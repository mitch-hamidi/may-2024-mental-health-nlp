0,How do you just have sex?,1715974255.0,"I never understood how people can just have sex with people. It feels too personal to me. How do you even go about asking someone of they‚Äôre interested? It feels so intrusive and wrong to ask ""hey are you interested in having sex with me?"" Maybe its because i feel so wrong in my body right now but i just dont know. I want to try but I've never had sex before and im terrified that im going to hurt someone. What if i just want to have sex without having a relationship but the person i want to do it with might have romantic feelings towards me? I want to try but i feel so unlovable and unfuckable i dont even think i could feel good. Not to mention i don't know how my body would react with my ptsd. What if i just freeze? What if im just there naked and my body just decides that its not ok and i can't stop. I want to be loved and i want to be touched so badly but i just dont know how. Im so lost and unsure where to go from here. If anyone can share their thoughts/experiences with me i would appreciate  that so much.

1,Struggling and I don‚Äôt even know what I need or what to do. (TW: small mention about substance abuse),1715973845.0,"I went through a breakup I was not expecting a month ago, I felt extremely betrayed by what happened. He was the first person I ever thought I was in love with, I was in love with who I thought he was at least. I made it through, somehow. 

Then over the past few weeks I went on four dates with someone and they told me yesterday that they weren‚Äôt interested. I realized when we were talking about what we wanted that maybe even though I didn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt want my ex back, that I‚Äôm not over what happened and getting used to someone new seems a bit weird. They had also mentioned they would never date someone with BPD again (talking about an ex), which I thought was unfair considering there are so many different combinations and levels of severity. I had never told them that about me but now I'm paranoid that it‚Äôs obvious to everyone else even though I am usually pretty good at hiding it with others especially new people and I am trying my best and have been doing pretty good with managing external behaviours with others. They also seemed to have their sh*t together and even though I work full time, have a car, and have a social life, I still feel as if I could and should be more ahead (better paying job, career). So that kind of made me feel unworthy as well? I usually don‚Äôt care whether or not someone has their ducks in a row to consider being friends with them or not, as long as we vibe and there is mutual respect.

I feel as though I never feel wanted enough unless I am dating or in a relationship. And I want to value my friendships as much as romantic ones but I struggle so much with it. Maybe its because I believe deep down that I am only a worthy person if someone wants to be with me romantically (because society seems to value that and therefore a lot of people think this way?).

It‚Äôs the long weekend here and my best friend is away but even when I saw her yesterday and discussed the dating situation I still felt so misunderstood even though I feel safe with her. I have some things planned over the weekend with some newer people and people I‚Äôve known for a bit to keep me busy but also maintain and make new connections (because I think that‚Äôll help in the long run).

I try to distract myself with TV shows, music and engaging in forums about these things. But it is getting nice outside and it‚Äôs reminding me of how lonely I am because of these activities available to me that I don't feel I have anyone to share them with. I feel like I‚Äôm just a placeholder within friendships. I want to get out in the community but I live in a smaller city so there aren't a whole lot of community events tailored to my interests. And even then I am so anxious I get nervous about approaching people, how to interact without being too much. I‚Äôve gone to local music shows by myself and have wanted to engage with people but no idea how.

Over the past day when I talk to people it‚Äôs as if the words are coming out of my mouth and I'm engaging but I‚Äôm not present.
I have my second session with a therapist this coming Wednesday who specializes and DBT and EDMR. I‚Äôm not sure if that's what I need but I feel it‚Äôs a step in the right direction.

I‚Äôm trying to quit using cann*bis because I know it‚Äôs only a short term solution. I use it because it‚Äôs the only thing that helps me not think and calm me down that doesn‚Äôt require me needing energy for it to work.

I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôm going with this but if you read to the end, have advice, or relate, I‚Äôd really appreciate someone reaching out.

10,i had s3x with my ex 2 weeks after break up...,1715969346.0,"hi, i don't really know where to start. i'm a 17F and my ex is a 16M and we were dating for almost two years (it would have been our 1y and 8 months tomorrow) and he was my first love. my first everything actually, we were mutually our first everything. we started dating when i was 15 and him 14, we were juste two teens in love. but i am a borderline diagnosed. and having my first love almost 1 year after my diagnosed was hard. 

we loved each other more than anything, he was my everything actually. we would see each other on weekend and some wednesdays. his family loved me and mine accepted him. in april, we ""broke up"" but it was most like a break. i mean, 2 hours after our break up we came back together. and then during the holidays i went to morocco. it was hard and i did not wanted to go, because being too far away from him was too hard. i learned to live with my bpd and he learned to live as someone's favorite person but it was still hard for us. we had some fight, and when i came home we talked a lot. we knew it was our end. 

i think it all started when i first talked about s3x and the fact that we stopped doing intimate stuff, we stopped doing s3x and i don't know everything was off. he just said ""you're right"" and he was agreeing with me and i just knew we were breaking up. so the next sunday he came to my house with all my stuff. clothes, plushies, the bracelets i gave him... we cried a lot in each other arms. it was hard because we actually were still in love. i never loved anyone like this before. we broke up because he wanted to stop suffering. it was too hard for him. 

so i'm coming to the point where i started to talk to a lot of guys, i drank a lot and i c/t myself, i did a lot of bad things and i was at my worst. i still do some stupid shit actually but it's not the point. 

he said to me that he wanted us to try again in the future, after his exams, after everything. he's the type of guy that want to experience a lot of things. and we almost broke up because of this once. 

today, he came to my house (we planned this 1 week  ago) and we just f/cked. i mean, i think we f/cked with love but none of us wanted to admit it. it was so passionate but we're just exs now. it hurts my heart. and i don't know if it's a good thing to keep talking to him but i just love  him so much. he's my everything. i miss him a lot. and i am just a lost teen trying my best not to fall apart :(.

I don‚Äôt know who to go to, so i really just need a place to dump my feelings and feel less alone in some way, this might be all over the place but my brain just won‚Äôt give me a break. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep more than 3 days out of a week for the past month, maybe longer but time is blurring together. I am just so scared. I am SO tired of always feeling like there‚Äôs nothing i can do to fix my life, and feeling so petrified of everything inside of me and things i cannot control and then one day i wake up and that flip switches and it feels like everything is working out and i‚Äôll get through this and come out on the other end a more *stable* person with some type of meaning, during these days of euphoria i will start things that i think will help me progress, and I make these promises to myself and people around me, and i think that‚Äôs making people doubt what i say. In these moments i am SO sure that this will become a reality for me, like going to college, or going to the gym. I‚Äôll do everything in order to get me to that goal i made, and then it all fades away and my motivation is gone and life feels so empty and pointless again.  
it‚Äôs just such a draining cycle, and i feel so embarrassed in so many ways!! i don‚Äôt want to be so upset and needing reassurance so often it makes me feel like such a waste and a burden to the ones i love! and i know deep down im not but no matter what i do i can‚Äôt shake that stupid feeling. I cling so hard to things and people that make me happy, and im so scared they‚Äôre going to leave everytime i slip back into the bad feelings, i dont want to live this way, i dont want my feelings to revolve around how or when someone responds or reading so deeply into everything always, it gets so obsessive in such an unhealthy way. I‚Äôll think of these scenarios when this happens and it always becomes truth in my head and i reach out to people that are close to me, but it‚Äôs hard only having 4 people in my life. Everytime i reach out it just feels like whoever i texted doesn‚Äôt want to hear it anymore, it feels like im being brushed off and then these peoples actions just affirm these feelings, like I have had breakdowns so badly around those who care about me and somehow it always ends in them having something better to do and leaving me in that state.

17,Unable to handle being a third wheel,1715965561.0,"Hi, I'm looking for some possible advice because I feel like I can't find much about what I'm going through. For starters, I was diagnosed 4 years ago, I've had my ups and downs but I feel like through the years I've been able to cope more with certain situations. But there's one thing that to this day I still cannot handle and is hindering my life and my friendships. 

When I hang out with my friends who also happen to be couples, I basically lose my sh\*t. I end up ditching the hang out session early sometimes, just having an excuse for why I have to leave, and having breakdowns (rarely in front of them, but usually before or after hanging out). The thing is, it's not really due to jealousy because I am in a stable relationship, I just constantly feel some sort of way that's like: ""*I feel like I'm intruding on this couples space and time, and I shouldn't be there, they don't want me there, I have to leave, they deserve to have their space without me*"" and so on. And even if people tell me I'm ok to hang out with them, I cannot ever shake these thoughts away, and I have to leave. I think deep inside, aside from the intruding feelings, I feel as if I wish people would want to spend time with me without also bringing someone who is obviously more important to them than I am to them, which is obviously toxic as hell to think, but I can't ever not think this.

26,Everything is too much,1715950987.0,"I (25F) have been diagnosed with BPD back in 2021. I used to have depression and behavioral problems since I was a little kid. I have a difficult family and live in a household full of screams and conflict constantly. Nevertheless, everything used to be quite okay after my teenage years until now. I did well in college, had an amazing boyfriend and a stable life. I somehow had a BPD breakout after leaving this relationship and leaving my house where I lived alone and ended up being hospitalized for half a year. Since then, everything has been going downhill. Even though I studied a career, a master and a pg, I can‚Äôt seem to get into anything because I am missing experience or my grades are too low for getting into a PhD (bear in mind that I struggled with mental health during my whole life I still managed to work and study, I was considered ‚Äúgifted‚Äù before my diagnosis). The economic situation in my country makes it really difficult to move out or have a decent job (not to mention working as what you studied) so I just live by shitty jobs where I am constantly mistreated. 

Due to my illness, I have been isolating a lot and pushing people out of my life. I am trying to get out of my country but everything is so difficult and I constantly have new health problems and other stuff that just seems to add up. I have a boyfriend with whom I have quite a toxic relationship and I feel constantly invalidated by him, doesn‚Äôt allow me to feel bad and feels like I am too much and what he does is never enough, but he doesn‚Äôt let me vent or be sad. My family doesn‚Äôt accept him because they think he mistreated me, but I just think I am quite difficult  and I have the love I deserve. He used to have very toxic behaviors that I have now internalized and never had. And I feel so alone and misunderstood‚Ä¶ I remember having a good relationship and this was not how it went and how I felt.

Everyday I have a new problem and people just think I am crying too much (debt, health issues, legal problems, my family battling illnesses and poverty)‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt seem to find a place where I belong, in any sense. I should be having an amazing life because they told me I was gifted and also I did so much with my condition, but I cry myself to sleep everyday and before working, and have such a strong pain in my chest sometimes I just wanna hurt myself phisycally not to feel so much‚Ä¶ I have had 3  attempts and somehow I am still here and I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt. Nevertheless, I am a very loving person and I feel like I have so much left to give to the world‚Ä¶ I cry with every little thing and I was fired at many jobs because I saw injustice in them and spoke up.

50,Fuck my mental health ,1715948553.0,"[19 F]
Navigating a relationship since I was just 14 and he was 18, meeting online, and then finally getting to hang out in person was like a dream come true. We shared everything, from silly inside jokes to deeper fears and anxieties. But my constant battle with anxiety and panic attacks was always lurking in the background, casting a shadow over our otherwise happy moments

When a stressful family event hit, I felt like I was drowning. I couldn't handle the pressure, and I resorted to self-harm. It was a dark and scary time, but I knew I had to reach out for help. Confiding in my mom was the first step, and before I knew it, I found myself in a mental hospital, with my boyfriend by my side, holding my hand and telling me how proud he was of me for being brave enough to seek help

But the road to recovery wasn't smooth sailing. The medication they gave me at the hospital made things worse before they got better. My panic attacks became even more intense, and I felt like I was losing control. I turned to my boyfriend for support, pouring my heart out to him about how tired I was of fighting and how I just wanted the pain to end. And then, out of nowhere, he dropped the bombshell..he was breaking up with me... (also before my birthday)

I felt like the ground had been pulled out from under me. The one person I thought would always be there for me had turned his back on me when I needed him the most. And to make matters worse, his mom, who had always been so sweet to me, suddenly cut me off completely. It felt like I was losing everyone I cared about, and it sent my panic attacks into overdrive

In the midst of all this chaos, I turned to therapy and medication for some semblance of stability. And slowly, ever so slowly, things started to improve. But despite the progress I was making, I couldn't shake the feeling of longing for my ex-boyfriend. I wanted to show him that I had changed, that I was getting better, but every attempt I made to reach out to him was met with silence or rejection. Started telling me how he doesn't think about me anymore and even if we would get back together he might loose one of his best friend ... And he also called me a narcissist.. :(

I'm trying to push forward but it's getting harder and harder... I'm sorry for doing the stuff I've done and I'm sorry for being like this ... I'm really trying to get better ... I still love him A LOT and I'm sorry for being impulse and trying to send him messages now even though he doesn't wanna hear from me anymore...I miss him .... I haven't ate in 4 days and I find myself going to sleep with anxiety and waking up with anxiety..",SillyWerewolfGirl,,False,1cu3sgh,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cu3sgh/fuck_my_mental_health/
51,Boundaries ,1715948277.0,"Hi I have a weird question for pwBPD.
My gf has an FP friend who is not me ( I am a partner of 5yrs both early 20s) 
There has not been any cheating, so please don‚Äôt jump to assume. 
They hang out occasionally and when they do she stays extremely late. Aka 4-5am late and goes home. Now she has done this with her other friends occasionally (but definitely not as often as FP) and I am not bothered but with her FP it makes me uncomfortable. Is it reasonable to ask that she doesn‚Äôt come home so late or is that verging on controlling? I find hanging out that late completely unnecessary and mildly intimate but she doesn‚Äôt think so at all and just enjoys her time with her friend. She‚Äôs on this sub and we both wanted a 3rd opinion. Thanks

But then things happened with another guy and I can't stop thinking about him and we are also talking a lot. 
I felt really bad for the other guy but at the moment I really was extremely attracted for this one and idk I just can't fucking control myself

53,He makes suicide threats?!,1715944518.0,"Edit: Just found out he‚Äôs now in a relationship with his ex girlfriend who is the girl he told me not to worry about lmfao 

So I‚Äôm very uneducated on BPD and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve came here to share my story of what I‚Äôm currently going through because I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy and it‚Äôs fucking with my head.

F25 M25

I would really appreciate some advice and I don‚Äôt mean to judge people with BPD (I‚Äôve met some absolutely beautiful people who suffer with this and my heart goes out to them I‚Äôve made life long friends who suffer with this) but this just my story of what I‚Äôm currently going through and would love some insight and advice.

My ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù has BPD, Autism, ADHD.

At the start it was amazing, he walked me home, made me feel loved, understood my childhood trauma and he would always be an ear to talk to and would be there for me 100%.

A few months down the line he started to become distant and I feel like he‚Äôs fucking with my head.

Whenever I would try and hug him he would pull away and laugh cracking jokes like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch me‚Äù but then two minutes later he would pull me into a hug.

I would try and kiss him and he would turn his face away and laugh and then two minutes later he would kiss me.

I would try and make a move and he would pull away and laugh but then call me frigid and say I don‚Äôt show him affection like wtf.

But other than this he was still great, we had our ups and downs.

A few months ago he went off the rails with drinking and self harming, I offered to give him some space so he could be alone and deal with it and he would say I don‚Äôt care about him, so I tried to help him and sat with him at hospitals, got him into ambulances and then he would say I‚Äôm too much and need to let him help himself he doesn‚Äôt need my help like wtf so I never knew what to do or how to help because I would either be pushed away or told I was too much.

Then he would tease me about other girls to see my reaction, I‚Äôd obviously be jealous and hurt and he would laugh and call me insecure, but if I played along and called the girls hot he would give me the silent treatment and say I don‚Äôt love him and become cold towards me.

Few weeks later he out of the blue said he was confused about if he wanted to date me, so I gave him some space as he then ghosting me.

I told him I would wait for him no matter how long it took and I wouldn‚Äôt give up on him and I only want him.

But then he came back and love bombed me, would call me baby and refer to me as his girlfriend but then we met with some friends, he said infront of everyone that we were no longer dating and just friends which was news to me and it broke my heart.

So I got up and walked home without saying a word, he then messaged me hours later asking if I got home safe and to meet him later to hang out like nothing happened.

So I ignored him and left him on read as the whole thing was fucking with my head.

Last night was the final straw for me, it‚Äôs fucked with my head and it‚Äôs driving me insane.

So for context he knows nine months ago I lost my mother to cancer and watched her die infront of my eyes.

Last night he texted me saying he bought two bottles of bleach and was going to drink them, so I obviously panicked and begged him to tell me where he was.

He kept saying things like

‚ÄúNah I ain‚Äôt telling you where I am‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll be dead soon‚Äù
‚ÄúMy phones going to die so I can‚Äôt talk‚Äù
‚ÄúStop asking me where I am I want to die‚Äù

So I got scared and searched for him for four hours in the rain crying my eyes out, because I couldn‚Äôt save my mother but I had the chance to save him from dying.

I told him to get some help immediately else I‚Äôll be the last person he talks to and I can‚Äôt have that resting on my conscience.

Four hours later I found him sat on a bench laughing watching tik toks on his ‚Äúdead‚Äù phone, I looked at him and he just had a childish smile on his face.

Me: You ok
Him: Yeah what‚Äôs up
Me: Did you drink it
Him: Yeah (then he smirked)
Me: Can I call an ambulance
Him: They came and drove off because I refused to get into the ambulance

I smell bullshit, they have a duty of care and if they know someone has tried to end their life surely they would contact the police and have him detained and mentally assessed.

Me: Go to the hospital please else you‚Äôll die
Him: Nah
Me: But you could die in your sleep
Him: Good

He then had that same childish smile and turned away from me and continued watching his tik toks so I walked away and I‚Äôve blocked him on all social media‚Äôs.

He didn‚Äôt drink that bleach, it‚Äôs clearly a lie.

Why would he lie about that and have me running around crying my eyes out, I feel so fucked up in the head from it.

He love bombs and then ghosts me, he jokes about drinking bleach, he plays hot and cold (understandable as he has trauma), acts like I‚Äôm a ghost then he‚Äôs clingy as fuck.

Did I do the right thing by walking away and blocking him, I love him to the moon and back but he‚Äôs very difficult to be with I feel like he‚Äôs playing mind games even if he knows it or not.

I did everything for this dude but he wasn‚Äôt the person I fell in love with.

I‚Äôm hurt that he embarrassed me infront of friends by saying we‚Äôre just friends after I begged him to just give me a yes or a no and then he love bombs me just to say that to our friends and humiliate me.

I‚Äôm hurt that he joked about drinking that bleach because that‚Äôs not funny at all, it‚Äôs sick.

I‚Äôm confused and absolutely heartbroken, he went from being my best friend to being a complete nasty stranger and it sucks.

I‚Äôm absolutely broken, I loved him with every part of my soul.

He‚Äôs made me feel like a lump of shit on the floor, completely worthless and used.

I know it‚Äôs crazy but I‚Äôd still take him back even now, because when he‚Äôs good he‚Äôs amazing but when he‚Äôs cold he‚Äôs awful to be around.

Just feel lost.

I did everything for him, was there 100%. I watched documentaries on BPD, I went to his therapy to understand him better, I sat with him and watched his bags while he slept when he got kicked out (not his fault).

Just need some advice as to why he acts this way especially with the ‚Äúsuicide threats‚Äù, how can he do that to someone.

54,When does it get better?,1715942724.0,"Since I was about 17 I‚Äôve been treated for some form of mental illness. I was diagnosed with BPD about a year ago but have what seems to be called the ""quiet"" kind so I find it's not my top priority compared to my depression. I often describe my depression as episodic in that I will fall into episodes of deep depression but I can also be really affected by everyday life. For example atm I‚Äôm unemployed again, 27, single, never dated, overweight, barely surviving financially, stuck living with my Mum and general just feeling down on my luck.

I do try and fight my depression. I take my meds, I‚Äôm under a long term mental health team, I walk my dog everyday, I run 3 times a week, I‚Äôm applying for 3 jobs every weekday, writing 5 times a day, sleeping 8+ hours a night, keeping a routine etc. Basically, doing most things I feel like I should. Yet I feel like I‚Äôm fighting a losing battle due to just life being shit.

I know some of these things just need me to fucking suck it up and do better but I feel like I‚Äôve spent all my 20s fighting mental illness and I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm kind of sick of being told it will get better or it‚Äôs ok to not be ok or whatever when it just feels like the universe keeps kicking me whilst I‚Äôm down. I need actual advice that will help me because honestly I can‚Äôt think of a single thing to look forward to in the future and I just feel hopeless.

I get so jealous anytime my bsf calls someone else their bsf,though they have said some really sweet things to me none felt genuine and felt like lies so I stop feeling down, they've never called me their bsf.






I know I am not great,I can't comfort people since I always just ignore my emotions,so it's natural to seek help from others,but idk they're always saying amazing stuff about others but I never hear anything about me.






this caused me to have a huge episode yesterday (check my last post for reference) and I honestly kind of want to cut them off,I am putting in effort but it's just not enough I guess,I don't deserve them,they deserve someone better than me and I've known that for awhile,but now that there's someone better,I just feel jealous.




I feel like they never even liked me in the first place,they just put up with me for whatever reason,and we've been friends for over a year.





am I just having an episode and want to cut them off because of that,or am I being genuine.

I had a huge fallout with my best friend. It's a long story. I'm just in so much pain. I'll try and do a quick summary. 

She was a bit of a thoughtless, selfish person. And I couldn't cope. She loves to party and has been embarrassed by me in the past. It all came to a head at an event we were at when I got triggered. I pushed her away, not in an ideal way. But I really needed space. 

I tried to explain what I was going through. I have been very very suicidal lately. I think about it most days. I was on my way to admit myself into the psych ward. She knew this. I asked her to explain what happened as I had caught her out on a few lies. And she cut me off. Said we can't be friends again. 

She has a habit of saying all her friends are ""too much"" and ""too obsessed with her"". I am definitely not the first one to complain about how emotionally unavailable she is. I just never told her in 20 years just how unwell I was and she wrote the coldest message ever. 

I'm heartbroken. I do hate her too. If I see her photo, I feel like I'm going to throw up. I know the end of the friendship is for the best. I was never good enough for her. But I'm still so sad.

im F20 and was diagnosed w/ bipolar 2, ptsd, bpd, and anxiety around 3 years ago when i was 17. been to therapy ever since. i was relieved at first cus i thought i could finally explain so many of my emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. but i immediately felt how shitty it was. now i constantly overthink and over-analyze whether what im abt to hit a depressive episode or if im js experiencing my constant mood swings from the bpd. 

i wish i could say im feeling optimistic abt my treatment, but to be honest, i dont think it‚Äôs ever gonna be better. im srsly convinced that the whole world just wants me gone. because how is it possible to just live in constant pain and to just be treated like shit all the time. since i was a kid, i was already constantly sexualized. honestly, as much as i hate it, i‚Äôd say at this point i‚Äôve grown to be a misandrist because every single man in my life has viewed me in a sexual light. i‚Äôve always had a really curvy body and a lot of ppl describe me as a really attractive person. it used to be nice getting compliments, but now i just hate it. because everytime i see a man, my anxiety runs wild. everytime i receive a compliment from a man, i immediately think that they just want my body. i‚Äôm pretty sure no one has ever truly loved me for me. in all my relationships, sex was such a huge part, and even when i said no, it was never rlly my choice cus apparently my body was js so inviting. 

ppl often took advantage of me, and i never really saw how horribly forgiving i was until i got stuck with my first love for 3 years. i was 14 when we started dating, and to sum it up, he cheated constantly, sexually and psychologically abused me again and again, and he also hit me. i was also raped by my ex best friend‚Äôs boyfriend. she was my best friend for 13 years, and she left me cus she blamed me for it. my other best friend, my first love, my mom, and my other friends blamed me too. around the same time my mom got admitted into the hospital for 2-3 weeks because she caught pneumonia while being under chemo (she was diagnosed w/ cancer when i was 15). it was only me and my mom who lived together cus both my siblings and my dad were in the states cus of work. my dad blamed me for her being sick too. at 17 i fell in love with someone new, and he was perfect. he was the one that made me realize that the abuse, cheating, the rape, my mom‚Äôs cancer, and my friend‚Äôs leaving wasn‚Äôt my fault. but because of that, everything came crashing down for me. for 5-6 months straight i became an alcoholic, i was constantly crying, felt empty, kept picking fights with him, the flashbacks and nightmares started, and i was so suicidal. he was the one who convinced me to see a therapist. but eventually, he left me after a year cus i became so toxic; was constantly angry and i always broke up w/ him then came back regretting it. i also attempted back then, and when i survived it, i got threatened to have my mom locked up and for me to be deported cus apparently it‚Äôs illegal. now im with someone new and we‚Äôve been together for 2 years, but i can sense how tired he is with my mood swings, my anger, everything.

i miss the person i used to be. before all the symptoms showed up. i‚Äôm not saying this to brag at all, i mean i dont see myself as any of these anymore. i was a straight A student, a hopeless romantic, an active student, i had so many passions (music, dance, art, reading, writing, public speaking, etc.), i was a popular kid in my high school back then (but not the mean kind), and everyone described me as this extremely bubbly and kind-hearted person. now, my memory is just not trustworthy anymore with all the disorders that pretty much ruined it, so im not even a straight A student which sucks cus im premed too so i need good grades. i no longer believe in true love because i cant wrap my head around the fact that someone would want me beyond my body. i dont participate in extracurriculars anymore, i lost my interest in the many passions i listed down, and im no longer this bubbly and kind person. i just have so much anger inside me cus all i keep thinking abt is how unfair everything is. i cant trust anyone anymore. not even me cus i dont even know who i am anymore.

im so exhausted honestly, and whenever i try to open up to someone abt how tired i am, i can never explain it in a way that they understand how extremely exhausting it is. the constant and unbearable pain that no matter how happy i convince myself that i am, deep inside i just feel this huge hole that just feels like my heart is constantly sinking. the worst part is when i have a hypomanic episode then all of a sudden a huge crash js happens cus of how easily hurt i am. i hate how terribly im treating my boyfriend too. i want so badly to just be able to show him i love him without subconsciously pushing him away cus of how scared i get that he‚Äôll end up treating me the way that everyone else in my life treated me. i‚Äôm so scared to lose him too, but with how unstable i am, i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he gets exhausted with me. i just want it to be over. 2 years in therapy and i feel like the pain is js never gonna end. 

anyway, im sorry this was such a long rant. i dont even mind if no one bothers to read it. i just really needed to let it out. ",National-Pirate1810,,False,1cu05ii,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cu05ii/i_feel_like_life_itself_wants_me_to_give_up/
63,age regression attachment c-ptsd and bpd,1715933702.0,"Heyyy, 

So my names Ash, I‚Äôm turning F21 in September. I‚Äôm currently in my second year of uni and live at a residential college. 

A bit about my background, I grew up in a very dysfunctional family, my mum is a drug addict with psychosis, my dad passed away by suicide before I was born and my step-dad sexually abused me for most/all of my childhood. I was eleven when I went to the police and told them what was happening, after that I was placed in long term care with my carer (nan) and she was not physically abusive or unsafe but just very emotionally and psychologically abusive. 

In year 7, after I had just been placed in care, I got very attached to my year 7 teacher, let‚Äôs call her Melissa, I was an eleven year old dealing with major ptsd and no support was given to me, anyways, I told her I loved her and wanted to be with her, obviously now when I look back I just wanted her to be my mum because I didn‚Äôt have one anymore, but as an eleven year old who spent the ages of 3 - 11 being molested, I thought it was normal to express love that way, anyways, she ended up filing a restraining order against me, expelling me and I got a formal caution from the police for harassment and stalking. My carer ended up hitting me and calling me weird, so ever since then our relationship has been very strained and I feel a lot of shame about my attachment problems but I know I need to be compassionate and kind to myself about it because it all stems from my mum and trauma. 

Fast forward a few years, I kept forming attachments to different mother figures and over time I‚Äôve learned how to manage the intensity of it better although internally I struggle with it just as much as I used to, it just doesn‚Äôt present the same way anymore. 

Okay so that was all just for context, what I need advice on is my current attachment. As I said I live at a residential college, there we have a wellbeing and student support person, her names Anna, the moment I saw her I knew I‚Äôd get attached so I avoided her for weeks during my first year at the college last year, didn‚Äôt last long because I ended up having to see her for drinking too much and passing out at a club, I was given a drinking band for a week üòÖ 
After that I emailed her many times and one of them was asking if she could be a parental figure type of person for me as I don‚Äôt have parents and she said yes but I don‚Äôt think she knew what she was getting herself into with me and my BPD and stuff lol rip 

After that she gave me her number, a lot of the residents have her number, and then I started messaging her all the time and asking to come see her in her office all the time, I‚Äôd send her drunk text messages, I‚Äôd basically explode over text messages to her about my feelings and my thoughts and my trauma and everything really, she‚Äôd always respond in a caring manner. Last year I told her to go away and then come back so many times, it was very back and forth but she never took it personally because I think she understands why I behave the way I do sometimes, I had to make a statement to the police last year and she drove me there in her car. 

Now it‚Äôs 2024 and it‚Äôs my second year living at the college and knowing Anna. I can open up to her more about things and talk more to her in person rather than messages all the time now, I do send goodnight and goodmorning texts though most days. I haven‚Äôt seen her or been in contact with her for almost a week now because she‚Äôs been so busy with running the college and everything and I guess I feel like I‚Äôve been going crazy, my BPD favourite person symptoms really be going hard, the amount of messages I‚Äôve sent about random ass shit argh. I just, she‚Äôs the first adult in my entire life who I have a stable relationship with, she doesn‚Äôt judge me or hate me or think I‚Äôm weird, all she wants is to support me and help me grow, I‚Äôve never had someone like that in my life before and I just, I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt want to lose her because she very much does feel like a mother figure to me, I feel like I‚Äôve learnt so much from her over this past year already. 

I just don‚Äôt know where this relationship is going, I don‚Äôt know if she actually cares about me or if she‚Äôs just doing her job and I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt know what I want or my expectations, I know she can‚Äôt be my mum, she already has a family of her own but she did say when i leave she‚Äôs more than happy to catch up over coffee together 

I just feel like when im with her I‚Äôm a child again and I act like one too it‚Äôs embarrassing but also she‚Äôs giving me a safe space to express myself and grow as an individual I guess 

I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm asking for I just want someone‚Äôs opinion on the situation and advice or something idk I‚Äôm sorry

64,Why can‚Äôt i just forget about her already?,1715932648.0,"disclaimer: i discuss suicide in this post. and this is a fucking long one, sorry. props if you make it through the whole way.

we met at college, the beginning of fall semester. i fell in love with her almost instantly and with my whole heart (in my normal and usual way). though i‚Äôm only 22 years old, i‚Äôve never ever felt such a strong attraction and connection with another person before.

the trouble was that she had a boyfriend, they‚Äôd been together for two years.. yet, despite this fact, she kept flirting and making advances towards me and we were each other‚Äôs favorite person, fast. it was so confusing for me to get all that affection from her while keeping the idea of her boyfriend in mind.

she explained the situation to me while we were out walking together late one night. she felt like she had needs that her boyfriend couldn‚Äôt meet for her, and the passion that they once had was falling off.. and over months she‚Äôd managed to convince him to agree that she could date other people at the same time. she wanted the other person to be me. of course i said yes, almost instantly and with my whole heart.

i knew that i was getting into hot water, but i couldn‚Äôt help it, couldn‚Äôt stop myself, couldn‚Äôt bear to kill this beautiful and exciting thing between us.. i was not at all fond of the idea of ‚Äúsharing‚Äù her with this other guy.. but given what she had told me of her misgivings with the other boyfriend, i thought that if i could build a strong enough connection with her and hold out long enough, that i could win her over through a war of attrition with the other guy.

for three months, her and i had the most intimate relationship that i‚Äôve ever known. she was incredibly open with me, told me everything she knew about herself, and i told her the same. it was so astounding how many ways in which we seemed to be the the same type of weird and fucked up, which drew us really close. we cuddled and slept together all the time, her with her CPAP mask and me with my eyeshades on. during her harrowing period cramps i would sit on the bathroom floor and hold her hand while she laid in the shower with a wet towel draped over her body, curled up under the hot rain. and when i had my intense mood swings she would lie with me and hold me as i was shuttering and sobbing on the floor.. she taught me that it was okay to cry when i was feeling that way, and that i shouldn‚Äôt feel so ashamed of it.

she would buy my food when we went out, never judging me for spending all my money on my passion projects. we traded our most unique and special trinkets with each other, and always kept an eye out for new ones to make or bring home for each other, we were always giving little presents. i even custom designed and made her a beautiful wooden folding table in my wood shop, and she adored it (making furniture for you is my love language lol).

and.. we had lots and lots of sex together. it was so amazing to match with someone whose libido was equal to mine. i‚Äôve never been with someone so attentive and engaged during sex as she was. we were always committed to making the experience as comfortable and pleasing as possible for each other. very early on she told me that she‚Äôd been sexually abused at a young age and that ever since, and still with her other boyfriend, she would have a panic attack or inexplicably cry almost every time after having sex. but with me, she never cried afterwards. and one of my favorite moments with her was when she interrupted me from my homework to tell me how grateful she was that i‚Äôd been so gentle and attentive with her during sex, and that i‚Äôd helped her so to move past the pain and shame that she‚Äôd dealt with following her abuse. it was so sweet <3

but despite all the beautiful and happy parts of our relationship, all the time i was racked with anxiety and jealousy for her other boyfriend. i couldn‚Äôt stand it when she would text him when we were spending private hours together, it just made me feel so worried and sick to my stomach. hers my warning to anyone else with bpd who finds themselves tempted to go into a polyamorous relationship: any existing fear of abandonment that you harbor will be amplified intensely when your partner has another lover, one whom they could decide to leave you for at any moment.

as things started to go downhill in her relationship with the other boyfriend, i was secretly very happy. my plan was going to be successful, i was going to outlast the other guy and have her all to myself! she even asked me at one point, ‚Äúdo you ever get the feeling that you‚Äôre winning against him? i get that feeling.‚Äù that felt really nice to hear.

in late november it came to pass that i was admitted to a mental hospital, having taken too many amphetamines trying to keep up in classes and having admitted maybe a bit too much information to my psychiatrist about the suicidal thoughts i‚Äôd been having lately. she reassured me that it was okay for me to go there, that she wouldn‚Äôt think anything less of me for it and again, i shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed. she stayed with me in the holding wing all the way until the (pointless) ambulance ride to the mental hospital. and during what ended up being two weeks inside, she came to visit me every single day she could. she got me through a very tough time in there..

she came to get me on the day i was released from the hospital. i was so damn happy to be out of there, and was even feeling very hopeful for my future and improving my mental health. and of course i was overjoyed to be back with her. only a day later, she came to me distraught with tears in her eyes. she told me that the other boyfriend had broken up with her. in that moment my emotions were 50/50, one part sympathetic to her pain and one part ecstatic for our freedom. and then she told me something that fucked my head, ‚Äúi wish i‚Äôd ended it with you first.‚Äù it was such a punch in the stomach that i just withered, couldn‚Äôt respond. i walked out of her room and went back to mine to smoke a cigarette out the window. she came in not ten minutes later to apologize, to reassure me that things would be okay with us.

the day after that, one day before winter break, she told me that it was over between us. it‚Äôs lucky that i was on enough stimulants to keep my emotions away from me, otherwise i think my heart would have stopped right then and there. it was simply unreal. she told me that she would miss me dearly. she asked me to lay down in bed with her and spoon her until she fell asleep, and of course i did. i left quietly and paused for a long minute to take one last look at her, asleep in her bed.

i did my best to keep it together in the days following our goodbye. the stimulants were good for my emotional pain but left me sleepless. i was going without food, uncomfortably wired and exhausted, but at least i wasn‚Äôt tying nooses or cutting open my arms. the sequence of events played out over and over again in my mind. at this time i was attending a partial program at the same hospital i‚Äôd just gotten out of, and was able to keep it up for a couple more days.

unfortunately, as if i hadn‚Äôt learned from my previous mistake, i again admitted too much information to the doctors there and wound up getting another involuntary admission. i‚Äôd been out for all of three days. i felt so defeated to be back there, to face all the same patients and nurses i knew. on top of it all, i no longer had any visits from her to look forward to. she texted me only once, a few days into my stay, asked me how i was doing. i told her the truth, that i wasn‚Äôt doing well at all, that i was back inside, that all of my suicidal thoughts were back stronger than before. she told me that she didn‚Äôt want to hear any more, and that she wasn‚Äôt going to contact me again for a while. this was the abandonment i was fearing for three months.

i got frantic. i went to my room and cried and shuttered, thought of how she used to hug me when i was in this way, thought of how she would never do it again. and i knew that this was the very aspect of myself that had pushed her away in the first place. i took my glasses off, laid them on the floor, shattered one of the lenses under a chair leg. i picked up a shard of glass and pressed it into my forearm and started slashing and sobbing. i didn‚Äôt want attention from the staff and i didn‚Äôt want to hurt myself. i wanted to die, to let the poison blood out of my brain and cease the awful feelings it was giving me. i really just wanted to feel peaceful once again.

obviously it didn‚Äôt work, and the shame is still with me. i regret doing something so impulsive and poorly thought out, i don‚Äôt know how i expected that to work. if only my lenses were made of real glass instead of plastic, maybe then i could have gone deep enough. 5 minutes never passed without my mind rethinking the pain of what she‚Äôd said to me or thinking of what i could have said differently or hoping that we would get back together again or despairing at the thought of never speaking to her again. these were the longest and most uncomfortable days of my short life. my stay came to last for 4 weeks, during which i was diagnosed with bpd.

i was out of the hospital again, had spent my whole winter break inside. i was lucky to be let back to school after what had happened, but i was 7/8 semesters through my degree and i just wanted to get through it. i wasn‚Äôt sure whether or not i was looking forward to seeing her again, but i wasn‚Äôt prepared for how it happened. i got a knock on my door and there she was, holding a paper bag of things. she came in and placed the bag on the floor, some clothes of mine she‚Äôd found in her room and a box of earrings that i‚Äôd given her as a Christmas present. i asked her to keep the earrings, i‚Äôd gotten them for her and i had no use for them. she told me she didn‚Äôt want them and i should return them to the seller. that really hurt to hear.

she asked me to delete all the photos of her that were on my phone and stood and watched as i did it. i asked if she wanted a hug, and she refused. i asked if we could talk for a bit, and she refused. then she asked for me to give her blue knitted sweater back, and i dug it out of my laundry basket and offered to wash it for her before giving it back. she said it didn‚Äôt matter because she was going to throw it in the trash anyway. then she just left. i just sat there for a minute, waiting for something, i don‚Äôt know what. then it all slammed down on me, even worse than the last time.

i had a razor blade this time, a brand new one, and i tried really hard to cut deeper now, i really wanted to bleed enough this time. apparently this is a very poor suicide method because despite my best efforts over 10 minutes, the blood just wouldn‚Äôt come out fast enough. by then the pain and concentration from the cutting had completely calmed me down, as much as this disappointed me. i‚Äôm not sure if anyone else gets this but i always feel really angry at myself when i start to calm down from a bad episode, as it feels like the fact it lasted so briefly means that i was faking the whole thing.

i called up my only good friend at school and admitted i‚Äôd done something really stupid. he was pretty freaked out when he saw the mess i‚Äôd made and was adamant on bringing me to the hospital. i told him i couldn‚Äôt go, that it would cost me my enrollment at college if they found out about it, and going to the hospital would make sure of that.. but he wouldn‚Äôt have it and we went. the hospital wouldn‚Äôt but my stupid ‚Äúwood carving accident‚Äù story and they called the police. then another 1 week stay at a different mental hospital. (hospitals really do nothing for me, if you couldn‚Äôt tell). school kicked me out, made me move home. 

i‚Äôve spent the last 5 months at home living with my dad, my brother, and his girlfriend. it‚Äôs been pretty rough, especially considering that i haven‚Äôt been working at all and should have no excuse to feel so shitty all the time. and even 5 months later i just cannot stop thinking about her, every day. she‚Äôs in my thoughts and in my dreams. i catch myself making up conversations with her in my head. every time i see a mazda cx-5 it just punches me in the stomach (that was her car). thinking about her instantly converts an okay time into another seizure of loneliness and negative thoughts. suicidal thoughts and plans are a daily occurrence.

people tell me that i‚Äôm so young and that i‚Äôll find someone else eventually and forget about everything like everyone else has a million times before. and that‚Äôs probably true, i‚Äôll admit it. but if my past experiences have told me anything it‚Äôs that the same script is bound to play out again and again, and that i‚Äôm the element that causes it to do so. i guess i‚Äôm just at a loss as to what i‚Äôm meant to do now..

i feel so lost in my life. i couldn‚Äôt care less if i died at any moment. i feel no fear of death, only of pain. i know exactly what I‚Äôm supposed to do, to get a shit job and work and get therapy and work out and ignore the feelings until enough months are passed and i can get back to school and finish the engineering degree and find a real job and move to the city and on and on. but i feel like i don‚Äôt have the resolve to execute all of that though. i guess i just don‚Äôt want anything enough to actually do what i know i‚Äôm supposed to do. i miss her all the time and it feels like that‚Äôs the only thing there‚Äôs space for in my mind, as much as id prefer to just forget her entirely now. as unhealthy as it is, it seems like romantic relationships are the only thing i really care about in my life, and i‚Äôm cursed to always ruin them.

67,What to do if a L/O with BPD says something concerning during an episode?,1715932065.0,"Hi, I hope it‚Äôs okay for me to write here? I saw there was a sub specifically for those with loved ones with BPD but the description immediately threw me off (group for those who have suffered ‚Äòchallenges‚Äô and ‚Äòabuse‚Äô at the ‚Äòhands of those with bpd‚Äô)‚Ä¶ it sounded kind of like there was no room for growth or like people with BPD aren‚Äôt just humans who deserve as much love and patience as anyone else?

Anyways ‚Äî I understand where my boyfriend is coming from when he talks to me about BPD symptoms partially because I have ADHD and experience heavy limerence. I was his FP and he was my limerent object, so we‚Äôre kind of hooked in that way, but have mutually agreed to NEVER step on each others toes or cut the other off from external relationships. 

I understand the jealousy. Seriously, I do. I get the feeling of rationally knowing a mutual friend poses no threat to your relationship but still feeling antsy and bitter and hating yourself for it. He‚Äôs felt sort of apprehensive about someone in our life (old friend of his, new one of mine). It‚Äôs ironic because I literally used to be jealous of this person too and I forced myself to befriend them and now we‚Äôre great pals.. üò≠

He‚Äôd gotten pretty emotional while I was trying to talk to him about this.. I don‚Äôt want them to be friends if that‚Äôs not what he wants ‚Äî but it kind of just makes me have this pit in my stomach being the reason they aren‚Äôt friends anymore. He experiences his feelings regarding BPD super strongly, but always says he knows some of his thoughts are unhealthy and that he never wants to restrain or keep me all to himself. He shows a great amount of self-awareness and maturity and a will to grow, so I really seriously want to make an honest effort to help him. But during this heated conversation he said something super possessive and honestly a little concerning that made me scared. It felt super impulsive ‚Äî I told him I wasn‚Äôt mad and understood how he was feeling, but that his comment made me anxious and that I wanted to talk in the morning when we were both a little more composed. He said that he was sorry and that he didn‚Äôt mean it ‚Äî and that was the end of our conversation.


I guess I‚Äôm just kind of antsy about it. In literally every other conversation we‚Äôve had he‚Äôs not once shown any sort of unhealthy possessiveness over me. It definitely felt like a charged and unrealistic statement ‚Äî not a real threat or something I worry about. It was just kind of harsh and slightly triggering and I wonder how I should discuss it with him. I‚Äôve never been offput by anything he‚Äôs ever said before. 

I don‚Äôt want this to be a ‚Äòstrike‚Äô against him or anything though. We‚Äôre both hurting and I‚Äôm DEFINITELY am not his therapist nor do I ever want to take that role but I refuse to give up on someone I love wholeheartedly just because he‚Äôs struggling mentally. He‚Äôs been showing me nothing but patience and love and respect for my boundaries regarding my own mental issues and I want to show him that same love. That doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt advocate for myself or be blunt with him if I need to be.. I just really want to help support him as much as I can.",mittyguts,,False,1ctznx0,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1ctznx0/what_to_do_if_a_lo_with_bpd_says_something/
68,How to be there for my cousin,1715931932.0,"Me and my cousin live in different countries but this summer shes coming here for about 3 weeks. She was diagnosed with BPD (i believe she has quiet BPD) about 2 years ago. We used to fight alot when we were kids but she is my best friend and we never disagree on anything anymore. I know she is severly depressed, very low energy at times, but whenever we hang out she is super sweet and never talks about how she is feeling. We did however have a deep talk last time i saw her about how her life feels with bpd.

Anyways, as i said shes coming here for 3 weeks and we will be home alone. I really want to make this a great time for her, now that she can just get away from all the stuff in her hometown that contribute to her depression. But if she gets low, which she probably will, how can i be there for her? Is there anything specific i should think about to make life as easy and fun as possible while she is here? If she opens up about her feelings, what can i say to make her feel validated? What is it that people with bpd want to hear from others? 

Im sure we are going to have a great time but i really want to make it as special as possible for her.

I am from a very traditional country where the topic of mental health has only started gaining importance. My parents, with their best has always tried to accommodate me, though they have given me enough trauma. I was a very active, hardworking child since childhood but that gave me a lot of bullying right from school.

I have been having recurring episodes and been in therapy and medicine. For the last one year, my medications were stable and strong however I have always felt the void and have always wanted to stop feeling the pain.I have had nights blaming myself. Even if I am not at fault, even if I point someone‚Äôs mistake, it‚Äôs me who I accuse at the end of day.I am afraid of being with a man yet again, since my previous relationship made me end up in the hospital since I tried cutting myself. My parents at that time asked me to at least be alive till my sister gets married off so she gets to have a respectful happy life, now that I have ruined the rest of their lives. I know this was told to me while my mother was having an angry rush and I do not want to speak ill of the woman who took care of me for so long.

This year has been awful so far. I haven't been able to stop thinking about my trauma. I feel useless because I'm too disabled to work or leave the house often. My mind has felt like a complete mess and nothing is helping. I started wanting to kill myself again. I set a date and kept writing about all of the reasons I want to die. I've held pills in my hand, staring at them, despite knowing that taking them would likely just make me feel miserable instead of killing me, but I feel like I deserve to suffer. I almost did take them once until it felt like some part of me made me put them back and I just comforted myself for a bit. I've been looking up what household items I could kill myself with. I've been looking up how it feels to get hit by a car and the specific effects of an overdose of certain meds. So many nights I have laid awake crying or dissociating because of how miserable and lonely I feel. I've stopped talking to all of my friends, my closest ones with good reason since they barely even acknowledge my existence; the only people I talk to now are my family and my therapist. I've been wanting to cut myself again or do anything that gives me even just a moment of peace. I've been walking outside in the middle of the night, although I don't go very far; most recently, I walked outside in just a bra, pajama pants, and a blanket wrapped around me when I felt overwhelmed and wanted to run into traffic. I got distracted by a cat, pet it for a bit, then went back inside. I still get enough sleep most nights though and have still been eating properly. I have to live with my parents because I can't be on my own, but I can still do basic things.

Writing this all down, I understand how concerning it sounds. But I doubt I'll actually hurt myself unless someone were to put a gun in my hand. I don't know if I need to be hospitalized or if I just need to keep seeing my therapist, who I see every other week (he can't see me more often than that). I've been trying to get help for 7 years and I don't feel any better. I do feel like I need more than what my therapist can offer me but I've been in the hospital once before and I don't want to go back. I haven't actually done anything bad or super dangerous.

Whether it‚Äôs self-harming, p0rn addiction (because some of us are hypersexual, and that is okay) or alcohol/ drug abuse etc. When attempting to push away from that and find healthier habits, consistency is your best friend.

If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve probably thought ‚ÄúI am bad. In the end this is who I am, so what‚Äôs the point of trying to improve‚Äù. And this is valid, this is a valid feeling. And I don‚Äôt want to do the generic mental health advice ‚Äúyour feelings are valid or your behaviour is not‚Äù - like??? It is very true but can feel invalidating. 

When you feel those horrible feelings and want to turn to your coping mechanisms, that‚Äôs when you find real healing. Because if you get through that, when you think life is over and all hell has broken loose, you‚Äôll find that it gets easier next time to break habits. Not even ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù - Personally I hate addiction recovery terms because they make it seem like it‚Äôs not you and it‚Äôs an alien concept that you have to conform to.

You are still you, at least give yourself the chance of critiquing that negative voice that ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt change‚Äù by using actions rather than calculating and ruminating with your thoughts.

- I‚Äôve been ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù for 3 years straight now. SSRIs don‚Äôt work for it only for my anxiety (constantly empty) 
- I have lots of moods throughout the day and they change very very fast
- I‚Äôll be depressed for a few days then be super energetic, talkative, motivated, irritated for a few days and then back to being depressed. Sometimes in the same day
- I don‚Äôt experience manic symptoms like being happy etc I‚Äôm actually anhodenic
- my anhodenia only clears up if I‚Äôm doing impulsive behaviors or risk taking (adrenaline rush)
- I crave risks
- I have an obsession with spending money (mostly from boredom) but it also makes me feel good
- this is the big one‚Ä¶ I get new hobbies every week and I obsess over them. The newest one being I decided to throw out every item in my home that contained chemicals and began the ‚Äúnon toxic lifestyle‚Äù. Researched for hours, donated everything, researched things, bought them, made new items, etc. still kicking on this one but I think it may stick around. But I go through different things weekly honestly. (Could very well be my ocd and obsessive personality) 

- I get on something and can‚Äôt stop raving about it 
- other peoples issues become my own when they shouldn‚Äôt and it puts me into moods
- I have strong opinions and get defensive about others issues and put myself into their business behind the scenes so to speak

Also, I go from loving someone to hating them for no reason. However, there‚Äôs 3 people that‚Äôs never happened with and that‚Äôs my fiance, my baby, and my grandma.

I‚Äôve never been sui** but I have threatened it so someone wouldn‚Äôt leave me as well as cut for attention years ago back in highschool.

I am convinced she's fake and I want nothing to do with her.

Logically, she was probably busy and distracted. I know I'm not the top priority in everyone's life. But that doesn't change how I feel. I hate her but we have several mutual friends so I'm forced to deal with her. Ugh. That's not the only friendship I've been tempted to destroy either.

From the outside, you‚Äôd think we hated each other, but it was one of those complex things where because everything I did set her off, so I learned to tread carefully. I built most of my life around trying to make her laugh (which never worked) and this bled into my life outside of her. I‚Äôm very self-deprecating. I am funny, genuinely. But what I hadn‚Äôt realized was that I lived like life was a big comedy routine, and at my own expense. I laugh at the wrong things- like when bad things happen to me.

I was in my mid 30s where I developed this thing that if I brought her little elephant things, like figurines, (she loved elephants) she‚Äôd be alive the next time I saw her. If I could describe my attachment it would be me, a full adult wrapping my arms around her waist and begging her to never leave me. Her dying was my biggest fear since I was six. It was the thing I worried most until it happened.

I dont know if its the fact that i dont feel like i have an identity so i am trying to find it through any means or if it is my OCD latching onto them. What pains me the most is that i can flip the switch every time i want and have dramatic changes and i feel like i am getting older and older and that im running out of time (I recently turned 22 so could be stress from that too idk)

139,Is this Splitting?,1715893052.0,"For context, today I saw on FB a girl laugh react and comment on my FPs latest post, to which he laugh reacted and commented back with a laughing emoji in his response. Would've been fine but I've seen this girl hearting/commenting/interacting with his posts for a couple months now and I finally had to ask him about who she was/express that I had an icky feeling about it. Turns out my Spidey senses are real because she was a former potential love interest of his that he drove an hour to meet and get a hotel room with after months of talking!

I tell him I'm uncomfortable with him still being friendly-ish with her like this with a ""former romantic interest/person"" and he said that he lost interest a long time ago and it was never romantic. I immediately started profusely apologizing to him because I knew I didn't want to freak out on him for the emotions I was feeling but internally I was screaming I knew I was right. 

My thinking spiraled down into the mindset that other girl is prettier/funnier/smarter and a better partner for him and that me starting this conversation was going to be the end of me and my FPs relationship(yes he's my boyfriend)and that if I wasn't so fucking stupid and insecure none of this would be happening. I cried on and off for hours silently at work and then when I got in my car I had a full on mental breakdown of me sobbing bawling my eyes out screaming and whatnot. He hadn't been replying after I had apologized about over 7 texts and called myself stupid twice via those texts so that's why it got so bad. But I didn't let him know how horrible of a state I was in. I don't want him to know how bad I actually get.

He ended up replying and saying he wasn't upset with me, that he loved me and that I didn't need to be sorry. So I'm better than I was before but I haven't gone through emotions like that in so long.....I feel like this is a split? I don't know though maybe I'm just overly emotional.

141,Should i apologize for a greater good?,1715892239.0,"Context: i (24M) am now engaged and living  together with my girlfriend (21F), she came to live with me a month ago, we had an agreement  that we'd be together no matter what, i didnt care who went where, but she agreed that here is the best place to do so. She lived on the other side of the country, i have visited her hometown, its nothing like here.
I had a best friend, we argued and had a huge fight around two or three months ago. To summarize, he's the kind of friend that, when bothered or mad, goes on a rampage saying everything we're doing wrong to him, how we can be better and etc, he's a fake high person. Over 12 years of friendship, and since he's always been my only friend, i took it every time, defending myself, but not in a fiercely way. Anyways, last time we had an argument, he said a bunch of awful things, the reason of the fight was something he misunderstood, but i got mad and i did what he always did, said a lot of stuff, afterwards he said ""after all the bad things you said about me, the way you see me, I don't think we can be friends anymore"". I could've explained the misunderstanding, I could've saved my friendship, but i chose not to. I find him an arrogant hypocrite for saying that, after he's done the same to me like 30 times and i did it once (the worse i said to him is that he was basically being a teen girl throwing a tantrum, i didn't even said anything that bad).
Anyways, his wife came from far away, the same place my girl came,  and she suffered a lot when she came here, she missed her home, and it took over a year for it to get really better, the plan was to try to get them to be friends, so my girl would have someone to talk to about her hometown, someone that actually understands her, because now, my girlfriend is suffering from it, and it breaks my heart not being able to help at all
I'm considering apologizing, even when i did nothing at all to him, to get the friendship back, so i can do what we originally planned and try to get my girl to smile more again.
The former friend has always gaslighted me, manipulated me and etc, because he knew i only had him as a friend and that i was scared to lose him and being alone, now i see it all, after i had guts to finally end it.

I finally feel completely confident in my body. I finally feel the motivation to pick up my career again and potentially pursue my old dream of being a radiologist later on. Im learning how to cook from scratch. Im sewing again. I plan on doing volunteer work at my local animal shelter. I‚Äôve been visiting the library again. I‚Äôve been going out to dance. I‚Äôve been going to events. I‚Äôm meeting new people and actually taking the time to learn about what kind of person they are, without any rush or impulsivity on my end. Im being open and honest with my wants, needs, boundaries and challenges. So far it‚Äôs actually going really well and many understand! Not all of course, which is valid and I take it with no offense. It‚Äôs still so worth it to put myself out into the world and explore it to the fullest. My online friends, new irl friends/connections, and family have given me their support :,)

I‚Äôm young. I‚Äôm learning and growing everyday. And while life will never be perfect and I know I‚Äôll never be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, I‚Äôve made peace with it.

I can still learn new skills and hobbies. I can still get out the house and be hot as fuck with my new confidence and clothes üòÇ! And yes, a personality disorder might affect all of the above, I‚Äôm well aware of that. I know that there will still be depression days or self-isolation days. I know I‚Äôll still think about ending it (pretty recently actually) but it‚Äôs just a fleeting thought now and doesn‚Äôt really weigh heavy on my mind like it did before. It‚Äôs not an actual desire at all, it‚Äôs more of an emotion that just manifests in that way. That‚Äôs typical for someone with BPD unfortunately, it is what it is. Before, I cried almost daily because the thoughts would never go away no matter what I did. I felt like I was going insane. As I said in the beginning, it was like my mind was crumbling. I had no clue what to do. I thought I was really going to die any day now. I had actual plans and luckily I never went through with them.

That being said, I know that not every friendship or love is going to work out, but that‚Äôs true for normal people too. I know not everything is going to be perfect, but again that‚Äôs true for normal people too! Im not going to let it stop me from having a social life.

I had wonderful parents they loved me and never gave me a reason to give up. I was the only child so I never had anybody to talk too. My parents worked a lot so it was very hard to see them. 

My mom had a friend who was very into herself. She would bring her son over, who was my best friend, but I was the only one getting in trouble when I did something bad. he never did. Everyone believed him. 

I want attention so bad where one day someone will be on my side who believed me. But having the autism part was not the easiest since describing my feelings was difficult.

I had dogs that I always played with, but when they didn't give me attention or bit me because I was rough, I would hurt them behind my parents' backs.

I asked him why he did it and he responded bec they are more prettier then me. (Which he was righ I smacked him across the face and kissed him. My emotions were everywhere. Was I mad, was I desperate I didn't care anymore.

We eventually broke up over a lot of different things but we got back together 2 months ago. My boyfriend finally did block her and hes been getting help for his mental health and things have been really good. He has worked on his communication and the way he treated me and nothing of this nature has happened again and i trust that it wont. The problem is that this girl (she knew we were together by the way) is in my friend group and if i cut her off or unfollow her it will create a problem and im afraid my friends will leave me so i cant escape this constant trigger. She also made herself into the victim to the point where she convinced one of my friends that i somehow owed her an apology for her constantly texting my boyfriend about sex and flaunting in my face that my boyfriend was more emotionally open and comfortable with her than me. She also has been really hostile towards me and has openly made fun of me for being autistic and talks down to me when in group settings. Me and my boyfriend have talked a lot about what has happened and he has done a lot to rectify it and show me that i can trust him and that he loves me but this girl has treated me terribly and has done nothing but make me feel worse about this situation that i know isnt my fault and i didnt deserve to be cheated on.

None of the staff understood my issues at all. They all assumed I was just doing everything for attention or some shit.

I don‚Äôt know if anything I can do or say will make it any better. For the people who have BPD what helps? Is there things others can do for you or say that help out? Like I said I know I can‚Äôt just make it go away but I really want to be the best support for her that I can. What kind of steps can I take to ease her pain and struggle the best that I can? Thanks for any help you can give. ",Afraid_Client_7242,,False,1ctk1yh,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1ctk1yh/non_bpd_person_looking_for_advice_on_supporting/
160,I'm obsessed with my toxic ex and his girlfriend.,1715884360.0,"I'm obsessed with my ex and his girlfriend. In like 5th grade me and her used to good friends, and I always found her interesting. We were good friends and she trusted me. And I was happy to be friends with her. 
But now my ex is dating her for over 1.5 years. And we broke up 1.5 years ago. And it didn't even take him days to go after her. I wanted to be friends with her but I couldn't, and they both were friends with each other.

But at that time, I had him. He was my boyfriend. And we were eachothers first proper relationship. We went out for about 6 months and I broke up with him around the 8 th  month. I'm saying that because, we had a on and off relationship. And I was in a very toxic place with him. He used to send me hate  messages, and he would state the things that he hates about me and even abuse him. But I still wanted him, because well I unconditionally loved him ( I know I was an idiot) 

My ex had a dark past, he was raped by his neighbour repaditly when he was a kid to when he was 17 years old. He used to cry and I would consule him, he even tried to take his life multiple times but I stopped him everytime. Me and him, we were both depressed as fuck, like we both were on the werge of dying and kill ourselves but then we found eachother. And that's how we became friends to best friends to inseparable couple.

I grew up in a very toxic household. My own mother was abusive, she would hurt me physically and emotionally alot. It was every days seen. She once hit me so hard that I thought I was going to pass out. And the reason she hit me so much for that day was pointless.

I grew up with a absent father who used to hit me whenever he felt like it. He once hit me so bad when I was in like 6th grade that my whole mouth was broken. I was bleeding so much from my mouth and my nose. He didn't ever wanted a daughter, he only wanted a son. But I was the firstborn girl. 

I still remember that when I was like 8 or 9 years old, my dad has just came home and I was watching cartoons. And he asked me for the remote and I said no, I'm watching cartoon. He slapped me so hard that my ear was bleeding all night and I remember being in the doctor's chair and there was alot of clotted blood in my ear. I was crying in pain all the night, he didn't even checked on me and continued to sleep.

 I was bullied alot throughout my school life. I was never really good at studies so I was hit my all my teachers in front of everyone all the time and they just used to laugh at me. In 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th grade. I remember this and this humiliation still haunts me, I got really bad grades and all my classmates who I thought were my friends, took trash out of the dustbin and whatever they had like paper pieces and leaves and ofc trash. They dumped all of it on my and they were pointing and laughing. I wanted to cry my heart out, I wanted to scream so bad, but I instead was thrown out of the group on the school field and nobody wanted to be friends with the dumb girl. 

Anyway I think this can literally go on forever. I'm here to talk about my ex, so I always had doubts that he liked that girl, and I even told him multiple times that, hey, I think she likes you. Maybe you should be with her instead of me. I had very low self-esteem and I thought I wasn't worthy of any sort of love. So I tried to push him away. But he stayed and always told me that he's not even going to talk to her after the school ends. And that I have nothing to worry about really. So I believed him. But guess what he's now been dating her for 1.5 years and she even has the same birthday as me. This thing just ruins my birthday. Because I always end up thinking of them. And that will wish me "" happy birthday"" this year?

 I've become very very obsessive when it comes to them. I literally just spend hours searching for the playlist that they created for eachother. And that's what confirmed that they are together. At first I was in denial that he'd never do such a thing. But when I asked him this recently he said yes. And he even said "" don't even utter a word against her""

Partner doesn't believe I have BPD (he says I don't have emotional ""swings"" but I know I do. They are all internal.)  I am doing the DBT workbook and am noticing certain things. I take everything out on myself, and everything is internal. 

We were supposed to visit family today, and my husband picked up a cold earlier this week. I ended up catching it. Now we can't see our little niece and I just started crying, blaming myself feeling like a horrible person. I had a huge emotional swing, just breaking down loads of dispair. Kept saying ""I ruined it."" I went to the extreme where I blamed myself for getting in the way of my husband connecting with his family, and I felt like he should leave me. I felt like I ruined everything.

My husband called my mother-in-law and she was so sweet, telling me it wasn't my fault. She was so understanding. Spoke to my own father - he told me to go and expose an infant otherwise I would be offending my in-laws. So his comments didn't help. Working on dialing down relationship with parents due to the part they played in this diagnosis.

  
Emotionally regulating is really hard. Am trying to use my ""wise mind"" to understand that I just caught a virus and wasn't doing anything wrong to take my husband from his family, yet this all still feels like my fault. I still blame myself.

My mother in law kept asking me ""why are you sorry? You're sick! It's okay."" This is just so hard. My world has been rocked by this diagnosis and sometimes I wonder if I'll ever recover and not blame myself for everything/think I am deeply defective and an evil human being all the time.

I'm at a bit of a loss. 

I'm in the process of seeking diagnosis for BPD (or whatever my current issues may be).
However, I can never get any provider to look past depression or anxiety. I don't know how to fix this.
My past therapist even identified my abadonment issues, but nothing further than that.
I just had a first appointment with a psychiatrist, and I feel like basically nothing was achieved. I think it's partly my fault, I didn't specifically mention personality disorders or not messing with my current medication, but even when she asked about mood swings and I emphasized that I have horrible irritable mood swings, she just asked if they were depressive or anxious. Even though I didn't want my medications messed with, she altered my zoloft and is adding a medication for ADHD. 
But also, at the beginning of the appointment she asked what my goal was, I told her that outside of my diagnosed ADHD, depression, and anxiety, I feel like I have other issues going on, and I said I was seeking evaluation and referrals for therapy.

166,isolating myself is so comforting yet so painful,1715881294.0,"so right now, i‚Äôm out of work and have been since i lost my job late last year. i have a boyfriend who i love and 2 friends who i see sometimes, im terrible at replying and i feel awful for this but for some reason, being in constant conversation with someone, even over text just drains me. 

it was honestly actually a relief in a way when i lost my job, every single day i would constantly be obsessing over small interactions with coworkers, the smallest thing makes me so angry, if i feel disrespected or not listened to, it invokes a rage into me that i know i absolutely cannot show at work. i am completely unable to be ‚Äòdiplomatic‚Äô, i will let resentment build until i can‚Äôt take it any longer and fly off the handle, using anger as a way to voice how i feel. i feel i literally cannot explain to someone that they‚Äôve upset me, unless im angry. of course, this is very unhealthy and has led to a lot of situations where im the one having to apologise for my reaction, rather than addressing why they upset me in the first place. this behaviour haunts almost every relationship i have. the ones id doesn‚Äôt impact, are the friends which i make sure i don‚Äôt get too close to, in order for this behaviour to not ruin our friendship. 

i am thinking of doing some voluntary work one day a week so im getting out my apartment more, but honestly the thought of being around a group of people, even just 1 day a week, fills me with dread and anxiety. its the same thing every time, i start a job, its the best job ever and everyone and everything is perfect to begin with, then a few months down the line, i become paranoid, i find out someone has said x about me behind my back, now i absolutely hate them, they‚Äôre a horrible person and no one can convince me otherwise. at every job i look back on, and this may sounds really silly, but it actually feels like i‚Äôve been through some kind of social trauma due to the way i obsess, hyperfixate and catastrophize every slight miscommunication, every comment, every look. i sit in my room for hours thinking and obsessing, sometimes sending me into panic attacks about the way people are treating/perceiving me. i start getting suicidal thoughts, feel as though everything is f*cked, i am f*cked, my whole life is f*cked forever. it is honestly draining. i actually amaze myself at how much i drain my own energy literally just by *thinking*. 

i‚Äôm in a trauma based therapy right now for sexual abuse i went through during my teens by my step father. i hope it helps because honestly i don‚Äôt know how much longer i can take living like this. isolation is comfortable, yet so lonely. i tell myself i would like to be alone, yet every time i am left alone in my apartment for a few days, i turn to drink, drugs and self harming because i feel so lonely. i thought i loved being on my own, so why do i always feel like this when im on my own? i feel like every single emotion and feeling i feel, conflicts another. if im around people, i can‚Äôt handle it. if im on my own, i also can‚Äôt handle it. 

i dont want to be this way. i want to do things with my life, i wanted a career and i want healthy relationships yet, it all seems so out of reach. every social interaction feels like the mental equivalent of someone poking at an infected wound, whether it‚Äôs a genuine interaction or not. my brain will always tells me its negative, that people are out to get me, that people are conspiring against me, using me, that they hate me, they are repulsed and disgusted by me and i feel such deep, deep shame about myself. 

sometimes, i look back on the times before the trauma during my teens happened. and i am so envious of the little girl i was, who trusted so willingly, who loved so freely, so openly, without fear of consequence. the girl who wasn‚Äôt constantly ashamed, angry, frightened and paranoid. i wish i could go back and tell her how lucky she is. 

sorry for the rant. i am so tired of feeling this way and if anyone else feels the same, i hope soon enough we can find a way to work through these dreadful feelings and soon become people that will make that little girl/boy inside of us proud. and thank you for taking the time to read my rant :)

167,Am I overreacting?,1715881185.0,"So my partner and I recently broke up and I am unsure if I am just being over the top or logical,  so any advice would help.
So to preface the issue,  we are long distance but have known eachother for going on 13 years. 
We got super serious during covid and spent literally everyday together,  then as things lifted and she was able to see her friends,  she started partying with them again and having nights out,  not an issue for me. 
1 of the nights her friends were hanging out,  she calls me making weird noises and we got disconnected,  so I attempted multiple times to call back with no answer. 
After her friends leave she calls me and we start hanging out(mind it's almost 4am at this point),  and she proceeds to tell me her friend Emma couldn't make it,  which means she was getting hammered with her ""gay"" friend Andrew alone in her apartment.  She told me Emma and Andrew carpooled and showed up together. 
This situation pissed me off because,  why lie to begin with?
I had never said or implied she couldn't hang out with her male friends,  so this caused us issues that made it difficult to trust her because she lied with no reasoning. 
She promised not to lie again about who she was with and to communicate better.

Fast forward to today

Saturday night we were gonna chill after she got off work,  she texts me and says ""I'm gonna go out and enjoy the sun,  not sure if we will get to hang out"".
My first thought was ""cool I don't mind if we miss a day of hanging out"",  but I couldn't quite figure out what was with the vaguarity of the message.  I thought ""ok the sun is only out for 3 hours tops at this hour"",  but I just kind of shrugged it off. 
She only responded to 1 message out of 5 and most of them were pertaining to our plans for the following day,  then at around 3am,  she finally starts texting me back but completely disregards all previous messages. 
We ended up getting into a fight because of her lack of communication and being out all night,  the next day she acted like nothing happened and wanted to hang out,  to which I refused and ended up telling her impulsively that I didn't want to be together. 
After 2 days of fighting about the situation she finally admitted she went out drinking with her ""gay"" coworker who she just met (out of character for her).
I kind of feel like claiming a guy is ""gay"" is an easy out though,  and a last minute outing with a man that you hide from your partner of 4 years seems off. 
She claims she didn't say anything cause she knew I wouldn't be ok with it,  which seems worse to me that she still did it. 
Am I wrong for losing trust and getting pissed off?

176,I miss how chaotic my life used to be ,1715877793.0,"From my mid to late teens I was all sorts of fucked up. I was newly diagnosed with BPD, addicted to pills, had an eating disorder, was hooking up with multiple strangers a night, self harming daily, shoplifting a ton, I had just met my first ever FP and was generally just living terribly. 

I was of course super miserable during this time, but under the misery it was also fun? Or exciting maybe? There was something that I absolutely loved about living that way and I miss it every single day. 

My life looks a lot different now. Now I have a job and a partner that I‚Äôve been with for years. I‚Äôm clean from drugs and self harm and my BPD symptoms aren‚Äôt very prevalent anymore most times. I haven‚Äôt been able to kick the ED though and I will acknowledge that it‚Äôs probably adding to my misery a lot.

For years, pretty much since I got clean, I‚Äôve been missing how things used to be so much. I am so bored of life. I‚Äôm bored of waking up every day just to go do a job that I hate, come home, eat dinner, go to bed, and do it all again the next day. It‚Äôs depressing. At least when I was on drugs I could get high and feel better whenever I wanted. I would give anything to feel like I did when I was 17 again. I had coping strategies that actually worked, even if they were hurting me physically, they made me feel better emotionally. I don‚Äôt get to feel good emotionally now. 

I also really miss the people who were in my life at the time. I met my first FP about 6 months before I got diagnosed with BPD, and of course, I thought I was in love with him. To make it even better for my attention starved teenage self, he was an older guy who also struggled with sh, suicidal ideation, and drug addiction. 

Our disorders fed off each other and even though it wasn‚Äôt healthy for either of us he was my best friend in the world for a few years, it felt like whatever I went through he‚Äôd always be there and I was there for him. He even knew how hopelessly in love with him I was, and he didn‚Äôt mind. He made it clear to me nothing would ever happen because I was a minor and he was an adult, and nothing weird or sexual ever did happen, but even knowing that a fucked up teenage girl like me had a huge crush on him, he was still there for me, he was still my best friend, and he never made me feel bad or embarrassed about any of it.

We don‚Äôt talk anymore, and I know I didn‚Äôt actually love him it was just infatuation, but he was honestly the best friend I ever had and I think I‚Äôll miss him forever.

She told me I had to change and that she wouldn‚Äôt give me another chance if I screwed up again. Well I screwed up again. I had a whole thing at prom with her because she was spending too much time with her friend (who lives 2 hours away and payed 80 bucks to get there) I felt it should have been our night and I was jealous of her spending so much time with her best friend ( she‚Äôs a girl btw). I got angry and yelled at her about it infront of her friend without really thinking. I embarrassed her and I hated myself for it and how I had ruined both our nights on such a special event. I got really low and had an emotional breakdown in the bathroom and I hurt myself. I punched myself a lot and she texted me that she was leaving and that I always do this to her when we‚Äôre together with other people trying to have a good time and how I ruined this for her , and she said my negativity was gonna be the end of our relationship. Well a lot of stuff happened and I called her while I was crying and walking in the road and I was so screwed up , she called my mom because she was worried about me. I took an Uber to her house because I wanted to try to fix things and really apologize but I was a mess. She comforted me while I cried on her shoulder until my mom came. She called me drunk at 2 am to break up with me. Basically that convo ended in us deciding to have some space and talk later when she was ready. On Monday she invites me to her house to finally talk , I was so nervous. She does break up with me and it‚Äôs so hard for her but she says she‚Äôs made up her mind. I‚Äôm freaking out and I can‚Äôt accept it , I love her so much and I regret my actions and how I treated her so badly . I would do anything to fix things and try again and I was trying to convince her of this stupidly for about 30 minutes or more , I can tell this was really hard for her , we were both crying a lot and kissing and hugging almost the whole time and it was so hard to let go of her. I eventually accepted it after bawling like I never have before. She said maybe we can find each other ther in the future when we‚Äôre both better. And honestly those words are the only thing from keeping me from being absolutely miserable and nonfunctional. I finally start to accept the situation and we keep saying kind of our goodbyes but we prolong it. And eventually when we were really close she says ‚Äúwhat about we say goodbye some other way, in the bedroom‚Äù so we have sex one more time and it‚Äôs amazing and sweet and especially romantic. And then I left. This was 4 days ago. We have talked a little in those four days but nothing serious. I‚Äôm devastated.

My friend often talks about herself as being ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù.

If there are problems (esp men related) she keeps talking about she will slap them etc she doesn‚Äôt care if it will get her in trouble. 

Now as a (kind of) peaceful human being, why does she do this? Can i help her ? I always try and talk to her that protecting ur peace is much better and just leave the bad people be, but she never understands :/

183,Boyfriend said I am unhappy all of the time and it broke me. Some thoughts I wrote down last night that I want to share.,1715874546.0,"I remember when I was a kid and I would daydream nearly every night before bed about me as an adult. Who I'd be with, what I'd be driving, and where I would live. I would even imagine the outfits I'd be wearing - button-up blouse with a teddy bear print, knee length skirt (gray) and modest shoes or sandals. 
I remember imagining how cool life would be, all the boyfriends I'd have and the places I'd see.

I wish life as an adult was as easy as my former dreams. I wish I could imagine myself as happy and instantly feel good. I've never known what happiness feels like. I guess that's why I always felt different and out of place as a kid. When I would see them freely express joy and partake in any activity without any second thoughts or doubts. I never understood why they never reacted or felt the same way as me.

Now that I am an adult, life hardly measures up to what I imagined as a kid. I didn't know about heartbreak, frustrations, misunderstandings, and my intense rage.
I didn't know that being in a relationship meant I would be forced to face hardships.
I didn't know myself then, and I feel like I don't know myself now.
What I do now is
I can be crazy,
I get hurt a lot,
I have fears of rejection, 
I am insecure,
I can't control my anger and often get worked up over the littlest things.
I get offended a lot,
I care too much about what other people think of me even though I am not entirely sure who it is that is me.

I have my causes. I know what's worth fighting for. But that can't be all there is to my identity.

I want to feel happy.
I want to show love.
I want to comfortably orgasm like I don't give a fuck.
I want to know that it is okay to be me in the face of disagreements.
I want to freak out if my boyfriend would just let me.

The only time I ever feel like I am truly expressing myself is when I feel intense emotions
No, maybe that's wrong.

Because of the nature of having an unstable personality, I (diagnosed BPD) mostly used to show the insecure, begging version of myself. On the other hand, there were instances where I could not feel empathy, and masked insecurity in the same way as NPD, instead of seeking validation and worth from people. Most people with borderline that I've known also show a similar proclivity to grandur and self importance, when insecurity isn't kicking ass.

I struggle with dating apps, very few matches, very few of which become conversations, even fewer become dates. So to fill the void of physical contact and feeling wanted I turned to casual sex.

Swingers club have been great - having a night out partying with fun people in your underwear and hopefully having some fantastic sex with one or more of them? Ideal, at least if I'm in the mood for lots of people.

But once I branch out into private meets, it typically goes one of two ways - there's no connection, we just have sex (usually fun sex) and move on without seeing each other again, but I feel a bit empty. Or we do have some kind of connection, have a great time and meet up again, which means I get attached, develop feelings, and then get rejected because they're not looking for a relationship - or just don't want one with me.

Cue devastation, downward spiral, general misery.

Until the loneliness gets the better of me and I restart my fruitless search on dating apps and the cycle starts again.

However, I'm starting to doubt the accuracy of the diagnosis for a significant reason.

Although others have shown interest, my shyness and lack of confidence have prevented anything from developing. I feel that I bond more easily with people who have BPD, forming intense connections quickly. Even when I'm initially avoidant, the other person often pursues me until I become attached.

DBT works for me. my therapist still never takes it seriously and the other day was my own personal final straw of sorts. 

  So i, (22NB), have been seeing this therapist for over a year. aside from this aspect hes been a great match for me. one issue i have with therapists is when they get their degree 40 years ago and refuse to open up their minds. yes, they can be competent too, but its so much better when the professional admits they can be wrong. 
the only thing he is bad with is my bpd. 
  right off the bat i told him first session what i suspect i have, with a list of the BPD criteria and times in my life i‚Äôve fit that. any thing else i have hes good with. but that even after i named those symptoms he goes, ‚Äúyeahh alot of bpd symptoms‚Äù in a condescending way. after a while ive made a 14+ page masterdoc of the BPD criteria and my own personal experiences with all of it. i didnt finish entirely but it didnt matter. he just stopped me and condescendingly went ‚Äúyes you have alot of bpd symptoms but idk how this is helpful to us‚Äù  I SPENT THE WHOLE 3 ish DAYS PRIOR MAKING THAT. I SKIPPED WORK FOR 2 HRS FOR OUR SESSION AND MY BOSS CHEWED ME OUT FOR IT.  AND HE DIDNT EVEN GIVE A FUCK SBOUT IT. you can have autism and bpd. he says this but i gurantee you if i didnt have the autism diagnosis he‚Äôd be perfectly fine treating me. 
     but hes not. hes never once said i was valid in how i was feeling and that was the name for those experiences. 
      I got this long ass message the other day, saying essentially, i was displaying behaviors i ‚Äúcriticize my mom for‚Äù to her and that because of that ‚ÄúBPD does not apply to you‚Äù. what the fuck? first off my mom has her own set of issues but she doesnt have BPD or any of its symptoms. she fits the bill for OCPD. and shes abusive. but not borderline. 

       i took her to my session bc i was sick of being emotionally abused my whole life. i wanted someone else to see what she does to me and surprise surprise, she gaslit both of us and played the role of the sweet, hardworking stressed-out mother who just wanted to help her poor little child with autismü•∫give me a fucking break. i was run so ragged and we argued in the session. i went through aba and speech ‚Äútherapy‚Äù as a kid and it ruined me. she refuses to acknowledge my hurt around it and wont believe i was abused. i asked him to confirm to her it was abuse but bro said nothing the entire session. but what did he do? use it as a gotcha to say i didnt have bpd. its just LeaRnEd BeHaViorS from my mom (she has no borderline symptoms) do i take my anger out on others bc thats what she does to me ? yes. do i get angry in unhealfhy ways impulsively in ways that my mother has nothing to do with? also yes. the whole call i was extremely upset not even in a bp way, but in an abused child that is being gaslit and betrayed by their therapist who now thinks my mom isnt ‚Äúthat bad‚Äù way. he broke up with me over text message with no response and no references. he talked with my psychiatrist so now he doesnt think i have bpd either. im currently out of therapy and have a psychiatrist who doesnt believe me. ive done 7 years of research and icknow what im talking about. im so sick of people denying the fact im hurting and im so sick of not being treated.  i also never know if i open up enough in therapy.  its subconscious at this point but i thought i was doing good for a while.  idk. i need therapy so bad but i have so much trauma regarding it. ive never once had a good therapist and im really losing hope here. sometimes i wonder my parents refusing to get me treatment for 10+ years till i was 20 was deserved.  its not like i am therapy-ing right anyway. the one place everybody has a right to have as their safe place never has and never will be safe for me. i feel like i‚Äôm losing my mind.

Since being out, I‚Äôve found it incredibly hard to adjust back into my home environment. Everything was so safe and I was so protected in the clinic. They even decreased my meds because I was doing so well. 

Fast forward to coming out and back into my home environment and I‚Äôve never been in a worse place in my life. On top of this, two weeks ago, I found out my friend took his life. When I found this out, I tried to call my one friend, but she ignored my phone call because she was too busy smoking, knowing that I needed the support because I was alone, and one of my conditions were for my friends to please not smoke in front of me. So she didn‚Äôt pick up and chose to smoke over being of company to me. Then, I had asked my very best friend if she would be around for company and support after my friend‚Äôs memorial. She said no, it‚Äôs too much for her. I will admit that I started splitting on both of them after those two occasions, because my friend has just died and no one wanted to be around. But at some point I pulled back.

Still happened anyway, but even now I feel awful and I don‚Äôt know what I did wrong to fix it. I was annoyed here and there when I wasn‚Äôt being talked to, flat out seeing them with others and talking to others but saying they were busy to talk to me, completely changing after they made new friends compared to how we used to be.

I don‚Äôt know, I feel like I was too much. I acted off towards his group causd I was jealous (I tried not to be, and I had fun with them many times, but deep down I was still jealous and upset) and I clinged too much to be considered good to keep around, and it‚Äôs been fucking woke up cause I don‚Äôt know if I was in the right or wrong cause I still don‚Äôt know what specifically I did. I have issues with my tone sounding off/angry when I don‚Äôt mean it to be, and I said to call it out so I can check myself and it never happened until the end.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, this is the final straw and my favorite person is seemingly out of my life forever, we weren‚Äôt even dating and never saw them in such a manner but it feels equivalent to a 10 year relationship breakup. I don‚Äôt know what happened, I don‚Äôt think I was a good friend, everything went wrong.

207,Maybe I am a lunatic,1715815649.0,"I've always lied to everyone and myself. I've always been good at it. I hide things and I know how to make people perceive me a certain way. I can read people well enough to know the worst in them, but blind enough to avoid seeing the good. I sometimes feel like I have a thread around my neck that is holding my head in place, only staying there because I have my hands to rest on.

I've always wanted to make sense, but maybe I just dont, maybe my brain is too broken to do so, or can you really call something broken if it never really had a shape to begin with? I survived, and that's all I know. I will do whatever I can to survive, even if it means murder or to hurt others, because that's what I am. I am seen as sympathetic because I want to, and because it is easier. Is that true? or am I deceiving myself to think of myself as a threat? maybe I am really as vulnerable as they say. I always wanted people to pity me as a kid, because it made it easier to feel safe and protected. Do I feel remorse because I want to? am I sane because I want to?

I sometimes want to push myself off of a bridge, maybe not to care about how crazy I seem to actually be. I reject how fucked up of a person I am, and the disgusting things I am willing to do to satisfy myself. I am a monster, and maybe I've always hid this from myself.

I dont think I've ever really had a good sense of morals, or who knows. I act according to ethics, but is that only for appearances? I follow morals because that's the best course of action, so is it only a cold calculation? What kind of monster am I? one who is aware? or one who is not? How can I change personality traits so easily? I feel like water, or a fire that can't turn itself off, but can spread as much as it wants.

I don't know who I am, and I don't know how I feel. But, I've started to wonder if that is by my own design. I am a lunatic that appears to be sane, only because I want others to see me that way, and more importanty, because I want to see myself as sane. I am not a force of good or evil, at least that's what I am thinking right now. I am just a force that will pull wherever it thinks it is best to go. I am insane.

At least that's the narrative I have at the moment. Maybe it will simply change in an hour, or in a day. No one seems to be able to predict me, and neither can I. I sometimes want to hurt others, but I always want to hurt myself. I feel like burning everything to the point that it might as well be hell.

208,"Weird question but, do you guys feel like every emotion is like a separate personality?   (NOT A DIAGNOSIS QUESTION)",1715805927.0,"To first clear things up, i do not have a professional diagnosis regarding BPD, nor do i want reddit to diagnose me with BPD. If that helps, i‚Äòm currently being assessed for Autism and if my Autism assessment isn‚Äòt resulting in an Autism diagnosis i will most likely be screened for personality disorders. Just needed to clarify, that i‚Äòm relying on professionals for diagnosis.
Let‚Äòs get to the relevant part though, without any labels. Also known as experiences.
It‚Äòs just kind of odd, i notice how when i‚Äòm irritated i have this huge hatred for all of humanity and start assuming nobody is really trustable and that i shouldn‚Äòt emotionally confide in anyone and how for instance intimacy is just pure egoistic cooperation for the mutual self satisfaction of needs. The typical misanthropic kind of stuff.Being the cynical type of guy. If the emotion is something different (which i genuinely cant tell what emotion it is) i can also have huge urges to be vulnerable, to be held and just loved. I‚Äòll refer to it as the hopeless romantic. Sometimes i feel apathetic as hell and feel like i‚Äòm an outsider and..well let‚Äòs just compare it to the character Meursault from the Stranger from Albert Camus.
I got that whole idc attitude. 
Sometimes i feel like everyone around me hates me (as in, i sense hatred though i have no basis to think so and then i have the sense of inferiority but at the same time i can feel grandiose/superior about the reason i‚Äòm being hated by peers). It‚Äòs simply i refuse to engage in the consumption of recreational substances. 
If the emotions are according i may be super invested in academic activities (because my personality kinda switches into the whole productive trope)

A final point is, i feel like i don‚Äòt really know who i am. As in, i deeply reflect, which gives people the illusion that i am very self aware. But i do that because everyone else around me seems to be so effortless in knowing who they are.

Therapy is draining me dry, but I know I just have to start it and figure out the rest later, and I'm thankful I can be on a sliding scale... But anyway, I know therapy is not accessable to most, or maybe DBT itself feels overwhelming. So I wanted to show this resource because I didn't realize how many free DBT books there are on the Internet archive.

My psych recently recommended me [DBT Made Simple by Sheri Van Dijk ](https://archive.org/details/dbtmadesimpleste0000vand)and that I should read it alongside my treatment to get a feel for everything. But then I noticed [the entire topic of DBT](https://archive.org/search?query=subject%3A%22Dialectical+behavior+therapy%22) has a lot more full books with free books you can ""loan"" with an account or download as pdfs.

Please still see a therapist though, if you have the means at all. This is NOT a replacement to therapy, just a supplement. You do need someone to help monitor how you're doing and giving tailored, unbiased but thoughtful advice into your life, and it does help to talk to a good professional, even if it sucks getting in the door.

213,Please tell me I made the right choice having an abortion and that I could never have handled or given my baby everything because of my BPD,1715860520.0,"I have diagnosed BPD and ADD, my ex has bipolar and ADD (diagnosed as well).

I always without fail took the pill, but my ex never used protection so we just got very very unlucky falling pregnant.

He instantly lost his shit. Fell into depression. Started ignoring me. Telling me he can't have this baby.

I never wanted kids because of my childhood trauma but once I found out I was pregnant I guess hormones kicked in and I loved the baby. I saw it on ultrasounds and it was measuring perfect. For once I took proper care of my body and health. For my baby. All my actions pointed to me wanting to keep it.

However with my ex desperate for an abortion and the moral window closing soon (if I got an abortion I'd want it before 8 weeks - no nervous system on brain activity yet, so it would not feel or be aware of anything) things were getting super tense.

My ex threatened suicide. He said he would leave me and never want to see our child. He already abandoned another child (that he told me his ex kept from him, but during my pregnancy admitted to never wanting), so I knew he was capable of that.

When his bipolar gets bad he's usually off the rails getting into debt and bouts on unemployment, so I knew financially he'd contribute next to nothing. (he pays his ex 100/150 a month)

I asked my family if they would support me (let me live there for the first few months with baby) and they basically said no. Then I thought about it and hated myself for wanting to bring my baby into the lives of the people who traumatised me.

But I had no one else. I struggle with codependency like my mom so I was unhealthily attached to my ex and had no support system whatsoever.

I got a lot of counselling from unwanted/unplanned pregnancy therapists but it always came down to its up to you, if you want it, keep it.

I wanted to keep it so badly but how could I, faced with reality:

- I have BPD. I'm easily overstimulated and completely shut down when I am. Frequently fall into depression and suicidal ideation where I'm unable to function for days. I can barely take care of myself. I don't have life skills, I cannot teach a child how to regulate themselves. I'd resent them depending on me probably.

- I'm codependent and would probably repeat the same dynamics with my child that my mother did with me. Enmeshment. Emotional dependence. Traumatising my child for life even though I'd love it with all my heart.

- my ex has severe mental illness and ADD like me (what is the genetic element in this? Would our baby be more likely to suffer from mental illness/disability as well)

- no support system whatsoever.... Literally no one except my mentally ill parents. I'm not stable either. How am I going to show up for my child in the best way every single day? As much as I told myself I'd die for my child and do it all, that is wishful thinking and unrealistic and unfair.

- despite many moms doing it alone on purpose the thought of my child not having a dad, knowing that they were abandoned, and me not having a partner to support me, it felt wrong. Like every child deserves two loving parents.

- I'd have to get off my meds because they weren't pregnancy safe. I'm on an extremely high dose so without it who knows what would happen to me on different/no meds. 

I had the abortion because in my mind love was simply not enough.

Afterwards my ex cheated, threw me out and made me homeless, I was hospitalized for an od because I just couldn't handle living anymore.

My 'due date' is coming up and I am still so incredibly sad, grieving. People tell me the baby was 'nothing' yet. But it was everything to me. My whole heart. Something more than me. I feel so sorry. Guilty. Curious how it would have been. Wishing I could have been enough.

Just tell me I did the right thing for my baby and myself.",diyyya,,False,1ctb4ib,288,147,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1ctb4ib/please_tell_me_i_made_the_right_choice_having_an/

I did some research and became even more confused. I relate to some of the traits and then some others on a very low level, like the anger issues, black and white thinking and impulsivity are definitely there but never enough to really cause much trouble in my life. I actually tend to have very stable long-term friendships and healthy relationships. I am a highly emotional and sensitive person but I try my hardest to not let it affect the way I treat others.

The most confusing parts were the favourite person and feeling of emptiness. I love people very deeply but those feelings usually don't just go away, even if a person hurts me i try my best to see all their actions in context and talk things out. My friends often joke that I'm a very low maintenance friend because I don't expect much from them and get immense joy from even small acts of care/affection. I actually have a problem with letting go of people who hurt me because I genuinely feel deep connection to everyone I love.

So yeah the emptiness is not there either. Even when I was in deep depression still living with my abusive family I didn't feel empty, I felt miserable. I've always felt things very strongly, only going numb when I am overstimulated and cannot take in anymore or im too dissociated to feel anything
 But that doesn't happen that often.

I'm not a profesional so I don't wanna say I was misdiagnosed but I have to wonder if someone can have BPD even without these major diagnostic criteria? Also what do i do if it was a misdiagnosis? How do I get a proper diagnosis? How can I make sure this doesn't happen again?

With that being said, I think I did everything possible to cover the bases here. 

My partner was at work today and didn‚Äôt bring food. Normally, when they don‚Äôt bring food, they go out to a nearby restaurant to grab something, and I offer to bring them something roughly half the time, but am never taken up on it. 

Tonight, I offered to bring them something an hour after their shift started. I was turned down as usual.

No. Would you like me to get anything and bring it to you? No. 

So I thought okay cool, they‚Äôre gonna go grab something like they do 99/100 times. I figured I wanted to go get something, so I did. But I also grabbed them a drink they love and saved them some of my food to surprise them when they get back. 

They called me on a break a few hours later, and asked what I ended up doing. I told them what I did and that I brought them home some stuff for when they get back home. 

That set them off - why didn‚Äôt I bring them anything, why didn‚Äôt I ask if I could get them anything, I‚Äôm so inconsiderate, I don‚Äôt think of them. 

I responded saying of course I did, I did everything I mentioned above. Not good enough. Eventually they got more heated, told me to bring them food and hung up.

223,I want to be there for my friend,1715844544.0,"My friend suspects that she has BPD, and seems pretty confident in it. I'm not a professional and can't really say, but I believe her. Either way, she is suffering from similar symptoms and not a little. She is going to therapy, but I want to help her out where I can.

Problem is that I am... not great at comforting people. I hear people out, say I understand how they feel if I do, and give advice when I think it might help. The latter doesn't happen often, because I'm afraid that if I give bad advice it's only going to make things worse.

I have my own set of problems, and struggle a lot with talking to others. I rarely start a conversation, I just respond when people talk to me. Which is not often. She is one of two people that have consistently been talking to me despite this, and she has helped me a lot with my problems. I want to do the same, and not because I'm grateful. I just want to help my friend where I can.

I like to think that I'm good at understanding others, but I don't know how it feels to have BPD because I don't have it myself, which is why I asked for advice here.

I'm mostly looking for general advice, because I'm not really comfortable with giving away information about her just like that.

Everything was going good until tonight. I keep having thoughts of my ex after seeing a song on YouTube pop up that remindse of them. I feel like shit for it bc when I'm with my partner it's all good and I love them so dearly. When I'm alone it's like my brain just likes to think and feel shit. I just want to brain rot on Instagram and just not have to think. It's like silence is violence. I know me and my ex aren't compatible and I haven't even talked to them in forever so why am I feeling this way?? I ruin everything. I'm new to BPD and have been recently diagnosed so tbh I don't know much about it. So I went to tell my partner that I felt like something bad was going to happen and I need help. It's late so I woke them up. I think they are just too tired to talk but it kinda makes me upset like do they not care about me. I try to think rationally I know it's bc they are tired but I can't help but feel they hate me. After sitting in the darkness with my sleeping partner I've made the best decision to get up and drink. Now I feel fucking miserable and I'm mad at myself for even doing this crap. Why can't I just be a good partner and not think about this person in the past who couldn't give me what I need??

I can rationally understand that I don't get much out of the relationship, and I can emotionally understand that while it feels so euphoric to get attention from them, that attention isn't worth feeling shit all day every day. 

But I have such a hard time letting them go.

Particularly if you're constantly watching self-improvement and growth stuff. BPD brains negatively frame stuff. Instead of learning, it makes you feel like a failure. It creates FOMO and distorts your values.

I experimented with going off social media completely to observe the stability of my thoughts and values for 2 weeks or so. I could quickly feel the stability and calmer. 

Then I got recently occupied again. I could feel self-harming negative thoughts getting stronger immediately.

So unless you have successfully fixed BPD default negative thoughts on envy and self-worth using DBT and mindfulness for a consecutive period, Get off social media.

Now, **about visual snow and BPD,** today I had a follow-up appointment with my psychiatrist and I asked him why I see static (also known as visual snow). I‚Äôve been asking him this for several appointments, and he always told me to wait a few more months to confirm that it wasn‚Äôt something temporary or some kind of hallucination and to rule out any ophthalmological problem. Well, this time, with the confirmed diagnosis of BPD (since before we couldn‚Äôt yet differentiate if it was BPD or BD), he explained that people with BPD tend to have increased sensory sensitivity in addition to emotional and mental issues, so it was probably related to visual overstimulation. I 'confirmed' this by researching a bit more about visual snow on the internet; it seems to be related to visual processing problems in the cerebral cortex. They also somehow related it to photophobia, a condition I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with, but I‚Äôve never been able to open my eyes properly when there‚Äôs a lot of sunlight, and I can never take pictures during the golden hour (I hate this, I wish I could) because I simply can‚Äôt open my eyes.

251,I have completely blown my life apart.,1715826551.0,"I was in a severely abusive marriage for 15 years. 
I became disabled due to my mental illness a couple years ago.
My husband would constantly call me lazy for being depressed all the time. I have been in and out of the hospital with SI. Sometimes a few times a year.

Two years ago he convinced me to begin doing online sex work. I did it. Making close to $3k a month, giving him every cent of my disability check and all the SW proceeds. It made me feel like I was contributing and not being lazy for once.

Then he convinced me to take on a poly lifestyle and accept a gf that we both shared.

I eventually became more and more unstable due to the sex work and being sad that he needed another woman to feel sexually fulfilled.

I went into the hospital a few times for wanting to unalive myself because I was so sad all the time between him calling me lazy for being depressed, being treated like a prostitute being pimped, and the loss of my self esteem because of the other woman.

I eventually told him I didn't want to be a SW anymore and I wanted to break up with the girlfriend.

He didn't take kindly to that and it ended in a huge blowout where I yelled at him in the front lawn in front of our kids. I know that was a mistake. I also know that I suffer from severe PTSD because of his abuse. I snapped.

I left him, and he took the kids, telling them that I abandoned them. They believed him and now hate me. They are convinced that the abuse was done by me and not him even though there are extensive arrest records from several times he beat me when they were babies and don't remember.

It's been nearly a year since I left and I barely have seen my girls because they say they don't want to see me.

I reached a tipping point when this week they told me they didn't want me at their band and choir concerts.

I wanted revenge. I emailed her job, which is a non profit that provides advocacy to disabled persons in bad situations, about her relationship with my abuser. I even sent them his mugshot and charges.

I wanted them to know that someone who is supposed to care for the abused and disabled is currently in a relationship with a proven abuser.

264,Helpful Strategies I Recommend ,1715822801.0,"26f Listen I‚Äôm no expert or saint. I believe I‚Äôm a good person who has a lot of work to do. I‚Äôm currently going through a metamorphosis- accepting and forgiving my past self and being serious about working on myself so I don‚Äôt repeat my mistakes. This is how I‚Äôm doing it: 

I downloaded this app called Finch. It‚Äôs an interactive self care app that is mostly free (there‚Äôs a version you can pay for but the free version is pretty good). I highly recommend it, even if you‚Äôre just struggling to get out of bed. 

Research your attachment style. I bought two books on anxious attachment because that‚Äôs what I have and even though I already knew I had that, it really opened my eyes and made my behaviours more clear to me. If you are curious about these books please ask. 

Literally just taking it one day at a time, getting out of bed, going to work, staying busy, being around good people and friends, having small goals I can achieve each day. 

Journaling- sounds simple but I‚Äôve always avoided it. All my counselors were right it does help lol. One thing that was hard for me to do was write down the situations or instances that would trigger me splitting. It‚Äôs hard to acknowledge your wrong doings and take accountability. It‚Äôs scary to admit you weren‚Äôt a good person at times. But writing out your wrong doings helps. Yes, some instances I felt valid in being angry because of how someone else mistreated me - but even then writing it down helps me understand what‚Äôs really in my control and what‚Äôs not in my control. Affirming to myself that I CAN CHANGE. I can do better. I CAN BE IN CONTROL OF MY EMOTIONS! 

Completing reflection exercises such as what I‚Äôm grateful for. 

Taking my vitamins. 

Respecting my boundaries. Not being too available to the opposite sex. 

Taking time to myself. Being out in nature. Not expecting anyone to save me. Not jumping into a new intense relationship (sounds easy). This also includes accepting that certain dynamics and situations don‚Äôt bring out the best in me and to avoid those people or circumstances - for example, it took me 3 long distant relationships to learn that long distant relationships don‚Äôt bring out the best in me. At least not right now when I need to heal. 

No casual sex!!! 

Making new friends. I use bumble bff. And I accept any new friends from this sub even if u need someone to talk or vent to. 

LISTENING AND ACCEPTING the boundaries other people have. 

Again I‚Äôm no saint. I‚Äôm a work in progress. I hope this helps some people. I would love to hear about what works for you! 

With peace and love üíó

We started discussing boundaries and stuff, been having a lot of issues interpersonally because I have been basically walling myself off, not wanting to talk about specific topics, not wanting to know about my ex, instead of being vulnerable, I tried setting up boundaries, but I was just making demands after all. My therapist called me out on it, she explained and at first I was confused, I thought I was quite a vulnerable person and about some stuff I am, but I realised I also use vulnerability as a defence mechanism from talking about what truly was making me feel vulnerable. Stuff I was holding back, yes and stuff I wanted to be vulnerable about, yes, but not the root issue.And the worst part it made me feel better because it was something I needed to discuss with that person, but it wasn't the main thing, I was still hiding.

Honestly this realsation explains a lot and it also explains a lot of other peoples reactions to stuff, people want to care about you, genuinly, they really want to care, so instead of building a wall, be vulnerable about whats really bothering you, it may seem impossible but you can over explain just how painful the thing is for you right now and just how scary it is as many times as you want and eventually that fear will subside.

He said he doesn‚Äôt want to hear what I have to say when I have an episode and that from now on he‚Äôs going to ignore me. When he said that, I felt so invalidated but I also understand why.

280,"My partner (21m) recently got diagnosed with bpd, I (20f) don't really know what to expect/how to help.",1715811771.0,"I started dating my boyfriend a month ago, though we were quite good friends for \~6 months prior. He was diagnosed with adhd a while ago and was recently diagnosed with bpd. He was diagnosed with major depression in high school, but that has not been an issue for a while. I do not have bpd and he is the first person with bpd I have met so apologizes If I seem ignorant or if I got something wrong, please correct me (he does not have a great understanding of bpd yet either as this is quite new).

From what I have read a lot of people with bpd struggle with intense emotions and unstable relationships. He has a really good relationship with his family and has a lot of long term friends. He is hyper rational and I have not seen him get really upset. I would actually say he is better than the average person at emotional regulation. This is something I know he worked on pre-diagnosis (he did this on his own, not with a therapist). So it does not seem that he struggled with the interpersonal components.¬†

He has a history of self harm, and some suicidal ideation, but far more of it was just self harm (clean for 3 years). He is a little impulsive/an adrenaline junky, though he is a 21 year old guy so some of that's to be expected. Furthermore, I would not classify any of his impulsivity as self destructive. The reason he thinks he got diagnosed is that he has rather intense dissociation. I have only been there for it once, but he doesn't make any sense, seems like he's experiencing entirely different things to reality and he is scared/paranoid. This is why he saw a psychiatrist in the first place. He has around 1 or 2 dissociative episodes a month.

He is rather resistant to treatment. He is prescribed meds for adhd which he almost never takes as he does not like how it makes him feel and he is rather against talk therapy. He did elect to see a psychiatrist as the dissociation thing really freaks him out. He has said that the dissociation is the only thing he would change about his life. When he got the diagnosis, his psychiatrist prescribed him antipsychotics but he never filled the prescription.

Anyways I love this guy, he is ridiculously passionate about life and it's infectious. He is super driven career wise and he has hobbies he really cares about. I love the talks we have and he is just so fun to be around. I also feel understood by him in a way I have not in past relationships. To sum it up, I really want this relationship to work and I don't know what my role in that should be. I would like to help him, but when I bring it up he is somewhat resistant, I feel like he does not want to inconvenience me. I asked him to think about triggers he has so I can avoid them, but he just said he does not have any. He is also very against being around me when he dissociates (which I have fully respected).

Any insight or advice on what to expect going forward or tips on how to be helpful would be greatly appreciated.¬†",Kindly-Daikon7637,,False,1csxkls,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1csxkls/my_partner_21m_recently_got_diagnosed_with_bpd_i/

286,Dismissed by therapist for BPD episode due to relationship issues,1715808570.0,"Hi everyone,

The background: 

I am stuck in a toxic relationship cycle from both ends, mostly my fault due to BPD but my partner also has significant trauma. 

I helped my partner get into therapy (finding her a therapist and paying for portions of it) knowing that this would probably end our relationship but cared more about helping her than dealing with a break up.

My partners work with her therapist has lead her to break up with me which I understand. However, my partner broke up with me over text while I was on an airplane yesterday coming back from a trip alone and her therapist advised her to not to response to me freaking out afterwards. Which in my opinion is a really bad thing to suggest to do to someone with BPD and intense abandonment issues. 

Heres the issue at hand currently:

My therapist is in the same practice as my partners therapist. I reached out to my therapist in crisis, freaking out, in the midst of a BPD episode. Saying I needed help and when I didn‚Äôt get a response, I threatened to call my partners therapist (owner of the practice). My therapist offered me a ‚Äúemergency‚Äù session two days later to speak about it. After this, I kept saying I needed help and she ignored me. I then called the practice trying to get in touch with my partners therapist multiple times because I was in BPD rage at this point and felt that no one would help me. 

I got no response for 17 hours from either therapist and then received a discharge letter from the practice today with no other explanation or regard for my crisis. Just saying I was being discharged and recommending other therapists. 

I was in legitimate crisis and their response was to ignore me and discharge me from the practice. I am aware that calling the practice/my partners therapist was inappropriate and wrong but they know I have BPD obviously and was crying for help. 

Is this horrible on my therapist/her therapist/the practice? Or is my BPD just making me overreact to this too?

Thanks in advance.

288,How do you deal with the fear that you need to isolate yourself from those you love before you hurt them?,1715801266.0,"Hi everyone. For the past few weeks I've been working with my therapist on the possibility that I might be suffering from BPD. I'm turning 38 this year and I've been struggling to figure out the cause of my pain, my relationship issues, my **severe** abandonment issues, and things like that for years, and educating myself about BPD has been very surreal as I've never before encountered a disorder that sounded so much like *me*.

But this comes with some problems.

I've been with my fiancee for almost 10 years and I love her more than I think I can adequately express. Or at least I think I do. I've been questioning a lot about how genuine my emotions are, before and after this discussion with my therapist (which isn't yet an official diagnosis but we both agree this seems to fit).

For some reason, I have never split on my fiancee. I do not feel intense jealousy about her when she hangs out with her male friends or does things without me (in fact, I often encourage her to do that because we both agree it's important that we each have our own hobbies in addition to the things we do together). I trust her, in a way that I'm not sure I understand when I read more about BPD and the ways it can interfere with romantic relationships. And this can't really be chalked up to a honeymoon period, either--we'll have been together 10 years this summer.

(Admittedly, I don't really split on other people in general. I'm not sure if that disqualifies me from a BPD diagnosis or not. The way I understand myself, my black and white thinking is more like ""I am all bad, and I assume others must be better than me, because surely it would be hard to be worse. Therefore if someone does something bad to me, I likely deserved it, because I am bad."")

But that doesn't mean I haven't been abusive. I've been horribly emotionally abusive to her (never physically--I am not a physically violent person and thankfully never have been). I use my emotions as tools to get sympathy. I subtly manipulate the stories I tell to her to get the reactions I want. I'm trying very very very hard to stop these things but, well, you all know how complicated it can be trying to separate out my real emotions from all of that. I worry that I gaslit her into being with me in the first place (I don't want to completely fill this post with this story but I was absolutely a manipulative, gaslighting monster when she was with her previous boyfriend, trying very hard to subtly break them up).

I am absolutely terrified that I will inevitably hurt her too much and lose her, and it's been hard for me not to feel like I need to remove myself from her life to avoid hurting her in a way I can't fix or take back. Again, not physically, I am not and never have been a physically violent person, but I know I can be very manipulative with my emotions and I feel **tremendous** guilt about that.

I've confessed these things to her but she doesn't believe I could ever do something like that maliciously. She seems to refuse to be angry with me for things that I feel like I really deserve to be at the very least chastised for. But she won't do it. She continues to love and support me. And I am absolutely terrified that I will ruin that and hurt someone who absolutely deserves the world.

This is more of a vent post but i really REALLY need support, or my relationship will crumble. I have been having severe mental issues for over four years and have been diagnosed with BPD around a year and a half ago and am currently getting treatment for bipolar disorder. During that time I have developed a lack of emotions and empathy. Almost 6 months ago I got together with a girl from my old school who i had a crush on for a very long time. When we started dating i finally started feeling some emotions, i felt happy, excited, warm, and loved. She has everything i ever wanted in a partner, she's very kind, loving, empathic and did everything to make me feel good. I felt like she could fix me. After about two months i started losing these feelings and fell back into that vessel-like state. I felt like i started losing interest in her and didn't feel the love anymore, even tho she dearly loved me. I still really care about her, i care about how she feels, what she's doing, what she wants, i keep worrying about her problems and I can't get her out of my head but i don't have the feeling of love. I started telling myself that it's only going to last for a short time but it's been four months and nothing has changed. For the last month I've been telling her this, that I'm starting to lose interest, that I don't feel the same way i did before. (I want to point out that communication isn't really a problem between us, we tell each other everything, how we feel, what we think. She knows about my problems to feel love and understanding it). Two days ago i completely broke down and told her that I don't love her anymore. She ran out of my house and I ran after her. She was crying all the time and I felt like I didn't even care. Later i somehow brought her back to my house so she could rest and we decided to take a break so I can figure out what i feel, and I want to be with her because I know I will never find anyone better than her and at the start i felt like she was my soulmate. 

TL:DR: I really care for her but sometimes i just can't stand being with her which doesn't make sense to me.

I often feel overwhelmed by anger and frustration, which seem to be triggered by even minor negative experiences. It feels like a suffocating cloud that makes it hard to enjoy life. For example, a simple act like a cashier being rough with an item can set off this intense anger in me. Despite my efforts to calm down, the feeling simmers all day.

This constant state of irritation feels like I'm always on edge, bracing for the next annoyance that might tip me over. It makes every small inconvenience feel like a personal attack, and I'm struggling to find joy in my daily life. I really want to change this but I'm unsure how to break this cycle. Does anyone else experience this? How do you manage it?

Reflecting on past experiences, I've faced significant challenges, like being bullied in my teens for being gay, which left deep emotional scars. I‚Äôve been let down by people I thought were friends, which only added to my distress. Despite seeking therapy, it often feels like my feelings are dismissed rather than addressed, which is frustrating.

Recently, I‚Äôve come to the realization I‚Äôve gotten attached to a new FP and I really don‚Äôt want this attachment despite the fact I enjoy this friendship dearly. I‚Äôve had a recent event where I had a nasty argument with a different friend and split off from them ( since made up ) but that FP was there for me during that rough time.

But now they‚Äôve been very close to someone else and it‚Äôs been messing with my head for a while.

I recent read alot on bpd, and felt that it relates. I dont want to self-diagnose myself. But if bpd friends can ans my question. I'll be more than happy! Just be nice to me plz :"") 

Personally im super confused with my feeling and thoughts and sometimes may not conciously notice. If you read through this, you'll realise that i mostly focus on the sensations of my body/ feelings because im so confused myself.

- The biggest giveaway for me is the fear of attachment. This one gives me a lot of pain. I soon learn this idea for someone with bpd to be called FP.
From whatever memory that i have since 13, I  always had that one person that I will think about all the time. The one person is decided based on my feels of ""this person will save me."" I know that they can because my heart beats really fast and it feels like anxiety and i will be energized but honestly, im not sure. Maybe its admiration? Or im just scared of the person. Thoughts? 

If i counted right: i have 7 of these persons till now. 
Im 17 turning 18 this year. And as it changes, the previous ones i slowly care less. But i can never forget them. And everytime I think of them, it hurts so bad. Its been 6 years since and i still feel the pain. And it didnt help that my 7th person is my therapist. Ded. Its been 2 weeks. I look at her chat everyday hoping for her to reply to my text. Its been 5 days! Im going crazy. I've been unable to sleep unless i cut myself, i ve been crying in my room and can you believe its all over waiting for a text? 

I remember lashing out at her saying these exact words. I rarely lash out at people.

""I wish i never trusted you! I care too much about and now it hurt so freaking much. This is too much i cannot. Its so hard to breathe. I hate this i hate you i wish i would just die. Im sorry im sorry im sorry. I cannot let it go. I just want to disappear""

I was crying while typing this in my room because it was the last few lessons and im just griefing. Hating. I wanted to die. 

Anyways haha im not functioning now because honestly i dont know i've been feeling like a zombie all the time and im going to kill myself. Anyways, people r gonna leave again. I dont think I devaluate these people though.

- This brings me to the part on emptiness. I personally dont know if its a subjective/ personal feeling or is it universal. But I the feels is tired and numb. Very tired and numb. Sure, i can pull out some energy. But once energy is gone. That's it. How does emptiness feel like? 


- anger, this is one that i cannot resonate with the most. Because whenever im angry, i tend to hind it within myself. However whenever I feel anger, especially to my mother the most, i will be so ANNOYED with her that i give her passive aggressive comments. But i dont know why. Its almost like if she dies i wouldnt care. I feel so much guilt saying this...

Usually to friends, i just keep it all within myself, i wouldnt lash out, because people would hate me. 

- self harm: i've been self harming everyday since my therapist left. Ofc there'll days of no self harming because im too physically tired from lack of sleep and all my school work. But im defo planning something. Average self harming.. maybe 3 times a week? But sometimes i can stop for a few weeks? 1 month? 

SI happeneds every 3-6 months. I've attempted 2 time alr

-Self-image: the things I know about myself is that I am an advocate for mental health if that is considered? Things i like include conversations with people. Things i dont like? Myself?

Is this even considered? Idk! 

- emotional instability: i think it means mood swings. Honestly I dont know what mood swings is because im not aware of the change. However, i feels like the most significant mood changes i can notice can ve that can be very depressed alone and happy when i am with people.

There's a more subtle one which i dont know if it considers. I remember that during a camp, it felt like all my group mates were againts me and hates me, because of all the dry response, the lack of interaction they give me and their judgemental eyes. And the fact made me spiral down and down and down until it felt like it was too demoralizing. I think what happened after that was i gotten very quiet. And the best thing i could describe or visualise that moment was that my heart had a sour pain and  my ears start to have the sound of those flat lines you see in the hospital when the heart is not pumping.  Can i go from my chronic feeling of emptiness to dispair and call that mood swings? 

There's another one called dissociation and paranoia, im still knew to this but im becoming more concious of it. I remember the first time when i was super cautious about dissociation was during my lasy therapy session, i remember what she said or asked but i suddenly stop thinking and feeling, like i cant remember what my therapist asks me.  And even if i think long, im not able to think through and so i gave some random answer. As for paranoia, im not quite sure, is it the same as anxiety. As for me the closest i can think of is that i feel like something is wrong with me and something bad is surely gonna happen to me. I dont feel safe. 

Yep, so far this is it. Im not going to diagnose myself but maybe if bpd friends here resonates, im going to find my psychiatrist. Thought thoughts ! Thank you.

318,F28 can't stop wishing my high school ex would talk to me again,1715797262.0,"I self sabotaged this relationship a few years ago, and then I got into a near death situation and came out the other side with so much clarity that I completely changed my whole life. One of those realizations was how supportive and kind this ex was, and how few people I've met that were so lovely to me even through all my drama and the crap my family put us through. I know I've fixated on this relationship and I have a few theories as to why, but it's been over a decade since we were actually together and a few years since we last spoke. 

He was my first boyfriend, he was always open to communicating even after we broke up, and even still years later when I came at him with toxic energy. I was in a fucked up place when I ran into him and burned that bridge with a lie I knew he would never forgive. Post near death experience, I've been worried about running into him again and how he might look at me or avoid me because of the lie I told to keep me away from reconnecting with him ever again. 

I'm currently in a very supportive relationship and it pains me that I spend so much time thinking about this person I don't even know anymore like my current partner isn't good enough.

I tried to craft a message to this ex to apologize and contextualize what I said in hopes of regaining the friendship but I retrospectively should have spent even more time crafting that message before I sent it. I will never know if he read it and is ignoring me or has just not read it yet. And honestly, I don't know if I would respond if I were him. I've done too much.

321,What medication have you found most beneficial for your bpd?,1715792035.0,"Hi there, I‚Äôm a 25yo female who got diagnosed with bpd recently. Last year I went through a super traumatic event that included a lot of abandonment. At first I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ptsd, however after seeing a psychiatrist earlier this year he diagnosed me with bpd as well. 
I‚Äôm currently on sertraline (max dose), Clonazepam and co quetiapine. I use the sertraline mainly for my depression, and I‚Äôve found that it saved my life last year (mainly by making me feel numb lol). The Clonazepam has helped me with anxiety attacks and more recently, bpd episodes. The quetiapine I use for sleep, as I can‚Äôt fall asleep naturally. Honestly this cocktail of medication is working okay, I just wanted some advice on what other medications work for others, especially bpd episodes since im a bit new to this. I know everything works differently for everyone, just wanted some insight from others. 
I‚Äôll also add that I do see a therapist, however that‚Äôs an ongoing process (like everything mentally is).

323,i‚Äôm worried i‚Äôm faking my diagnosis ,1715796788.0,"this also falls under the advice flair but i wasn‚Äôt sure which one to put.

so for some context i (18f), have suspected that i have bpd since 2021. i was diagnosed by my psychiatrist in march of this year. 

my fear comes from the severity of my symptoms. i meet all of the criteria and they do genuinely disrupt my daily life, but sometimes i wonder if i was diagnosed correctly because the symptoms i do have aren‚Äôt as intense, i suppose, as other people with bpd. 

it also seems as if they‚Äôve become more apparent too recently. i understand that as you get older, more symptoms will sometimes start to appear but if feels like it‚Äôs happened too quickly for me to have not manifested them. 

i‚Äôm just worried that i don‚Äôt meet the criteria as strongly as i need to for the diagnosis to be valid. i have problems with impulsivity that come from needing a dramatic, immediate change but it‚Äôs more like cutting bangs and dyeing strips of my hair rather than my whole head and doing something drastic, etc. but the impulsive behavior i have is out of the norm. i‚Äôm pretty straight-laced which is why it‚Äôs so extreme for me. 

the other thing is that i feel like because i haven‚Äôt attempted, my diagnosis doesn‚Äôt count. i‚Äôve had recurrent thoughts of suicide since 5th grade, to the point that they‚Äôre just always there like a voice in the back of my head. but i don‚Äôt know what comes after this and that‚Äôs why i haven‚Äôt done it.

during new years, i was abroad visiting family so i wasn‚Äôt able to talk to my friends or boyfriend as much, especially because of time zones. because of that, my best friend and my boyfriend started talking and spending more time together on games. i didn‚Äôt have a problem with this at all as i trusted both my friend and my boyfriend. this is relevant, please just bare with me.

once i got back, i met up with my best friend to catch up. my best friend started going on about how they (my boyfriend and best friend) had a conversation about their sexual preferences while i was away and i honestly didn‚Äôt really care much. i know this may be weird to some people, but the reason i didn‚Äôt care was because my best friend is a gay man and my boyfriend is straight, so it wasn‚Äôt like there were any suspicious feelings involved. 

at some point my friend told me he knew something about me i never told him and part of me genuinely knew exactly what he was talking about and my heart sunk. i gave them the benefit of the doubt and asked what it was, and it turns out my boyfriend told him about the things i thought he would never tell anyone. 

i genuinely feel like my soul was crushed. it‚Äôs been months and i still think about it. i can‚Äôt get over it and as much as i love my boyfriend, i just can‚Äôt ever get the fact that he betrayed my trust like that. he knew how deep and personal what he told my friend was to me and he hurt me so fucking bad. he apologised multiple times and has told me repeatedly that he wishes he could take it all back but no amount of apology is going to take away what he said. 

i‚Äôm so scared and i‚Äôm so upset because i let my guard down. i love this man so much and i feel like such an idiot for every trusting anyone with my sexuality. i feel disgusting and ashamed and i don‚Äôt know what to do. i desperately want to move on but i don‚Äôt know how. if anyone has any advice on what i could do please share it with my because it genuinely feels like im falling apart every time i think about it.

i‚Äôm really losing hope for life. i told myself i wasn‚Äôt making it to 16 then 18 then 21, 30‚Ä¶ now i have a little sister who needs me more than anything and a fiance who would be devastated if i left.

i have no money, don‚Äôt have kids because im terrified of child birth, struggling to find something to eat by the time i go to sleep at night. i live in a mostly safe environment- a mental health rehabilitation program with my fiance who never leaves my side. i only say mostly because some effed up shit has happened to me in this program‚Ä¶ 

can‚Äôt get someone to hire me, constant triggers, wrong therapy methods but can‚Äôt afford a good therapist, never traveled outside my area, can‚Äôt make friends even though my fiance is really trying his best to get me good friends but everyone is strung out where i am and deceiving.

i had a BPD episode that lasted a few days leading up to a meltdown today. 

i looked at my fiance and asked ‚Äúif life doesn‚Äôt get any better, can i ‚Äî‚Äî myself when i‚Äôm 40?‚Äù and i think he almost cried when he laid his head in my lap. 

it would give my siblings time to grow up and hopefully gain independence.

i know this is selfish which is why i want to ask- does life with BPD get better or is this it? is there any success or is it just relapse after relapse? 

i don‚Äôt want to leave anybody behind and i don‚Äôt want my siblings to go through that pain but i can‚Äôt stand it here. my only wish is to travel and i‚Äôve never been outside of the city also have no money. that‚Äôs all i want. i feel like it would be therapeutic and make me see the beauty in life.

all i see in the city is addiction on every street and so many people suffering and just looking like they‚Äôre at the end of their life even when they‚Äôre not showing any gray in their hair. 

but like‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt see traveling ever happening. i don‚Äôt see a future job. really, can i have a good life with BPD? can i handle marriage? or is this it? 

edit: hey, thank you everyone for the amazing support. i‚Äôve never gotten this kind of support or this amount of understanding for my BPD. i hope everyone can continue doing well.

333,Does this sound similar to bpd?,1715793373.0,"
Awhile back i made a post about a situation with my friend and a couple commenter's said it sounded similar to the way someone with bpd acts. 

I was wondering what you all thought? 

I know she can't be diagnosed over the internet. I just love her a lot and I'm so confused by her behavior I guess im searching for any reason to make sense of the situation. 

............................................

Awhile back my friend told me her therapist said shes avoidant. I'm not sure if it's more dismissive or fearful but my guess is fearful.

We've always had a slightly tumultuous relationship. & learning she's avoidant made past things make sense. Ive known her for 10+ yrs, both girls. Sometimes we're so close & she's always called me her soul mate. Then (what feels like) out of no where she'll shut down or get distant. Ive learned to give her space after a lot of trial & error. & I especially know now that ive learned some about avoidant attachment. 

Anyways she's getting married this year & I'm not sure if she wants me there or just in her feelings or what. I want to support her but am very confused. 

A yearish ago she sat me down & semi friend broke up with me saying I make her feel guilty/she doesn't feel like she makes me happy etc. That I didn't have to answer now but to think about if we really make each other happy. 

Then she went on a trip with her bf/family, got proposed to, accepted & when she got back asked me to pick them up from the airport. I was surprised but figured this was her quirky way of waving the white flag. 

Things seemed okay between us & then she comes over to hang out one day & is in her feelings wanting drink. She ends up clinging to me, crying, telling me she doesn't want to marry her fiance, doesn't want to lose their friends/family if they break up, tells me I'm her soul mate/best friend & feels safe with me. During this time she mentions the avoidant therapy thing. 

The following few months, when we meet up she's telling me all the reasons she doesn't want to marry him but also they're in couples therapy etc. Etc. I just listen giving her a space to vent no opinions. 

Then I don't see her for a couple months & when I do she's in full wedding planning mode. Again I'm a little surprised & mention something like I'm glad they've worked things out. She just laughs, says what do you mean we were ways getting married everything's great. Like nothing ever happened. I just say congratulations & leave it at that. She asks me to be a bridesmaid, I say of course. 

We go on a couple group trips my fiance & her & her fiance + some of their friends. 
& I can tell after the 2nd one she was withdrawing from me. So I didn't reach out to her for awhile til she did me. We hang a couple times, I thought things were OK. the 3rd time we hang out. We get into a bit of an argument. 

She's grilling me about when I'm going to get married/details & I'm trying to tell her i have no details to give her & were not moving at the same pace as her & her guy. 

Then she tells me again that I still make her feel guilty & doesn't enjoy when we hang out anymore. But loves me & wants me in her wedding. I'm very confused. 

Now I can't help but wonder if I'm just in the wedding party cause she feels guilty/obligated. 

At the same time I'm trying to remember that she feels guilty alot. She vented to me about how her fiance & different members of her family make her feel guilty. She feels guilty if she doesn't complete a to do list etc. 

So i guess im wondering if this seems like her going through something avoidant related & I should wait it out/give space. 

Or if she means what she says, I make her feel guilty & truly doesn't want to be around me anymore. I feel confused & like I shouldn't be in her wedding in that case. 

........................................ 

So that's the current situation.  
Not mentioned in the story is I know she's always struggled with anxiety, depression, ocd, insomnia/night terrors. She's always had a weird tendency to run away (figuratively & literally) when upset/overwhelmed with emotions. At the same time she is one of the most intelligent/accomplished people I know. She's a perfectionist and sets and accomplishes goals in a way ive always admired. ",fiddlefaddling,,False,1csq77w,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1csq77w/does_this_sound_similar_to_bpd/

Over the past six months I have become very close with a person who has untreated BPD and became their FP. Recently this person treated me in some very hurtful ways because of their BPD, and I had to establish the boundary that our friendship would need to be paused until they received treatment for their BPD. We left things on relatively good terms ‚Äì though they said they are not currently, and may never, be able or ready to receive treatment, we hashed some things out, let each other know we still care about one another, will miss each other, and wish each other the best.  
  
While I understand this person may never receive treatment and that our friendship may be over, I want to be as prepared as possible for (should it ever come) the day they tell me they‚Äôve began treatment and would like to reconnect. I am committed to making the friendship work, being a support for them through the good (which has been some of the most fulfilling friendship I have ever experienced) and the bad, and doing what I can to ensure our friendship is healthy for the both of us. I‚Äôve bought a few books that I‚Äôve started reading, have been lurking on this sub for a while, and have searched online for more resources.

We have had conversation about this problem many times and I know certain things would make me feel less distant from her , I have identified these things from observation.


So a few days ago she went away for some work , it's temporary stay and I started feeling very aloof from her . I couldn't feel like I was worth anything to her and so I started withdrawing . Today I texted and asked her that maybe it would help if she said certain reassuring things but she says she feels burdened because I don't improve and instead just tell her to make me feel good . 

I don't agree infact I felt insulted and hurt beyond limit . I am not someone who asks for help forget being vulnerable and I had thought since we talked about this and she agreed that she will do her best it was okay to directly ask her for help . I don't know what I did wrong and I feel horrible for opening up .

I feel like I just asked for some reassurance because for the past few days our chat was silent as she doesn't like to text people if they aren't talking to her themselves. I thought it was selfish of her to think that way when I shamelessly opened up about my falws and told her exactly how I feel , why I feel and how I would need her help and despite that she didn't say or text anything reassuring but just did exact opposite.

I communicated my needs and I was told to just improve if I am aware of the problem instead of burdening her by asking for these things. Am I in the wrong ? 

Also I am not going to stay like this forever, I don't mean to say that I won't help myself so it's her responsibility to do so but I feel isn't it basic to cheer up your partner if they need help and communicated so .

364,Losing My Dog and Best Friend,1715778704.0,"Back story: I am a single 38m that's been homeless for the last seven months with my dog. We have been staying in motel rooms and my car with a little help from friends here and there. I have no family to lean on because of the abuse I went through. I do have a full-time job but it doesn't pay enough with the cost of living here in this city.

My dog has been my companion for the last 5 years. He sleeps with me at night. We play together outside. He's been a support for me when I have feelings of being abandoned and unloved. When I take care of him, I have the drive to take care of myself. 

Despite all these benefits my dog offers me, I am unable to get him registered as an emotional support animal (ESA). (I have done EXTENSIVE research on this and pursued this option with several licensed clinicians.)

I was only officially diagnosed with GAD about seven years ago. But I am convinced I was wrongly diagnosed. I took a personality test back in March and I am STILL waiting on my therapist to finish her report and discuss the results. I highly suspect I have BPD and ADHD, which would explain many of the difficulties I am having.

Last Sunday, my money dried up and I had to move out of the motel room we've been staying in. I've been in my car the last three days, been unable to go to work, and all because I still have my dog.

How is my dog keeping me from going to work? Let me explain. My dog, a boxer mix, needs a safe place to stay for 10 hours a day. It is against company policy to leave him in my car in their parking lot while I go inside. Even if I peridoically check on him and give him plenty of water, leaving him in a hot car is very dangerous. So this is not an option.

Why don't I get a friend to watch him during the day? I have reached out to multiple people over a span of several months. No one has the means to take care of him while I go to work. He doesn't require much care; just give him a fenced in plot of land and he'll run around all day. But, still,no one is able to or willing to help me.

Why not surrender or rehome him? I've been fighting this option for as long as I could. The moment I finally decided to give him up is also the moment I learned no one will take him. Animal shelters and the Humane Association are full. Additionally, they only accept surrenders from local residents. They determine this ONLY by either my car registration or my driver's license. Because I do not have a permanent address and what is listed on them is from another state (U.S.), they will not take him. I have also posted online for help and rehoming. No luck there either.

The moment I am forever apart from my dog is the same moment I'm admitting myself to a hospital and that would be a minimum 72 hour visit. But the pain of being forced to abandon my best friend is unbearable. Why am I forced to cause him to suffer so I can continue to live? It doesn't seem fair. He is not a bad dog in any way. But no one will take him and give him a good home. And as much as I have tried, I can't take care of him anymore.

I don‚Äôt make any advances with these people that I picture myself with, because I know it is not rational and not okay to flirt with everyone I have these feelings for. It just confuses me so much as to why this happens.

She was pretty pushy in the beginning about wanting to meet, wanting to date and was really in to me. After a while I finally gave in and said we could meet. She I'd a college student and also works so she's busy and I understood that.

She has 1 year of college left and she said after that she wanted to move and would move to be with me if everything worked out. I had a lot of skepticism but she kept assuring me it's what she wanted and it would be okay.

About 2 weeks ago we had a misunderstanding about our level of communication and she freaked out and told me she didn't want to talk to me anymore and blocked me everywhere. About an hour later she unblocked me and told me she over reacted and was sorry. We talked it out and she assured me everything was okay. We agreed to meet in person, picked a future date and I bought a plane ticket. 

The past 2 weeks she has been extremely busy with finals so we haven't gotten to talk much. I've been really supportive and patient with her. She kept apologizing for not being able to talk much, and I kept assuring her it wsd okay and I understood. She kept telling me that as soon as this semester was over she would dedicate more time to me.

Monday was her final exams. Monday night we texted a good bit and everything seemed good. We talked about our future and everything. Yesterday we didn't text much, she said she slept most of the morning then had to go to a meeting for her research project. Then I heard absolutely nothing from her for like 10 hours, which was not usual.

Early this morning she texts me to tell me we need to cut all contact, that with everything going on in her life she can't make time for me and it's not fair to me, and that I've been great and did nothing wrong. Just days ago she told me how serious she was about me.

Hi!
I, 29/F, recently got diagnosed with EUPD and Anxious avoidant PD and currently on mood stabilizers and therapy. My psychiatrist is also suspecting that I also present symptoms of ADHD but that verdict is currently on hold.
I felt like a wave of relief washed over me as I finally knew the answers to my lifelong troubling symptoms, which hampered both my personal as well as professional relationships. I found a new hope to finally work on myself to make things better.
But when I shared this information with my SO (hoping he would be understanding), his reaction hurt me immensely. He quite coldly responded that I can't play the 'oh I have a fancy disorder sympathy card' as an excuse for my mood swings, impulsivity, poor self image and pessimism. And not being able to concentrate on work, hobby hopping and forgetting to do chores are just due to laziness and lack of accountability (followed by a condecending chuckle). Now he is not talkting to me and acting all cold and detached. He also tried to break things off but I begged him not to out of guilt. I don't know why I'm feeling guilty.

377,Are my main BPD struggles anyone else's struggles too?,1715757714.0,"***very long read so strap in babes***

I do not know anyone personally who has BPD or any mood/personality disorders, so I often don't get a chance to explain my struggles to someone who has personal experience with them or something similar. 

Because of this I feel so stupid and small and inadequate like ""am I just that high maintenance?"". I feel crazy when trying to explain to someone, w/o bpd or any experience with it, how my episodes don't reflect who I truly am.

So with that, here are my most debilitating bpd struggles:

--I am SO hypersensitive to any real or perceived criticism or microexpression. I could tell myself over and over again about how my worries are not based in fact and I will still believe someone hates me. I have gotten way too good at reading body language and adjusting what I say accordingly bc of this. It's very exhausting, and trying to explain myself just sounds like I'm fake and manipulative

-it physically hurts when I'm in a sadness episode. Not even just the headache I get after, but my chest hurts and I feel sick. My emotions are on a tightrope and any nudge either direction sends me plummeting. For example, today's events. I am in beauty school and it is crunch time to study for the state tests. I walked in and was immediately confused and couldn't figure out how to set up my kit. It was loud and eventually I gave up and couldn't hold my tears in anymore. I cried in the school bathroom for nearly 2 hours. I have no control over my big feelings


-in my day to day life, I am alone in the sense that no one will truly understand the mental anguish I have 24/7 and I worry about how people think about me because of it. I'm so scared that everyone in my life just secretly hates me bc they hear/see me and think I'm a monster. It feels like one day everyone will leave 

-everyone overestimates me in my ability to function ""normally"". Being told to just think the opposite of my fears and me sitting there not having the energy to explain how it's not that easy and how it will never be (for the foreseeable future). And ofc this files into my anxiety about how people see me

-I worry I stress people out with my emotional baggage

-I still live in the house I have for my whole life, but I never feel safe or home. All I see is how much remodeling has taken away everything that stuck out most growing up. The hole in the bedroom door that was there when we bought it has been replace with a brand new door. My entire bathroom went from being straight out of the 90s to fancy tile floors and a glass shower. The TV that used to sit on a small cabinet for forever is now mounted on the wall, and I keep begging my mom to let me keep it for when I move out. 

-^^^side note about this last one. I am incredibly sentimental and attached to a lot of things that I have. Not in a material/monetary sense, but in the sense that these things hold so many memories in them, especially my baby blanket and my childhood stuffies. One of my greatest fears is my house burning down and all of those things going with it. Along with this I mourn and cry over my childhood that was just perfectly normal and a healthy upbringing. I feel guilty bc I have nothing to mourne in theory, but on the inside I can't deal with the fact that I am supposed to now navigate a messed up world in my 20s. 

I also have noticed that sometimes I have age regression and need help doing mundane things like opening packages.



Tldr, I feel like a freak and that everyone hates me and can't find a way to rip off the bandaid and leave. I feel really sad about all of these things all the time, but I'm lucky to have a wonderful and supportive partner.

>PD-TS w t/o HPD, NPD, BPD, DPD, AvPD and OCPD (in order of severity with HPD, NPD and possibly BPD being full disorders)

to

>NPD & BPD w t/o HPD and OCPD

AvPD traits were better explained by NPD and HPD (inability to regulate self-esteem internally). 

No explanation as to why the DPD traits r gone. Probably better explained by BPD? 

I have worked hard on myself and this is visible in the dimished HPD symptoms as that went from my worst cluster B to only traits! 

I'm very happy I finally have a ""full"" BPD diagnosis as it is more validating than traits to me, and fits my experience better.

I also had the preexisting diagnoses:

>PTSD (in remission) 

>PTSD under 6y/o (replacement diagnosis for C-PTSD as we go by DSM) 

>Alcohol use disorder (in remission) 

>Drug induced manic episode (very speculated, some agreed some didn't. either way, inactive)

>ADHD predominantly inattentive type

and now with the wonderful addition of:

>GAD

I've been waiting on that anxiety disorder diagnosis, I've been struggling with it all my life and at least now I can pick my anxiety meds up without paying for them.

I feel like this is a good moment to stand still and look at my progress (diminished HPD, addiction and PTSD in remission) and have hope for treatment that is to come.

I find that preventing myself from getting angry at online competitive games is almost impossible. I‚Äôve been trying to play a few more competitive games, and across the board I get so so so angry when anything doesn‚Äôt go my way. Sometimes in chivalry 2 I run in and die 3 times in a row without killing anyone and I start spiraling and get so angry I‚Äôm tempted to break my laptop and it pretty much ruins the whole day most times.

Sometimes I do hurt myself from anger, I punch myself a lot, and I can‚Äôt play with anything sharp near me. It gets 20x worse when they shit talk or T bag or anything like that.

I still want to play them though, I know the obvious answer we is just to stop playing but I‚Äôm hoping for method of controlling myself and limiting frustration that also still let me play competetive games, because I still really like them and I don‚Äôt want to let this control my life by ruining everything I enjoy on top of 98% of things I don‚Äôt enjoy.

Anyway, this one time we were hanging out they were very touchy, and they held hands in front of me. I was very upset by this and my SO didnt understand why until like a day later. They still play games with their friend and everything. After a few incidences of hanging out and the light touching and everything still happening I confronted their friend and had told them how I felt. A day later, out of my presence, the two made a joke at my expense about me expressing my concerns and wanting to put up boundaries. Yesterday they were playing games together and i overheard a slight inappropriate comment. I looked over at them and they told me it wasnt toward their friend. We talked today and they had told me it upsets them that they have to watch what they say around their friend as to not upset me. And it hurts that I feel like Im keeping them from their friend, but at the same time I feel like its wrong that they'd want to do those things with a friend when theyre dating me.

Could I just go to a clinic and mention I want to talk to a psychiatrist and get assessed? I don't want to self-diagnose but I'm very sure I have BPD. But then again, it could be comorbid with something else and I'm just not sure. 

I moved here from a smaller town and I have a family doctor there but everytime I go to him he's either 1. prescribed me medication that did more harm than good (75mg of Zoloft that caused terrible anxiety and I was also passing out a lot) or 2. dismissed what I was feeling for the most part. This is why I'm trying to avoid going to him until there's no other option.

The thing is I have feelings for him. I keep picturing how it would be Ike to kiss him. Getting closer with him. I got him a job where I work at so he can save up to move. I even plan on moving with him so I can leave my hometown with him. (Which is probably a bad idea) But every time I work with him I go crazy I can‚Äôt stand it. It‚Äôs like all my emotions are all bundle up in one. Especially when he talks to other people I get super jealous. Especially this one girl he now considers a close fiend too. I feel like she‚Äôs going to replace me. I tell him I don‚Äôt like her because she talks crap but it actually because I‚Äôm jealous. She‚Äôs having a baby and he told me she invited him over when the baby is born and he told me he‚Äôs excited about it. I was so mad. But didn‚Äôt say anything of course because that‚Äôs his friend I shouldn‚Äôt be angry but I am! He talks about guys and girls. How hot this and that girl is. How pretty. How sweet. It makes me mad!

401,How do you trust love again?,1715748735.0,"I am at a hopeless rock bottom right now and it isn't making any sense to anyone, so I am going to try here. It is going to be a long one, so please bare with me.

I grew up in a family where love was limited and conditional, for myself and between my parents. I had watched my parents beg each other for the minimal respect, change, and genuine love. I had too begged for those things from them, in which I eventually developed this disorder.

I have struggled with the obsession of love/true love/soulmates my entire life. I have had countless favorite people, in which I would have given ANYTHING to be reciprocated the kind of love I was willing to give. 

And in all of these endeavors, I acknowledged I do not love correctly. I realized this when I got out of my first relationship when I was 18. I have dedicated the last few years to unlearning these things. I still struggle with the want to control, the games I want to play, the general pull and push. I have been trying.  

I have acknowledged that what I envisioned love in my head is wrong. Love isn't the constant fight for reassurance or the constant proving myself as worthy. It isn't the begging, fighting, or the challenge. 

I have told myself for years, love is in the little things. Love is learning a song on the guitar cause they would love it, memorizing their order so you can surprise them, or bringing a jacket cause you know they would forget one. Love is the small laughs over inside jokes, the loud laughs over little fails, and the shared memories that were created on accident. 

Love was supposed to be in the little things.

But over the last few months, I have been shown a dark side of it. 

I was on a work trip. 

One of my supervisors gave long speeches at dinner about his fianc√© and how their wedding in June is going to be the best day of his life. That same night, we went out for a few drinks. He proceeded to send a few other girls and I messages about ""spending the night with him."" He went on the next day like it was a usual occurrence for him.

I was utterly disgusted. My gut sat in my stomach for days. 

Another one of my supervisors on this trip did something some what similar. He is ""happily"" married to his wife of 17 years with young daughters.  But as happy as this man is at home, he hit on every waitress, took up countless numbers, and would disappear for days at a time. 

Again I was disgusted. I could've easily said this was the work of nasty people, but it got worse...

Once again, on this trip... one of my dear friends/coworker spoke about his plans to propose to his 5 year girlfriend. We were all beyond happy for him. But within the night, he made a closer relationship with another one of our close friends. He started confiding in her of his doubts, how he is not happy, and he doesn't know what else to do, but marry her anyway. He then dedicated the rest of this two week long work trip to his new found interest in his friend. He gave her a sweet little nick name, held her hand, and walked her to and from everywhere they went.

I was very dumbfounded by this information. I was under the impression that they were happy at home and that they had found something people prayed for, but I was wrong.

When I returned home, I received some also unsettling news.

One of my best friends found out she was pregnant by her boyfriend (who is a very very close friend of mine as well). I have known her boyfriend and his family for 10 years, they have been incredible and wonderful people to me and everyone I know. So for the last 7 months, I have watched them prepare for this baby. They are building a house  together along with a life and family. She was so excited. But as of last week, she informed me of him entertaining random women online. She said he described it as a thing that didn't happen before and he did not know who she was.

But Saturday, her and I sat down and talked a lot about it. Turns out, he lied again. He had been seeing these women their ENTIRE relationship. They are having a baby and he is out there with ""random women"" who he has been seeing for years.

I thought I knew him better, but I am incredibly disappointed. This particular event has triggered me beyond belief. I had watched them do my healthier version of love for a long time, only to find out it was one sided.

I began to look at all the long term relationships that have been shown to me in my life. My parents, never have been happy. My aunt and uncle who have been together since they were 14, have one conversation a day about the coffee machine. My friends from high school, who went literal years of break ups and cheating to now hitting 6 years. My friends parents, who have cheated divorced and remarried several times. My other friends parents, who have been on the verge of divorce over small things several times. And now all of these...

I struggle with what is real and what is not. I struggle with trust, intimacy, and connection. But I have been trying to get better with the hope that one day I can be good to someone and they be good to me. I have never cared about money, a nice car, nor a large house. I want to love and be loved and raise a happy family in the healthiest way I can. All in the hopes that i can experience love in the little things, like how I imagined real love to look.

Now I don't know what love looks like. All of my ideas have been disproven. My dreams have been crushed. I am fighting the urge to recluse and regress in all of my efforts in vulnerability, but I am distraught.

I feel like love romantic love is not real anymore. 

I am honestly taking this more towards men than women, because of my sexual orientation and just from personal trauma, but I know that I am not supposed to do that. 

I am turning away from a connection I have been trying hard to sustain and be healthy in, all because I am triggered by the actions of other men, my fears, and my new found hopelessness in love.

And everyone I talk to says this quote I have heard a million times, ""I know love exists because of the love I give."" I understand that love is real, logically, but i want to experience it. I want to know what it feels like to love and be loved, equally and truly. 

But is the pain and dishonesty truly worth it? Is it something I would have to put up with to experience long term? 

How do I even begin to when given this example of modern day ""commitment."" 

What do I do? Before I ruin the connection I am building. How do I let go of the fear of being hurt so I can learn to love?",kekersmoke,,False,1cscrek,19,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cscrek/how_do_you_trust_love_again/

We were together 4 years and I broke up with him in January for valid reasons (drinking, anger issues, jealousy). Since then it was even worse and I had to block him almost everywhere and even that didnt help because then he continued the pressure even with emails. He was also threathening me that he will hurt or worse himself and it will be my fault, he was blaming me to be hearthless and selfish and on and on. So after threaths I stepped back and unblocked him only on facebook. I am also still contributing for rent even though living elsewhere, because he refuses to move to smaller affordable apartment.

Long story short, my ex didnt change at all. Time and me repeating and explaining the same that I have no interest in coming back didnt help at all. I really cannot continue to hold him above water... I can barely hold myself and my work.

403,what does paranoia/delusions look like for you?,1715747921.0,"So, I didn‚Äôt really think I experienced paranoia until recently. It definitely got worse after I had my baby to the point that I had to put a name to it. Turns out, after reading about it, I‚Äôve been experiencing paranoia to some degree for almost as long as I can remember. Here‚Äôs what it looks like for me:

‚Äîfeeling like someone is potentially watching me all the time, even if I do know that rationally this is not likely at all

‚Äîpassing thoughts that there‚Äôs a camera in the exhaust fan in the bathroom, or a drone taking footage through the window. Sometimes this will prompt me to go put on pants if I‚Äôm in my underwear or something ‚Äújust in case‚Äù. I get this exponentially more out in public. As if everyone is staring at me, or if I can‚Äôt see anyone they‚Äôre staring at me from windows, parked cars, cameras. 

‚Äîbecoming somewhat ‚Äúperformative‚Äù in my mundane actions when I‚Äôm completely alone, because I feel as if I‚Äôm being watched and I need to make sure to do things ‚Äúproperly‚Äù so that They(??) can see I‚Äôm doing things the right way 

‚Äîsudden intrusive thoughts about myself, my husband, or my baby getting grievously injured because of some horrible accident, this makes me so anxious sometimes for days at a time that I can‚Äôt stop seeing imminent danger literally everywhere I look. I‚Äôll refuse to leave the house during these times and I‚Äôll refuse to let my husband hold my (our!!) baby sometimes because I‚Äôm that paranoid something final destination will happen. Sometimes I‚Äôm convinced the floor WILL cave in any moment. Gotta touch the gas stove burner switches to make sure they‚Äôre off if I think about them even if it‚Äôs the middle of the night. My husband hates it, he feels me get out of bed and he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúTHEYRE OFF. STOP IT‚Äù so I lie and say I have to pee so I can check anyway 

‚Äîif I hear people laugh out in public, I‚Äôm sometimes convinced they‚Äôre laughing at me even when I know on some level they aren‚Äôt even aware of my existence 

‚ÄîI think the neighbors in the building are listening to the sounds I‚Äôm making in the kitchen or by walking around , and that they can tell what I‚Äôm doing inside my apartment by hearing through the floor 

‚ÄîI have STRONG paranoia that when I take my baby to the doctor, they‚Äôre giving her drugs to slowly make her terminally ill, and they‚Äôre doing it only to MY baby. It‚Äôs so fleeting and it does pass, but in the moment it‚Äôs so strong it almost feels totally real. Like it really worries me about myself. That level of paranoia wasn‚Äôt a thing for me before I had my baby. 

There‚Äôs other instances, but this is too long already. Also, I am almost always aware at the same time that it‚Äôs not real, yet I can‚Äôt stop having the thoughts and feelings. It‚Äôs almost like part of me really does believe it, and sometimes it feels like the rational voice is the delusional liar‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm scared of how paranoid I‚Äôve become.

405,Obsessive and unwarranted hatred,1715746556.0,"I find that when I randomly split on someone (for no particular reason) I become angry to an insanely unreasonable degree. I'm not talking about the reactive kind of anger that drives my impulsive reactions to conflict and is caused by my lack of emotional regulation, I'm referring to a simmering anger that's more long-term and less explosive, and is often caused by nothing at all. I just start to absolutely despise people practically overnight. Every single thing that the person does sends me into a rage, no matter how minor it actually is. The hatred lasts months, and has even lasted years in some cases. Sometimes I feel a very strong urge to hurt the person, though I'm confident that I can control these urges, thankfully.

For example, I currently despise my former FP, despite the fact that nothing's changed in her behaviour. She's always treated me slightly poorly, but I never really minded, and have distanced myself from her anyways, so her behaviour no longer affects me. That said, every time she posts on social media, or sends me a text, or does ANYTHING, I am filled with rage. Like, today she posted a random photo of herself on her story and I instantly felt a sense of all-consuming disgust and anger just by looking at her. Honestly, she could literally post a picture of a wall and I'd still find a way to get angry about it. Even the mention of her name pisses me off. Idrk how to describe it honestly, she just can't do anything right in my eyes at the moment, and I genuinely think I might need to block her for the sake of my own sanity.

For the next few years she would say she wanted me and had made a big mistake, and then date another guy.  Eventually, I got really angry about her saying one thing and doing another and blocked her on everything.  But the ruminations haven't gotten better and my illness has gotten pretty crippling.

So to today.  I had to cancel my DBT therapy because money is bad.  I feel awful and hopeless about getting better.  That led to me somehow decide it was a good idea to unblock her and look at her pictures.  That was like taking a hit of a drug.  Her eyes brought me back to the good memories but then to the intense hurt, betrayal, abandonment, lies.  My stomach is aching.

I tried some radical acceptance.  I guess that snapped me out of the urge to write her a message.  That got me out of the memories for the moment.  I tried to think about this brokenness and emptiness that I feel each day.  And I sorta realized that when her and I were together, that was the last time I had a big distraction from the pain.

414,Do I tell my sister that our dad is dying?,1715740908.0,"I‚Äôve tried to keep this brief, advice needed:


My dad disowned my sister. For her BPD. When I objected to my dad, he looked me in the eye and said he was incapable of loving her as she is. So I looked him back in the eye and said ‚Äòthat‚Äôs monstrous. if you want a relationship with me, you have to have one with her‚Äô
And that was the last time I saw him. I would text on his birthday and New Year‚Äôs Day.


That was my choice. As horrible as no contact with my dad is for me, it‚Äôs been absolutely devastating to my poor sister, who did not choose to never speak to him again. His treatment of her is the source of so many hurts.


It‚Äôs been nearly 15 years since that happened. Yesterday, dad‚Äôs girlfriend texted me: my dad has had a stroke and a cancer diagnosis and there isn‚Äôt much time left, will you come see him?


I know they won‚Äôt tell my sister.  My dilemma is, do I tell her now or do I wait until he‚Äôs dead. 


I think the good, moral, correct, fair thing is to tell her right now and give her the opportunity to see him one last time. But I know it will be Devastating. And she‚Äôs been doing so well lately, she even has a promotion interview on Thursday. 


Has anyone been through something similar? Do I lie or do I upend her life?

421,How to cope with separation from fp and the sudden stop from taking any medication (very venty but heavily seeking any sort of advice or support ,1715727723.0,"Posting on a throw away bc paranoia

Me (M19) and my Fp (M20) have been in a serious romantic relationship for quite a while, we both have bpd and he‚Äôs being evaluated for possible schizophrenia, we‚Äôve both been open about our mental health and since the beginning, we‚Äôve been open about our mutual fps on each other and due to it, our separation anxiety. Due to recent events which I won‚Äôt go into specifics to in attempts to keep this post as short as possible, my Fp was sent to the psychward for about a week or so, he had to give up his phone just about two hours ago and I‚Äôve been at a total loss, I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself and I can‚Äôt stop crying, I don‚Äôt know how he is, how he‚Äôs doing, what he‚Äôs doing, nothing. We are long distance due to college starting in a few months so I cannot visit him, he wrote down my number before they drove him to facility so he wouldn‚Äôt forget it but it‚Äôs likely they won‚Äôt let him call me anytime soon. I‚Äôm in contact with his mom but our conversations have been limited and I am at a total loss.

I‚Äôve tried distracting myself but there‚Äôs nothing i can do, i have no friends to rely on, I have no enjoyment for anything anymore, watching videos and playing games leave me with nothing, I feel a sense of emptiness so deep that it‚Äôs crippling, I don‚Äôt know what to do. He‚Äôs my support system, he‚Äôs my everything and without him I have nothing and I am nothing, I have awful thoughts and memories that I try to fend away but i cannot, nothing helps and I‚Äôm hurting. I am an artist, I have art I owe that I must work on but I can‚Äôt get myself to do anything, my hands are hurting, I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt think or I think too much, I still can‚Äôt tell.

The worst part of it all is that I was forced to stop taking my medication suddenly after taking it consistently everyday since April. For some context, i started having an allergic reaction yesterday, mainly just hives, I still don‚Äôt know what from, today the hives were still here even after I spent the day yesterday taking allergy relief and lathering myself up In anti itch shit that really didn‚Äôt help much. I went to the doctor today once they started to swell, initially I suspected my medication because I didn‚Äôt eat or do anything out of the ordinary (i don‚Äôt go outside) but after being seen by the doctor and had blood taken, he ruled it out and I fainted, had a panic attack, had some stuff injected in me and all that good shit. I called my psychiatrist right afterwards for good measure and she was unable to speak with me since she was with another patient but her receptionist contacted me after speaking with her and I was informed to stop taking my medication all together until we could speak. 

My next appointment was meant to be June 3rd but I am considering calling in tomorrow and arranging a sooner appointment or something because I feel like I‚Äôm losing my goddamn mind(

I just feel like I have no direction right now and I miss him so badly im hurting physically and I don‚Äôt know when illl be able to finally hear from him again, I only have him, I have no one else, if he‚Äôs gone, im done for.

TLDR; I was forced to suddenly stop taking my medication due a medical emergency and my fp is being sent to a psych ward for about a week, it‚Äôs been two hours and I can‚Äôt stop crying.

I‚Äôve been seeing the same guy for over a year now with some very rocky and traumatic times sprinkled throughout, but I can‚Äôt help but think that I‚Äôm just playing into my diagnosis and going along with it because someone else said I have it.

I don‚Äôt have a traumatic childhood past or any explanation as to why I would have bpd, and that really bothers me.

I just don‚Äôt understand, why me? 

I feel like after being diagnosed, my symptoms just worsened because of some sort of self fulfilling prophecy. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs actually true or if I‚Äôm just more aware of my own triggers and behaviors. Even today, I was feeling normal and completely fine, happy even, but I asked my boyfriend if he was going to stay the night with me, and he replied ‚Äúmaybe idk,‚Äù and that completely broke me.

So I planned a trip to see some friends about a 2 hour drive away from me. The persons house we were staying at was my ex. I had ended up giving him oral towards the end of my week being there. We didn‚Äôt go all the way, this is important. When I got back home I had ended up going to the hospital for heavy bleeding and what not. I went alone. A few days after that my fp decided to contact me and tell me he loves me and he wants a family with me and the works. So we got back together. That night when he was at my house I was on his phone when I realized he was on tinder. He had added girls on snap and saved their nudes to his camera roll. Something he has never done with me.

I‚Äôm 19 btw.  My dad was too scared of her to stand against her and my brother was too young to fully understand.  Since then she has divorced the other guy, remarried my dad and has been pretty uneventful.  I refuse to say anything more than superficial stuff and try to avoid her and not make her mad.  I hate that she is nicer to me lately cause I‚Äôm still mad but feel like all that pain was invalided and I don‚Äôt have enough of an excuse to try to move out sooner.

anyway, every therapist ive ever had has triggered me in one way or another. and ik its not THEM its ME but its really frustrating trying to get treatment and then literally fucking up your relationship with your therapist so bad they stop working with you \*because\* of your mental illness which you're trying to get treatment for. 

i always either get way too attached and they become my FP (which is a whole issue and really messes with progress) or i start relying on them for emotional validation on a normal level and if i dont get it i will have an increase in harmful behaviors in an attempt to recieve that validation. ive literally never had a therapist that didnt trigger my symptoms in some way \*even\* the ones i really liked and clicked with and was making progress with until i started having an increase in symptoms.

  
i kind of gave up on therapy last year after my fp/therapist ""abandoned"" me (mostly my fault and life circumstances but um,, my nervous system still thinks it was abandonment soooo). i was working with another therapist at the same time for addiction help and dropped him after i split and ghosted my dbt referal after one session bc i felt like she was trying to replace my fp. 

its been months and i was ALMOST in remission but i remitted all my symptoms a month ago and im struggling again and i want to go back to my referrals but im really scared of the same thing happening again‚Äî getting triggered and fucking over my relationship with the ONE person that actually has a chance at helping me (dbt is so hard to come by these days oml). it hurt SO much the last time. and idk how to stop it from happening because obviously i havent fully recovered yet. 

  
idk if anyone can relate pls send some support my way. maybe even good stories of good therapist who stayed with you through a split. or advice so that i can preemptively prepare. i really just want to recover and go into remission but its so, so much harder than it seems. like just going to therapy and implementing it doesnt magically make everything better. and in my case it made it worse for a period of time.

442,I think I'm being unsufferable for my fiance and I don't know what to do,1715729449.0,"Hi, 

I (25F) have BPD and have been diagnosed last year. 
My fiance (25M) is being really supportive, we know each other for 12 years, been friend and now we're a couple.

He's an angel but I know I'm complicated to handle. I really try my best, the anger don't always get the best of me because I worked on it a lot. 
However, one night I talked to him because I was feeling lonely and work took our private time away. He talked less and less and slept earlier everyday which made me lonelier. 

Tbh, I know he's working a lot to make us live better, I don't want to be ungrateful but I want to be honest with him completely. 

To resume, we got into a fight, he went to sleep, I cried, he tried to comfort me but I pushed him away as I didn't knew what to do anymore and he went back to sleep. 
The next day he admitted that he wasn't really sleeping, he just avoided me and didn't wanted to comfort me. (it looks made up but I promise he did say that) 
I was shocked, I cried again and he went emotionless as I was really hurt. 

After this I slammed the door, took a bath with some music with high volume and went back to the bedroom as he went back to sleep. 

As I'm a stupid girl with BPD, I apologized for my behavior and let him out of the hook.
Am I stupid ? Why am I like this ? Is it normal for my fiance to became like this ? Is it because living with a BPD person is exhausting ? 
What can I do ? Please I'm feeling so bad to accept this kind of behavior but I don't want to hate him...

444,Suspected BPD in a loved one,1715728408.0,"
I‚Äôm currently separated from my boyfriend of four years, he‚Äôs been extremely emotionally abusive lately, a completely different version of the man I met four years ago. I started looking into different things; I myself have Bipolar 1, depression, & panic disorder so I‚Äôm not new to the mental health world by any means. From my experience over the last half of our relationship, especially as of late (we separated about a month ago), he has been exhibiting every symptom of BPD but self-harm. So my question is this‚Ä¶

What made anyone with this disorder seek help, or how did a diagnosis come about?

I am trying desperately to get him to see a psychiatrist, but to no avail at this time. Unsurprisingly, he believes there is just nothing wrong with him. Maybe I am grasping at straws, but obviously everyone with BPD was diagnosed at some point and I‚Äôm trying so hard to figure out what kind of conversation I could have with him to give him a nudge to see if this is something that has a chance of being managed or if he has really turned into this person I can‚Äôt recognize. I have zero intention on informing him of my suspicion, I‚Äôm aware that‚Äôs a horrible idea.

**Disclaimer:** Obviously I‚Äôm not a doctor, but from what I‚Äôve gathered from research, other people‚Äôs experiences, on top of his EXTREME childhood trauma, I believe my assessment is fair for the following reasons:

1. He is convinced I am out to get him (has said this verbatim)

2. He is by far the most impulsive person I have ever met (one week we couldn‚Äôt afford dog food, then he got paid and immediately bought a drumset that he has yet to touch, not to mention two months into our relationship he bought me a puppy, which I loved, but you get the point)

3. His fear of abandonment is beyond comprehension (I would joke that he was the ‚Äòwoman‚Äô in the relationship with his constant need for reassurance that I wasn‚Äôt going to leave him or cheat on him and that I still loved him, my family finds it very odd how often he calls me when I‚Äôm not with him for no particular reason).

4. His anger can get out of control very quickly though it is usually internal and directed at himself, but has lately been projected onto me through screaming, name-calling, insults etc., which will suddenly vanish just for him to ask me to ‚Äúcome cuddle‚Äù after some time in separate rooms. 

5. One day he will believe he is king of the world, he‚Äôs overly confident, posting gym pictures etc. and then the next day he will lie around convinced that nobody likes him, that he‚Äôs a POS, hating himself.",Ancient_Concern_7241,,False,1cs652o,3,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cs652o/suspected_bpd_in_a_loved_one/

468,emotion related question,1715719223.0,"Not really sure if this is bpd related at all, but i‚Äôve been sitting in this for a bit now. 

For context:
I dated a girl for a few weeks, and I must admit things got serious quickly. She asked me to be her girlfriend and I agreed because things felt comfortable and secure. After a week of being official she suddenly told me she wasn‚Äôt so in love after all and just dumped me. I (F,23 w BPD) got very emotional and upset about the whole thing. I realise i‚Äôve only known her for a month and that i‚Äôll get over this eventually, but the thing that upsets me the most is that she (F,21 ) seems totally fine.

 I haven‚Äôt gotten a proper apology for the events that happened as she told me she needed some space (I respected this fully, and haven‚Äôt reached out since the 5th of april) I‚Äôm over her, and don‚Äôt have any romantical emotions towards her anymore. But, i‚Äôm just so 
angry that she‚Äôs fine. I want her to be sad and I feel bad for wishing that? She did apologise shortly in the moment, but I feel like I deserve more. I struggled immensely with relapsing (alcohol) and I don‚Äôt blame her for any of that, that‚Äôs on me, but I just can‚Äôt shake of that deep anger towards her and the fact that she seems pretty unphased by it. I feel used and taken for granted, I secretly wish her the worst and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs upsetting me the most. I don‚Äôt like that I feel like this?! 

I do have a tendency to minimise my own needs and be too apologetic towards people who wronged me, which leads to unresolved feelings of invalidation and hatred for what they did afterwards.. Feels like I want ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù in some odd way? 

Today, I decided to block her so she‚Äôs unable to reach out if she would suddenly decide to do so and give me closure, she‚Äôs been given more then enough time to show some actual respect towards me so, idk? was this the right choice?

479,Disassociated From BPD While Drunk?,1715710653.0,"Last night I ended up going overboard and drinking considerably too much, but fortunately not enough to forget everything. For some brief context, I had set up a night with my current FP and we decided we were just going to have some wine and chat. 

It turned out to be a fantastic time until getting sick, but what's weird is how I felt while I was drunk. I've never experienced this before but I almost felt disassociated from my BPD. I felt muted, and was surprised that I was not feeling my emotions with the same level of extreme intensity that I usually did. Also, before this night I was constantly writhing about my romantic interest with my FP. I was undeniably in love with her (which caused me a lot of pain since she has a long time boyfriend). But, this night I didn't feel any romantic love towards her. I just felt like we were two great friends chatting and having a lovely time. We were more intimate than ever before--hugging, hand holding, constantly touching each other--which you would think would be my paradise but I actually just felt still like we were friends. 

Then the morning came. Hungover, but still relishing the great moments with her, I wrote her a long string of texts expressing my gratitude and reaffirming my love for her as her friend. Despite saying ""I love you too"" back to me last night, she responded to my texts with three short lines saying she was happy to help and asked how I felt. The short response, not saying I love you, and her ignoring my request to hang out again immediately made me split. I used all my willpower to not totally freak the fuck out, but it hurt so bad. 

So that's where we are now. I am trying hard not to split, but I am in agony over her not being as affectionate as she was last night. I feel more dependent on her than ever before, but I can't tell if my romantic feelings have come back or not. I don't think they have, but more than ever I just feel like I need to hold onto her so tightly so she won't leave me.

I feel an overwhelming sense of dread when someone new says they like me, and I still think back to my FP and regularly get waves of anxiety and sickness when I do, but I don‚Äôt think about it nearly as much anymore. I reached out to some new people, albeit online on a Discord server, but overall it‚Äôs been a welcoming experience. I‚Äôm happy to start anew and it feels nice to be complimented and praised and told I‚Äôm sweet and helpful. I‚Äôm not close to any of the people there, but I‚Äôm well known now and so they recognize me and crack jokes with me and it‚Äôs really nostalgic. I‚Äôd like to keep it that way, too.

I think I‚Äôve really stopped caring so much about my ex-friends who dumped me alongside my FP, too. I don‚Äôt feel the same consuming anger I did back when it was still fresh in my mind. In fact, I hardly think about them and sometimes forget they exist. It‚Äôs pretty funny because I‚Äôd known them for years.

What I‚Äôve got certainly isn‚Äôt a long-term solution to my problems, but it‚Äôs a step in the right direction towards moving on, I think. I‚Äôve been making some money off of my art as well, and I already know I‚Äôve become more financially successful than all of the people who hurt me. That part‚Äôs pretty petty, but it feels good, so whatever works, you know?

I hope I continue to forget about all of that, and all of the trauma I went through with my FP. I hope everyone else can heal from their own trauma and mistakes as well. Much love to you all.

510,Does anyone else think they might have been misdiagnosed? I think I may have ADHD ,1715694440.0,"And by that I mean that the BPD diagnosis might be the wrong one (or at least not the only one)

I (27f) was diagnosed with BPD 7 years ago. It felt like the most fitting diagnosis at first, but apart from my emotional regulation issues, impulsivity, indecisiveness and feeling empty (frequently, not necessarily 'chronically' though!) I've noticed I'm different from other people with BPD. I happen to know quite a few. Their impulsivity shows in different ways (I have impulsive speech, but I never really lash out at people unless I'm drunk), their self-destructive behaviour is wayyy more intense than mine, etc. 
I'm aware there's over 250 different combinations of having 5 or more out of 9 symptoms (which is the diagnostic criteria according to the ICD-10 and I'm in Europe), and I know there's quiet and less severe forms of BPD. 
However, I have A LOT of symptoms which are not associated with BPD but rather with ADHD. To list just a few, my short term memory is terrible, I'm the most disorganised and messy person I know apart from others with ADHD, my executive dysfunction is ruining my life, I'm both hyperactive and inattentive in many ways. This was already the case in my childhood, but my parents are dead so no one can give an account of that. Also, BPD treatment (therapy and skills training) has not helped with those kinda symptoms at all. The only thing that helps is taking amphetamines lol
I've actually been self-medicating for a while with Vyvanse and it works so well. I've told my psychiatrist about it and he refuses to believe it may be ADHD because it's 'a trend diagnosis' and because my former self-harm is 'proof for BPD'. My therapist on the other hand has been very supportive and trying to help me get a diagnosis. I went to a screening, scored extremely high on the ADHD inventory, but a little too well on some of the cognitive tests, so I just got diagnosed with BPD *again* (even though I got lost on my way there, forgot to bring important documents and to wear a mask during COVID haha). My boyfriend and many of my friends suspect ADHD as well...

I'm frustrated. I feel like my doctor is mostly holding on to the BPD diagnosis because I'm female. And I'm convinced I'm on the wrong medication and that Vyvanse or a similar medication would help me function. But since I already 'failed' the screening, I'm scared of seeking out another doctor. I feel like now, I'll never be taken seriously. 

Has anyone had a similar experience?
Is there any chance at all I might still get diagnosed for ADHD? Should I try? Trying again would cost so much money, and it would shatter me if I don't get the diagnosis, as in my mind, ADHD medication is my only hope.

So I guess I'd be grateful for some advice whether to further pursue getting an ADHD diagnosis or not. Or just some support and reassurance that even if I don't get the diagnosis, there's hope for me.

TLDR: me, my therapist, my bf and some friends are pretty sure I have ADHD. My doctor says it must be BPD and refuses to try new medication. Already 'failed' a screening - try a different doctor anyway or not?",uebea,,False,1crsknd,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1crsknd/does_anyone_else_think_they_might_have_been/
511,Changing from quiet to petulant BPD? (also undiagnosed),1715665641.0,"I (22F) have been looking into PDs these past few months and suspect I may have undiagnosed BPD, but I am not sure what type...

I suspect I may have been quiet/discouraged BPD for since middle school since I often struggled with self-hatred (made a ton of self-deprecative jokes) and suicidal ideation (never made any plans, but I often went REAL deep into misery as I convinced myself that everyone around me hates me and would celebrate if I were to kms). I also had a lot of people who might be considered FPs ‚Äî for example, my teachers in middle school and after that it was a bunch of older guy friends who I thought were ""crushes"" ‚Äî but looking back I think they might just be FPs since I would genuinely feel really happy as long as they were willing to stay friends even if I knew it was unlikely to become something more (and plus the one time a guy DID like me back, I cut them off real quick :') ), except my emotional attachment to them was also a lot more intense than what's probably typical for friendship?? Like I had thought ""Even if they end up marrying someone else, I'd still want to stay in their lives as a friend and support their relationship and future kids as like a family friend""

But also recently I went through a pretty traumatic experience with an ex FP, and I kind of wonder if it has pushed me from quiet to petulant/externalizing BPD? Like they repeatedly hurt me/broke trust real bad to the point I can't see them the same (I guess it's like ""splitting"" but it also feels different and more intense/darker than times I've split on previous FPs) and now ‚Äî as bad as it sounds ‚Äî¬†I hate them more than I hate myself and wish they would just unalive themselves?? And it's to the point I'm so consumed with hatred for them that I'm spending less time fantasizing about killing *myself* but I'm not sure this anger and bitterness is healthy either... (Part of me also wonders if it could be comorbid NPD, but I don't feel this sort of intense hatred toward anyone else in my life right now eithter)

Has anyone else had similar experiences of changing from quiet to petulant BPD (or shifting between other different types) due to life experiences? Or would this mean I probably had petulant all along but just had never been in the environments where symptoms flared like they do now?

I don't like how my borderline and PTSD combine to self-sabotage everything I want, I still like a girl I hurt because I still wasn't over the hurt my ex did to me and now she's with someone. . Otherwise, I'm happy she's with someone who I hope knows what she wants, unlike me.

I got angry at two girls for not knowing what I want and although they accepted my apology, I feel like I don't deserve to study psychology.

To cope with the demands of my office jobs, I've found myself relying on excessive drinking, weekend partying, and struggling with food, waking up at 3-5am and doom scrolling or punishing my body with horrid HIIT workouts until I want to collapse.  


I often vacillate between feeling hyper-vigilant and completely demotivated, tearful then irritable or cranky and tend to overanalyze my colleagues' expressions, constantly seeking their approval while simultaneously distrusting their intentions. The insincerity and harshness of workplace interactions only exacerbate these feelings of inauthenticity.

526,Took a coping test it was very interesting.,1715682082.0,"I took this coping mechanism test it was very interesting.

These are my results. Ironically, I am over emotional but this what I try to do to avoid being so emotional.

Detached Self-Soother

You carry a deep longing for emotional comfort, but your caregivers were unable or unwilling to fulfill that need. This has led you to be wary of relying on others. You have developed a coping mode that seeks to numb emotional pain by creating distance from difficult feelings.

You rely on self-soothing strategies such as distraction, avoidance, or numbing to regulate your emotions and alleviate discomfort. Your detachment allows you to maintain a sense of control and autonomy in the face of adversity, but it also leads to feelings of isolation.

Watch for these signs:

Emotional Numbing: You engage in behaviors or activities that numb or suppress emotions (such as overeating, substance use, or excessive screen time) as a way of escaping painful feelings. You find it difficult to identify or express your emotions, and have a tendency to dismiss your own experiences.
Avoidance of Emotional Triggers: You avoid situations or stimuli that evoke strong emotions, preferring to keep emotional distress at bay rather than process it directly. Your life history has made you an expert at creating distractions, keeping your mind occupied by a constant stream of external stimuli.
Self-Isolation: You withdraw from emotional intimacy, preferring solitude or superficial connections to avoid potential hurt. Your need to escape emotional discomfort leads you to neglect important responsibilities or obligations.
Distraction Techniques: You use distractions such as hobbies or work to divert attention from uncomfortable emotions or thoughts, temporarily soothing yourself by avoiding deeper emotional processing.
The Cycle of Detachment: By avoiding your emotions, you limit opportunities to develop healthy coping mechanisms. This leads to increased emotional vulnerability, further fueling your need for distractions and avoidance.
Your coping mode provides temporary relief from emotional distress but also perpetuates feelings of disconnection and loneliness. Without learning healthy ways to regulate your emotions, you risk further isolating yourself from meaningful relationships and opportunities for personal growth.

When does it end? When was your last ep?,1715667746.0,"I'm curious to know about your experience with a splitting episode, as I generally struggle to identify mine until it's too late and everything falls apart.

For me, it feels like hell. I'll cut off people.
I'll stop talking to close family. Impulsive online buying. I'll start feeling like I'm losing my sanity. I'll binge eat, then stop eating altogether. Everything moves at the speed of light. I'll get paranoid, start hallucinating during the night, and become delusional during the day. Not to mention the disorganized thinking and talking, which makes me seem like a child. And the worst of all is waking up from nightmares EVERY-SINGLE-DAY.

I've never been able to cope with it; it usually just fades away after consuming me entirely. I'll start having suicidal thoughts but never act on them. I'll treat people around me like they're nobodies. Sometimes I'll feel like everybody's trash, and then shift to feeling like I'm the most miserable person on earth.

It can last from weeks to months when I don't reach out to anybody and let myself spiral. Thankfully, I have friends who are very aware of this and drag me out of it most of the time. These friends never realized how much they've saved me plenty of times. I am very grateful to have them in my life.

What triggers it is when I don't feel in control of my life, when I'm getting to know new people, when I'm with someone who doesn't know me welli when I'm surrounded by toxic people, when I feel like l've exposed myself too much and start feeling vulnerable, when I feel like I'm failing academically, when I feel like I need to put in more effort but I can't, and when I feel lonely and isolated.

543,How to approach someone in their anger?,1715666170.0,"So, I am coming to the conclusion my husband is pwBPD, though not diagnosed. I'm not seeking confirmation on that, but it helps me to try to understand his emotions and behaviours. Reading through posts here is helping enormously. 

We've been married for 15 years, and he has always had angry outbursts, but they are getting more frequent, being triggered by (from the outside ) seemingly smaller and smaller things, and he then retreats into an angry stonewalling that is now lasting for months at a time. 

Currently he is not speaking to me for several weeks, and I think that it is because I fell asleep on the sofa while waiting to help him with some medication (for a separate medical issue). I can't think of anything else that triggered it, there was no fight, I guess he just felt like I didn't care enough about him to stay awake.

I am not allowed in the room with him, he comes home late and slams things. When I have offered to help or offer a cup of tea etc, he pulls his hair and looks at me with such rage. He has held his hand up in my face and screamed that he needs space. 

In the past he has only really climbed down from this point when a crisis occurs. E.g. he ended up in icu with high blood pressure, his mum ending up in icu with high blood pressure likewise, or me nearly getting deported because he wouldn't support my visa application. As in a serious crisis. Then once he starts talking again, he expects us all to carry on as if nothing happened. 

This is taking its toll on my own mental health, and our daughter and his mother. I don't feel like he is choosing this, but he won't come down or allow anyone to reach out to him. 

I am scared, for myself (he's not violent, but the look in his eyes terrifies me), for him (he could  easily end up having a heart attack), for our marriage, for our family. 

I would hugely appreciate any advice on how to approach things from anyone who finds themselves in that way.  Do I just give the space he is asking for, even though this could be months, and surely makes him feel more rejected? Or do I keep trying to approach, bearing in my that even the slightest perceived criticism might result in a deepening or a full blow up. 
He doesn't read well, and won't read a letter, he is not responding to messages. He is not in a place to accept that he needs professional help. I'm so lost. 

There is a lot of background and detail I can add if anyone needs to know, but just some basic top tips would be so helpful.

548,I cheated and can‚Äôt stop focusing on the other woman,1715662455.0,"I (20F,lesbian) posted this already before but using a different account because I have a new phone. I cheated last weekend on my girlfriend (19F) of over a year with a woman (21F) I was developing a strong friendship with. We got drunk and kissed and although we didn‚Äôt have sex, she slept over and we cuddled. 

I do feel awful about this. Sure I have anxious attachment and BPD. I have a cycle of always having an FP and honestly the time period between my FPs is incredibly short. Sure my girlfriend is more of an avoidant and communicates less. It bothers me but I had zero intention of breaking up and was looking forward to our future adventures. 

I have made up my mind to tell her in one week once finals are over. I would love to say that if she takes me, I am going to work on things. However, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the other girl, even just our friendship means a lot to me. She is very emotionally intense as I am and I crave emotional connection. The other day we had a phone call to cut things off and for clarity, but we ended up talking for 7 hours straight. 

It sucks that I‚Äôll also be halfway across the country this summer for a job, coincidentally not far from her hometown while my girlfriend will be at home. 

I truly know this is bad, but I don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm supposed to make of these urges. How do I go from loving my girlfriend to wanting to throw it away all for a new connection? It makes me feel like I‚Äôm just a shell of a person. Yes I have been in therapy for 6 months and I know I need to keep at it.

My bpd symptoms are only apparent when im in a relationship. With that being said, I think its unfair that the only way to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is by isolating myself. 

It breaks my heart into a million pieces thinking that the only way to feel sane is by breaking off the relationship I have with my ex. I still have hopes that we‚Äôll get back together, i mean we are in contact and hangout all the time but it breaks my heart that im no longer one of his priorities due to my past behavior.

Im in therapy, im waiting for an evaluation for medication. My therapist told me to not put all my eggs in one basket, to not think that medication will help all my issues but I really hope it minimizes this feeling of emptiness, doubt and impulsivity. 

I go back & forth with feeling helpless and not wanting to let this define me. But recently i cant get the thought out of my head that I‚Äôll never have a healthy romantic relationship. No one deserves to put up with someone like me.

the sucky and tricky thing about this is my fp is honestly a lot like me. he was only interested in being my friend and talking to me and romantically pursuing me (he‚Äôs an ex) but after him cheating on me and just a lot more life things happening I made the almost fatal decision to cut it off. (and I have the kind of BPD where I‚Äôll stay no matter what you do to me so this was hard) beyond a few cheating incidents he really seemed to only want me. always being there for my panic attacks as I have panic disorder and autistic meltdowns and shutdowns and even taking care of me now by helping provide a roof over my head. (my parents kicked me out at 17 so I had been couch surfing and living out of my car for awhile and I stopped being able to work and drive a few years ago due to my mental health getting out of control)

Ever since I lost a close friend due to an argument, I started getting involved with bad people and talking to a lot of strangers online and in person, overtime I've been taking more and more risks, giving more and more information and doing more and more of what I'm asked, even if it's unsafe for me, I'm starting to get scared that I'm going to go too far one day and need help with controlling my impulsive behaviour. 

So I decided to post in order to get advice, I'm in desperate need of it because I know the way I'm going is dangerous but I'm really struggling to stop it, I feel like I'm getting worse everyday, I don't know what to do.

Any advice is really appreciated, I just want to stop walking down such a potentially dangerous path because I know if I don't stop soon I could end up really hurt, and I have a to lose, and a lot of people I care about.",henry-nmw,,False,1crf74d,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1crf74d/how_do_you_cope_with_impulses/

I'm 22 f (undiagnosed) my partner is 22 male we got together when we were both 19 we moved in after a week of dating cause we were both basically homeless so we got an apartment together. 19 and 20 where really rough ages for us. He cheated on me and was listing after other women and said a bunch of hurtful shit after cheating in attempts to make me feel better because I was blaming myself and my identity specifically about how maybe dying my hair black would make him love me more. This fucked with my self image so fucking much and I'm trying to undo that. And 21 and 22 have been really good years for us we're both happier and healthier but I suspect he my also have undiagnosed BPD or some other personality disorder idk I'm not a psychiatrist but he too has that crazy child hood trauma that makes your brain go weird. I'm rambling but anyways. I keep getting feelings of hurt and sadness coming up almost like ptsd it feels like it's still happening all the time and it used to make me split in a mean way but now I split in a sad way. And it feels like maybe I should leave but then it passes and I'm okay again. Idk what to do we're talking about getting married and buying land together but I'm not sure cause when I do split like this it's so heart breaking. And he tells me all the time he was stupid for the way he acted and what he said was wrong and he only said/did it cause he was young and immature and he know what it means to respect me now but I still feel pain.

I'm just having a lot of big emotions and it's weird cause he'll tell me he was wrong and hug me when I cry about him cheating. How do I move on without breaking up with him?

577,Partner‚Äôs anxiety over news of my BPD,1715649820.0,"Hi, my partner (28m) and I (24f) have been together for about a year. This past month we found out from my individual therapist that I most-likely have BPD. Things are not nearly as dire as any of the stories we‚Äôve read online, but it‚Äôs still something that needs to be addressed for a long, lasting future together. We are trying to get into couples therapy, but it‚Äôs going to be a few weeks out at least. We‚Äôre having open and productive conversations about everything, but (understandably) he‚Äôs still pretty stressed about it all.

The thing that concerns me, and that I‚Äôm looking for advice on, is that he‚Äôs beginning to convince himself that my feelings for him aren‚Äôt as genuine or unique as he previously thought. His anxieties are telling him that my love and devotion for him have a lot more to do with my disorder than our connection. This is a valid concern, given all we‚Äôve read about bpd idealization online, but I‚Äôm worried about the effect it has on his self-esteem. I still firmly believe that our connection is so special and that he is the best partner anyone could ask for. I do, for the record, understand that nobody is perfect and acknowledge he isn‚Äôt either.

I want to be clear that the issue is not that I worry he is going to think our connection is less special, and then decide to leave me. It seems to be more ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm replaceable and she would love someone else just as much?‚Äù than ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm wrong about how I feel toward her?‚Äù I‚Äôm posting to ask for any advice from partners of pwbpd who have gone through those same feelings. Is there anything I can tell him to reassure him that my love for him is just as real as it he thought before? How have you dealt with the thought that your pwbpd may just be idealizing you? Any general advice to calm his nerves a bit would really help. I hate seeing him so stressed and I want to help however I can.

Now there's this other dude. He's almost the complete opposite of Jake, and we're gonna call him Nikki. Nikki and I talked for a little bit, and he took care of me for days when I ran away from home. He became my FP for a while and i was obsessed. We had a good fuck, i felt connected to him, and i wanted to be his girl so badly. But he was emotionally unavailable and even after numerous talks with him about our relationship, we concluded that he wasnt ready for a relationship. Which was fine by me, as long as he still texted me often and showed at least some interest. As time went on he began to play a push and pull game that drove me fucking insane, though i tried not to show it did. 

Now that im publicly dating Jake, he's liked every post ive posted with him. Which is odd, bc he doesnt usually like my stuff. When i texted him and asked him if he was going to a certain concert, he was really dry and sent only one message at a time. Complete switch up.

It comes and goes as a persistent issue, and lately I've been able to identify the issue as a lack of direct communication. I don't feel loved in the ways they show love. I understand they are trying to show love, but it comes off as confusing and indirect so I miss what they're trying to convey very often. I had a breakdown and tried to communicate this, and it resulted in them feeling upset and taking space. For me, this was extremely tumultuous in an already bad mental state. I don't think I've ever quite split for this long with them. We've been taking more or less some space, I told them I am tired of initiating conversations (I'm feeling very burnt out) as I kept initially trying to cater to them in this time.

They messaged today, their best friend who is a long distance friend they never get to see (it's been many years), has a layover tomorrow in our city. My S/O doesn't drive, so this implied my presence to drive them. I asked if they needed a ride and if they wanted me to come with or just pickup/drop off, and when they responded that they want me to come, it frustrated me deeply. We haven't talked at all about the incident from days ago now, we haven't seen each other in person, and the first time we see each other- in my mind- we just have to shove everything away and act happy and normal so we can hang with their bestie. They haven't asked me how I've been at all, it doesn't feel like they give a fucking shit about me, and that they just need me for the favor. I feel extremely unloved and I'm scared of seeing them in person at this point.

I'm. honestly not sure what to do. Do I go? I really don't think I want to but I've been the source of them not meeting up last time the long distance friend was nearby- we planned a whole trip and I ended up canceling due to stress. I think for sure I would offer to drive, I just hate the idea of spending time with them like this right now.

589,My bestfriend wBPD and I had a falling out and I'm trying to understand his thinking.,1715643702.0,"So my (27M) roommate/best friend (26M) with BPD have been living together for 3 years now. We've had ups and downs, but most of the time we always bounce back from it. Our last big argument was 8 months ago and it ended with him finding out he had BPD and apologizing for how it affected me.

About two months ago, he randomly became very distant with me. This came 4 days after him telling me how excited he was at how close we are and how I'm his best friend and he's so appreciative of me. He also made significant life changes like quitting drinking, reading self-help and spirituality books, stopped dating, etc. a MAJOR shift from his previous lifestyle.

Two weeks into that, I asked if everything was good and he said yes, but also acknowledged he'd been distant and that he's just been enjoying spending time alone, which I respected. But the following weeks, he would just continually make passive aggressive remarks to me and not anyone else. Then he would start being nice to me right after. He would hangout with all these other friends and not me. Other friends started to pick up on his behavior towards me too.

He would act very close and almost relationship-like one day and then the next day act like he hardly is friends with me. The back-and-forth was a lot to deal with personally so I needed to set boundaries. This basically just meant me not agreeing to everything he wanted to do just to stay on his ""good side"". I still hungout with him, I still invited him places, I didn't treat him any differently and I still thought of him as a best friend.

Last month, he sent me a message reassuring me I didn't do anything wrong and he appreciates me so much. At this point, I decided I had to say something. I confronted him and essentially told him that I understand he's enjoying spending time alone and obviously I support that, but that's not an excuse to be passive aggressive or rude to me. I basically asked him to treat me like a friend consistently and let him know how his behavior has affected me. I even said if I did anything wrong please let me know. He basically flipped it onto me and said I was the most manipulative person he's ever known and that I victimize myself all the time. The conversation ended with him saying he's been looking to move out for awhile (he told me 3 days before he wanted to start touring apartments) and he's going to do so ASAP.

Now, it's been almost a month and we haven't spoken besides in passing. Our mutual friends have tried speaking with him and he shuts them all down saying he doesn't need advice. I have offered to talk it out but he says he doesn't have anything more to say. When were around friends, he still tries to talk to me as if nothing is wrong, but I don't want to engage in small talk unless we talk things out.

He is very into spirituality now and has determined he doesn't need therapy or medication anymore and that he doesn't actually have BPD.

But every time I try to go through that process alone I only see myself as a problem that needs to be solved and won't ever get better. I can't see myself as a person. I only see the diagnosis and the symptoms and how I treated others. 

On top of all that I end up just hating myself to the point of very bad thoughts and actions. And I stop caring about how I affect other people. Because I'm undeserving of real love so I won't ever find it so trapping someone with me is the only thing I can think of doing. Manipulative and guilt tripping behavior. I don't plan on being alive to sort it out so it doesn't have consequences in my head. 

All conflict feels like bridges burning so I act in ways that damage the relationship because it's already over to me. I can't do anything else because I can't see anything past it. 

And I want to stop. I want to be better. I don't like being this way and I hate it. I really really hate it. But I need someone to hold my hand while I sort through this box of shit I didn't ask for. And if I don't have that I crumble and I can't see the end to the maze, I feel there's nothing outside of it. The extreme thinking patterns are quite literally my only perspective and I hate that too. 

What can I do? I have no one. All of my friends are either blocked or have me blocked or when I ask to hang out they tell me they aren't in the mood and 20 minutes later their story is them hanging out with everyone who won't talk to me.

He cheated on me. He selfishly asked me to wait for him and said he wasn't looking for anyone and would consider me first if he did.

I told him I didn't think he wanted that arrangement and he was more than open to leave if he wanted and he said no. He knew it was selfish but he wanted it. 

And I'm so lost. He's 3 hours away and refuses to come here. I've offered him everything. I've offered him my body, I've offered to let him hurt me, use me, comfort me, or whatever else he wanted. But no. I just can't do this anymore.

I‚Äôve destroyed all relationships in my life. I‚Äôm 38 in a few weeks. I have no connections really anywhere. I‚Äôve never had close friends because I didn‚Äôt really have any structure growing up. I don‚Äôt know how to establish relationships. I‚Äôm in my head constantly.  
I don‚Äôt have any passions or hobbies because quite honestly I‚Äôve just lost the will to care about anything.  
  
Therapy isn‚Äôt helping. I have the tools to end myself and yet I‚Äôm still here for not fucking reason. I feel everyday the voice in my head gets stronger.

I don‚Äôt just feel invisible I literally am. I certainly don‚Äôt know who I am, what I am, I‚Äôm just here taking up space. I lost the ability to even hide my fucked up emotions like 4 years ago. I seem to be progressively getting worse. All of my interactions with people seem vapid meaningless. It‚Äôs all face value horse shit.

It‚Äôs suffocating. I would like to have normal interactions with people a normal life, people I can relate with. Enjoy even simple things.  
  
I guess lost is an understatement. This every moment of mental anguish is unbearable. I pray for peace but don‚Äôt know what energy is listening, I hope for mental clarity, just a sense that I‚Äôm okay. Each moment in my mind is fight or flight, each moment is black or white.

603,Feel like I‚Äôm running out of time and a lost cause,1715637788.0,"What‚Äôs cookin my emotional brothers and sisters. I‚Äôm 20 m and I was only recently diagnosed with BPD like two months ago by my therapist. He told me to do my own research in my own time and see if I could relate to others with the disorder, which I most definitely did and it was an extremely surreal experience. It STILL is surreal and it‚Äôs come with a lot of feelings both good and bad, but honestly mostly bad lmao. 

After learning about the diagnosis I pretty quickly quit yet another job (this time a high paying shipyard) and also texted my high school ex who I haven‚Äôt spoken a single word to in TWO YEARS a massive embarrassing ramble of emotions (she responded as nicely as you can to that sort of thing though thankfully lol). Some weeks later and Im here now hired for yet another job that I‚Äôll probably stay at for a few months then quit, but I want this to end so bad. I‚Äôm so tired and honestly the hope is gone. 

I know I haven‚Äôt been in therapy long, but already my therapist has missed like three meetings and I don‚Äôt know if he can help me even if I did actually meet him every week like I‚Äôm supposed to. How can he help me become better just by talking to me when I‚Äôm this far gone? I‚Äôm thinking about talking to my psychiatrist about trying antipsychotics (especially since I‚Äôve experienced two VERY vivid auditory hallucinations quite recently) but I‚Äôve already tried so many stimulants and anti depressants that have done nothing for me.

 I also read many stories about people with BPD and how they can‚Äôt find love and how they‚Äôre alone and it crushes me. Despite the fact that it‚Äôs been over two fucking years, I still miss and obsess over my ex all the time and since she dumped me it hasn‚Äôt felt like I‚Äôve been living ‚Äúlife‚Äù anymore. It feels like every day I live has been the ‚Äúaftermath‚Äù of that event despite all the times I‚Äôve seriously tried to push her out of my mind with actual HEALTHY distractions over the past two years. 

I feel so alone and unloved and that‚Äôs because I truly believe I am. The people who don‚Äôt hate me I cut from my life anyway subconsciously. I haven‚Äôt been able to connect with any of my family members since I was very young, not because they‚Äôre bad people or anything but just because I feel extremely anxious around all of them, and that definitely includes both my parents who I haven‚Äôt lived with since I was 13. I really only have 3 dickhead guy friends left who I‚Äôve known for a decade, and lately they‚Äôve been unhappy with me too (for good reason). The only person I love and I feel at least remotely loves me back isn‚Äôt actually a person but my cat Walt. The only thing I want in life is a real connection with someone. I WANT to work for it but I can‚Äôt, I always give up or fuck up somewhere down the line. 

I‚Äôm just getting worse and worse. I‚Äôm addicted to everything and my physical health is taking a nose dive too. Binge eating has become a huge problem lately, and I think I‚Äôm starting to get fat which will fucking destroy me since I used to be a fat kid and thinning out was genuinely one of the best things that ever happened to me lmfao. I want to work out from home and get really fit and big which would be extremely helpful for my confidence, but I can‚Äôt even START because I know I will probably just give up like before. Time is flying so fast, probably in part because I haven‚Äôt stopped smoking copious amounts of pot longer than a week in over two years. I feel like I‚Äôm running out of time and even if I do get better or don‚Äôt fucking kill myself this week, I‚Äôll have already wasted so much of my life. I‚Äôm so alone and depressed and tired and I have so many problems I don‚Äôt even know where to begin to even ATTEMPT to try and become happy. 

Idk what any of you can tell me, and again I haven‚Äôt been in therapy for BPD long so really that‚Äôs probably my best bet. If it does help, I hope it starts helping really fucking soon because I think things are really, really bad now.

614,How hard is it to maintain relationship with a partner having BPD?,1715633802.0,"I (23M) am in a 4 month relationship with my girlfriend (26F). Although she's not officially diagnosed with BPD, I can notice a couple of BPD symptoms in her such as impulsivity, mood swings and intense emotional responses.

She shows emotional intimacy to me, initiates conversations and is contact with me frequently every day. She even get‚Äôs a bit jealous if a girl follows me on Instagram, is curious to know more about me and is interested in meeting/dating more often. She was the one who suggested getting physical as well.

We‚Äôd a minor dispute 3 days ago and she blocked me on Instagram. The following day, she unblocked me, followed me again and liked my latest post. I didn‚Äôt follow immediately, but she kept contacting and sending romantic messages till I followed her back.

This has happened 3 times in this 4-month relationship already. All due to disagreements on trivial issues. We get irritated quickly, short fuse and unfollow each other. But the resentment is minimal and after just 2 or 3 days, we reconnect due to missing each other.

She broke up with her ex 2 years ago. The final year was rocky and in the on/off mode. She was the one who reached out most of the time to reconcile, but it only got worse. After the break up, she'd depression for almost a year.

It's been a couple of years that she vapes moderately and even occasionally gets stones to mitigate her mood shifts; but she has not taken any medications.

I don‚Äôt know if these temporary cuts signal manipulation, controlling behavior, avoidance, instability and passive-aggressiveness; or are just unimportant blips due to not knowing each other enough and will stop once the boundaries are defined.

Some people have told me these are signs of BPD, while others believe she's clingy and emotionally dependent.

I was wondering what the chance of this relationship to last is. Will this get worse overtime once the honeymoon phase is over?

628,My jealousy is ruining my relationship. (TW),1715627656.0,"I have an amazing boyfriend whom I truly love. He is my FP. I get so jealous when he speaks to any other girl to the point where I am ruining the relationship. 

I wanted to avoid speaking to him about it because I knew that I most likely wouldn't handle it well and I was right. Usually when I feel jealous I distance myself so that there is less of a chance that I do something that I will regret. But the topic came up anyway.

I have a female friend who also has BPD and I have a very complicated relationship with her. I want to be her friend but at the same time I hate her guts. Our friendship has been on and off for about 2 years. More recently the friendship ended on bad terms and she said some hurtful things and I of course did not take it well. I hated her and I was very angry because I could not let it go. Recently we're suddenly friends again. I thought that maybe it could work out if we communicate more. I already regret contacting her. She knows all about how jealous I can get. We know A LOT about each other. Our friendship was toxic and competitive.

 Last week we went to a school dance along with my boyfriend (the day we became friends) and I had told her that me and my boyfriend were together before we arrived at the dance. We met up with my boyfriend and we all quickly started talking. She patted him on the shoulder after joking around which is odd since she told me that she hated physical touch, she knew that we were together and from all the time we've been friends she should've gathered that I wouldn't have liked her touching my boyfriend. While we were at the dance I kept having to move to the other side of my boyfriend because she kept walking next to him. I know that it is a stupid thing to be upset about but they were walking really close to each other and there were quite a few times where I was walking behind them and they didn't even notice. I was the third wheel. They also talked a lot which is strange since my friend doesn't usually like talking to people nor finds it easy but she quickly talked about some minor personal things which I think was really odd. 

My boyfriend said that he changed his opinion on her and that she's really cool. It hurt me a lot. I felt that I was being replaced. And I felt so betrayed. I asked him about the whole leaving me out thing and he apologized
 He said that he didn't notice (am I that unimportant?) and that he felt bad for disliking her and thought that since me and her are friends again that he should try to get along with her. 

Later on he texted her to ask for the photos she took that night. He could've asked me. She definitely has his number saved now and it makes me so fucking angry. 

Today he brought it up and asked about me being jealous over my friend. We talked a bit and then he said that I can't get mad at him for talking to my friend which is true but I lost my shit anyway. It didn't matter how many times he reassured me that he only loved me because I still went crazy. I sent him multiple voice messages about it where it is clear that I am on the verge of tears. I was so hurt. It hurt so much. He just wanted to know what was happening. But I felt that he was replacing me and I couldn't stop crying. I couldn't stop thinking about having to walk behind them. I couldn't stop thinking about how much it hurt. 

I did some things that I shouldn't have. Not completely terrible but enough to hurt him too. I just want to be the only one he loves. I already apologized but I am ignoring him because I want him to worry about me (I mentioned suicide) which now that I type out sounds horrible.

How do I cope in the future? I just get so jealous and possessive that I feel it is taking over my life and I can't do anything about it. I trust my boyfriend I really do. I just always have this fear in the back of my mind that I can't get rid of. What do I do?

I just feel that he is all I have. I can't lose him. I genuinely feel that there isn't anything I can do to fix the jealousy problem. My only hope is that I find a way to deal with it better because I truly do not wish any harm upon him.

632,Forcing myself to join BPD group therapy- how to change my very negative attitude about it?,1715625949.0,"I knew a BPD group would be great for me, so I joined one and will be starting tomorrow. 

The problem is that I have an extremely negative attitude about it and don't want to do it. I already don't like the group leader. Plus, the group is a part of a substance use facility, so there is a bunch of other rules I have to follow even though I don't have a substance use problem. 

For excample, I can't drink or do any drugs ever. I'm not following this rule though because I don't have a problem with substances (I only do them maybe 2 a month) and I do them responsibly. I don't see why I need to stop.

I'm also trying to really enjoy life more and make up for lost time and experiences I've missed out on. I'm getting married soon and have a lot of other fun things going on this year, some of which include drinking or occassionally drugs. I'd be extremely upset to not be able to do these things just because of a support group. 

To make things worse, they can drug test me if they think I'm doing some kind of substance. I'm going to refuse to do a drug test because they have to watch me pee and will absolutly flip my shit if that happens so I'm just not going to do that. However, this will likely result in me being kicked out. 

It just feels like I'm be punished and viewed as a bad person who can't make responsible decisions. 

The threat that I could be kicked out at any moment also looms over my head and, as you can imagine, for somebody who has abandonment and rejection issues, this isn't going to feel like a safe enviroment. It doesn't help that I have to hide that I occasionally drink or use drugs (just weed 98% of the time). 

I just don't know how to change my very negative attitude about it. It doesn't feel like I'm joining a group to better myself, but more like I'm being punished and that I need to be baby sat to make sure I'm living my life by somebody else's rules.

We both concluded that despite the breakup, he still believes we'll get back together, move in, and sees a future for us, waiting for me to be ready to show him some changes. He said he loves me very much, and these were the best months of his life, but he doesn't want constant fights or to be limited by my fears and jealousy. He wants me to change primarily for myself, not for him. He wants me to return to him without new scars and bruises. Our anniversary was supposed to be in July, and he hopes it'll be a new beginning for us instead. I'll have DBT training for two hours a week and am in the process of signing up for therapy. I'll write in my journal every day. We agreed to say our final goodbyes when I calmly message him because our last conversation involved me crying and begging standing in the doorway. 
We love each other, and we'll continue to do so - he'll wait for me, he won't get rid of our matching things, or delete our photos from Instagram. He'll just wait.

Towards the end of the session, my therapist grew a little agitated and pointed out that I am giving, what she called, ""logical sounding excuses"". What this was supposed to mean, was that for everything she said I would have a rational reasoning as to why I couldn't implement whatever she's saying. (for example, she'd say come to bed an hour early so that you don't have troubles waking up. I would say that I cannot come to bed an hour early because that's the only time I get to talk to my long distance boyfriend. Or I know that if I go to the gym, I will come out feeling good. But because I am afraid of being perceived, I can either go in for a full 2 hour workout, or not go in at all, even though the option to go in and leave in 30-45 mins also exists)

649,BPD and Substance Abuse - a Request For Practical Words of Advice,1715618757.0,"Hi all, 

  
I (29m) am hoping to tap into some of the experiences of those within this sub. For some context, I have for a long time struggled with abusing substances as a means of emotionally regulating myself and as a response to trauma. I have always done so since about the age of 14. What I have learned recently through a BPD diagnosis is that I use most frequently whenever I come across a particular difficult emotion or feeling - something that occurs quite often for me.

This has got to the point where it is actually aggravating my symptoms and also causing some issues in my life. I'm managing to keep a good job, but I can only wonder how long for if I continue to engage in these behaviors. 

  
One significant issue is that I feel quite certain that what I am going through is less like what we traditionally might view as an addiction, and more so a soothing behaviour - although I am no expert. 



My question to you fine folks is this - how did you manage to avoid substance abuse whilst dealing with BPD?

672,How can I deal with my bpd bfs outbursts? ,1715608169.0,"

Hi there, 

Been with my boyfriend now 2 years and we were friends before that for 5 years. Things are good most of the time, besides his occasional emotional outbursts. 
For some context, I have autism myself and he recently got his diagnosis of bpd 6 months ago. 

In the last 2 years he has ‚Äúbroken up‚Äù with me 2 times, what usually happens is he gets highly emotional about some subject, gets angry, blames me for imaginary things and leaves for 2 weeks. He comes back, apologizes and tries to fix things. 

The last time this happened was 4 months ago, and it was quite an ugly break up. I had to call his primary doctor because he was screaming that he wanted to end his life, after his doctor came to our home to check on him, he left again. 

Right after he left, he texted me he told me he‚Äôs going on vacation with his family for 3 weeks and he‚Äôs going to get drunk and have sex with every woman he sees. 

He had me blocked for about a week, then came back again. Wanted to talk things out. And actually since then things had been better than ever before. 


But now he left to go on that vacation with his family and last night he was suddenly not on his phone for several hours (when the rest of the whole vacation he had been texting every hour) I texted him that i was going to go to sleep and hope I could speak tomorrow morning. 


He texted me he was out on a walk with his brother and then he started drunk calling me, I picked up the first time and he was in some loud bar, he sounded very drunk. I texted him that I heard what was going on and it made me feel uncomfortable and if he could please let me know in the morning what‚Äôs going on. 

He blew up at me, cursing, name calling and told me to just block him and get this shit over with. I didn‚Äôt block him.

I left him be for the night and have yet to text him, but I‚Äôm really not sure what to do. 

How can I deal with this and what‚Äôs the best actions to take when he gets like this? 

I hope somebody can help and sorry for the long read

It's like I'm renarrativizing everything in hindsight and using this new story to disconnect. 

And I even realize why I'm doing it. My self-image is so shit I can't genuinely *feel* the good or bad I'm supposed to in the moment, so how I ""feel"" is the product of calculation and estimation.

I don't want any one thing because I'm so empty, but I *want* to want something because I understand the story of wanting leading to fulfillment. It's like I exist entirely semantically.

I hold it against people that they're able to be genuine while I'm this ever-changing empty shell that's screwed out of connection before even trying.

I've heard that you can't genuinely love others without loving yourself, so it just feels like I've been robbed twice. I don't get self-love and I don't feel the warmth of others' affection.

Im always the one that breaks it off with him and he‚Äôs always the one that comes back. 
Everytime i break it off it‚Äôs due to lack of attention from him and his obsession with other women. It‚Äôs as if cheating is some sort of fetish to him.

682,Boundaries! I don't owe anybody on the street to let them being able to talk to me and harass me!,1715598299.0,"
Boundaries! I don't owe anybody on the street to let them being able to talk to me and harass me!

went out the day before to get food over the weekend was keep getting unwanted attention and harassment on the street, I woke up today with massive migraine and back pain from having panic attacks of being fighting mode.

People warned me Totthengam Is horrible possible the worst part for sexual harassment. They were exactly right. I haven't even left the street corner and it has already been so much harassment and abuse.

During last summer, every single therapy session I went to was me complaining about getting harassed by ranmdoms on the street. I was constantly angry and in fighting mode. So I could never relax doesn't matter how many coffees I have. My therapist said it's lack of boundaries. Which I agree. Really lack of boundaries/ relationships/ society function due to panic and anxiety. I was so angry and agitated from all the men trying to talk to me by making compliments on how I look or what I do to get so ""fit"", I just awkwardly smile but they would not leave me alone. It is so stressful and because I have complex ptsd I really can't handle this kind of stress and social anxiety now. I'm not sure if it's just a London thing or it's because I'm unwell now that I have sexual harassment constantly, I don't remember ever experienced this when I was younger.

Also it's because I'm east Asian, traditional we are so polite and don't want to be rude, so we are seen as easily pushover. The stereotype is all correct. I'm also one of them who don't know how to say no. When I do say no is when I get so overloaded with anger I would respond with a violent physical fight and just want to carry weapon to go out or I would not go out at all.

I would get so anxious on the street or be seen in public because people look at me, and I would start to act really anxious and nervous and start to do yoga and circus to calm down, and then people would stare at me even more

I am so tired and stressed. I can't function in a society alone in the street walking around unless I have a big dog or a man protecting me. Unfortunately I don't have them. I am serious considering talking to a hospital to get permission to get a guide dog so people on the street can leave me alone! And I am not even a dog person I love cats.

When I went out to get food so many men tried to talk to me, I'm not dressed in any way that's not appropriate for the weather. The more these people start to harass me because how I look or because I dare to expose skin to get some sunlight for depression treatment the more angry I get, and the more I just want to strip naked in public because it's a revenge anger of mine. I hate it when people in public shame me for how I look. I just have an overwhelming urge to go fully nude in public and welcome all the harassment and heal the shame

I'm aware perhaps other women can deal with it better than I do because they are not suffering from the same long term condition as I do. I was told just say no no no like a broken record or say please leave me alone you are making me really uncomfortable and violated. I think it's because I'm Chinese and in our culture we don't confront people like that it's seen as rude so I have a lot of trouble functioning in western society, in the street where the predators are everywhere.

I get into survival mode as if I have to fight predators in the concrete jungle in London when I go on the streets. I can't imagine if I take the public transportation alone now how bad it can get in London.

Also the police dont have th√© resources to take sexual harassment and assault seriously. The previous perpetrator on the bus was never caught and the police keeps asking for my DNA which I have reservations to give due to data privacy concerns.

I am so tired of living like this I just want to pack up and move to somewhere isolated or with a smaller community where I can be left alone with no stress triggers. I noticed with my condition I cannot handle any emotional turbulence and I get overwhelmed easily with anger and overstimulation.

I know it's expected to be treated like this when you are weirdly behaved and dressed and can't fit into society norm.

the second time she texted less again and then broke up with me. she said she had stress fever and has to think about a lot of stuff. she also told me that she doesnt want to see me. i went to her house again (stupid me - i hoped it would resolve the issue again) she was very cold, i could not solve anything. same night she blocked me everywhere.

It seems like no matter how much I tell people what my problems are they just don't get it. Granted I do beat around the bush but it's not that hard to tell which bush I'm circling. Sometimes it seems like I could fully spell it out and still no one would understand what I'm saying let alone why. Sometimes it seems like no one would care even if they did. I wish I had someone who really got it. Someone who didn't judge me and won't ditch me just because I'm tired of trying to change for the sake of other people's comfort. I don't want to get better anymore. Sometimes i think that i never really did. Ive just always been afraid that people will leave. But people leave any way regardless of how agreeable you are. Maybe later in life I'll feel more inclined to change and try again to do the work. Maybe by then I'll be ready to be more honest. But for now I'm done. I'm not biting my tongue anymore.

Basically I knew something was going on with my friend, but I never suspected BPD. I have read some about BPD however.

Anyway, so lately she has been telling me who she thinks I should and shouldn't be friends with. Without using certain words to describe this, it just feels a bit smothering. I have my own issues I'm currently addressing, and I am feeling well enough to use the head I was given on my own two shoulders. But she has seen me at my worst and I've seen her when she wasn't doing so well either. And I can tell she's currently struggling.  
  
Anyway, so I'm doing well and I do believe this friendship is worth maintaining. She is quick to apologize when she realizes she has said something or done something out of turn. Likewise I apologize if I do or say something wrong as well.

The problem is she seems to be telling me I should or shouldn't be friends with certain people she either 1. knows personally or 2. knows of based on things I said when I wasn't doing so well

I believe if I think things through carefully, I can convey my thoughts to her in a way that she will receive well. I just feel like I need some advice if at all possible.

697,? listening when talking ?!,1715583114.0,"i‚Äôm upset and pissed off if someone is on their phone, not paying attention or just deliberately responding ‚Äúyes, yes‚Äù to end our conversation when i want to talk about something that‚Äôs on my mind.

i‚Äôm not really that talkative or have things to rant about 24/7, but when I do, i need to make sure i‚Äôm being understood and listened too. this varies from fuckass rap beef to talking about my disorder or depression .

this was prompted by just talking to my mom about how I view my life. I know it‚Äôs 2:00am, you‚Äôre eating and tired. all you want to do is sleep or relax (which is scrolling on your phone but i personally think your daughter is more important than that) but i can‚Äôt help getting upset when I can see subtle mood changes. she was just signing something for me (i‚Äôm underage) and I just started talking about how I don‚Äôt see myself doing anything with my life. I let her know it was gonna be short. just needed to get it off my chest

she was just yesing everything i said being cold. i know how she‚Äôs like and i can notice sudden shifts in her demeanour. after i was done (didn‚Äôt tell her I was) she said ‚Äúbye, i‚Äôll see you later.‚Äù

look, i do what she does sometimes whenever i‚Äôm busy. she didn‚Äôt seem particularly busy nor did she tell me she‚Äôs overwhelmed and can‚Äôt talk rn (which i understand most of the time).

i genuinely get upset whenever this happens. most of the time she does this as she wants me to go to sleep. but is sleep more important than my feelings?? is waking up for school on time more than me potentially killing myself??? apparently so

she‚Äôs like my best friend. i tell her everything. i don‚Äôt talk about these things with anyone else other than myself.

i prioritize my feelings and thoughts over tasks that i complete. i don‚Äôt give a fuck about school, i care about my mental health at this moment. apparently she thinks of me in the opposite. this has happened multiple times, as minor as it is, i would‚Äôve died each time it happened if i wasn‚Äôt a coward. if a gun was next to me I would have 100% done it.

699,I miss my ex girlfriend ,1715581628.0,"She gave me someone to be and loved me unconditionally for being what she saw I was. We were kids, meet in middle school, dating in high school and my senior year was the last I‚Äôd see of her‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve tried finding something similar to what I had with her but no one compares. She was so forceful with her love, it was so addictive. I never really felt loved growing up in an unstable household. But she gave me this level of love that I‚Äôd never experienced and I was so desperate to keep it.

Unfortunately negative feelings arose. I started to feel as if I wasn‚Äôt enough for her, that I couldn‚Äôt satisfy her (especially sexually), and I wasn‚Äôt what she thought I was. And another problem I had was nodding my head and saying yes to any thing she asked. In my mind saying no was going to risk our relationship and I couldn‚Äôt do that.

BUT THEN I PUSHED HER AWAY LIKE I DO WITH EVERYONE.

I broke up with her after not being able to handle a poly relationship with her. Then we had a spark again the fall of my senior year and I almost got back with her. But I drove her home that night, walked her to her door, told her I couldn‚Äôt continue this kiss and touch game we had going, and that I wasn‚Äôt taking her to prom. And that‚Äôs the last I really spoke to her.

She left me a letter. I never read it. I let my friend read it and let her determine if I really needed those words. She disposed of the letter.

I‚Äôm going into my Sophomore year of college now and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her. I still crave the affection I felt from her. The late calls that I‚Äôd spend pacing in my bedroom with the biggest smile on my face, hearing her beautiful voice on the other line. And god fucking Christ, I miss holding her and kissing her, her laugh! Fuck this! 

I wish I knew what to do! Part of me wants to just drive over to her house and break down at her feet and let her kill me there. But no! My cowedly self is left driving down her neighborhood in the middle of the night and reading our old snap chat logs before being spent into a spiral with shame and regret.

I fucked it up. I‚Äôm the one who didn‚Äôt set boundaries. I‚Äôm the one who lied if it made her happy. My whole goal was to to make sure she was happy at any cost. The cost of my time, money, energy, emotional support, changes of my character, I‚Äôd do it all for her, she was worth it.  But it just made me collapse as parts of myself start to fight back and I was left in a horrible state of cognitive dissonance.

But I have severe anxiety, I have a hard time doing anything on my own, and I mirror people. 

So, if other people are spontaneous (usually others I meet with BPD or Bipolar.) I am a force to be wreck-in with. I am spontaneous, I spend money, I get so drunk and/or I do drugs. While still playing the mom and taking care of them to the best of my ability. In this scenario I am wild and outgoing, anxiety is nearly nonexistent. 

But if the other person is calm, of sound mind in some sort of way, then I am calm and collected and I have this need to take care of them and make sure their mental health is considered. In this scenario I am outgoing, I feel like I have to be to take care of those I‚Äôm with. 

The thing is, someone in my life I‚Äôve recently met IS that first person, and I want to do badly ruin my life now. It‚Äôs like her sheer presence brings me so much happiness and I want to go off the rails with her. But also, that isn‚Äôt necessarily an option.

Now, i know these people are angry and hurt by their experiences. I can‚Äôt deny that there are some awful people out there, and i can unfortunately admit that even i have been awful to those i care about. I wouldn‚Äôt blame a lot of people who have been around me for joining a group similar to this one i‚Äôm in and being equally as cruel about me. 

But god it sucks to see it all. I know i should have left the second i realised i wasn‚Äôt going to find any advice for people actually still in relationships.

Reading all those opinions of us, saying how we‚Äôre toxic and evil and undeserving of love. Seeing just how many people agree with those ideas. Seeing how many people just say the same things over and over again.

Is it all true? Is that all we do? Ruin people‚Äôs lives? Or are these just angry, hurting people just venting about their experiences? I‚Äôd like to hope it‚Äôs the second but honestly when you see thousands of comments and posts about how no one with bpd could ever be a good person to have in your life you start to believe it. 

I can‚Äôt get those posts and comments out of my head. Every interaction i have now i take it back to that group. I imagine seeing one of those gut wrenching posts about me, about what i‚Äôve done. It kills me. Splitting is hard enough as it is. To live with the guilt of what you‚Äôve said and done while you‚Äôre in that moment is hard enough as it is.

I feel like the only way ill be happy is if this time all of my friends stay and understand my mental illness. That I get a better partner this time. If that isn't a guarantee to happen then what the fuck is the point in leaving when our lives are so tied together?

Like I've known him since I was 12. Part of all of my core memories. There for a lot of the ""firsts"". I feel everything and I hate how some days I'm ok with him not caring and it being clear he's not good for me

But today it hurts like hell like how the fuck can you go from passion to nothing? To feeling like room mates? How can that happen??? I just wish I had a neurotypical brain where it's ""just a feeling that passes""

He was my FP. My everything. Some days I hate his guts other days I cry and long and mourn for the man I thought was my best friend. I've been in therapy for a year almost two now but fuck

It wasn't until I was diagnosed with bpd that I finally understood why I felt so different or more dramatic. I am a naturally calm person and always have been but when I am triggered and experiencing a breakdown, it's the most intense thing I think anyone could witness or experience. It's like I loose all control of my emotions and it all flows out at once, and I am completely inconsolable.

719,Obsession? FP? Something unrelated to BPD? ,1715571519.0,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been trying to process some emotions lately‚Ä¶ and for like a year now about a specific person. I‚Äôm 25 (f) and have been very (like very very) into my older professor/advisor for quite some time. 

****huge note**** I am SUPER aware that not only is this inappropriate and wrong for many reasons, he is also married and easily twice my age**** he has never reciprocated******

I‚Äôll call the professor M. We first met around Covid for some virtual advising and hit it off immediately. I really appreciate him for making a tough time easier on me. Once classes opened back up I took a semester and we chatted a normal amount for a student and advisor. When it came time to setting up the following semester, it just so happened that he would be teaching a class I needed and wanted to take. 


I‚Äôm unsure if it was his passion, enthusiasm, laid back energy, kindness, intrigue, etc but something during that class caused me to develop a MAJOR crush on him. I told my friends but kept it to myself otherwise. The class just so happens to be a hyper fixation/passion of mine, as well as my literal major. We got on super well, chatted each day after class, tossed around theories in the field, talked about publishing‚Äôs we had found, made jokes and talked about minor personal anecdotes sprinkled throughout. By the end of the semester I was pretty much ‚Äúin love with him‚Äù. 

I wrote him a really nice sincere note on my final exam saying that I appreciated the entire experience of the class and am looking forward to the next semester, nothing mushy or obsessive. In order to allow me to tack on a minor and graduate within a year he overrode a bunch of prereq‚Äôs for me so I could take his class specifically that met multiple degree requirements. 

That was something I may have ran with mentally and thought was special even if I rationally know it probably wasn‚Äôt. Next semester is here (current) and we‚Äôve maintained a sort of ‚Äúbuddy buddy‚Äù rapport, and after class chats, etc. 

As I briefly mentioned above, he is exactly or just over double my age, has at least one child in my age group, is seemingly happily married (doesn‚Äôt wear a ring as a friend pointed out), and is my professor. And advisor! 

I talk about him with anyone and tell them ‚Äúomg I‚Äôm so in love w him‚Äù and they usually think I‚Äôm joking. I‚Äôve read lots of his published works. I‚Äôve taken interest in his specialization. I also happen to find him attractive, more than just physically. He has a very calming and safe energy where nothing is too drastic or traumatic and it‚Äôs so nice to be around considering my history with people who were so intense. 

I‚Äôve cried about the fact that I know it‚Äôs never gonna happen, hated myself for being young or ugly or not smart enough or skinny enough, as if any of this would change anything. I hope this isn‚Äôt too much info but I‚Äôve definitely thought about him while *-* pretty much exclusively. 

I find myself knowing in my actual brain that this is far fetched, wrong, unlikely if not impossible, and just silly but I can‚Äôt help but think of him like a school girl crush. But maybe a bit too obsessive. I tried to be pretty straight forward but can be a little more open if it helps. 

I‚Äôm just curious if this is sounding like an obsession or an FP situation since I genuinely feel pain and sadness when I realize we aren‚Äôt real or close or eve going to be anything more. Or if this is just me falling for someone who finally makes me feel safe but also encourages and shared my passions.

727,Somewhat proud of myself,1715568777.0,"TLDR
For the first time in my life I managed to stay silent and not get actively angry when we got put down and ignored. I'm quite proud.


A lot of my life I've been a very angry person, everything has been enraged me and I used to tend to rant a lot whenever I was enraged. I've seen psychologists and been on anti depressants most of my life and they've somewhat reduced the anger but I've always had an impulse issue and reacted before thinking. 

I've been seeing a psychologist for about a year now and on and off meds (currently off for reasons) 

Yesterday at my mother in law's house for mother's Day my husband kept trying to talk about his new job. His sister kept being rude by talking over him, undermining him, making snide comments and interrupting him constantly and usually this would make me visibly react and make rude angry comments back but I somehow even without my medications managed to ignore it and keep my mouth shut.

I've found more and more recently I'll try to walk away from situations that make me angry or not comment probably for the first time in my entire life. This is while not even taking my antidepressants. 

Instead I talked to my husband afterwards about how we're both trying to work on ourselves and need people around who are going to lift us up not try to tear us down.

I'm not really sure what's caused the sudden change now in my life as opposed to other times I've tried but I'm quite proud of myself for ignoring the snide comments our way. ",Successful_Sample209,,False,1cqp292,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cqp292/somewhat_proud_of_myself/

I'm having a rough night. My partner has been really supportive. Left me alone for a bit like I usually want then asked me how I was feeling and if I wanted to talk about it. 

I told them, not good, yeah I want to talk about it. 

Then I'm pretty sure I disassociated because the next thing I knew my partner was telling me they were leaving the room to go do one of their hobbies and would be back later. 

I don't feel like any time passed since I said I wasn't doing good and wanted to talk about it but I know for a fact I disassociate when I'm struggling so I'm presuming that's what has happened. 

Now I feel so lonely and ignored and I don't want to talk to my partner about anything anymore. I know this is my BPD, it's a common symptom I get and I'm so angry at myself for not just being able to tell my partner what's going on and how I'm feeling. 

I wonder how much time passed, did we even talk or did I just shut down for an hour then my partner decided to live their life as normal like we've discussed they should do a million times before. If that's what happened then why do I feel so damn sure I asked for help and they ignored me even though they've never ignored my need for help in the past but emotionally right now all I can think about is how I said I want to talk about it and they responded by leaving the room for a hobby.

I am looking for support/suggestions if you have them. 

Like many of you, I usually tend to refer to myself as hypersexual. Most of the time I want sex all of the time, back to back, inconvenient times, rough/kinky. I‚Äôm in a bdsm dynamic with my partner and he is also hypersexual. However lately I‚Äôve found myself just emotionally feeling like absolute shit. Mood swings worse than ever, stressed all the time. Usually I turn to sex to help alleviate stress and my partner knows this and has been initiating, will offer I can come have a quickie before work or something but despite me not wanting to, I feel like since I‚Äôm normally so hypersexual just can‚Äôt say no? I know it‚Äôs not the most rational and I think my bf would be okay with me not wanting to but I‚Äôm scared. 

 My ex used coercion to get me to sleep with him when I was tired and didn‚Äôt feel like it. Saying if I didn‚Äôt want to sleep with him I should just go home after I drove him home and just wanted to cuddle between school and work. That made me end up saying yes even when I didn‚Äôt want to, I would usually end up feeling like shit and crying alone afterwards. Now I‚Äôm noticing the same pattern of saying yes when I don‚Äôt want to and feeling bad despite my current bf actually caring about consent. Some part of my brain tells me that since he‚Äôs hypersexual too if I don‚Äôt want to sleep with him for a week or so and he‚Äôs said he needs sex usually 3-4 times a week to feel satisfied that he‚Äôll just go get it elsewhere. I know it‚Äôs not rational but I can‚Äôt get past it. I keep doing it anyways and feeling bad and idk what to do. It‚Äôs hard when he feels good after and I don‚Äôt want to tell him I don‚Äôt.

I was honestly taking a sense of pride in being able to live in my head that I can only describe now as dangerous. 

I was listening to a podcast that caused me to examine where/when I started feeling so stuck. And after literally writing it down, it suddenly grounded me and reminded me I was real, I guess ? And after a few moments of euphoria and just feeling happy to be alive, I calmed down. But the fact that I was in such a impressionable state for so long without realizing it is scary to me. Like I couldnt see my way out. And I just started to question and honestly abandon all of the things I worked so hard to stabilize (stopped therapy, stopped working out, stopped journaling, etc) To say I was on a slippery slope is probably an understatement. 
 I feel like Ive had this realization before of the importance of finding things to ground me and sticking to them in spite of how I may feel, but it was like I was so caught up in my own mind, I guess I forgot. The only way I could describe my state of being is just foggy. Like everything felt like it had this fog in the way. 

Ive taken up the theory that myself and others with BPD are definitely in tune with some spiritual part of ourselves that wants more out of this life that we are faced with.

.
Of note: I'm engaged and non-monogamous.

Two weeks ago, I met someone through a threesome with my really good friend. My friend (Z) and the third (S) were close, but had an unrelated falling out. I continued seeing S after the falling out with Z's blessing, but it still felt wrong. 

I am also engaged to D. D and I have a pretty tame/infrequent sex life. I enjoy what we do, but I also have a lot of sexual trauma, and have battled with really severe sex addiction in the past. This has caused conflict between us in the past with no easy answer. I also know that seeing me spend days hooking up with S bothered D a bit. 

S and I had *incredible* sexual chemistry. The kind of experiences you think of for years after. We explored a lot of mutual kinks that are a bit fringe and niche. It was absolutely amazing. We also started being more casually intimate --cuddling, going on walks, pda, etc. It was definitely never headed to dating/a relationship, but the it was a weirdly romantic time. The problem is, S *reaaallllyyy* sucks as a person. Arrogant, sexist, inappropriately pervy, and a lot of other things. I realized after the first time that we hooked up alone that I wasn't the biggest fan of them, but became absolutely infatuated with them. With their touch and the things they did. 

I started to neglect things I need to do in a very short time frame. I would linger at S's and try to block out the world as they talked nonstop about the most boring/annoying things. I would force myself to laugh or make myself palatable to this person I found morally reprehensible. Today I reached my limit and found myself struggling to maintain the fa√ßade. I realized I was self sabotaging, and sent them a message saying I wasn't seeing them anymore.

Now I'm really sad. I really proud of myself for recognizing what was happening and taking action towards my healing, but I feel empty now. I'm not sure why I'm writing this, even. I think I just needed to get it out.",coomquing,,False,1cqmkb3,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cqmkb3/broke_it_off_with_a_whirlwind_lover_and_feeling/

748,WHY AM I CLINICALLY DRAMATIC ,1715560505.0,"I usually consider myself pretty self-aware and able to keep my BPD under control for like 80% of the time.

Not yesterday tho.

We have an upcoming school trip, me and 3 more girls from my class will be going and we would be staying at a hotel.
Yesterday our teacher texted us in the group chat to ask us about our room arrangements, and who we wanna be in a room with. (Just to clarify, there are only double rooms and triple rooms.)
Girl 1# immediately said she is gonna be with girl 2# in a room.
And im like ""oh okay. Thats fine. No problem. I can ask girl 3# to be in a room with her.""

Girl #3 asks the other girls if she can be in a triple room with them.

Oh.

Oh.

RAGE. RAGE. RAGE.

FEELING OF BEING REJECTED.

Do they hate me so much they dont wanna be in a room with me? Am i that unlikable?? Why dont they like me?? What did i do??

I cried, had a breakdown, unfollowed and blocked everyone from my class (even people who have nothing to do with the trip).

And now i realize how over the top my reaction was!

Idk what to do now, since i already have a tendency to block people in an episode and then follow them back shamefully after i calmed down and i dont know what to tell them if they ask why did i blocked them.

Basically i fucked up! Big time!

Or there are those times with strangers‚Äîmaybe they're outright rude, or I just perceive them to be‚Äîand I switch to being full-on confrontational. Is this switch a common trait in quiet BPD?
