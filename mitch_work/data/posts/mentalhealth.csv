To feel mentally ill has honestly got to be the biggest curse ,1716150922.0,"I’m at the point in life where I feel so much grief. I feel so much grief over the person I could’ve been have I grown up in a better environment. Had I grew up with parents who were emotionally intelligent and took consideration of my emotional and mental needs. I get tired of hearing “you need to get over your past”, when someone’s past is a major part of them. I’m not saying it should be a reflection but it’s definitely hard. I’m such an emotional over thinker and it’s exhausting. I just feel as if I’m so detained and there’s nothing I can do at the moment to escape not feeling so down about my life. The biggest thing I want in life is be financially stable and successful.

I feel empty if i am not waiting for something,1716150854.0,"I don't understand how this works, but I don't experience anything exept nothing if i don't wait for something 

For example, a year ago my phone was broken and i was waiting for my birthday to get a new one, then - emptiness 

Same when I was waiting for Christmas, after - nothing 

Now - i had a crush on one girl and waited for a month, feeling emotions as usual, then after confession (and my first ever rejection) - I feel empty again 

How do i stop this feeling?

Or will life will always keep me waiting?

Struggling with the state of my country,1716150644.0,"Hey everyone,

I hope everyone in the world is doing good in their own way. Me, it's a bit complicated.

Right now my life is going great in a lot of ways: I have a job that pays well, I'll be moving out of my parent's house to my own place, I'm budgeting and avoiding impulse buying, all of that sort of stuff.

But at the same time, I'm struggling.

When I read the news, or just talk to my friends, it seems like everything in my country (I'm American) is going to shit. We have two people running for president who probably aren't fit for the office, nasty and vitriolic political discourse, and a media that constantly gives us things to be sad/mad about. All the while the rest of the world stares on as if we're some sort of circus act. I have a lot of non-American friends, and they can't help but remind me of the state we're in. 

Even if America isn't really all that bad and the media is just messing with us, it still feels hard to handle sometimes. I've tried cutting out the news, but it's almost impossible to avoid. How can I focus on improving myself if I feel like the world is going to end?

At the end of the day, I may never know, but I just want to put my feelings out there and to know there are people out there who feel similar to me.

Is my inteligence causing me to become crazy,1716149779.0,"19M
I myself think that i am dumb af with certain things. Like extreme stubborness. Inability to change currect action, even tho there are more important things to do.

Little childhood background. Told by everyone i was gifted, very smart child. Learned to write and read at the age of 4-5. Basicaly nonverbal, wouldnt want to talk with anybody, extreme stuttering, scared of everything -> very curios and wanted to know everything about my surroundings and the world. Always asking questions. Didnt have any friends bcs i was wierd. Spent around 8 hours a day building legos/solving puzzlez. Forgetting to eat/sleep. Extremly determined. But if i wasnt good at something first try, i was the maddest person on the planet -> would do anything of my power to actually solve my problem. This resulted in extreme agression towards anyone who would intervine with my current problemsolving session. When i was doing my first iq test. Some of these questions vere actually hard, and maybe for the first time in my life i became challenged, trying to do everything in my power to complete the test. Result? 130ish. My parents were shocked, and said i need to attend gramar school. So as 10/11 year old i started my first year in grammar school. Fast forward to current day i am really paranoid, everyone is againts me, i can tell how fake and fabricated conversations in my school are. Noone is genuene. But then, i myself am unable to have smalltalk, i learned that people need smalltalk to connect, but i just cant do that. Im having a hard time replying to my surroundings overthinking everx aspect of my intination, word selections everything, with people i care about(parents, gf, couple my friends) i feel like a robot, having my place, doing the same things every day, i dont even know what day is it, i wxperience extreme time blindness. I always need to do something in order to not let my mind wander around my dark future thoughts. I want to sleep but think of my broken bracelet from a month ago, i am like nah lets do it tomorow, but then i cant sleep thinking about it for 40 minutes with my eyes closed, rumbling in bed forcing myself to sleep, impossible. I get up and repair my bracelet, its 2:45 in the moring and my alarm goes of in less than 4 hours. I am like, how i was just watching a video from 3 blue 1 borwn like 30 minutes ago, turns out its been 4 hours :)) i reflect, what did i actually do. My mind then fabricates these fake memories of actually studying for physics test, texting my friend and watching a hockey match with my parent and went to sleep. Wrong i havent done any of that now in the morning i am stressing having intense halucinations my mind wanders of to extreme depths, seeing images of myself kicked out of the house, homeless, begging for food, then i see my present self bringing my homeless self a hotdog. WHICH IS SOMETHING I DID LIKE 2 YEARS AGO AND WANTED TO HELP A HOMELESS MAN OUT. Seeing this ultimate cycle of life gives me chills. I believe we are all conected somehow. But thats not the point. I dont even know where i was going with this anymore. My mind is racing at milion mph and sometimes i cant fabricate single thought or keep simple instructions in my mind like please bring a shampoo to the bottom bathroom my mum says. I get distracted by taking a dump, then forgetting completely, cuz in my mind i see myself handing my mum the shampoo and her thaking for my service. THIS IS EVEN WORSE IN MORNING, i see myself getting up, eating breakfast, texting my gf good morning text, UNTIL I REALISED IT WAS ALL JUST A WIERD DREAM AND I OVERSELPT 40 MINUTES. Dont even get me started on my dreams, these are to most complex storylines with multiple parts since dreamworld passes slowly compared to realworld time so sometime i csnt wait for second part of my dream which mostly happens next evening i go to sleep, i am now keeping track of multiple dream plotlines where in one me and my friends have our own comunity survival typa thing. My fav dreamseries :D. Honestly i cant unsee how depressing and dystopian current world-state is. Honestly i see myself dead in nomore than 10 years during ww3 where trump gets elected, refuses to help eu with russia invading The baltic states. I was believing i was going dummer and dummer. I resit my iq test, spend like 3 hours answering questions, 144. I started researching if inteligent people go crazy, found a lot of evidence, thats why i am asking, could this be my case??
I havent told these things my psychologist, dont wanna endup in psychward lol, currently we are discusing my adhd, along  ocd i was diagnosed with as a child.
My room is a complete mess, in eyes of a stranger, in my i eyes, my solution for grasp on reality. Empty bag of chips? Helps me remember that time was watching anime with my gf. Nail polish remover at my desk? Me painting my nails for the first time. Dirty clothes lying on the ground?Ii remeber that time i wore it as a part of my outfit on ceetain hangouts with friends. Where my parents see mess, i see my past self, remebering my life, helps my mind not to wander of when i think of these past heartwarming events. Honestly I want things to end, but i cant imagine getting my family friends and gf this sad. Im so lost and dont know what to do

Was I neglected? (sorry for the long post),1716148982.0,"As a child I was in day care from the age of 3 (preschool)to the age of 10(4th grade) for at least 12 hours a day on all weekdays. When I was in preschool I would start at 6 am and stay until 7pm when my parents would pick my brother and I up and we would then go to bed at 8 or 8:30pm. As we grew up we switched to before school care, school, and then after school care. School from kindergarten to about to second grade we had before school care in our school lunch room until it got canceled because we were one of the only families that would go, there were about 14 kids that would go to the morning care. But during that time we would get to school at 6:30 to 7:00, the morning care would start at 7:00 so my brother and I would just wait outside the school on the sidewalk. The actual school day would start at 8:00, we would then start after school care at 3:00. The after school daycare would start at 3:00 and end at 7:30 but most days we would be there until 8pm. After the morning care was canceled my brother and I would just walk ourselves to school, our parents would leave at 6-6:30ish. We would leave the house at 7:30 and normally get there early and would wait outside until school started,but the after school hours were still the same. This went on untill 4th grade when we would just walk ourselves to and from school everyday. Also on every school holiday we would also be at day care until 4th grade. During summer time we would also go to daycare every weekday. Also during this time from the age of 4-5 we would dress ourselves, make our own meals, and be responsible for all of our own health. After 4th grade we would do all the same but we would start waking ourselves up in the morning, and we would be responsible for cooking dinner for the family on weekdays and weekends. During covid when my parents worked from home (5th grade) I had gotten very depressed and I wouldn't feed myself, and because of that I would be very tired and not be able to get out of bed without either passing out or becoming very nauseous. My parents would get very mad at me for this and they would tell me to feed myself even when i was too sick to get up and I would just have to crawl to get food(my parents wouldn't bring me food or try to take care of me). Also in 4th grade i fractured my wrist and wasn't taken to the doctor untill weeks later because my parents didn't believe me when I said it was broken, this cause my wrist to start healing incorrectly and I had to have a full arm cast instead of just a lower arm cast. During this time i still had all the same responsibilities. I would also like to mention that when I was in elementary school we wouldn't have any food to pack for lunch so I would either have free crackers and candies from restaurants that I would steal. Or I would use birthday money to buy school food. I now have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and because I have not had any serious traumatic or abusive events I am wondering if this is the reason or if I am just forgetting something. I also was once thrown into a car by my father which caused me to have two dead front teeth, I don't remember this event exactly but I do remember all that happens after wards. Any way if anyone has an idea of weather or not this is related to my bpd i would really appreciate the insight.

I’m having random waves of flattening sadness and anger is this normal,1716147114.0,"I’ve been suffering from childhood abuse all my life up until about maybe two months ago when I split ways with my dad and I’ve never seen him since he’d never let me try go and diagnose for anything other then anxiety as he’d always get in the way of it and block it as he thought mental health was just a sick joke and it made you look weak, which me and my mum thought was utterly stupid so I do not know what I’m feeling right now. This is just a small description of what I’ve been through to gauge an answer on the reason to why I’m feeling these weird waves of emotions. I’ve come here to see if I should check up on myself and see if I have any mental health problem or if this is just a thing that will hit you after realising how bad I was treated after all those 14 years of coercive controlling,narcissistic behaviour witnessing my mum get harmed physically 
And verbal abuse,I feel like there’s a high chance I’m not right in the head as my mum now suffers from ptsd, depression , anxiety etc etc and I feel like it would be reasonable if I also had problems or if this is just a wall of realisation uppercutting me in the head. In these waves I feel depressive,sadness,anger,anxiety and confusion,is this normal orrrr???

Is this platonic love or “love” love (romantic),1716146508.0,"Hi all, 

So I have this friend from work with whom I talk daily since Dec last year. We have shared almost all of our darkest secrets and we call each other brothers. 

Last weekend he called folks from work for a weekend party. He was really busy with them (and called our common friend “family away from family”). This is a regular pattern with me that whenever he gets too comfortable and talks with his other friends, I become extremely jealous. Last week he was saying words like “bro you are the best” “you are my family” and it hit me so hard. I was depressed and felt that in this friendship, I don’t mean that much to him as he means to me. 

This is so weird. Is this normal friendship jealousy? 

1. I always wait for his calls. Whenever he calls, my mood lightens up and my day becomes happier. It’s fixed he will call for sure, but then again I am just waiting and waiting and thinking about him all day. 

2. He has a habit of saying “bro”, “you are so good bro” “you are the best boi” etc to others. But still I feel jealous. 

Am I experiencing platonic love? I will be honest here, I sometimes watch gay porn but I have no romantic interest in men. I sometimes think about hugging him and all. But I don’t want to suck his dick. I just want to cuddle him like a kid, kiss him on the head and say that I am lucky to have a friend like him. I just want happiness for him is all.

Does being sexualized as a child effect you like this?,1716142747.0,"As an adult i am scared of intimacy, being sexualized, and just relationships in general, I think it might have something to do with my childhood but idk. So as a kid I talked to random strangers online and got groomed. But I always had a feeling it was wrong so I never let them like do anything sexual. But they still sexualized me despite saying it made me uncomfortable. And me being uncomfortable with sexual stuff made them sexualize me more, because I was so “innocent, pure, and quirky”. There was one particular guy that I talked to for 2 years ish, from age 14-16, he was 2 years older than me. He confessed his love for me so many times and dated my friend and other people to make me jealous, but it didn’t work because I absolutely hated him and wanted him to die. He’d always manipulate my friends and me saying stuff like “I should just commit suicide, no one would care anyways”. Please do. I remember praying to god that this man would kill himself, or die in some way. I told my friends I hated him and didn’t want to talk to him but they wouldn’t take no for an answer and kept making me talk to him. He said he had wet dreams about me and a bunch of other stuff happened and it all made me uncomfortable. I think It really made my personality switch. He’d always say how I was kind, pure, and innocent. And how I was so nice to everyone, so I just tried to be a total bitch. And I don’t know if I ever stopped. I was also sexualized by older men, growing up I worked at a restaurant with my mom when I was 13-14 ish, and old men would always compliment me but in a really weird way. “You’re so much prettier than your (adult) sister”. “You look like you’re old enough to run the bar!” And a bunch of other crap like that. I’ve had many other creepy coworkers since then, I think the most appalling one was “don’t worry daddy’s got you”- a 50 year old man after i made a mistake. But also as a kid I wasn’t allowed to hang out with my best friend (who was a boy) because my parents thought we’d do sexual acts together, MIND YOU THIS WAS LIKE 2ND-7TH GRADE. I remember bawling my eyes out in the church basement because I was so sickened that my parents would think that about me. I remember just wanting to not be sexualized. My dad also is kind of sexist and says stuff like; “when women started voting this country went to hell” “I can’t imagine being a women and being infertile, I mean that’s my only purpose” and just a bunch of stuff like that. I told him how I wanted to move to a city one day and just try it out and he was like but the end times!!! And so I said I’ve spent my whole childhood caring and grieving about politics and the end of the world, I’m so tired of caring, it’s not good for me to worry about that stuff. “Well you’ll be caring when they’re raping you!!” What. What the fuck? My parents are Christians and taught me what’s right and wrong from an early age so I think that’s just been drilled into my brain and effects the way I live now.

I was at a stop sign in an area I’d never been in and someone to the right who had the right of way stopped and let the person ahead of me go then they went. So my brain went there are four stop signs here. Which there were just not facing all four directions.

So then I started crossing and saw someone barrel towards and they hit the back of my car sending me spinning off the road. So the accident was my fault. But in my head even after I had been hit. I thought why the hell did they run that stop sign. I don’t know if it was my ADD (Now know as inactive-ADHD) or what because I really did see the intersection as a four way stop. But I’m not going to use my disability as an excuse though.

Anyways the insurance didn’t cover it because the insurance is in my parents names. Mine wasn’t on there. The car took me three years to save up for working tirelessly day after day after day. Now Sylphy is gone. I also have like $1000 so it is going to take me all summer if I get full time at work to buy another WRX.

But I really am just tired and exhausted. Calculus and other college classes just drained everything out of me. My car was probably the only thing that kept me going because of how enjoyable it was and I had so many plans to mod it for reliability and maybe get a nice exhaust. Now all that is down the drain.

I feel really distraught. I’ve cried five times in the past two weeks since it happened. Sylphy meant so much to me and now that she has just been ripped away from me. Not only that I failed the class because of the final as well so maybe I just shouldn’t have gone to college that day I don’t know. I also have one highschool class that I just stopped doing work for after the accident because I’m just sick of always working.

But everything I do now just doesn’t feel like it’s really worth it anymore. Like I wake up and just want to lay in bed all day. I don’t work out anymore. And I’m not happy about my job anymore. I just feel like shutting down and letting everything play out. There is nothing I wouldn’t do just to have my car back. Because after I lost it I realized that it was the only thing making me get up every day.",Legitimate-Factor-53,,False,1cvvuaa,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvvuaa/i_feel_empty_because_i_have_to_restart_from/

I think I was in a VERY dangerous Situation ,1716143014.0,"Didnt want to put anything in the title to not upset anyone.

So here it goes. Yesterday I went to an open air rave with lots of my friends. It was in the City but behind industry buildings so pretty secluded. At one point I needed to pee and since I want to have Peace while going I went a little further away from the music. There was an empty street which I followed and I found a spot between some trees which looked fine. There was a bit of trash laying around but nothing more. Or so I thought. I was looking very closely in the bushes because I wanted to make sure that no homeless people had their stuff their and then I saw someone. He was standing still, I couldnt see his face but his red tshirt. Because there was a parking lot from some building I thought he was standing behind a fence and guarding the buildings. I went back to the path/ street quickly and went a few more meters before I was comfortable with a spot. As I made my way back to my friends, this man comes out of the trees right at the spot I went in earlier. He had a Black jacket on so the only way I could see his tshirt beforehand was if he was facing the way I was on. I thought maybe he was another guest from the open air but he walked right past it. I was really shaken up afterwards and so happy I didnt have more drinks beforehand and wasnt Tipsy and was able to see him. The thought about what could have happened is since then in my head. I directly told my boyfriend and just went to the toilet with other Girls. I know that nobody would have heard me if something serious would have happened because everyone was drunk and the music was loud. I also think the man had Bad intentions because every normal would have made a Sound to draw attention to them if a woman is heading in their directions in the woods.

"20F, I’m exhausted and feel like I’ve completely lost hope in life",1716142697.0,When I was 2 my dad video taped my half sister naked in the bathroom without her knowing. My mom found out and of course left him. He paid off jail for a long time until I was 11 and he went to jail for 8 months. My dad really struggles with mental health I think and I’m the only thing he has. I love him because he’s my father but my sister is also my best friend and so important to me. It makes me uncomfortable cause I’m also a girl and my sister was young when it happened. I’m in college now and live with my mom with visits to my dad. I feel guilty cause I truly am all he has but it’s hard to deal with everything that has happened along with his sometimes difficult mental health issues. My mom is also my best friend but she regularly argues with me about everything in my life and I’m starting to become miserable. I go to college far so all my friends are far away and the only thing I really have in my hometown other than family and work is my boyfriend that I grew up with for 11 years. We grew up best friends and then we dated and it has been on and off for 4 years now. He also has suffered with mental health throughout our relationship and I always did my best to be there. He is always the one to leave me and he always has an excuse but quickly goes to other girls. He has 2 girl friends that he chose to stop talking to when we started dating and I didn’t question it. Then he started talking to them behind my back and it made me uncomfortable. They always text him even when we’re fully together without breaking up for over a year and just don’t respect me. They didn’t start texting him until the one broke up with her boyfriend which also makes me uncomfortable because she didn’t care when she had a boyfriend so why would she put me through that with mine? The first time we broke up I ended up being pregnant and during that he would leave me for those girls and a bunch of other girls along with dating apps. I went through the ab0rt1on alone a week before my birthday and my mom ended up finding out and hated him for it. The week after my birthday he told me he had cancer which was a lie but i believed him and started talking to him again. Currently he broke up with me the day before leaving for my past semester in college but throughout would text me and try to see me so i knew when i came back home he would try to talk to me. I love this guy i feel like ill never find anything like the connection i have with him and i cant let go. There are always other girls at this point and now when i ask him about the other girls he leaves me on open instead of reassuring me but my stupid self still wants to believe there isn’t anyone else. My dad texts me nonstop about seeing me and I feel guilty for not being there as often but then my mom also makes me feel guilty for not being with her all of the time but if I’m not perfect for my boyfriend and there whenever he possibly needs me then he will use it as a reason to leave me and to tell me I’m not worth staying. I can never be happy alone because I feel like someone always needs something from me or my boyfriend is doing something behind my back or someone is yelling at me for not being good enough. For the past year I have began to truly struggle with my mental health and I keep trying to find a bright side but at this point there isn’t one. I feel like people only use me for things and I always end up alone. Even my far away friends don’t exactly feel like true friends because I always feel left out.

Getting into a bodybuilding routine changed my life,1716141575.0,"Hi guys,

I just wanted to share a success story which might help others. I have been suffering with anxiety for years mainly due to a highly stressful job, which I have recently quit and found something much less stressful which could have also contributed. I also spiralled into deep depression from June last year to January this year.

Changing jobs aside I think the main factor I believe in my recovery was focusing on the gym and really throwing myself into it. When you go to the gym and start lifting weights, you have both long term gratification and instant gratification. You feel good when you’ve worked out but also you have an idea of what you want to look like in the future. I have become so focused on these short and long term goals it has taken over my negative thoughts and I am feeling so much better. 

It starts to take over small parts of your life, instead of skipping meals you focus on eating more food and eating healthily. You cut out all the things which could stop you achieving your goals such as alcohol and drugs which we all know are bad for your mental health in the long run. 

It actually got me off taking benzodiazepines because I had another way of getting the stress out of my body. I am basically off my SSRI now, only on the smallest dose available and I eventually plan on coming off altogether - I feel ready for it. 

You get tired from pushing yourself so it helps with the insomnia. It becomes somewhat of a lifestyle and I wake up looking forward to working out. 

I find it best to do it in the morning because my anxiety was always worse in the morning than the evening. When i go, I feel 10x better when I get home. Instead of googling about anxiety and sitting on Reddit talking about how awful the world is, you find yourself googling best exercises for chest, legs, shoulders, different types of workout styles etc. 

I would 100% anyone suffering with mental health to incorporate going to the gym and lifting weights 6 times per week. Put yourself and your body first. It might not cure you but it sure as well won’t hurt. I am much more confident now, enthusiastic and energetic. 

If you feel as though you don’t have the energy push yourself to spend 45 mins in the gym. What else are you going to spend that 45 mins doing? Sat watching Netflix, scrolling on tik tok, feeling worse about yourself? Go sit in your car for 5 minutes and if you still don’t have the energy to go, then don’t, but I guarantee once you’re in your gym gear and sat in your car and you will go. Spend some money on gym clothes, supplements etc. and then you will feel guilty for not going - it will encourage you. 

Just 5 months ago I was so low, no energy, not eating, and I gradually forced myself into this routine and I’ve never felt better. I hope this post brings some inspiration to others and sorry for the long paragraph. If anyone would like to chat about workout routines or how to get motivated just message me.

"Feeling hopeless, no resources",1716141407.0,"Hi, 

I would like to apologise in advance if this comes across as whiney or rambly.

I have been struggling a lot recently. I have anxiety, depression and ptsd. I have been described as neurotic and I would unfortunately have to agree.  

So here’s what’s been happening:

My marriage is breaking down and I am in contact with a solicitor trying to sort out a legal separation. (I have to be legally separated for 12 months before being granted a divorce in the country I live in).  I got married in the hopes of having the stability and family I never had as a child. I know it was stupid. Our differences are irreconcilable and they will never put me before their drinking. They have also told me that they dont want to make any changes because it is “too hard” so I am currently running myself ragged trying to save us from poverty. It is what it is. 

My remaining family members genuinely do not care about me. It’s not an exaggeration or pity party, it’s just a statement of fact. We grew up in terrible circumstances and as a result have gone our separate ways. 

I have a job that I previously loved but my manager does not like me. I have tried to be on his good side and complied with everything but I ended up on stress leave (which my manager encouraged me to go on). When I returned from leave, I was met with a “PIP” despite no issues being raised with my performance and passing my probation with no concerns last year. I am devastated and humiliated because I know what a PIP means for my long term career. A PIP is usually given after an extended period of time with poor performance and a minimum of 3 warnings, it basically means “we want to fire you but we can’t yet.” My colleagues were shocked to hear I had received this.

Given the divorce, it’s looking like I will have to sell my house and split the proceeds and with the state of finances in my country, there is a good chance I will not be able to afford even a 1 bedroom flat.  

My one thing that is keeping me going are my animals. They are my entire life and I love them with every fibre of my being.

I have a history of self harm and suicidal ideations. I thought I had kicked these when I was a teenager but they have resurfaced alongside stress induced hallucinations (I have never experienced this before but my gp is not concerned as I can tell instantly if it’s a hallucination.)

I have reached out to my gp multiple times and a local mental health organisation but there is little interest or support other than “take time off work and stop stressing.” and “if you tackle the source of the stress, the hallucinations will go away.”

I tried to explain that this is a crisis but they cannot help. One organisation did offer me an appointment for speaking therapy in about 2 weeks which was very kind of them as I can no longer afford my private therapist (I’m £900 into my overdraft and my car keeps breaking down)

I reached out to the only sister I remain close (ish) to and understandably she cannot help.

My friends are getting tired of me not being fun anymore and are getting noticeably irritated with me so I am distancing myself from them (I did try to tell them a bit about what’s going on but it doesn’t really make a difference.)

I can’t tell my workplace.

My world is falling apart but I can’t kill myself because I cannot trust my ex partner to take care of my animals. I also do not want my ex to lose out on my life insurance. If I cause my own death, they will not receive any money and I know they cannot afford the mortgage and bills alone. They do not love me but I do not want them to suffer.

I am lost and feel hopeless. Has anyone else experienced any of the above? Do you have any advice or can you share your story with me?

Thank you in advance and I sincerely apologise for any grammatical or spelling errors.

Trauma made me question sexuality,1716140673.0,"I (23 F) was abused physically and emotionally abused as kid, by mostly girls/women. After I graduated, Covid hit and that’s when I started feeling low, lonely and lost sense of purpose. I even had suicidal and self harm thoughts.

I found myself attracted to women, and desperate for an emotional connection and physical comfort. When I told my new therapist about me questioning sexuality, she told me to think why that might be since her approach is all about analysis. I came to a realization that the fact trauma was caused by women; nurses who tied me to the bed when I was in psych ward, students who bullied me, teachers who didn’t protect me and my mother who didn’t hug me enough as a child might be a factor that made me question sexuality as a way to cope.

I hope I’ll someday recover. For now, I’ll take my time to find myself, and enjoy life as it is. I’m sharing my story because I know someone out there is struggling, and to remind them they’re not alone in their journey of healing.

"Better looking & charismatic people made to feel ""wanted"" - results in better mental health",1716139387.0,"I work with huge numbers of people & have noticed a direct correlation between ""looks"" & charisma vs. being made to feel wanted.

Everyone who is considered by the majority to be ""good looking"" or ""pretty"" & has natural charisma (need both apparently) seems to get so much attention from others to the point where they have a non-stop social life, easier (not easy but EASIER) work life treated better by bosses, and never bored or lonely- while the stark contrast is that those who are average looking in the minds of the majority (or less) are treated with indifference, often left alone, have to work harder to keep bosses happy & harder to have a social life (often being impossible).

I've noticed the more charismatic tend to have things ""handed to them"" on a platter so to speak. That doesn't mean they don't work hard- it just means everything seems to slot in relatively easily & they have options.

Those with more attention are naturally happier & live full lives. It's not right. Yet they are blind to it & to the suffering of so many, just assuming everyone's the same.

It's incredibly frustrating. Another example of this is those who are naturally charismatic or good looking not needing to post on reddit for company, understanding, or attention, and thus don't get stressed by reddit's filters constantly deleting their posts that they take time to write.

I find this whole situation concerning as most people rarely are made to feel wanted & it damages health.

Most of my year during festival season either I was injured or had some kind fever so couldn't celebrate anything no got chances to make friends or interact with people. My birthday was also in Dec end, so never got a chance to celebrate in school. My parent were not strict normally but when I used to go out as high schooler (Class 8 to 10), they used to ask lot of question, so I kept myself to my room.

**Fast forward**:

Now I am Bangalore, people, chilling going out, what food do you  like, asking body count, asking how many places I have visited, which place did I like ? How many girlfriends did I had in past ? How many friends do you have ? Who is your best friend ? Where do you wanna go ?

What should I tell these people ? . That I am lonely person who did nothing apart from studying who is slowing heading towards su\[eye\]c\[eye\]de ?

Decided to try and write down my feelings. Any feedback? ,1716142183.0,"Day 1

Everything feels bad. Can't remember the last time I was happy, probably when I was 8 or something but I don't remember. School is going badly, I feel like I don't fit in anywhere.

I'm weird and different.

I am never completely happy. There is always something there to ruin my day. Is it a girl? Is it that I'm behaving rudely? Is it that I don't fit in?

I believe what everyone says, doesn't matter if they say it was a joke or they didn't mean it. If they say something, it's clear they've noticed it in me.

I don't know if I want to be different or normal, maybe that's a good thing? You may stand out from the rest of the population, but is that a good or bad thing?

I'm confused, feel like I'm living the same day over and over again.

(I should add in here, we aren't technically long distance, just on the other side of the city we live in from each other, so we really only get to see each other on weekends, so the tone I'm talking about is over texting) my fear is of them leaving, which as I type this seems somewhat ridiculous, cause as I go back through texts they say they love, and appreciate me.

Struggling with two parts of myself that are not integrated Dissociation Dpdr Depersonalization,1716140803.0,"Hi I am writing this as I am struggling with some symptoms of mental illness, basically my therapist said that I have two parts of myself that are not integrated, I dont have DID, but there are some incongruences that are annoying me too much:

The number one personality is me when I was maybe 20yrs old, I was very restless, I dindnt know what I wanted to do with my life, and had poor control of my emotions, making me not so functional, but there were good things too, I felt connection to my family and friends, but at the same time I had poor limits and it was easy for me to be mistreated and I wouldnt even notice. Also my perception in this one much more focused in the sensorial stimulus, specially visual and auditive stimuli, making it too easy for me to get overstimulated.

The second me is me after  a crisis I had, because I had to choose my career path and I didnt really know who I was, because dysfunctional family, trauma and stuff, because my parents didnt let me develop my personality in peace. After this crisis I became functional again, but it was a new version of me, of course during the time of the development of this new me I grieved the loss of the old one,  because I missed  how the world used to feel. In my new perception my attention was pretty much inwards and I developed an amazing inner world. I became an animation student and developed this passion for animation but it is too much. Also became very rational, intellectual, better habilities, better awareness and undeerstanding of everything, and smart, also I feel way more in control with this mode or personality I´ve develop, but the downside is that I feel emotions too intensely, like way too much its overwhelming and an inmense feeling of crippling loneliness and low self steem.

The thing is that lately I ve been struggling to be the second me, I´ve been into so much stress lately because of college and because it drains all my energy . Also I have ocd and I have self sabotaging intrusions, that have become stronger. Also I have felt so anxioius and stressed that I felt the old me come back, the first one and I just want her to go away, but I want to me the second me again in peace, but I dont want it to be overwhelming. Also I am scared to become a third me, but I am not letting it happen. My Therapist said that this crisis wont happen again because now I know better who I am.... But because of who I am is so overwhelming I am struggling to be me again because of the pain it feels to be that person... Please I am asking for help, for tips, for reassurance that i am going to be okay again, If you ever felt the same please let me know.

My sister went to a mental hospital at the age of 14 and now she’s more manipulative than she was before ,1716140559.0,"My sister had problems with her mental heath and ended up going to a residential. She was there for 3 months. Prior to this she didn’t know how to express her feelings without yelling, and would get agitated easily. She also has a problem “dating” people and getting really attached and shing when they break up. She’s 14 and has had over 20 “boyfriends” as soon as one leaves the next comes. 

She’s always had a problem going to school. Well now she’s dating a kid who doesn’t go to school either and has a dying grandpa(mirroring her,) and she’s particularly attached. She says the kid is nice to her and helps her but he comes to the house and just plays video games and when she calls him he doesn’t talk to her because he’s playing video games. He’s sat in her room and said nothing while she’s SHing. He threatens to beat up his caregiver. 

My mother told my sister the kid wouldn’t be able to come over any more and he’s grounded. Sister stole moms phone and started freaking out saying my moms a liar(she usually is) and then started taking pics of my moms texts to the kids caretaker. When I asked her what she was upset about she just kept saying “moms a liar” and eventually told me stuff we already knew (my sister and her boyfriend lied about going to school and then they went into my parents room and took down the security cameras they had in my moms room). 

I told her I didn’t understand why she’s so upset. We already knew this. I told her I can’t understand her and she’s gotta stop screaming and crying if she wants to talk cuz I can’t understand her. She then starts to scream bloody murder at the top of her lungs and I tell her to take a deep breath and she starts saying I’m yelling at her and runs out the door. (She hasn’t eaten since 9 last night, she doesn’t drink water, she’s probably a little bit stoned, and doesn’t have shoes on) so I tell her to come back inside and that the only people inside are me and the cats. She starts to run away screaming at me saying I’m yelling(I do have a problem with raising my voice that I’ve been working on cuz my sister says it triggers her) I was not raising my voice. She then picked up a bike and chucked it in my direction and kept yelling at me saying I’m yelling at her. I told her to just go back inside, she kept screaming and I said finallly “so you get to be mean and yell and scream but yelling triggers you?” She went inside. 

She started throwing stuff inside and then shoved me and scratched me cuz I was standing by the door she wanted to go in. 

She knows about triggers and stuff now but she’s worse in almost every way than when she went into the hospital. It’s like she went in there trying to absorb the knowledge to fix other people and didn’t focus on how to help herself.

i am now very overly sensitive and apologetic, and i take everything very very personally. i know this isn’t healthy, but it’s gotten a lot better. however i am still hurting people bc of my reactions. 

EXAMPLE: the other day i was ranting about a game to my partner. i am very bad at this game and reiterated that so that they didn’t need to say it, however they ended up saying “well usually when (thing i was ranting about) happens its because i am playing badly” which i took the wrong way and kinda shut down. they meant it as we all make mistakes, and that it’s happened to them as well, but i took it as them reaffirming that my skills are lack luster when i was trying to make it clear that i didnt want to hear that, because that was what i was ranting about. 

usually when i handle these emotional from small instances like above i kind of shut down and get quiet for a minute or two and then slowly reintegrate by bringing up something i know will engage the other person. 

this instance led to a bigger conversation with the issues i have been causing in the relationship. this is leading me to a longer shut down. usually i process emotions alone and need space away from people. i take walks, and just unplug, or draw. i feel very unable to talk or communicate in a healthy way, so i dont. i always thought this was the proper way to handle things but i am quickly realizing its not. how do i handle this better?

like typing it out will make it make more sense. i’ve have depersonalization-derealization disorder for about 10 months, depression, anxiety, and ocd. the ocd isn’t diagnosed like the other things but it’s not hard to figure out if you have it. i am always obsessing over something that’s wrong with me, for 5 months i was convinced i had cancer, and developed symptoms of it. for these last 2 years i was 100% convinced i was having a stroke and the symptoms of it and went to the hospital so many times and the side of my body would go numb. i’m female (20) years old. and these last few months i’ve moved onto schizophrenia. i’m so paranoid. i’m always seeing things in the corner of my eye. i’ll be in bed on my phone and i swear i hear someone say my name. or i’ve heard quiet music. all of this sends me into a panic attack which worsens my dpdr, i know from movies and shows and reading about it that people with schizophrenia think someone is following them, etc. so when a car was parked outside my house of course that thought crossed my mind, and made me feel even worse. i always have to check my back seat before i drive away at night time or i’ll think about it constantly. i know that is probably ocd tho. i’m always telling my friends i’m so scared of developing this and they think im crazy and they say of course i’m not why would my kind happy self ever become schizophrenic. but how do they know? i have so many other issues and i’m so i’m edge i can start to develop any kind of symptom.

More than just forgetfulness ,1716137664.0,"When I was young, I use to hyper fixate on things. If I was interested in something it was all I could do for hours.

Now as an adult (F, 27), I forget everything I am doing in the moment. My brain resets after 5 minutes. I can't hold a thought or remember what I am doing or where I am half the time. I can't focus on anything.

I lose my keys, my wallet, my phone often. I forget to turn things on or off. I stop half way between a task and can't remember what I was working on. I dont hear people when they talk to me. It started off not so bad but now it's severe.

The other day I was driving my normal route to work and zoned out, next thing I knew everything looked unfamiliar to me. It was the same road I drove a million times, but it was like I had no idea how I got there and I didn't recognize a thing and I felt terrified.

I went to get tested for ADHD while in college because I noticed I couldn't focus on lectures or homework, but they didn't take me very seriously and thought I was after meds. I did leave with a suggestion to get further testing for ASD, which they did not have the resources available for in my area for adults.

Anniversary of brother’s estrangement,1716136674.0,"My brother is estranged from my family for around a year now. There was an incident in 2016, when my family and me were getting ready to travel outside of the country. We couldn’t find my brother. It turned out that he jumped from his bedroom window and injured his leg so he was at the hospital. After that happened, my brother told my father how he is abusive. When my brother told him, my father disassociated the whole time. My brother requested therapy between him and my father. My father denied and made the whole family go to therapy instead. Fast forward to recent years, my brother was flunking his classes and never finished college.

About December 2022, my mother confronted him about not going to work (doing DoorDash) and how he never leaves his room. After he came out of his room after the argument, my father called him useless. My father also hid his car keys from him. Since that incident, my brother stopped talking to them entirely. Fast forward May 2023, he moved out for good.

It’s important to note that I’m African and family is really big within our culture especially the only son.

"""Fetishizing"" bad things that happen to me as a way of ""coping""?",1716136494.0,"So I've realized that when I'm in a negative situation or something bad happens to me, I tend to ""sexualize"" it. For example, I'm currently in love with someone who doesn't like me back and in my head I visualize it as me being ""below"" them, and as I am a very sexually submissive person, it kinda turns me on and helps me cope. 

If someone says something bad or demeaning to me (I have BPD so those kind of things really sting), I see it in a BDSM/sadomasochistic kind of fashion, which lessens the emotional impact.

It's not being insulted itself what turns me on - it's posteriorly, deliberately trying to view it as a situation which puts me into submission what does it.

Mental Breakdown - Advice Needed,1716136276.0,"My family and I are in desperate need for some advice on how to help a family member currently having a complete mental breakdown.   We know drugs and alcohol are a factor, but he seems to be showing signs of bipolar or even schizophrenia (whether chemically induced or not, we do not know).  

In the past week, he has sent out an email to VPs at work with whistleblowing type accusations, pushed a coworker,  kicked off the property of work and told not to come back. He thinks he’s on vacation.   After all of this, we receive a call from police Thursday evening saying he has locked himself in his apartment and is destroying it.  He is a gun owner so they were afraid to enter.  They were called after several neighbors saying he was walking around saying he was lost, then when he made it home he went out on his balcony nude, yelling profanities.   After not letting them in for 2 hours, they left to hopefully de-escalate the situation.  That night he destroyed his apartment (tore cabinets off walls, ripped faucets out - breaking pipes and flooding his and surrounding apartments).  

The kicker is, after that night, he wakes up to said destroyed apartment and acts like nothing happened and everything is fine. Not denial, truly believing nothing is wrong even surrounded by his destroyed apartment.  The neighbors took his dog in all of this and he doesn’t even notice until the next evening, then claims the dog has been with him this whole time (he is also saying the dog can talk to him).  He truly believes he was asleep this whole time and the police came in and destroyed his apartment.  The following evening, he started tearing up the flooded floors in his apartment, making it sound like he was working a job site and fixing the floors. 

He refuses to get help (my parents are now with him from out of state) and truly does not believe anything is wrong. Nothing he is saying makes sense to anyone but him.  We have tried everything we can think of but he needs to be in a mental health facility.  We are afraid he may hurt himself or others if he comes back to reality and realizes all that has happened.  

The police have been zero help.  We obviously would prefer he be in a  facility over jail cell but don’t know what to do.  To get an involuntary mental hold (since he is unwilling to walk in), we need medical proof that he needs it (makes zero sense, Texas sucks). 

Is anyone in Texas that is familiar with the laws and anything we can do?  We just want to help him.  This isn’t him, but no one seems willing to help him unless he physically harms himself or others.

"I feel like most of my peers either ignore me, laugh at me, or outright hate me— I think they don’t understand me. (M23) Can someone read this short version of my adult life so far and give me some advice or encouragement? I feel really alone..",1716135729.0,"I don’t really know where to begin. I guess with describing myself; I’m an I usual person in my eyes at least. I’m heavily interested in topics no one else is like history and politics but also have super high aspirations of being an entrepreneur (am in school for business). My 23 years of life thus far have been anything but easy for the average person: since birth both parents either in jail or rehab, raised by grandparents until just before high school, foster care 4 years of high school, covid pandemic second semester of college(dropped out). The most negatively impactful experiences on my adult life have been the following: late 2020 I began a relationship with a woman who would end up taking me through a rollercoaster of a toxic relationship and that brought the out the worst in me. This relationship was filled with manipulation, mind games, verbal abuse, and even some serious domestic violence/threat against my life on one occasion; all done to me by her. This relationship left me with absolutely no sense of myself, I did not know what way was up or down for the longest. The relationship ended late 2022 but even now almost 2 years later I’m not still fully recovered. During the time between the relationship ending until right now at this very moment I have lost three love ones: my grandfather who raised me, my grandmother who raised me, and my biological father just three months ago. As you could imagine I also struggling with alcoholism and substance abuse but never hard drugs (was just a really bad pothead like all day every day). 

That’s the background and context to myself, I should also add this all takes places in a small town where everyone knows everyone, now for why I’m really here:
It feels like the majority of my peers either ignore me, laugh at me, or hate me; and for no good reason. It’s almost like they don’t understand my weirdness and also don’t understand mental illness. I’m a rare case in that I’m a man who was in an abusive relationship with a woman and have C-PTSD from it (yes I see a therapist). I really try not to care what people think/say about me but it’s hard when it feels like it’s everyone. Really the only ones who care for me are my foster family and maybe 3 friends but I never ever get to see those friends as they have full time jobs or work, so I’m a pretty lonely guy. 

I just wish someone would take the time to listen and understand. I’m not ugly, mean, or rude; I’m not a comedian but I’m pretty funny, I am not ugly in appearance but also not strikingly handsome. I like to think I’m a pretty decent human being just one who’s been through a lot. Idk what I’m doing wrong. Maybe it’s because I’m a male and maybe people automatically assume mental health struggles means you’re crazy. (I’m only slightly crazy but not straight jacket crazy lol)

Struggling to get my shitty neighbours out of my head. Any methods to doing so?,1716134568.0,"Hi, I just wanted to ask for some advice. I have a neighbour opposite us who basically started a little feud with us because they didn't like me asking them to stop blocking off my driveway, which they did numerous times for no reason other than to antagonise us.

We haven't continued anything as we just want peace, and they've stopped parking across our dropped kerb after they were spoken to by our local PCSO, yet I still find them staring at me randomly which im assuming is for some silly intimidation tactic, and my anxiety has become quite bad for it as I hate conflict, especially when it's prolonged and for no good reason. They don't know about my anxiety, so all they are seeing is me not giving a single shit about what they're doing, and I'm glad that they assume it doesn't affect me.

I wanted to ask what methods you have used/continue to use to avoid these people (in your mind, of course. I can't physically avoid them unless i lock myself away), or to calm your mind when you see them or think about them? I'm doing pretty well with controlling my mind recently, but I'd love to know of any other things I could try, or maybe ways to think differently when I see them so I can view the situation in a more funny light.

"If you're struggling with loneliness or depression this may help, or it did for me atleast.",1716134385.0,"So I'm going to say off the bat again this works for me. There's always more nuance to each case, but I just want to offer unsolicited advice. Some of it may be (and probably is) a bit flawed, but I still feel like posting it.

Firstly, I've found that the internet has been a HUGE cause of my past feelings of loneliness, depression, or otherwise just emotions that inhibit me to enjoy my life. All I ever heard was you need friends, you need people or you should logically just feel like shit. The thing I didn't understand until now is, it's all bullshit. 

Now this isn't to say we shouldn't feel lonely, but man we really just need distractions, we need focus, something to get completed honed in on that pulls us out of the neverending thinking-mode and makes life fun. We need to change our way of thinking of ourselves most of all, instead of thinking about every single tiny flaw we have, we need to think of ourselves much higher. Not like an inflated ego, but high self esteem. In order to feel good and be happy in your day to day life, you need to believe you have the capacity to do so first.

 Now of course, each person's case is entirely different. Some people have developed neural pathways and reactions to things that are just so ingrained that it simply not as easy as flipping a switch and presto, you're happy. That being said though, I do think this is the right path to feeling better honestly. 

And one of the most important things I've realized is your mind doesn't know anything, like at all. I mean we *know* things like leaves are green and pain hurts, but we can't predict the future, we can never have certainty, and to me personally this is a blessing more than a curse because it means we're not completely hopeless no matter how long a painful experience persists in our lives. This is not saying the same old ""it will get better"" because that would be hypocritical to what I just said, but it does propose the *possibility* of change, which is all I think we need to get moving. 

Other than that it comes down to discipline, and while we shouldn't take this too seriously to a fault where we return to scrutinizing our every action and it's mistakes, we should adhere to a certain set of habits we want to adopt highly enough that we learn overtime to say no to comfortable things. Say you want to lose weight for example, try eating later in the day and build that habit of taking control of your mind, that will get a bit easier each time as your mind gets used to not having it's fix.

This is just my two cents, maybe it'll help nobody and maybe some of it is a bit wrong but I felt like sharing it just cause. Hope whoever reads this has a good day.

Ok. Over this past year I've noticed my little sisters mental health go down the drain and no one in my family is helping. My parents think she is an outcast and they want to send her away to a bording school. My brother(14) finds it funny everytime she gets into trouble with my mom and she has started to get increasingly aggressive with my 4 tear old sister. Every day feels like hell. Everytime my sister and mom are in the same room I can feel the tension in the air and I get so uncomfortable. I've tried to help my mom to try to understand that shouting had never worked and that it never will but in return she just shouts at me back. I'm trying to speak to my sister (11) but she never wants to start a conversation with me anymore. She's developed pica because I found out why there was a hole in our wall. My mom gets ever so angry everytime the hole in the wall gets bigger and every day I fear more for my sister.

How can I believe someone loves me,1716131620.0,"
I (26F) have been with my husband (30M) for nearly 4 years and got married at the beginning of this year. I’ve always been extremely insecure in our relationship and I felt like he was never over his ex (or basically anyone he had any kind of relationship with before me) and that he settled for me. Admittedly, in the very beginning of our relationship he had inadvertently compared me to his ex. I also read an old journal of his where he went on for pages about how much he loved her and all the things he loved about her. All these years later and being married, I still replay it and I’ve convinced myself he thinks about her and compares me all the time. 

We got into an argument this morning because I had a dream he was cheating on me with his ex, and I asked him if he regrets marrying me. He got very upset and now thinks I regret our marriage because I bring up how I think he doesn’t love me all the time. He says he can’t keep defending himself and I look for things to validate the narrative I created. 
I love him more than anything, but I have this intense fear it’s not reciprocated. He does nice things for me, treats me well, supports me, and the only issue we really have in our relationship is our communication skills (but honestly I know I’m more of the problem with that) so I have no true reason to feel like this, but I do. 

 I have been in therapy for nearly 3 years, but my first therapist never mentioned BPD, while my current therapist thinks I show traits but hasn’t formally diagnosed me yet. 

Any advice on how to move past this? I feel like I’m ruining my marriage. ",kingkongsnips,,False,1cvqi99,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvqi99/how_can_i_believe_someone_loves_me/
Should I look for another job? ,1716131328.0,"Hi I am 22 f, I have BPD, OCD, and ADHD, I just started on a job late at March, everything was fine, until what has been happening this week got much worse. My manager has been keeping telling me, and even whisper at the other employees and managers that I was slow, even when I did everything to get alittle faster but she still thinks my techniques are slow, she always expect everything to get done, even with the trays, people would just throw the trays and just wash them, even when sauces are still there, so I had to do 10 second timer to make sure I got everything done and making sure it's clean, cause I kept seeing reviews how customers complain how the trays are never clean. ( I work at Burger King)

Then just everyone expect you to do there chores for you, I can't handle more then 3 or 4 task at once, one women just handed the stuffs to me, shouted "" Ok I'm done"" and just clocked out, I was confuse and pissed. Then she complained how I didn't do the dishes right, and got upset when I explain it needs to hand wash, telling me"" That's not how our managers told us?!"" Which just pissed me off more. 

I can't handle when people called me slow, lazy, or even just even people making me do things for them, cause being treated differently, expectfuly people thinking ADHD people are weird. So I had to be fast as I can just not to upset someone, but to my boss I'm still slow to her, she didn't even tell me how to make things faster, for days until she told me how to do it, I asked "" Why didn't you just show me sooner instead your just saying I'm slow"" which she didn't say anything and just walked away, even when there was a couple of times I couldn't come in to work, expectfuly when I'm sick, she tried to make me feel bad, which sometimes works, but even when I'm sick, I told her I couldn't come in, and she demanded that I did, I had to remind her I could end up everyone getting sick and she has to find extra new employees to hire, which made her shut up and left me alone.

Another girl at work won't stop begging me to buy her food, I kept lying telling her I had to get groceries, or order for my family, which there are times that I even see couple people that are slower then me, and still never get bothered, when I do chores, she demanded I'm faster, which is just annoying and a mental break down at this point.

I Feel Like Shit,1716130681.0,"Does anyone else’s therapist throw their clients feelings to the back burner? I.E.  Instead of acknowledging the feelings the therapist completely disregards them/is more focused in a solution. 

It is great for a therapist to not SOLELY focus on the emotions with NO SOLUTION or RESULT, but I thought that was one of the reason for therapy. 

Emotions drive the actions. 

I feel empty and BARE to the elements. I’ve told my therapist. However my therapist just seems to be focused on the physical results. (I.E. Get your own place, get a job, etc….). However when I bring up things that are actually plaguing me he makes it seems like it doesn’t matter. 

If being a pushover, someone that is easy to manipulate, a people pleaser, not being able to set boundaries is not important… WHAT IS?

 My friend just cut ties with me.,1716129044.0,"Back in my college day, I have a friend who I will called “Peter” from now on. Peter has always been a guy who is my close friend and we basically a part of the same group when we hangout or go to any classes. One day, he seems to have a problem  or an argument with his family and now he lay it out on me, wanting me to console him, or maybe to do something that would help with the situation, but that problem is internal within his family, so I can only give advice and one of them was for him to think about the good life that he has in the past, to look at the friendship scrap books and old messages that he got from his friends back in the day so that he could take his mind off the problem. After we talked about the situation and I helped him set his mind off the thing, he says thanks to me and we say goodbye to each other, but a short time after that, he DM a Sticker to me, and that Sticker look sinister, like he held a grudge on me or about to do something sinister. I didn’t respond anything to that.

Some time after that, I started to have my own problem, too, can’t remember the exact detail, but I choose to call Peter and confide in him. I talked about my struggle and problem that is going on, and what he chose to say to me is unbelievable. Instead of helping with my problem, he started to talk about a random game which I have no interest in at that moment, going into detail about its lore and world building, about how interesting this game is, completely ignore my problem, then he ended the talk by saying that “I just did what you’ve done to me in the past”. At the moment I don’t know what to said and I can only think about the day I consoled him in the past. Maybe I did something wrong back then? I only told him that I will improve whatever he wanted me to do better. The thing is, what he did to me has hurt me so much and I won’t be able to forget it anytime soon.

Fast forward to two-ish years later, I decided to settle this problem once and for all. I always knew that whatever problem I have, I could just talk directly to him, so I decided to call him and explain how he did the “I did what you did” thing to me and how angry I become due to that behavior. He said that he can’t remember that thing, and then started suggesting that we should cut ties from each other, but that’s not what I want. I just want everything to be the same, and also to lay this problem out on him, to show him how uncomfortable that behavior is to me. He just seems to respond with normal stuff like “yeah”, “okay”, “alright”, so I didn’t really know whether he actually understands what I said. So I called him again a few days later, to asked him to explain the problem, and then apologize to that. He did that, but then he also state that he don’t want to be my friend anymore, like we should just end things here. It broke my heart how we have come to this point. I still want him to be his old self, cause before I call out this whole thing, he is actually improve a lot and there are no more things that I really have problem with, except that one “I did what you did to me” thing. After that, we go to eat dinner together cause we are in the same group, but the whole time that we are there, he didn’t say hello to me, or talk to me at all. It is just me trying to initiate conversation with him, and he only nod or say “yes”, something like that. He *really* not wanted to talk to me. After the dinner is finished, everyone go home and we have an argument again, and he still stand by his choice to cut all contact with me, but then he told me that he will reconsidered his choice. A few days later, he reached out to me, and long story shot, he still think the same as before. He will cut contact with me, and I convinced him to continue staying in the group. I still don’t know whether we will get to meet up next time my group gets together, but it sounds like a point of no return for our relationship.

I never thought that calling him out like that would lead to that kind of damage, both to our friendship and our emotion. I thought we can always talk things out and everything will return to normal. But I think it doesn’t matter anymore, what matters is that my feeling is going through a rollercoaster right now. Sometimes, I still got angry about the argument and how I could told him “this” or “that” to change his view, or to have a come back to the argument. Sometimes, I think about the good old day and how we used to talk to each other, confide in each other, and how we laugh to silly things together. Other times, I got scary about what he is about to do when we meet again next time, how he potentially could hurt my feeling. And there are also times that I thought about how things could go differently. What if I just stayed silent and buried my grudge forever. I really missed the good version of him, and wished that we could be the same like before (minus that “I did what you did to me” thing). Can someone tell me how to get through this? How to process all of this thing? I don’t have that many close friend and losing him really have an impact on my life.

Reached financial independence but I'm not happy with my life,1716128285.0,"I'm a 25 asian male who lives with his parents. I currently have plans to pursue dental school. I've worked in dentistry while preparing my application in dental school. For the past few years, I've only been making 80k/yr (I live in a HCOL so this isn't as much as it seems) living with my parents to save money. After 6 years of investing in the market, I saved a fair amount which was enough to not need to contribute to retirement accounts (coastFIRE for anyone part of the FIRE community haha) and still retire comfortably early at 50. This was a huge goal of mine and I thought I'd be happy once I reached this- this freed up my saving to allow me to buy whatever I wanted but it turns out there's not really many things I want in life. I've spent most of my past years saving every penny to invest in the future, and that future is finally here. And yet, I'm not happy in life.

My goals when I was younger were just to buy whatever video game I wanted and order UberEats whenever I wanted. The problem is I'm on a diet trying to get lean so I meal prep everything which I already outsource. I tried ubering everywhere but I felt very uncomfortable with other people driving me around so I drive or my boyfriend drives me. I thought I'd be happy buying a Tesla but it turns out EV charging is very annoying + Teslas are very annoying to work with so I ended up not getting one after borrowing my friend's. I also thought about getting a luxury apartment nearby that's 4k/month but its honestly less convenient than living at home as I'm a few minutes away from work...The ""solutions"" to spending more money just end up creating more problems.  I've bought a bunch of lululemon to augment my wardrobe, finally got a new phone after 8 years, upgraded to Tmobile from Mint, got a new laptop, basically bought a bunch of material stuff I've been staying away from. I went on a few flights and decided to just buy business class tickets for the fun of it and yes, it was nice, but my day to day happiness is still pretty low.

I also received a massive inheritance that basically means I don't have to work if I don't want to. The obvious question is well why don't you just quit your job? Well...I still really want to achieve my goal of trying to become a dentist and to do that, I need support of dentists to back my application which is why I still go to my job. I also really do love my work/patient interactions and work in a good environment, and something about having the freedom to say ""Fuck you I quit"" whenever I want makes my job a lot more enjoable. In the future, my goal is to become a part time dentist and treat my friends/family for free/charity cases, and spend the rest of my time with my kids/family/hobbies. There's also a great deal of pressure from my parents to become a dentist- they know financially I'm set (and by extension them as I've managed their portfolio for many years with great success), but this doesn't matter as I'm still not a dentist.

While I'm sure this sounds like a great problem to have, I just don't understand why I'm not happy in life. I think it's because I'm still not yet in dental school/a dentist whereas all my friends are successful in their careers but maybe there's more? I do want to get a therapist but I don't even know what I'd talk about. I know exactly how I sound: I have so much money and I don't know how to spend it wow and I""m not happy.

How do I move on from something I loved?,1716127299.0,"I graduated college recently and am not happy at all. During my senior year, I had the opoortunity to work with one of our college's sports teams and loved it. I didn't feel lonely, found something I was passionate about, and made solid connections. I became heavily invested in what they're doing by attending every practice, traveling with them on every road trip, and voluntarily cutting uo film for them. I was searching for jobs throughout this time, but considering I didn't have a car, my options were limited. Deep down, what I was doing won my heart over and I was really hoping that the work I put in would pave a path for me to return, even though it was a one-year commitment due to graduation (and likely a lack of budget). Unfortunately, that didn't happen. 

There's mutual interest in a return, especially with the value I brought with cutting up film, but I'd have to do so under the condition I'm a grad student going for my master's degree - something I cannot afford out of pocket.

Unless I receive enough funding to make my return a reality (which feels unlikely at this point), there's no way it will happen.

I have no idea where to go from here. I'm considering taking a ""gap year"" which allows me to save up for a car, wait for next year's batch of GA positions, and get myself in the right place physically and mentally. I can do so as I have an internship I can place on my resume in the meantime. How do I move on from something I loved?

I (f30) feel like my mental health issues are ruining my boyfriends (m39) life. ,1716125692.0,"I’ve been with my current partner for 2 years. We both fell really hard and fast for each other, and our relationship progressed quickly. I moved in with him after 5 months, and from the beginning, we had an internal knowing that we wanted to spend our lives together. 

After we moved in together, however, we went through an extremely rough period. We started fighting all of the time, and for about 9 months I was on edge because I was terrified to do or say the wrong thing. During this time, it seemed like I would offend him or upset him on a daily basis, and our fights would escalate to screaming matches that often involved me sleeping on the floor of our bathroom crying my eyes out. He’d often demand apologies for things I felt were small, and get really upset if I ever tried to explain behaviors or things that I did. I got in the habit of apologizing for EVERYTHING & blaming myself a lot & the apologies never seemed good enough for him. 

At the same time, I had a very traumatic upbringing with unstable parents, and don’t have a relationship with them as an adult. I was also in an abusive relationship a few years ago, and still have nightmares about my ex. My therapist says I have symptoms in line with cptsd. I have lots of friends, but getting close to others is extremely hard and scary for me. I’ve also had regular ups and downs in my mental health. 

During the rough period with my partner, I developed suicidal tendencies and started self-harming. I bounce between anger and guilt continually when I do something that hurts or upsets him, and I am terrified to talk about things that bother me because I’m afraid of arguments. My boyfriend also says that I have a distorted view on arguments, and experience our disagreements as a lot worse than they actually are. Things have improved immensely between us, but I’m still afraid to talk to him, the suicidal thoughts have ended but self harming persists.. I  am actively working on this with my therapist and life coach. I’m also looking into joining a DBT group. 

Fast forward to now and our arguments don’t get NEARLY as bad as they used to, but I’m still having self harm issues regularly because I get so scared to have tough conversations or when I upset him. At this point, we are able to recognize and stop when things escalate, but for some reason I still go between guilt and anger very quickly and end up hurting myself. I’ve broken my hand twice from hitting the wall, and I’ve bruised my face several times. He’s seen it happen and is very disturbed by it (rightfully so), but I can’t seem to stop. It’s like something snaps inside of me & I hurt myself.

I’m watching this take a serious toll on my partner, and I don’t know what to do about it. Part of me feels like I’m ruining his life and he would be better without me, and I live in constant guilt over it. Another part of me is hopeful things will get better, but at what cost to him and the relationship? I’m scared he will stop loving me, or that I’ll have these issues forever, or that I’m inherently broken. 

Can anyone relate or give some kind of advice on how to cope with this & proceed? 

TL;DR I developed self-harm issues after a rough time period with my boyfriend with lots of intense arguing. Our arguments have improved and gotten better, but the self-harm issues persist and deeply hurt my boyfriend. I don’t know what to do & would like advice on how to proceed.

Disappointment in life without reason,1716113521.0,"Hey, this is my first post and I’m sure it won’t be seen (which is fine) but I just want to know if there may be any reason for my feelings. I am disappointed in life, I am unsure of why because I recently got the job I have been trying for years, but I have had no joy. Any joy I feel is fleeting, I have happiness when with friends and loved ones but as soon as the YouTube video goes off at night my mind is flooded with the realization that I have no reason to keep going. I have no intention of attempting suicide or anything but if I were to fall in a dream and never wake up I do believe I would find life more satisfying, even my bad dreams seem more enticing than waking up the next day. My friends have noticed this as well and have been growing concerned. The joy I used to feel when doing art has begun to wane as of late and so too has my smile which has been pointed out by them. I never lost my smile in high school even when my mother was sick, I never wanted others to see that I was down but now that life should be good I can’t hardly bring myself to smile, it used to be automatic. I am concerned with my mind as of late, and the isolation that this new job has brought has caused the already apparent issue to fester and grow.

Am I messed up? ,1716099041.0,"I’ve always been emotional - my therapist once confirmed that I’m a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP). My emotions go haywire whenever I feel overwhelmed - whether it’s anxiety, guilt, sadness, happiness or anger. Because I feel things so deeply, I can be very empathetic. I can feel compassion and sympathy for others very heavily. However, it can become too much. 

Sometimes, feeling so many emotions brewing at your core can be extremely overwhelming. It can get to the point where the brain decides that enough is enough, and begins to shut down those feelings. Eventually, you become numb and emotionless. You feel nothing. Feeling so strongly than other people can cause a lot of inner turmoil for people like me, it can be exhausting. 

But that’s not really my case anymore.

Let’s briefly delve into my childhood so we can hopefully get an insight of why i am the way I am:

I grew up in an unstable household - my mother is a narcissistic shallow woman who mostly relied on men for financial comfort. She was strict, judgmental and cold but she was gentle and caring when she wanted to be. Shes also childish, and sometimes acted like a bratty sister rather than a responsible, mature mother. She is beautiful, she knew that, so she used her looks as an advantage. She could be incredibly seductive when she wanted to be. I was once indirectly victimized by her tricks. When I was no younger than 5yo. 

I witnessed her having sex with a man she once dated. 

Though “witnessed”  isn’t enough to describe it. I FELT it. I laid on the same bed where they did it. I felt her naked, sweaty body rubbing against mine, I now realize that it was her bf rutting into her from behind. This disgusting, revolting and horrifying experience went on for hours. 

Though she is beautiful, she’s incredibly insecure. She always strived to “look” perfect. Shes obsessive about her weight and her looks and she made sure that I lived the same way. She scrutinized my diet, my clothes, my make up, my hair. Otherwise, she’d judge and criticize me, calling me “fat” and “plain”. 

She married my step-father who was her total opposite - he was kind, funny and incredibly loving. Their relationship was by no means a good one though. They often fought and argued due to my mother’s callousness. The fights took a toll on my step-father’s mental health, leading him to me. He was very lonely you see, and he thought that I was the only one that could understand him - his only anchor. He sought me out every night and crawl into my bed, seeking comfort in my embrace. He’d talk about how much he hated my mother and that she was destroying his and my little brother’s life. 

“Promise me,” he’d sob into my neck, “You’ll never leave my side. Let your mother be damned. She doesn’t matter to me anymore. Nothing else does. Just you. You and your brother are my whole world.” 

This was a nightly occurrence. Our little secret. It was not healthy, I later realized. My step-father was extremely emotionally dependent on me. It was almost incestuous, now that I thought about it. Despite not being related by blood, he was just as much of a father than my biological dad ever was. But the way he needed me felt kind of wrong. It felt too intimate. 

As sick as it felt, I didn’t mind it. Because I was just as lonely as he was. 

One thing that we need to establish here - I’m incredibly selfish. I tend to think of myself more and put myself above others. I’m inconsiderate, entitled and self-centered. I sometimes think of myself as superior than my peers and secretly regard them with contempt. I’m privileged, I come from a wealthy family and I’m spoiled with things that others would kill to have. I don’t go out of my way to be grandiose about it though - I’m very introverted and secluded. I like showing off QUIETLY. Worse thing is, I don’t even realize it. It’s as if it’s within my nature to consider myself more important than others. 

My family have known this fact about me for as long as I’ve lived, and they find it repulsing. You see, even though they’re rich and successful, they don’t take what they have for granted unlike me. They worked so hard, sacrificed a lot to get where they are now. They weren’t born rich, they earned their living. It makes sense that I’m spoiled because of them, I was born into the luxury they bled, cried and sweat for. They see me as a selfish, inconsiderate and an arrogant teen. I used to be extremely ashamed of myself. I thought I was a failure under their eyes. A burden. The black sheep. The weight of their shame was excruciating, it once made me suicidal. I self-harmed, overdosed twice, because I thought that my death would make their lives easier. 

But I’m quite fine with that now. 

I don’t care if I’m selfish anymore. It doesn’t matter to me, because I can’t really bring myself to care for my actions. In fact, I embrace it. Any sense of guilt, remorse and empathy that I would have been sick with before, is no longer my concern. Maybe, because I’m tired of feeling anything now. It feels nice to not care about anything. It feels freeing. Liberating. 

Though I am a nasty person at heart, I make sure not to let it be known. People outside of my family think I’m kind, considerate and friendly and that’s about it. Like I said, I’m reclusive. Closed off. I don’t socialize much. I never have because I’ve always found people quite boring and mundane. No one and nothing matters to me. 

Its a horrible trait to have. Because of boredom, I enjoy toying with people’s emotions for my own entertainment. For example, I absolutely LOVE helpless people. Especially men. Whenever I encounter such a person, I feel the immediate need to protect and cherish them, like a pet. I approach them like their savior would, their guardian angel - with kindness, compassion and tender care. But in doing so, I make sure to control, trap and isolate them because I want to ensure them that I’m the only thing that matters in their miserable lives. I want them to be needy, desperate and dependent, like a child to their parent. It makes me feel good. Strong. Powerful.  

I realized that every “I love you,” I’ve told every man, held no meaning at all. Every man I had a thing with, every friend, meant absolutely nothing to me. They were just… toys. Entertainments. Distractions. There was no spark between us. No thrill. 

Then I realized why. 

It’s because they led normal lives. They had friends, loving parents, jobs that they enjoyed. They were normal and because of that, they were emotionally and mentally secured, they didn’t need me in a way that I want to be needed. There was no love, and I don’t think there’ll ever be any love. I don’t know what that is. I don’t even know if I’m capable of forming a healthy romantic relationship with someone, because “healthy” is foreign to me. I want someone who’s desperate, helpless, someone’s who’s life is an absolute hell that they can’t control because then they’ll be easy to manipulate. My idea of “love” isn’t to treat them like an equal, but rather like a damsel in distress. I want them to be helpless without me, to not being able to live without me, to believe that I saved them. I’d shower them with so much attention, love and care, when really I’m trapping them, making them feel secure only in my presence. 

I would anything for such a person. Even kill. Because if I kill for them, it would just be an extra step to make them believe that I truly love them.

I'm confused and stuck,1716096943.0,"Lately I've been trying to remember my childhood (as young as 1 to 11) to try and figure out the reason why I'm the way I am.

From what I can barely/somewhat recall: I never told my parents about how I was doing in school (replying with the bare minimum) or about my emotions because of my older brother. My brother has torettes and had it really bad when we were young, I wasn't aware of it from being young but I knew my brother had problems so I made sure my parents would prioritize him by keeping things to myself.

This year I had come out to my parents as Trans and have been more open about my emotions and what I'm going through, as well as presenting symptoms for depression and possibly a neurological disorder. I've been put in for sessions in a youth health clinic. In my first session when I was asked to explain/talk about what I'm going through I found I was unable to truly explain it how I wanted to. It was like something was blocking me from talking about myself to the extent I wanted to.

I'm starting to wonder of the reason it's taken until I was teenager to present symptoms for a neurological disorder (because it's very common from my dad's side) was because of repressing and hiding things from my family as a kid.

Was this abuse? ,1716096585.0,"I'm 42m.

I have never had close friends and have no family.  I try to think of why i turned out like this.  I grew up in a middle class home.  My dad made ok money but worked night shift my entire childhood, he rarely spoke to me or did things with me.  My mom was a stay at home mom until i was a teenager.  

I think most days my parents did not really interact with me except for essential things, so they gave me food and clothes, but doing things with them was very rare, like we went on vacations maybe 3 or 4 times during my childhood.  I never learned to ride a bike or to swim.  I think i learned to tie my shoes when i was 12, i taught myself.  I remember that i did not learn to use the bathroom until i was 3, and that also i taught myself, i didn't understand for a long time when i was at other peoples houses or my cousins houses why they had small toilets for the babies.  

I remember specific things that happened that stand out in my mind as being especially bad.  There are 3 that i can think of. 

When i was like 5 or so, i remember being in my room very cold.  I didn't understand at the time, but later i came to understand that our house was very drafty and cold in the winter because we had wooden windows and they should have been painted about once a year, they were not maintained and so did not shut all the way were always cracked open a small amount.  Also the furnace did not heat the whole house, it only heated it until the thermostat on the 1st floor reached it's preset point, so the upstairs was usualy 10 or more degrees colder.  My mom didn't think that we needed blankets (my sister and me, she is about 4 years older).  We had sheets on the bed and that was all.  I don't remember if it was my sisters idea, i think it was, we went into the hall closet at night to get more blankets and my mom caught us and yelled at us and made us put them back.  She said that the blanket i took was a wedding present and i didn't need it.  Years later i remember my sister as a teenager having several arguments with my mom about a comforter that she had bought herself.  When i moved out of the house i stole that same blanket that was still folded up in the closet never used.  Still have it.  

When i was 9 i got very sick.  My mom thought i  had some kind of flu.  I kept throwing up.  She did not take me to the doctor.  She always said how dumb it was how people took their kids to the doctor all the time just because they were sick. She kept giving me ice cream because she said that was good for throwing up and keeping energy up.  I was sick for i think more than a whole week, not sure if it went on for 2 or not.  Still didn't take me to a doctor, i kept throwing up.  Then one day i collapsed and they called an ambulance.  It turned out that i was diabetic and was throwing up because my blood sugar was too high.  

Later, i think i was 12 or 13.  I developed ingrown toenails.  My big toes would bleed and ooze every day.  When i came home from school they would be stained with blood and some yellow.  My mom would yell at me for this and scold me for not taking better care of my feet.  This went on for about 6 months.  My mom got a foot bath for me, and told me to soak my feet in warm water and gave me these sharp sticks to try to pry the nail out of the skin, but it didn't work.   Eventually she did take me to a doctor who performed the surgery to cut the toenails out.  

Other things that i remember, smaller things, were things like i asked to join the boy scouts at one point and my mother told me she didn't have to do that because she had already done that when my sister was in girl scouts, and i asked to learn to ride a bike at one point and my parents told me i was too old to go ride a bike with training wheels so i wasn't allowed.  I told my mom at one point that when i grew up i wanted to have a family with lots of kids, and she told me i couldn't have a family because of my diabetes, it was going to be too expensive.  

My parents never hit me, or denied me food, and when i got diabetes my mom would always track all of my sugar levels and how much insulin, she still has stacks and stacks of the monthly sheets for tracking everything the doctors office gave us.  But i don't remember ever playing with her or my dad, my dad didn't take me to football games, though he went with my grandma all the time, they had season tickets together.  My parents never told me i should join anything at school like sports or anything.   

The older i get, the more i think of these things, and look at how much i hate my life, and i blame them and get angrier at them, i hate them.  They are in their 70's now, they invite me over for dinner, on the weekends sometimes, i hate going over there, when ever they text me asking me to go i yell at my phone and i wish they would both die already.

My emotions heavily rely on one specific person and i dont know how to stop,1716088734.0,"I have this friend that lives about an hour away from me so we arent quite online friends but the main way we communicate is through texting, but the issue is theyre REALLY bad at responding to text messages and such or sometimes theyll just ignore some things i say. I know they care a lot about me but sometimes its really hard to see that because i rarely see them in person and theyre very much of an ""in person"" kind of friend. 

Weve both helped each other so much but sometimes i feel like im really just talking to a wall or they dont care about me and its gotten to the point where whenever i dont hear from them for even just a day or two it REALLY impacts my mental health and then im just fine when they respond to me and i feel like im just being dramatic later until they stop responding to me again. Theyre not a fake friend i know that theyre just bad at messaging (they have anxiety) but that doesnt stop my emotions from basically being reliant on if they texted me that day or not. It really sucks and i dont know how to get out of this loop.

Can someone please help,1716087939.0,"Hi everyone, I usually don't post on reddit, and there is no way on earth I could summarize what happened or how I feel and even I did, I doubt anyone would read through 10 pages of text, so I will try to summarize how I feel now vaguely

  
I am a male in my late twenties in a third world country, there is no father figure, I got a little sister and my mother, gratefully, I have pretty much taught myself everything and parented myself, bought everything I own and almost everything my mom and sis own too, I keep finding things the hard way and I wish if someone taught me these things earlier whether it's my non existing womanizing father or my naive innocent mother who needs help herself, I barely open up to people, I try to never show that I am negative or going through anything to anyone, except 1 childhood friend I trust and no one else, I find it super hard to make new friends as I get super anxious of being backstabbed again or somehow losing a good person, and I did put efforts into this, I did therapy, I did go to the gym and I still do, I read books, I ask for help, I improve my skills, my language fluency, I check for Visa programs and I am working on it to try and change my life / my mom's and sister's financially, a lot of people actually get close to me quickly, consider me their friend, compliment me, call me funny or smart or charismatic, but I can't believe it, I just see I am a bad person and I hate myself really hard, and I am super anxious and stressed, I have literally cried every single day in the past couple of months without missing one, and I can't help it, only my grandmother was a kind soul and she was a real mother to me, she died a few years ago, my father is crazy and he never cares for me or my sister, my mom barely got away from him and and he was literally giving death threats, it is very hard in my country for a woman to divorce her husband as well, so, I went on a marathon of self improvements on the inside out and yet I still feel so broken and sad and lonely and scared, I keep blaming it feeling like maybe it's cuz I am not smart enough, maybe I am not funny enough or maybe it's cuz I am ugly, male friends always compliment my photos like crazy and tell me I could ""model"" potentially, but the two girls I have opened up to in my entire life did not reciprocate feelings at all, the latter seemed like she did have feelings and I did my best to be the best version of my self in all aspects of my life, why? Cuz she in particular, made my eyes light up, she made me so happy when I never felt so happy and I know, I shouldn't be a relationship if I am expecting someone else to make me happy, and I am not fixed myself, but I wasn't looking for one, she entered my life so unexpecdly and she was so kind to me, she was so loving and caring, I felt love and good treatment I never knew even existed in my entire life, I was so happy I didn't overthink, I didn't feel bad or sad or lonely or scared, I felt so strong around her, and I doubled / tripled my income, became so much better at taking care of my health, I became almost the best verison I have ever been of my self, because deep down I was so scared of not being enough for her, and I made sure to communicate with her in every healthy way, I watched tons of guides on how to healthily communicate, attachment styles, giving space, etc etc, it was going so well, then suddenly she said she wasn't ready for a relationship, I looked back at my actions, every single one of them, every word I said, and I couldn't get my hands on something I might have messed up, I was joyful and normal, I didn't act differently around her from the way I did on day 1, I showed my best friend every action I could have done wrong, he kept saying you did nothing wrong, I still believe I did, anyway, ever since I got back not only to my old self, but hell, my negative thoughts 100xed, I reached out for help, moving phase they said, I cried, griefed all I could, I focused on myself and kept going to the gym, kept eating healthy, I have quit porn forever as well, been porn free for as long as you can count, I never get the urge to watch it again, all the urge I get is I wanna have a person like her, and I wanna be successful and change my moms / sisters life, I do help them and buy appliances/  gifts to them and I try to be kind to them, I do my best in my jobs / I am working on a business with my friend, I am going to the  gym except for this week where I have lost my mind I think, first time I don't go is this week, look I can't write everything, I just wanna feel loved and I wanna enjoy being alone and stay focused on my missions for myself and my family, but, at the same time, I get super high levels of stress and negativity and I keep crying, in fact I am crying now, it's 5 AM and it's a weekend, I pulled away from most of my friends except my best friend whom I am grateful to have, but I am tired of venting out to him, I feel like he doesn't deserve this, I can't afford to vent out more to him, even tho he does to me too, but not as much as I do, I feel like I put enough on his shoulders and he has helped me enough, I know a million people have it worse than me I feel bad for them and I cry when I see a homeless person okay, I have good health, I have an ok job and I still have my mom and sister, but I can't help it, I literally cry till I can't breathe, I am so scared and I am so lonely, I thought maybe it was the idea of having a partner who lit me up, but no, it was just her in particular that was so kind and caring, and this is not a relationship subreddit, nor is it the main theme of this post, TL;DR I just can't help it, I feel so bad, I feel so unloved and no one gives a shit about me, I even feel like my mother doesn't care, I am also scared when the day comes that my mother is too old or she is gone, as at least she is the only soul that was genuine to me, I don't know what to do, focus on yourself, there are people that have it way worse than you"" I know but I can't help it, and I do everything possible to be my best self and I don't see results, I work two jobs so I can afford the gym calories and protien intake + pay for mym om and sister's college, I dont have time for the gym mostly, so I can't really get rid of my skinny physique which my mind thinks is why she wasn't ready for a relationship, or maybe it's affecting my self confidence, maybe it's cuz I am not tall, I don't know, most of the people I know have loving girlfriends and some of them even cheated, or were complete jerks, I try my absolute best not just in relationships, but also in business and in fitness, but I see no results in any aspect of my life, except the income increase recently but money isn't really helping, I wish if my father taught me a thing or two, I don't know what to do, I don't know how to live basically like how are people not just like wanting to end themselves and how can they be loved and be happy and effortlessly have someone that loves them, even when I don't put effort because maybe you think I am putting too much into my relationship or I am pushy, people just don't give a damn, it's like I am either super ugly and my friends are gaslighting me, or I have something wrong with my head, I am too stupid and I can't realize what's wrong with me, why me like, I see a guy who is a jerk and he is alcholic + smokes and everythin, and cheats and his GF loves him more than the world, friends respect him as well, while I don't smoke, I don't watch porn, I work out, I provide for m family, I try to parent myself, I try to self reflect, I keep doing self improvement, I try to jooin fun activites and hobbies, I am doing my best to have my own business even though I barely have enough time, but nothing is working out, what is wrong with me? I am so stupid + ugly thats what I genuinly think, I don't wanna do any black or redpill bs okay, I don't believe in any thing specific, I just don't see why this is how it is, like listen, I wasn't always try harding, I was younger and I was not thinking about any of this, I just liked video games, movies, animals and I had friends too in school, but when I am in my 20s I see that I am just becoming like, an outcast, like, I can't have a gf, I can't have free time, I can't figure out what am I supposed to do, and if I am afraid of leaving my family and focusing on myself because they have no one  but me, literally, just me, I can't travel and afford to leave them, I tried suicide over two times in the last few months, I can't figure anything out, and I don't know why can't I have the courage to end my life either, it's like I am hoping something will work out and my life will change for the better and I will feel content, the only bright spot in my entire life was her, and I am so sad that I probably messed it up, I don't know what to do, the advice I will probably get is just keep working out, keep saving money, but guys what if I am 30 and nothing changes, I can't just cope everyday I can't, it's sooo heavy, I am tired of crying I am tired of venting to my best friend, I am tired of feeling so anxious and lonely, I tried therapy but therapy won't change the fact that I am unloved and just have something wrong with me, like is it my genetics or i dont know, what am I lacking, what did I do wrong for her to change her mind, and why can't I open up to any other girl, and it is so difficult to find a good hearted kind souled girl like her, I wanna learn how to be happy on my own, but it is so hard, like I just can't, I don't know why am I even writin this here, no one knows all the details and I doubt that anyone cares either, I am forced to work for my mom and sis, if it werent for them, I would probably work a simple job and just isolate, I have to do it as it is the best paying job in case they need anything, I am not even close to being rich, I am not handsome and I am not tall, I am not funny, and I didn't have the best upbringing, my city barely has activities and I can't move out now, I googled piano classes, dance classes, archery, I did martial arts, I keep coming back to the gym, I read books, I eat healthy, why is nothing working guys, all I am asking for is just like one person to be kind to me as she was, honestly a part of me also just wants to be in a relationship as I wanna have great / carefree memories with another person that will also care for me, not just be one sided with my family, I just wanna love and feel loved, I want a nice kind girlfriend and to find a way to travel out of my country, the companies that sponsor visas just prefer engineers or super highly skilled individuals I am trying to be that, but its not working and I am not that bright or smart, also, I am afraid even if  I go to a first world country I will be even lonelier + I will leave my family behind to starve, honeslty, I don't know what to do, I feel like I am doing everything by myself all my by myself mentally and physically, and I have 0 support, if it weren't for my best friend I wouldn't have been alive, but I don't want to vent out to him anymore and give him negative energy while acting like nothing is off to me to the rest of the world, I wanna feel loved and recognized, I wanna have a car and a good looking body, I wanna be content and confident and have a girl friend that will commit to me too, but these things are taking so long that I feel like they will never come, and I will just keep woring 1-2 jobs till I lose my hair and die alone and miserable, a failure with wasted potential, I don't know why am I even writing this, and I don't know what am I supposed to do, ALL I am asking is a way not to feel shitty for a single day, so I can keep doing what I am doing, and that only happened when she was in my life, not it is worse than ever, and I cannot find a fix, honestly, I don't know what am I even writing at this point, hopefully I will die soon painlessly and forget everything",Bright-Notice-3190,,False,1cveisc,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cveisc/can_someone_please_help/

I love my partner so fucking much but my mental health is ruining our relationship. 

I've tried to leave since I'm obviously hurting this woman but the second she tells me that she doesn't want me to leave, I can't help but go back to her. 

I feel horrible and I feel disgusting because of the way I act towards her. I hate upsetting her but she doesn't want this relationship to end any more than I do. 

We want this to work but every time we ""try again"" it always results in me being at fault. It's always my fucking fault. Always. 
I don't want to keep hurting her but neither of us want to end this relationship. What the fuck do I do?

I  feel like she's cheated on me a few times but there's no way of me getting proof so I just have to accept the fact that I'll probably never know the truth and it's that uncertainty that leads me to act like a fucking animal.

I just don't know what to do. I try to talk to her but it's constant denial, the problem is that I don't know if I'm being paranoid or delusional or, what I fear, is actually true.

I know that it’s not too late, but I struggle so much, and I never had problems with doing many things and studying, is this what burnout looks like?

Am I right?,1716116196.0,"Hey!

I'm currently 24 years old and I'd much appreciate your honest opinion. 

I was se#ually a#bused when I was 6/7 years old and to ask for your opinion about the consequences of this I'd have to tell you how it went down. 

My aunt had a boyfriend whom my grandfather did not like so she had to hide him from sight. She had a separate room from the house, so she kept him there but she'd bring him food instead of having him go inside the house because of my grandfather. I can't remember she asking me to bring him dinner, but all I remember was that I had a plate on my hands and I was walking inside her room, knowing he'd be there. When I walked in he was on the bed, wearing nothing but my aunt's underwear. That's when the paranoia begins... 

I never thought this occurrence had affected me in any way, shape or form, but I think it did and more than I can realize. I say I don't think it affected me because it wasn't violent, and said person made me believe I wanted that (I know, i only recently came to realize how stupid that is of me to think), and he did not have intercourse with me, or so I don't remember. 

There's a lot of questions about this night that I wanted answered, one is how is a child left inside a room with a stranger and no one comes to check? Paranoia 1 is that my aunt and/or grandmother (who raised me) knew about it. 

Paranoia 2 is that the fact he was wearing my aunt's underwear was the reason I began having severe gender dysphoria throughout my life only now realizing it fully and considering transitioning. (yes, stupid, I know, but please bare with me, this causes me great confusion.)

Paranoia 3 is that it didn't affect me and the problems I have right now are due to other circumstances in my upbringing (chaotic family, substance abuse from family members that usually led to fighting and yelling, severe untreated depression throughout my whole teenage years that led me to isolate entirely to the point I did not leave my room - this stopped around 18/20, but I still suffer with social anxiety).

I guess what I'm trying to say is... Could this ab#se have caused me to develop gender dysphoria? Am I right into suspecting my aunt and/or grandmother knew what was happening? I don't know if it happened more than once. I'm only know paying more attention to this and going back because I was forced to tell everyone about said occurrence by another aunt whom I relied this information to, the only person in the family - she threatened to tell everyone so I did it instead, otherwise I'd probably have forgotten it. 

I'm sorry this was lengthy and thank you for reading everything. ",Hour_Ad_6411,,False,1cvlmup,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvlmup/am_i_right/

"M31 - I just finished my time at a clinic, and was diagnosed with severe depression, as well as reoccuring depression and sociophobia",1716112981.0,"Hello ya'll

As my title reads i've been in a psychological clinic for some time, mostly for diagnosis reasons. I probably dont have to tell anyone how annoying, upsetting, etc. symptoms can be. It sucks if you cant get up, cant move, and cant get stuff done. It sucks to have self destructive thoughts, to struggle with the easiest things in life and the sheer lack of understanding from family and friends. It also sucks to suffer through the loniless caused by such symptoms.

One day i woke up, and i was just tired. Tired and angry to not live my life like a ""normal"" adult. And thus i decided to finally do something about it, because i dont wanna live the rest of my life alone. Alone in a grey, sad world.

I've lived like that for over 10 years, i have missed out on valuable expiriences and years we should have in our young adult phase.

Now, after a few months of therapy and clinical treatment, i am finally feeling better. I am on medication, which luckily did not turn me into a zombie, nor did it have any severe side effects.

Of course there are still many many dark days, but then there are also happy days. And those are the days i cling on to, while im walking the long road ahead to a new life. 

I'll never be fully cured, i can only learn to live with it. Learn tricks and skills to handle situations, which ultimately lead me to my goal. Hopefully i can one day just have a very normal and boring life with a partner. Thats all i need at this point.

I dont wanna belittle nor berate any of you, as i know what its like.

How to find the right psychologist/counselor,1716112965.0,"It can be really hard to find a psychologist or counselor who is the right fit for us, particularly when we are acutely unwell and are seeking instant relief and do not have somebody else to support us and advocate for us in this process.

I had to see many people who (at the time at least) I found unprofessional and unhelpful, which can be a demoralizing experience when we are in a vulnerable state and reaching out for help, until I eventually found someone I had rapport with and felt I could trust and had the skills to help me.

Struggling with fear of windows,1716111835.0,"Earlier this year I broke a window in my house and cut my wrist quite severely. The cut was completely accidental as a result of my hand going through the window (I was not trying to self harm). I required stitches and have a thick scar which still causes me some pain. When it happened I was the only adult present and had my young children with me. I was terrified because the cut looked horrific, right across my wrist and up  the palm of my hand and I had no idea if I was going to bleed out (which might not be rational but that was the thought going through my head).
When I had the window replaced I learned that the windows on my house are very thin (half the thickness of modern windows) and lack other safety components. 
The problem is I seem to have developed some sort of fear which results in physical reactions. I've never had a fear like this before. My young son likes to bang on windows and I'm so scared he's going to break one and get cut. Every time he leans against or smacks a window or glass door in my house I get absolutely terrified. My head fills with images of the glass falling on him and cutting him horrifically (almost in two). My heart speeds up, I freeze and all I can think about is stopping it immediately, I pull him away from the window as fast as I can and if I can't get to him immediately (because I'm physically restrained like on the toilet or in another room) I scream at him until either he stops or I get to him, whichever happens first. I also have a physical response when I hear glass breaking (real life or in a movie) but I can calm myself quite quickly when that happens.
I'm at my wit's end. I can't replace the windows because I rent and I can't move because I have nowhere else to go. I don't know what to do or how to handle this fear.",TerrariumKiller,,False,1cvklij,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvklij/struggling_with_fear_of_windows/

So I'm a male in his early 20s. I have a problem that has always been haunting me ever since I was young.

In the extreme cases, these groups of friends start banding together and treating me like an outcast and gossiping behind my back. I'm a very self conscious person and always treat everyone nicely and kindly. I've nvr done anything that is hostile to any of them or anything of the sorts. But one thing I've noticed is that whenever I've made friends with those people, after a month or two, they start to act hostile towards me, some subtle and some very obvious. I've tried asking myself so many times what's wrong with me, why they reacted the way they did and what to fix abt me and how to fix myself, but I've nvr found the answer. I even stopped reaching out to ppl to befriend because this has always happened to me all the time, I've pretty much become anti-social most of the time now. I'm at a lost on what to do.

BP partner in depressive episode confessed his feelings to another woman,1716103286.0,"Hello, dear redditors. I have joined this subreddit to seek some support and advice. Hope you can help me to get some peace. This will be a long post, but I feel very hurt now, and need to vent, so forgive me that.

6 months ago I met a guy, 33 years old. I’m 27. It was unrolling slowly between us, but eventually we started to like each other and have frequent meetings. Be both agreed to exclusivity, and confessed that we enjoyed each others company, and that we are more than just friends. He always took lead and reached out for a contact with me, texted me first, and was quite engaging. At one point I started to realize I was falling for him.

3 months in I started to notice he suddenly got a little sadder. But I couldn’t figure out what was going on. This was slowly happening over the period of several weeks. He has always told me about his anxiety issues, and his sleep problems. One time he even broke out in tears in front of me, and I tried to support him and calm him down the way I could. We kept seeing each other, but I saw something was going on, his mood was always getting slightly lower with every upcoming week, which started to distress me. I asked many questions, trying to figure out the reason, but could never get to the point. I figured he was suffering from some sort of depression, probably.

One day we agreed to meet, but he suddenly cancelled, and said he does not want to see people right now, and does not want to be around anyone. I got confused and very anxious, I thought something happened. But he refused to see me or get my help.

over the next couple of weeks he was texting me a couple of messages a day, letting me know that he is in some sort of ‘comatose’, feeling very anxious, restless, and not able to sleep. This is where I started to google the symptoms, and confronted him. Turns out his is BP, and he was scared to tell me because of the stigma.

This episode lasts from the beginning of April. He finally decided to take medication. He was not unmedicated before, because he was scared. I tried my best to talk to him, and support him, as much as I could. It cost me a lot of stress, sleepless nights and tears, because I mainly could not figure out what is wrong with him.

He got very cold with me, he stopped calling me sweet names, be gentle with me, and complained about no libido, which is totally normal. He said he needed a friend more than anything now. He said he does not feel like he can be with anyone now, that he does not feel anything to anyone at this point of time. I knew I already liked him a lot, and I confronted him with this, but said that I will support him as much as I can now.

I knew he had a female friend, he knows for a long time. Yesterday he texted me that this friend is leaving to another country in a couple of months. He said he confronted her that he likes her, and she said the same back. According to him, he just realized that he has ‘feelings’ a week ago, when she told him she’s leaving. But he said he does not know, what exactly he feels to her. Whether because he is sad a friend is leaving, or he actually likes her, he doesn’t know.

but this hit me very hard. I hope it makes sense of that I explained here. I am very hurt and do not know what to do.

do bipolar people have mood/feeling switches like this? I feel like everything what happened before this depressive episode was a lie, and my feelings were misused.

Will therapy do anything for me?,1716100315.0,"Hi! Fair warning. I can’t articulate myself. So if you make it through this.. you deserve an award.

I’ve had a fucked life. Sexual abuse, parental violence, relationship violence, childhood poverty ect. 

I’m am aware that none of this is my fault. I’m aware I had no control over the worst of it. 

I had the strength to leave my first verbally/sexually abusive relationship. I had the strength to leave my marriage after my husband told me he wasn’t attracted to me anymore. I’m trying to make this as short as possible but giving enough details. 

I feel like therapy is for regrounding people, bringing them back from delusions created by others with malicious intent. I’m okay with the childhood sexual abuse. It doesn’t affect me as an adult. I’m okay with the parental abuse I witnessed because it taught me what a relationship ISNT. I’m okay with my adult sexual abuse and mental abuse because I learned again what a relationship ISNT. Childhood poverty taught me how to be good with money and I’m doing great on that aspect. That brings me to my divorce… 

I have always had bad self esteem, shocker with my history, but my ex brought me out of that. He was the first man to make me believe I was beautiful. Told me I could be a model. I was always tiny tiny cross country athletic. Covid hit and I eventually lost my job. I gained a lot of weight on my frame. I became 160lbs at 5’4”. It was a big change for me and I was down bad. But he loved it. On my frame it was not flattering. I no longer had the abs and tone and was pretty chubby. I’m sure many many women look incredible at that weight, but this is me specifically. I did not. I was devastated. 

I returned to work after Covid and the weight started dropping. I was so happy and felt so much better. 

One night my ex disappeared. I found him sobbing upstairs. Of course I panicked asking what was wrong. He said he was no longer attracted to me. He was piss drunk, so as devastated as I was, I put him to bed. Next day I confronted him and he reiterated that I lost weight and he isn’t attracted to me. I still was not at my original healthy weight. I tried to stay but over the next two years he repeated it over and over. Even grabbing certain areas of me saying “I liked when these got bigger”. It destroyed me.

I’m a small tiny girl with a decent body. Yeah B cups but a decent butt. Runner body. He fucked me up permanently and I don’t see how therapy can help. We had the relationship everyone was jealous of. We were the model for all of our friends perspective relationships and then this… 

I’m now dating someone far far far out of my league and it’s serious and I know we will be married. However, I can’t get out of fight or flight mode. I constantly ready to be let down. If the man I worshipped for 10 years did this to me… and not to be foul but my ex isn’t comparable to my current man in any way shape or form. This man is anyone’s dream. How am I good enough for this man when a man who is 1/100 of him told me I wasn’t good enough.

Sensory issues,1716098872.0,"Hi, so I have ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (If this info Is helpful).

Recently, like within the past half a year or so, I have noticed that I’ve become more and more sensitive to loud noises. The sound of the vacuum running is probably the worst. I just vacuumed my house and had to stop because I was so overwhelmed and it was making me feel physically scared. I was actually on the edge of a panic attack. This has been happening every time now.

I also feel super overwhelmed when in public places with a large amount of people and things going on. I went to a craft convention and I had to take multiple breaks because I couldn’t handle all the things going on. It makes me feel like my eyes are darting all over the place and I can’t concentrate on anything. Then that makes me feel really disassociated.

"What is the appropriate belief or alternative way of responding for someone with OCD about a fear of ""not knowing themselves perfectly"" ?",1716098305.0,"Basically, I'm confused what the healthy alternative would be (insteead of reassurance seeking by posting and asking opinions about how people see me/what I'm really like or compulsively researching/ ruminating/introspecting)

At it's core I think my obsession/ fear is basically about the possibility of not knowing myself (I'm afraid I'm actually morally bad/deluding myself/fooling everyone and if I don't figure out my flaws and see myself accurately it could be humiliating to be viewed as deluded and full of myself and also unsafe, like others can hurt me badly by pointing out character flaws I didn't know I had, and I'm actually a much different/ worse person than I thought)

But I feel like this is kind of a reasonable fear? It's actually very likely I don't know myself and others will end up pointing out flaws and other things about myself I don't know. That's how life works? So it's not like most OCD where you accept uncertainty but the likelihood of your fear happening is super low. My fear is quite possible and even plausible?!

Breaking down and need clarity,1716095366.0,"\*\*Throwaway account due to personal nature.\*\*

I've been with my partner for over 20 years, and we have a 5-year-old child. I am the sole breadwinner and primary caregiver. My partner has worked less than a year in all the time we’ve been together.



We met in college and moved across the country for my first job. He also got a job but was unhappy and quit after seven months, citing depression. Initially, I urged him to find another job, but eventually, I stopped asking. My career was thriving, and we had a comfortable lifestyle without the added stress of pushing him to work.



He started drinking heavily to cope with his depression and refused to seek medical help, insisting that doctors and medications were ineffective. I stayed with him until his behavior became frightening. On two occasions, I left our apartment in the middle of the night, fearing for my safety. One night, he brandished a knife and threatened suicide. I locked myself in a room and called 911. He was arrested and received a misdemeanor charge. His parents intervened, sending him to rehab, followed by two months in a sober living environment (SLE). Despite being close to leaving him, he convinced me to stay, promising to change. I stayed, motivated by love, cultural conditioning against divorce, and my desire to have a child.



Since rehab, he hasn’t drunk alcohol. However, a year after the incident, he developed paranoid delusions, believing our neighbors and strangers were stalking him. These episodes of psychosis would come and go. I initially tried to reason with him, but I later realized that logic doesn’t work with psychosis. Unfortunately, his psychiatrist was also ineffective, using rational arguments rather than understanding his condition. We managed through these episodes, but it was exhausting.



Now, I am emotionally drained. He accuses me of lacking understanding and empathy, which may be true. I've spent most of my adult life with him, and the situation has conditioned me to rely solely on myself financially and mentally. After our child was born, I took on the majority of childcare, as he claimed his mental state prevented him from helping with night feedings. Outwardly, I appear competent and witty, but inside, I feel broken and alone.



I am scared. I fear for my child’s future with a psychotic father and feel sad about my own lack of happiness. I have no one to confide in; my close connections are either gone or unable to handle this drama. I could leave and take my son, likely gaining primary custody, but I struggle with guilt over leaving my partner without financial support. If I leave, he would have to move back in with his parents, as we live in a high-cost-of-living area. He insists that moving back would be the end of his life. I also worry about alimony, as I am the primary breadwinner and we’ve been together for a long time.



I don’t understand how I, an educated and smart professional, can be emotionally manipulated. I had chances to leave but was afraid of being alone. Now, with a child, I am still afraid. Why do I feel responsible for his well-being when he refuses to take care of himself? He makes excuses to avoid help and manipulates me into feeling responsible for him. I know I have made a lot of mistakes in this relationship, letting things slip. I am finally tired.

But, one day I watched ""The Deer Hunter"". That movie has a slow first half and a much better second half. In the first half, there's a wedding scene. It's around 51 minutes long and it's just the characters at a wedding, nothing really happens. It is mind-numbingly boring and I wanted to pull my hair out. I watched it in it's entirety because I'm a completionist. What's weird is, after watching it, I had so much energy. It even lasted to the middle of the next day.

Getting over someone who is not good for you?,1716094113.0,"I ‘37F’ left my boyfriend ‘41M’ over a year ago. It was needed. He had zero respect for me after have our child and would lash out and blame everything that went wrong on me. I had been with him 14 years and realized everything was getting worse. 

Don’t get me wrong. I had some red flags about two years into the relationship. But I was dumb and thought love could be enough. 

Years later we went through a bad spot but got replaced what most women see as someone in pursuit of a goal. Then things leveled out and it was ok but not exactly where I wanted to be.

We hit some hard times before I got pregnant. It was an accident, not planned because I was thinking of leaving before then. Even started house hunting. Then found out I was pregnant and decided to try once more.

He literally had zero respect for me at that time and I was not ok continuing that role. No amount of trying to talk would lead to a discussion but more just him giving me the silent treatment. More my health and metal health I had to get away. 

Now he is dating, honestly I thought that would be better for me. A push for me to actually move on with my life. But I feel paralyzed. Sure in the end he was absolutely horrible to me. But it is hard to shake 14 years. Harder still for me to see him with another genuinely good woman. Like does he even deserve that. 

In the end I am upset and feel oh so played. How did I get so bamboozled. How do I even trust a guy is who they say they are after this. It took so damn long to see the true colors. I need to get over this person but it doesn’t help that I have to work with them for my son.

Preface information: Gay 23 Year old male living in a rural/small town area diagnosed with Depression Anxiety Asthma and ADHD (ADHD was not diagnosed as a child)

Exactly as the titles says i just want to run away and start over but i can't. Is it healthy no but I just don't know what else to do at this point. Compared to most people probably has a decent life with a supportive family, but I am unhappy with all of it and haven't been happy since I was 16. 

I have been to multiple therapists but have yet to have a consistent one and currently my newest one I see maybe once a month due to high demand in my area. And we have not even begun to actually begin helping my issues. (Have been seeing her for 2 months now. I believe I am being properly medicated however I forget even with alarms set to take my meds (and lost my depression meds which yes I know is not helping). 

I just got hired for a 3rd shift job making decent pay and hopefully can start a decent saving so i can eventually move away. I also have a prior commitment working for someone during the day watching their storefront while they are out with a trailer at different places. This is not every day but more like every other weekend for now until summer when i am excreted to watch the store more frequently. This will have me working 10pm-6am and 11am-6pm some days which I know won't work. I need to tell the store owner I can't do it but I don't want them to get mad and screw them over as they won't be able to find someone to cover their store if I don't. (And yes that's their problem not mine but still)

I have aging grandparents and my mom/dad doesn't have the time to help them or spend a lot of time with them nor does my sister make an effort to most of the time either. My grandfather on my dad's side is more worse off than my grandmother on my mom's side due to his age and having a stroke (but not telling anyone he had one). He constantly answers obvious scam calls and orders stuff off the TV or elsewhere and when we try to help him he fights with us because he doesn't want to be the steotypical old person (which he is) my dad's brothers still live at home mooch off him and do not acknowledge his existence 99% of the time as well. 

I have tried to go to college twice couldn't get into the institution I wanted and flunked out both times due to the pressure, teachers insulting me, and my mental issues that were the colleges refused to acknowledge even with my attempting to give them the paperwork to do so through proper channels. This is to the point where I don't even know if it is worth going back as everyone I graduated with for the most part is either graduated already, have great careers, have kids, or just are overall very happy and content with their lives. 

One of my best friends also died in early 2022 and I could not attend the funeral as I was working and had moved away for college (or attempted to) and everyone back home completely forgot I even existed as a friend to him. I had to beg and plead to get something to remember him by (one of his deckboxes for card games) and I'm still not even over his death as he and I spent almost every night playing video games together and I can't even touch those games without being reminded of him. This also includes the card games I play too mainly Yu-Gi-Oh as he played that slong with my other best friend but it's just not the same. 

Most of my issues stemmed from high school where I feel my life just ended.  I was diagnosed with asthma at 16 after having a lot of issues with cross country and swimming and subsequently diagnosed with Depression and anxiety a couple of months later due to constantly bullying from teammates and one of the cross country coaches that I was either faking it or that asthma is not real. I was one of the star swimmers in our school until our original coach left and one of the cross country coaches took over. Because of my asthma my mental illness and non supportive coaching staff I just drifted to a point where I was basically one of the worst on the team and had no idea what I was doing with my life and still don't to this day. I was the gifted kid growing up but once I got to high school and asked for help I was told I would just figure it out like I always do I was a smart kid so my cries for help were always ignored. 

EDIT: almost forgot but I have 0 love life no one around me wants to date and I have very little options where I live one guy I went to school with moved to a big city close by and seems to have no trouble finding guys who actually want to date so I guess I'm just also jealous of that and want the same options he has. 


TLDR:  
I want to run away and start over because of
1. No consistent mental health
2. I don't like people depending on me
3. I have too many commitments and I don't know  to say no
4. Aging grandparents that expect me to be at their beck and call
5. Issues with School feeling left out/behind
6. Death of a close friend and not being able to get over it 
7. Issues stemming from High school where I feel my life ended.

Scared to take SSRI’s and SNRI’s any other type of effective anti-anxiety med suggestions? ,1716089483.0,"I was recently diagnosed with PTSD, GAD, OCD (and probably ADHD but I can’t afford the official diagnosis but my psychiatrist says it’s likely). My psychiatrist and I both believe that my GAD is causing me the most issues right now so that is the priority with my treatment. That being said, she wants me to take Prozac to treat my GAD, OCD, and PTSD at the same time. But I’ve read about the risk of sexual dysfunction, which can apparently continue even after discontinuing SSRI’s and SNRI’s. The other two meds my psychiatrist suggested both have these risks as well and I feel VERY hesitant to take a medication that could destroy my ability to enjoy sex again, as some people have apparently lost the ability to orgasm permanently. 

I was wondering if anyone has experience with any other type of meds to treat GAD, it would be great if it helps with PTSD and OCD as well but my priority is GAD. I’ve heard some doctors use Wellbutrin off label to treat GAD but I can’t find much about that online.

Any suggestions would be really really appreciated 🫶🏼

Concern about my daughter,1716087998.0,"*Just to clarify, there’s no real violence happening here, just had to choose flair to post*
So I have a young adult daughter who seems to be stuck in this Peter Pan situation. She doesn’t want to be an adult and can’t seem to apply herself or finish anything she starts. She’s made so many excuses and when she changed her environment and tried a different school she just did the same thing, stopped doing the work and just stopped going. Lately I’ve noticed a trend in which she has days where she’s full of anger at the littlest things, raising her voice and not able to control her frustration towards things. She does let take advice from me very easily, she usually blows up if I say something wrong. Does anyone have any insight what she may be struggling with? She recently lost her job after blowing up at work when one of her supervisors said she had a bad attitude that day. It’s clearly becoming a bigger problem lately. I really don’t think this is IED, because she’s not suddenly exploding for no reason, her anger and aggression about small things will go on all day long and bounce from one small problem to the next. The next day she acts totally normal 🤷🏼‍♀️",BeltFit7785,,False,1cvejfi,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvejfi/concern_about_my_daughter/

Im falling apart in my first semester,1716085085.0,"Hey everyone!



So I am currently a first-year Mechatronic Engineering student. Studying engineering has been a passion and dream for me my whole life, but this dream is slowly falling apart. I did pretty well in school, and things seemed to go really well at the start of this year too.



I’m doing really well in the majority of my modules: Programming, 3D Design, Physics, etc. But I have big problems with Calculus 1 and Digital Electronics. These two modules are slowly making me wonder if I chose the right career path.



I’m currently failing both those modules, and my final exams are coming up in about two weeks. Because of this, I’ve been in complete overdrive mode for the past three or four weeks. I haven’t left my house this whole time except for class, and I’m only attending the two problem modules at this point.



I’ve developed major sleeping issues, worse than usual, so sometimes I can only fall asleep every second day with maybe a short nap here and there. I felt okay mentally, but then I got multiple phone calls today from friends who were worried because they thought I had unalived myself since they hadn’t seen me in a while. This came as quite a shock, but after some reflection, I realized I have been acting differently around them. My brain is in complete hyperfocus mode, so I forget to reply to their messages. Now, I have so many unread messages that I’m too scared to reply. I’ve unintentionally cut off so many people in my life since I don’t reach out when they try to contact me. I also called my parents for the first time in probably a month, who were also very worried because I usually call once or twice a week.



So I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. If I’m already folding so much under pressure in my first semester, how do I expect to survive the rest of my time studying? I also can’t figure out why I’m struggling. In my friend group, I am the tutor for pretty much all our modules because I usually have a solid understanding of the topics. They admit they do well because of my help, but then I end up failing. Even though I’ve been grinding to catch up these past few weeks, I still feel like I know nothing.

And its not like I am stressing so much during a test that I blank out. I am usually super calm during and before tests.

I'm Alone.,1716084883.0,"I’m a 16 year white guy, and I’m saying this shit on Reddit, because I just want to vent about everything without facing the consequences of saying them to actual people. Most of you won’t read this, and won’t give two flying fucks about what I’m feeling (like everyone else), and I’m okay with that. Used to it. Without further ado, unlikely reader, enjoy the show…  
  
Speaking of shows, I feel like I put on one every day I wake up. Like the whole world’s my audience, I it’s actor. I act like everything’s fine, say everything’s fine, hang out with friends, smile, laugh, talk, and make others do the same. I socialize decently, I go to the gym, and explore my so-called “passions”. I have a job, work most weekends, and am starting to work more since classes just ended. I get home to a loving, financially healthy family with two supportive parents, and two younger brothers (I am the eldest son). Everything in my life seems amazing, just fine.  
  
It’s not fine. I’m not fine. I don’t think I’ve been “fine”, much less “good”, in a long while. My “passions” are all a falsity; I do them not out of self-enjoyment, but of the image it creates for me and the praise I get from those around me. I go to the gym not out of drive to make myself better in my eyes, but in the eyes of others. I talk to others to make them happy, and feel good, but I never get that same return myself. I feel so alone, yet am so surrounded by “friends” and family. I don’t think I’ve ever looked myself in the mirror and said “You look good today, Gabriel.” Or “I love myself.”  
I can’t love myself. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what I think about myself. All that matters, what truly matters, is who I am in the eyes of others. Image is everything, and will continue to be.  
  
I’ve been told by many I’m an attractive person. I don’t believe them. I never will, most likely. Again, it doesn’t matter what I believe, but it does matter what others do. I’m aware I shouldn’t speak of the matters of the heart, as I am young, so I may say things with a naiveté that others may find idiotic. Yet the one thing I crave, the thing that makes me happiest, or feel happiest, is the thought of a lover. The thought of a girl meant for me, that I can be everything for, and that can be my everything. That I care for deeply, and am cared for to the same lengths. A girl who can save me and pull me out of this dark, soul-shattering mess of loneliness, self-loathing, and depression, and say “ You’re enough for me. I am here for you. I’m not going anywhere.” I have extremely terrible attachment and abandonment issues, as I’m sure you, dear reader, can tell. I’ve tried everything possible to find this love of mine, to find this girl that’s meant for me. I’ve chased, and I’ve waited. I’ve cared not, and I’ve cared. And every time one gets close enough, gets even a little interested, it only takes a look, and a few words, and I’ve called head over heels. A few words that can be lied. A look that can be faked. Words that have been lied. Looks that have been faked. The second I show even a fraction of care, of affection, they run. They are drawn in by my looks, but as soon as they peel back my skin and I be myself, they run. I hate how much I loathe myself, how much I am starved of affection, that the second a different person shows love, I take it as a god-given sign that it is “meant to be”. It never is. It never has been. I’ve never had a relationship before, gotten to experience romantic love. And I want it so badly. I deserve it, I am told, by many people, yet am scorned time and time again. It is so easy for people to say “you’ll find someone”. They never say when. Or who. Or how. Because they don’t truly know. No girl wants to be with a boy who gets attached too easily, and becomes too scared that they’ll stop caring about them. Yet that is me, and that is being myself. Sixteen years without a lovers touch, a kiss, or even a word. And yet, the world moves on.  
  
My mother fears I’ll turn to drugs or substances as I’m falling ever deeper into the chasm of my emotions. She thinks I’m like every other blathering idiot teenager who thinks that it’s fine to vape, or do crack, pot, or heroin. I am not. However, I have started hurting myself. Nothing too serious. I’ve taken matches and burned them into myself, and the worst thing I’ve done is cut and bite myself. It matters not. I am told I’m attractive. I would not be told that if people saw what lies beneath my clothing. They would see burns. Cuts. Pain. They would see me as I see myself. And one day, they wouldn't see anything at all.  
  
My heart is shattered steel. Hardened, yet broken, like my body, and my mind. I crave the one thing that is always within reach, yet too far to grasp. I am not ungrateful for my fortunate life, but am not happy with it. I am depressed, lonely in the deepest sense, and will never achieve anything. Thank you, dear reader, for listening to an overly privileged teenage white boy cry like a whelp about his meaningless problems and empty existence. I bid thee adieu, and close the curtains on my performance for the day.

My sibling is depressed and I feel useless,1716083236.0,"My younger sibling and I were very close growing up. We’re only one year apart so it was easy to get along and play together. Despite getting along, we had very different personalities. I was the goody-two-shoes and they were the trouble maker. Whenever they would get scolded by teachers, our parents, other kids, etc., I always stood up for them. I love my sibling with all my heart. They are my best friend to this day and I would do anything for them. Now that we are older, both of us being in college, I understand that I can’t always fight their battles for them, but it is so rough seeing them struggle. They did very well in high school and got a full ride to a prestigious college, but it feels as if everything has been going downhill since. They have had a lot of bad experiences with people at the college and don’t really fit in. Their grades have decreased dramatically and they are often sick, whether it is a bad cold or throwing up randomly. I convinced them to talk to a counselor/therapist and they were diagnosed with bipolar disorder. They took meds for a while but they insist that none of it works. Right now, they are back home for summer break and we’ve had some time to talk. They don’t enjoy doing anything they usually did. They don’t like eating because they hate that they’ve gained weight. They told me that they hate their reflection and just don’t feel alive. They reassured me that they won’t do anything to endanger their life but I feel as if they are slipping through my fingers slowly. No amount of talking seems helpful, in fact, they seem more and more over it the more I talk to them. I keep having dreams that I lose them.

My family is very conservative and religious, so my parents don’t believe in mental health illnesses.

I can do 100 body weight pull ups, run a mile in 10 mins and 30 seconds (working to get it in under 10). My deadlift max is 280 (I weigh 154) shoulder press the 40s for 2-3 sets, etc. None of that fucking matters. Guys could care less... I'm ugly, so it's not impressive and it doesn't matter. Losing weight isn't even that big of an achievement, so many other people have done the same exact thing. I still feel inhuman.

Oh, and there's this dude that I see every single day that claims were just ""best friends with benefits"" yet acts like a boyfriend and gets mad when I say I'm going to spend time with someone else. He likes other chick's posts, so I share them and he doesnt like it when I share it and I don't understand why I'll never be good enough. I just want to look like every other chick my age (I'm 24) but I have to continue to hide in ugly baggy clothes, I don't like anything that I own. I won't buy anything that I like because I continue to lose body fat and will be having skin removal sugery asap ( Im at 21% the goal is anthing below 20% and then sugery. I dont care if thats low Im going to have abs. After sugery ill begin mma and cross fit). I see all of these posts and all these females look amazing after weight loss and don't have the skin (my stomach legit looks exactly the same as before weight loss) and here I am, still just as hideous, worthless...

The last time I felt this way I fell in love with the gym. Now there's nothing besides possibly returning to self harm, wich only helps temporarily anyways. I don't know what to do. I just want to look like and be able to do the things that everyone else my age is doing. I just want to matter to someone and be respected and not used. I'm getting so tired... again... I don't want to feel this way... again. If I can't enjoy my body and still strongly resemble Shrek then it's all been pointless.

"a part of me feels violated, a part of me feels i am to blame for consenting. i just know i can't stop thinking about it. i deeply regret partaking in a roleplay with an older woman when i was merely 20.",1716080755.0,"i am writing this on a throwaway as i have never told anyone this, and i don't actually know how to feel about it.

  
i was a depressed, self loathing and insecure newly independent individual and part of an online chat community at the time. a lot of those people were really close friends of mine even though we had never physically met.  
at the time i was 20, and at the center of this group was a woman in her early 30s dealing with her own issues, dating another woman in the group and for the most part it was a group where we talked about general interested and nerdy things. aka a normal chat group. however, at some point an nsfw channel was created as we had moved to discord from previous software.

  
at the time i was exploring my own situation, i had just recently moved from home and knew i was interested in bdsm. but i had nobody i knew or trusted to talk about it, growing up most people had outright stated disgust or called people who enjoyed bdsm things like 'freaks' whenever it came up in a discussion. dealing with my own trauma of bullying and alienation i kept it part of myself, feeling like it was another thing proving to the world that something was wrong with me.

  
at some point bdsm was mentioned in the nsfw group by the woman in question, at the point we were friends, so i carefully reached out mostly to ask questions, try to learn from someone who was also interested in the same thing. i had some serious issues with guilt and shame and i hoped to learn and get better from this. nothing happened at this point but we talked, including that i found out things about her and her girlfriends relationship.

  
as time went on, it was clear things were shifting until it outright lead to the creation of a seperate channel just for nsfw things in relation to one of the mods shutting down the nsfw channel as we had gotten an influx of younger people, it was quite a mixed group at that time. At the time I joined that wanting to still have an outlet to talk about things. But as I was mentally unwell so I would find out that she was aswell, but when I did stuff had deteriorated.

  
while she had a relationship she had always been open about the fact that she was poly, especially in relationship to the kink scene. and the nsfw channel quickly started devolving into her dragging people into that sort of thing, even if it was done slowly at first. in my own depression, and self loathing i had gotten convinced way earlier that nobody would ever want me, that there was no hope for me on the relationship front, especially not with bdsm.

  
she started to flirt with me, well knowing my interests.

  
at the time i was still establishing myself in a new town, i had few friends and generally felt lonely, i was careful at first but a part of me was drawn to play along which i did. and gradually it got more indepth, all of this was online, but it started to include real life roleplay and commands, i had known she was older than me, that i should have been careful but i was so desperate and getting a sort of attention i had never experienced before. i let my own desires start running ahead of me, usually leaving me feeling grossed out by myself. but i also felt like i couldn't stop, because i wanted the attention of someone, the notion that somebody cared.

  
while i did not know it at the time, she had started growing increasingly unwell herself, ending up in fights with her partner and becoming more engrossed in general, trying to make bdsm as big a part of her life as she could. roleplay had turned to photos from my end, it was one sided, and it was clear it wasn't a 'relationship' from her end but at the time i thought it was okay. at it's peak she gifted me a collar, which i did buy myself so it was never really a gift.

  
it became names, obligations and a roleplay that started affecting my life, i wish i had realized what was going on at the time but this was when things started falling apart. there was a huge fight between her and her partner, the community itself reeled and she became increasingly distant, from having led on and pushed me towards this for months she now retreated but still whenever we talked tried to keep the thing going. I at the time intentionally started to cut back a bit on it but I had come to rely on her in a way that i know is unhealthy, something she had both encouraged and pushed for that she now withheld. if we ever did anything, as i realized now it only went till she felt satisifed/done and usually ended with her ghosting me for prolonged periods of times before returning and repeating the same sort of kind, flirting into a session into ghosting. at the time i was too unwell to understand and she always ended up making me feel guilty. she called me demanding, a burden and that i was being selfish, i finally read her behaviour as a need to step back and did so but she would always come back, always try to start the same process again, encouraging and telling it's fine regardless of what i did. it didn't help that i was still young, and unwell and relied a bit on her validation and encouragement to deal with my own issues. it was never fair on my end.

  
and by the side things on her side went extremly bad, i hadn't realized it at the time but i wasn't the only one she kept repeating this process with, and outside of that including reasons for her fight with her partner was growing issues at home including self harm and suicidal ideation.  
I tried to help after a while, without bdsm, I still thought of her as a friend despite everything and for a while things seemed to improve, she had broken up with her partner at that point but seemed more stable. i generally tried to stay away and not not contact her too much, except she contacted me. at the time she had found a new partner and she tried to start again with, i wish i had been as i am now, more rational and should have stayed away but after a while we resumed, i thought it had stabilized, but quickly it resumed to the previous levels of ghosting, roleplay and eventually the comments of me being a burden. at least it was scarcer as she spent more time with her new partner. and while i was unwell at that point i made a choice and i told her that i can't keep doing this like this anymore.

  
i am not a person good at confrontations but i felt that i couldn't do this anymore.

  
shortly thereafter while she didn't contact me again, her partner did. he called me selfish and similarly a burden and that i needed to stop putting demands on her and be more considerate. at the time i mostly felt guilt, while she had been the initiator i knew i had been problematic and affected her negatively.

  
at the time i consented to all of this out of desperation, inexperience and self loathing. i am not claiming i am innocent, nor that this was some form of overstepping on her part but i have mixed feelings and a lot of regret about what happened. not to mention that following it my own guilt and shame over my own sexuality trippled, damaging real friendships and crushes i had and generally harmed my mental health the years thereafter including my own, albeit avoided suicide attempt at one point. Yet thanks to that and some other things I did recover, I did get better and it's been years both since this happened and since I got better but recently it's been on my mind a lot. a part of me feel violated, that our situation was too skewed and imbalanced. a part of me feels guilt, i feel like it was my fault for consenting to it in the first place and letting it happen. i tried to remember thing as well as i could but i am realizing my memory is foggy, some things have been mixed up and i am probably coming off too skewed against her as we were both in bad places..

I don’t know what to do or what the right answer is,1716083405.0,I’ve known my bf for 12 years we were best friends for 7 of those years. We’ve dated on and off for a while now but he tells me he only loves me. He is the only one to ever leave and even when we’re apart I stay loyal to him. When he leaves me he is usually texting other girls within 30 minutes to a day after breaking up with me. This time getting back together I told him I couldn’t handle going through it again. I never struggled with mental health up until these past years and I feel like I’m currently at my worst. I feel like nothing I do can ever be right and I think a big part of it is this relationship. I stress myself out trying to be so perfect for him so he can’t blame me and say I’m not what he wants if I catch him texting other girls. I know everyone says he isn’t good to me and I should leave but when he leaves me I am more sad than ever. When we’re in person he does a better job and says he wants to see me happy but when it’s over the phone he just tells me to shut up or ignores me so now when I’m upset I don’t say anything. I get stressed out and ask him if he’s talking to other girls regularly because it’s just happened way too many times but then he says I’m crazy for asking and that he’s gonna leave me if I can’t trust him but how can I be capable of trusting him I just don’t understand but I also don’t know if I am in the wrong and he’s right.,Conscious_Ad_8585,,False,1cvd49q,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvd49q/i_dont_know_what_to_do_or_what_the_right_answer_is/
Miserable but too exhausted with life to do anything about it.,1716083397.0,"Some background...

11 year colon cancer survivor. Have fairly severe gastrointestinal issues from surgery that I CAN mostly manage but it requires revolving life around a very strict and encumbering routine that I was sick of and completely over YEARS ago. I struggle with immense anxiety that I would mostly say is caused by the amount of dread I have about being required to exist. Hope that makes sense. Every day is just such a monotonous slog that thinking about having to do it over and over makes me want to throw up.

I'm medicated with klonopin which helps with the ""omg I feel like I'm dying"" panic attacks but I still have a generally pervasive disdain for life and more or less everything that it asks of me. I have no patience or tolerance for people because I am constantly so miserable with myself that I have nothing positive to project. 

The problem is that I am the way that I am and have been doing it for so long that I am exhausted with life to the point where the concept of caring enough to do anything that might help is a foreign concept. I don't know what happy is. I haven't felt it in years and have no motivation to go on what I feel like is a unicorn hunt in order to find what I don't feel exists for me.

I don't work because I can't and am in the middle of a disability claim that will take 2 years and assuredly be denied so I'm broke all the time which helps the self worth thing a lot. I don't really know what the end game is when they deny that so there's a lot of stressful hopelessness on top of everything else.

I imagine this is where people who are capable of doing so end their life but I'm just not wired that way. The sense of obligation to the people who it would hurt has and will always keep me from doing that which kind of  makes my situation feel like a prison. 

I don't even know what I'm asking or what I'm searching for or hoping for someone to say.

Edit: I've read a lot about anhedonia which I have a lot of the symptoms of in that I get enjoyment from literally NOTHING but maybe not in the sense that I'm able to be miserable which means I'm capable of feeling something.

Can you have compulsions without having OCD?,1716081328.0,"I was talking to my friend about some compulsive behaviors I have- specifically two.

The other is centered around shopping, I’ve always had really bad spending habits in general and just buy things I like without thinking but in the last year or two I’ve noticed a lot of the times I’ll see something I want to buy and if I don’t, I will not be able to stop thinking about it and feel like I absolutely need to have it until I eventually buy it.

Stuck in the past (ruminating),1716080983.0,"hey so i am (F19) now in college, but the negative comments/experience I had had in high school sticks to me. I had moved around high school freshman - sophomore (covid for half of freshman and full year for sophomore)  year i stayed a new high school in a new district, moved again junior year to the old district in a new high school. I had known some people from elementary, tried to catch up, it was good for the first half of the year, but later on it went downhill. people (girls) were not that nice, I would say that I use positive reinforcement in a negative way. 

Some girls who I thought were my friends would sometimes say things and in the moment, I would feel for a second that it was hurtful, but because I like to protect myself, I painted it as maybe a joke, them being playful, and I did that for the rest of the school year. It was really the first time people ever really dug at me. I am not good at confrontation and I don't like to see the truth if I know that it will hurt me. 

It was the typical things, pretending to be your friends upfront, or making comments surrounding your body, backbiting, being judge mental, making comments surrounding my intelligence, (i would ditch, but i was really sad and I constantly looked for anything to make me happy) I know that from high school to older age, you do hit puberty again and I was a bit skinnier back then and sometimes their comments would revolve around my body and now that I have gained a few pounds I can feel the old comments being reinforced (in my head). Or some comments that I am not that pretty, and somethings I believe in those comments, even though i know they aren't true, I know a part of me believes it. It's hard to think that people who have done you wrong will live a peaceful life. 

We live around the same area so smths I fear (even when writing this) that they may see this post or see me and laugh. I have struggled with my sense of self esteem, since I have been little. I tend to cover it by trying to appear confidence, which backfires and I usually end up being cocky. I try to cover it with makeup or my hair, but I know that when I take it all of, it isn't me. 

I am obsessed with them and I can find myself ruminating with the idea. I have already talked with a counselor ( i went online for senior year to get mental health) and I fear when I see them (old classmates, not the girls in general) that they smths look at, some have asked, one followed me for a bit, and I know it is none of their business, but it still haunts me. 

I constantly feel the need to prove something to them even though they are no longer in my life, maybe my ego is hurt, but I tried talking to counselors and they seem frustrated that I'm stuck in the same situation, so I'm afraid. I want to be better and live free of them. 

How do I move forward, live in the present, not fear them anymore, and improve my self esteem. It seems I pretend to be confident ends up in being cocky and cry bcuz deep down I know I’m insecure

Advice requested ,1716080616.0,"This may be a bit of a rant as well but there’s so much going on in my head right now, I have no real direction. 

I never really thought I was neurodivergent until the last couple of years after I had my son. Started with depression due to my ex husband wanting a divorce and cheating on me while I was pregnant. My “symptoms” have exploded since then and continue to get worse. My PCP at the time didn’t think there was anything wrong and put me on sertraline to start. I weaned myself off and had been med free until this year when it would have been my 5 year wedding anniversary. i had found a drop of hope with my new job who effected housing and good pay for my experience in the field. I moved on site at the end of January 2024. I found a new pcp a month ago and she said I had to get evaluated by a specialist in order for her to prescribe medication, and she also put me on a new antidepressant: a Wellbutrin XL. Shortly after that visit I found out my health insurance was no longer valid. This past Monday, I was laid off my job and given a month to find new housing. My divorce/child possession decree stated I had to live in this county. No child support. I’m devastated. I don’t have any real family to help and nowhere to go. I feel like my brain has been rotting for the last couple of years. I get distracted super easily and it’s difficult for me to stay on task. With no official diagnosis, and I can’t afford to seek out a specialist, I’m feeling incredibly defeated and lost.

Does anyone have any advice on how to obtain any kind of assistance? Housing? Healthcare? 

How do those of you with adhd/autism cope without medications? What kind of jobs do you have? My only job experience has been in veterinary clinics/customer care. I have no degree or certifications.

The weekend after I finished I went back home to visit friends and had a wonderful few days with them. These are people I miss dearly since I moved, so seeing them is always a great way for me to decompress. I felt myself again and it was amazing. However when I came home I just began to spiral. I don't even find myself worrying about the exams specifically, I just feel lonely and empty. Physically, I feel run down. Mentally, I feel drained and alone. I had all these plans for personal projects to work on with my free time that I have been looking forward to for months but now that I have the time any attempts at working on them leave me feeling defeated. Even my own hobbies, things I usually do to relax, just bore me. I have no confidence, I have no life, I don't know what I can do to fix it.

This was supposed to be the light at the end of the tunnel, I'm supposed to be enjoying the summer. I feel like a fraud, nothing particularly bad is going on in my life right now but I still feel like this, why?

I have spent years trying to build my self back up from some dark times in my past, and I have felt fortunate enough to be able to say I am happy in recent times. But I feel like I'm slipping, in fact I feel worse than I ever have right now. The fact that merely a set of bad of exams was able to knock me so far makes me question whether I ever really made any progress in the first place.

My ex girlfriend might want to kill herself,1716061800.0,"Hello,


I have been together with my girlfriend for a year, long term distance relationship seeing each other every 2 ish weeks, sometimes every week, we spent quite a bit of time together in real life.

Her family is very muslim, I am very atheist. I told her 6 months ago I would fake-convert, I shouldn't have said that because later in the relationship when we talked about kids and everything I started to imagine what me fake converting would imply (e.g. what if the parents are visiting and my kids are there i have to be a fake muslim with my kids around, among other things).

If I don't convert her family would dissapprove greatly (she would go to hell and thus they are kind of dissaproving out of love) and she doesn't want to hurt her family so I would have to convert. Being atheist is kind of a core belief of mine. I am absolutely convinced organised religion is not true. We broke up, it seems like she blames me for not ""giving the religion a chance"", kind of. But I think she makes those arguments cause she's not thinking clearly and is just so distressed from losing me. She's crying all the time and she thinks about suicide a lot. Yesterday she crossed a busy road in traffic without looking. 

When we call she can seem normal and understanding at one point, and then blame me for not trying hard enough and never caring about her etc. I don't know what to do, I'm scared. I ask her to seek help in form of therapy or psychiatrist. Sometimes she's receptive of it but sometimes she blames me for just wanting her to not kill herself and that I just feel guilty for her feeling this way that's why I want her to get mental help.",No-Plastic-2286,,False,1cv5m99,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cv5m99/my_ex_girlfriend_might_want_to_kill_herself/

I'll outlive everyone I love and I dont know how to cope with that future,1716078157.0,"I am the youngest of my family both my parents are in their late 50s (they both turn 60 next year) and my two siblings are in their early thirties and I'm not even 20 years old yet. If I don't fall ill I'll most likely outlive all of them and the thought of having to bury them someday absolutely breaks me and I don't know how to cope with it. Our dog recently died so it's been on my mind a lot recently and I've been crying myself to sleep some nights. I've tried talking to them about this before but most of the time they cut me off because they don't like to talk about things. I can talk with my mom about this I guess but she also deals with a lot of death in her profession and she already griefs a lot and so does my dad about the dog. One of my siblings will avoid the subject entirely and the other one will ridicule me. I don't know how to cope with death I've only had one death in our family which was my grandfather when I was 8 years old I didn't know him very well though. I didn't see him on his deathbed I only saw him after he died I carried him into his casket. (Why did they make an 8 year old do that? No clue but it definitely did something with my development) so I don't know how to cope. About me dying, I don't really care. If the universe decides it's my time I'd be at peace with it. I hope for life after death but if it does or doesn't exist I won't know in this lifetime or the next one so I don't really care.

Volunteer in Ukraine. At my breaking point.,1716064480.0,"I gave my whole life up to be here, to do work that directly support the troops defending their nation, to allow Ukraine and Ukrainians the chance to enjoy the peace and safety I enjoyed for 38 years of my life.

I left my home my family, my amazing GF and love of my life, and a decent job to come over. There is no going back, there is nothing to go back to.

But with the recent events at the front and the internal politics of my NGO I feel like I've literally walked right into the end chapter of my life.

If the Orks don't kill me, I can't go home. There is no work, no home to rent, nothing. Even my family has disowned me for my choice.

And here in Ukraine I don't stand a chance of making a new life for myself. Most I have is a Temporary residence status.

Money is running out, I can't even afford new shoes.

All I have is grueling 13+ hour days doing what I do, which is being a kitchen porter. I used to be a chef, a damn good one too. I came here in the pretense I would be paid following a probation period, But because I got on the bad side of my trainer (a Ukrainian half my age and a quarter my experience) for reasons unknown my NGO leader sees me as a liar and functionally useless. Just a body for the line.

I feel like this is the end. I keep thinking about this beautiful spot in Poland, secluded and peaceful, right by the river. I think it would be a good place to see my end. It has a beautiful view of the sunset. Dress in my chef Whites one more time, knife roll by my side. sit down with a good bottle of Cognac, down a cocktail of muscle relaxants and sleeping pills and watch that beautiful sunset.

Don't even think my NGO or anyone I work with would notice I'm not there. Doubt anyone back home would either.

I don't know why I feel this way, I'm a hopeless romantic, love and fight for what I love untill the end and then.

I think I'll always feel like the helpless little girl who cannot defend herself ,1716066648.0,"Hey so 21 F here , my life seemed alright to me until when I was 13-14, after which i started getting these dreams/ flashbacks of my cousin SAing me. It got really frequent and i would just lay there reliving it unable to move. It was like that for about 2ish years and near the end i almost got them every day, one of the flashbacks was of me telling my mum and her crying. i wanted to ask her if it actually happened but i thought it was a really grave accusation and i wasn't even sure it happened. i think near the end i was sure about it happening because i could actually feel him over me during the flashbacks and I felt absolutely helpless. During this time the same cousin frequented my house and I just thought that wouldn't have been the case if it was actually true. After all this the pandemic hit and I was depressed and suicidal. i almost killed my self, but i didn't at the last min. I got a lil better w the help of my friends and n sisters. they didn't know anything tho. After this I started dating my best friend and was in a better place but those flashbacks started again and this time it was worse. i confided in him n my bsf. he actually gave me a lot of strength and i actually gathered the courage to ask my mum. she seemed very irritated when i asked but she confirmed that it had infact happened. The SA had started when I was only 7 years old and my cousin is atleast 8 years older than me. It continued until I was 11. I was very frequent and I'm sure it has happened hundreds of times. i didn't know what was happening to me was wrong. He made it into a game at the beginning. he would partner up w me during hide and seek and then took advantage of the opportunity. He built stories around it and told me that was everyone was doing it. I was always in pain because of how frequently it happened. He would say that there was something wrong with me and I was being a bad girl because i wasn't enjoying it. i believed it to be true. I seem to unlock new memories even now. My now ex bf was there for me through it all and i don't think i would've had the courage to ask my mum if it weren't for my ex and my bestfriend. At that time it kinda felt that it was just a part of my story and it had made me stronger. i wish i felt the same even today. to get back to the timeline my parents didn't react that well they just told it that i should just move on n these things happen to a lot of people. the SA stopped the day I told my mum. she had given me the whole good touch bad touch lecture earlier that day. that night I told her. i did not know that what had been happening was wrong. i don't remember much of what happened later. i just know that i kept seeing him later as well. i also have this distinct memory of my mum asking me if I had enjoyed it because she saw me playing w him. Now she completely denies it. my parents refuse to talk about it and act like I'm harrassing then by asking questions. i have confronted my parents about why they didn't do anything multiple times.i asked them why didn't you guys report it to the police or at the least made sure I never had to see his face again.They gave vague answers and at one time my dad pulled out a knife and was like fine i didn't do anything but he asked what had stopped me from murdering him. Yes he actually did that. 
Anyways in my mind, i still cannot associate what my cousin did it me as a child to the adult him. i had repressed the memories for so long and honestly even after that he was always around. Growing up i didn't know that he was in the wrong. he was not punished or even treated differently. My parents act like im overreacting and my mum gives me examples of people who were assualted my their own fathers and told me that a lot of evil happenes in the society. She has also told me that it's because of adolescence and that kids get urges but i told her I have been through adolescence but I have never forced myself upon anyone .
About a year ago I was almost SAed by my friend.i don't wanna get into the details now because I feel like it will get too much for me.
but now I feel like I'll always be the helpless little girl and I dont think I'll ever get out of this.

I’m going to die alone,1716066834.0,"My whole life my biggest insecurity has been romance. I don’t rlly have an issue with small talk with girls, but I’m 20 years old now and have 0 romantic experiences in the slightest. I also have 0 female friends. The only girls I have ever been close to are my mom and sister. Im also just weird/socially awkward. Most of the people I meet might laugh at some of my jokes and have a surface level friendship with me, but don’t really like me beyond that.

 Idk if I’d ever be able to have a romantic relationship that would work out in the end. I make way too many dumbass jokes and am not the most masculine guy ever (am in self improvement, but idk how much looks will even help me). Even if I do manage to pick up a girl, It would most likely be at a bar and our personalities probably wouldn’t mesh. I’m a gamer nerd who says some of the dumbest shit imaginable and I’m pretty sure I also have OCD.

Every time I think about having a gf or whatever it just seems so unrealistic. Like a fairytale or some shit.

I’ve tried to devalue love, and not think about it as much while I develop myself, but it’s hard man. There’s also so many ppl who just wanna hook up nowadays and that’s just not what I want at all. It feels weird to say that despite struggle with a porn addiction for many years but idk I just feel like hook up culture isn’t for me. 

My family is now starting to get on my case about it and it’s depressing. I already beat myself up about it enough and now I have them poking me to get a gf? Fucking horrible. I would just shoot myself in the brain but idk if I could do that to my parents/siblings. If I do I need to somehow make them hate me first, so when I do commit it won’t hurt them and I can just be forgotten

Can repetition of stimuli cause anything adverse mentally?,1716076979.0,"Can being subjected to the same audible cue repeatedly for extended periods of time constitute psychological torture even if it's not intended to be?  At work today my (for real) autistic coworker listened to the same 5 second clip of a song for roughly 5 hours or so between tasks.  After a couple of hours it started getting to me, but I didn't want to say anything because I've noticed that he's self unaware to such an extent that when you point something out like this he clams up immediately and shuts down for the rest of the day.

He does this kind of thing often too.  Sometimes he'll listen to the same short clips of car accidents from various old NASCAR races repeatedly, or he'll repeat something to himself over and over and over again.  He doesn't seem to be aware he's doing it either.  Like I mentioned before, he's extremely self unaware about these sort of things and when you point them out he basically... shuts down I guess.

I dont know how im going to get through this. The pain is unbelievable.. ,1716074616.0,"My love, the mother of my child, left abruptly 5 days ago now. We have been together and living together for 4 years and our daughter is 3. I got home from work Monday and she moved out everything while I was at work. I got home to a mostly empty house and endlessly broken heart. I was lied to so that I would give consent for my daughter to go away with her parents for the week. I was led to believe this was a date night. She asked when I would be home from work so that way she could have everything gone by The time I got home. Her parents thought I knew this was going to happen. That's why they took my little girl. No one will answer my phone calls or texts or tell me when my daughter is coming home. I cant get more than, ""I'm leaving"", ""we will talk later"", ""I'm not yours anymore"", And many other hurtful things as a response from her. I have given everything. Everything I do and provide is for my girls. I have worked so hard to get my girls in a space where they can have room to grow and be independent. I don't know how I could ever look into my daughter's eyes and tell her mommy isn't coming home, and I don't know why. My abandonment wound is ripped wide open again and my soul is scarred for life... Im trying desperately to make it through the pain of waking up every day and realizing this isn't a bad dream.. I can't wake up because this is really happening to me.

I had such a crazy panic attack yesterday when I woke up I almost had to call 911 because I couldn't breathe. I woke up with an incredible weight on my chest and a pounding heart and no matter what I did I couldn't catch my breath. I assume it was a panic or anxiety attack but it lasted for several hours and I was scared out of my mind. I don't have a single person I can call here to get so much as a hug, talk to me, or Even take me to the hospital. My entire life is completely upside down and I have absolutely no idea what I did to deserve this.

And even worse is that nobody will answer my calls or texts. None of her friends or her mother who literally has my child. I just want to know when my little girls coming home. I provide day-in and day-out for my girls. I pay all the bills I provide the place to live I've worked and given and sacrificed so much for this family and I am utterly destroyed and cannot comprehend how someone can do this.

Of course, there are more details because there always are. I'm a very reasonable understanding emotionally intelligent person and there's no circumstance in which this should be handled like this.

Any advice on what I can do or how to make it through the days and the pain would be helpful. I have ceased communications with her, despite how incredibly hurt, angry and in disbelief I'm in. What can should my next steps be? 

I will post a link to some messages to give maybe a little more understanding on the situation.

I’m moving away and am never going to see my friends again,1716074296.0,"A couple of years ago I had to move across continents, but I knew I would still be able to visit where I had spent most of my time growing up. After moving I became extremely depressed and had no friends, so I eventually got the opportunity to move back and be with my friends I had grown up with.

A year has passed since then and now I’m 18, and leaving again. Where I live everybody moves very far away, and I’m really struggling with how to cope with knowing I am almost certainly never going to see my best friends ever again. This is the same situation with my ex girlfriend, she didn’t treat me well and we were always on and off, but now I know I am probably never going to see her again I don’t know how to cope at all. 

I really struggle meeting new people and making new friends and I’m so worried about going back into that situation I was in a few years ago. I don’t know if I’m being silly but I feel very very upset and distressed over this, I can’t deal with these feelings at all and don’t know what to do. 

I’ve realised despite all the problems I have where I live, that I’m happy here, have friends (especially one) that are super important to me, and don’t feel like I can do better than this. I also realise I do still care a lot about my ex and I can’t imagine never seeing her again and that door being fully closed forever. All these people have been so important in my life and shaping who I am and I’ve never felt so awful or scared.

I isolated for a year and now idk how to get back to normal,1716072738.0,"In high school I never really made friends myself, I met everyone I knew through basically one person. Never really felt like I fit in with them, constantly was awkward and weird and it only got worse the longer it went on. So after graduating I just wanted nothing to do with them. I stopped talking to all of them hoping I would make friends in college. Tried college, dropped out due to mental health, now I haven't socialized in a year.

There are a few old friends I could reconnect with but I don't want to explain my situation when they ask, nor do I want to be even more weird and secretive, nor do I want them to realize I just got worse instead of growing as a person in that year in any way. It took me a while for it to hit me that I have no social life at all since I have some good online friends. But suddenly, out of the blue, I feel completely alone.

Now I'm afraid of spending my 19th and 20th birthdays alone, The passage of time in general is freaking me out. I'm afraid of never being able to make friends again or never being in a proper friend group again. I just can't see it happening. If it does I'll probably have already turned 20 and the thought of that number is terrifying to me. I'm taking a few community college classes next year but I doubt anything will come of it.

how can someone with selective mutism ask for help?,1716072512.0,"my wife has autism, generalized anxiety disorder, almost certainly has ptsd, and has selective mutism sometimes when her anxiety gets really high. i respect all of that and we're working on some things long term to help her.

the problem is that we have kids together and sometimes she needs my help with parenting them. a direct request is obviously not possible during those times that she is also mute due to high anxiety, but just not communicating or waiting for me to notice that she has gone mute are also not options because children's needs don't wait. i don't always have my phone on me and, even when i do, her anxiety doesn't always allow her to text. i offered the idea of some kind of signal agreed on ahead of time, like placing a specific item in a conspicuous place, but that was also too direct and too stressful for her to consider. please help us! how can she ask for my help when she is mute?

just in case anyone gets worried about this: our kids are fine and not neglected in any way. my wife can be home alone with them and take care of them even if she goes mute because that situation itself of being the sole caregiver provides the focus necessary to do whatever they need. the problem only exists when i am home and she knows that me doing something is an option and she could really use my help but i'm not even aware that she has become mute.

"People with Bipolar disorder, what do your manic episodes look like?",1716070335.0,"I dropped out of college as a psych major and have invested a lot of time in my life to study mental disorders. Mostly anxiety, depression and personality disorders, but not too much on bipolar. I know it's a behemoth and very difficult to deal with in day to day life. 

Recently I have made the decision to join the US army, I've always had a sense of adventure and have had the army in the back of my mind for a couple years now...but recently I have gone all in, I'm hoping to get a special forces contract so I've begun to train for it. I'm training non-stop just obsessing over it, taking martial arts classes, going on runs, lifting weights, and I feel so great. I'm happier than I have ever been in my whole life, I finally feel like I'm on the right path. I've never truly known what I want to do and I feel like a massive weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. 

However, having studied manic episodes I know that what I'm feeling is similar to what someone may feel if they have an episode. I'm not sleeping well, I can't fall asleep and I can't stay asleep. I sleep for about 2 or 3 hours at a time because so much is going on in my head. My mother is also diagnosed with bipolar II disorder so I know I'm already at risk for it. 

This is NOT me asking for any sort of medical advice, I'm simply using the responses as a mild guide as I go consult a professional. As I mentioned earlier in this post, I haven't really done a lot of studying for bipolar disorder and it's almost impossible to look at yourself objectively. Although, if your experiences are night and day different than what I'm feeling right now, then obviously I wouldn't need to spend the money on a professional in the first place. 

Lastly, I'm not trying to insult anyone or claim that I have something I don't. It's just that in my life, I have not gotten very many wins. I'm not happy often and maybe part of me feels like I don't deserve it or it's too good to be true. Also I just want to hear about people's experiences because it is something I enjoy talking about.

The past few months, maybe more, she's been talking to me about how she's been having crazy vivid dreams, and she connects this with spiritual reasons, but she describes these as like insane dreams and I can't help but wonder if it's something medical? Or just aging?
Lately it feels as if her theories and nonsense are getting worse and more intense. She called me today saying she had an epiphany, saying she had felt something crazy. She kept looking at me saying I looked peaceful, which could be normal for her, but she kept repeating it, and I swear she had a crazed look in her eye.

and it sparked a thought in me , if you ask anyone if they would ever commit violence aginst another human being (exluding self defense) they would tell you that , no , they wouldn't of course , and then you'd ask them ""why?"" and they'd respond with ""well, because it's wrong""

""well i don't do it because what i can lose is bigger than what i can gain""

My first post in this sub (need help),1716068209.0,"

I am a 20 y/o student, living alone and this is my very first post in this sub. There was a time I got bullied in school and sports club. I have a difficult relationship to my parents. I was never able to talk to them about my problems, I was silent instead. My mother was very controlling and patronizing. My father only cared about my school grades.

After a long time of self reflection I realised, that I'm seriously suffering from:

-social anxiety: I'm often trying not to behave awkwardly, because I care too much what people think about me and I feel watched many times. I have problems approaching stranger people. Also, I often feel caught in normal situations, for example when someone is entering the toilet and I'm styling my hair in the mirror. I'm getting a bit sweaty and my heart pumps. I have these problems especially when interacting with women.

-porn addiction: it literally slows down my life. My dopamine level is constantly low in phases of watching porn (rn I'm trying to beat this stupid habit). It isolates and destroys my social life. I'm not getting my things done and porn changed my view of women. I'm very ashamed of this, ashamed of sexulizing women. And I really don't want this any more.

-depression: tbh I think depressions are the result of the problems I mentioned above. Negative thoughts only come, when I'm alone at home for a longer periods of time. Times of feeling hopeless and helpless.

Yeah......,1716067909.0,"Hey, so since I was a kid I have always been the black sheep in my family. I don't don't know why they always take out everything on me. If My siblings do something I get beat up with them(my other siblings don't) . Even now, whenever my sister fights and yells at him he tells her, ""this is not you I bet that bitch is filling your head with none sense"" Another thing is that once  she shouted at him his solution to that was punching me in the eye  and there are so many stories something else  is when my mother gets upset at my father she  takes out her anger on me. Even if I didn't do anything wrong and she does it so often that now at home or outside with my friends and with the people, even if I don't do anything wrong I start to panick and start imagining them being mad at me  and we start to worry and be afraid, and my heart starts  pounding, and I  let people make fun of me laugh at me, and take advantage of me, so they don't hate me 

Something else is that I have never felt loved when I was young by my family. They never hugged me or kissed me , and they didn't tell me we love you. (Especially my dad to the point where now I go and seek attention and validation from my older professors hoping I'll get from them the love I never got from him.) I have also been compared all my life with my sister, my classmates and cousins they say I am the ugliest and most stupid out of all my siblings and for years all they did was criticize every little thing I ever did.

Now that I am grown up(20) it has gotten kind of better but I hate myself  I have no self confidence my self esteem doesn't exist, I am  afraid of everything and of all people. I feel that I don't deserve good things In this world, I  feel that people outside do not love me, and that I do not deserve to be loved. And I always feel ashamed of myself, of everything I do even if it is the most normal thing(I have toxic chronic shame)

The worst is I don't even know if what I am feeling is actually true or if I am just victimizing myself

Help me, I swear to God, I don't know how to live like this. How can I manage? How can we get together? How can I stop being worried,afraid, and sad all day? How can I love myself ? Please help me.

I'm a 24f, in 2 weeks i will officially graduate from the university. Then im planning to start working full time in the industry, which probably means moving cities / countries. 

I've always been the less important friend. The one you ignore and forget about, despite being loving and invested in all the relationships i had. I thought that I finally made friends at the university (postgraduate), but then last week I discovered they organised a meeting literally 300m from my building, behind our backs (around 10ppl on the meeting, around 20 of friends intotal), and inlt was not the first time, just smaller groups earlier. 
I've tried dating, I've been on over 35 first dates in the last 3 years (ages ranging from my age to +20 years), but since I moved abroad (nordics), i can't find anyone that would be even a little bit invested in building any kind of relationship (""casual dating"" society), meanwhile im craving a deep connection, doesnt have to be romantic. Additionally, i trust people too much because of the fear of abandonement and put my health in serious risk last week, that can give consequences soon.

Today I feel so lonely for the first time since I finished therapy 8 months ago. I'm staring at the ceiling and crying.

Why could I be experiencing déjà vu daily?,1716061119.0,"Sorry for any grammar mistakes in advance. English isn’t my first language.

Recently, or rather, for a little more than half a year, I've constantly been experiencing severe cases of déjà vu. Every time something new or slightly noticeable in life happens it’s just like ‘Oh, I’ve done this before’ and that on almost a daily basis. It happens so often that it feels like I’ve lived that exact moment already.

I looked into it and the internet said it could be a neurological problem. But I had an MRI a year ago for other reasons and everything was fine then. I also didn’t get hurt in any way by then. (Underwent an MRI because I’m experiencing terrible headaches on a daily basis.)

I don’t know if it’s important to mention, but during the same period, I started seeing angel numbers everywhere I went. ‘Angel numbers’ are what my friends and I call it when the time shows, for example, 11:11 or 15:15 o’clock. Usually I see them when opening my phone on accident or checking the time. There have even been instances where I woke up at night only for the electric clock in my bathroom to show 04:04 or other times. Also, after a few months, I’ve been counting how often I see those numbers daily, and it’s between 3 to 8 times on average. I don’t know if it’s even worth mentioning, but it’s making me feel almost paranoid and stressed to look at the time when I’m already bothered by Déjà vu daily. (+ since two months ago I have encountered weird combinations such as 12:21 or 13:31.) 

Speaking with any professionals isn’t an option due to my bad relationship with my mother, and getting an MRI for the headaches with no explanation for my headaches is already making her think that I’m just seeking for attention.

Why do I feel the need to always be with someone ?,1716060435.0,"Hello everyone, idk how long this will be but I’m just writing whatever’s on my mind and haven’t organized my thoughts so sorry in advance.

I (22M) got out of a 4 year relationship about 3 months ago. During those 4 years I’d say I was not the best partner that I could be. I had a lot of issues with self image, self esteem and just being generally insecure. I would just feel like my partner would leave me for another man at any day. This has led us getting into many arguments and us giving silent treatment to each other. However, I would feel terrible and so awful and feeling like my chest is closing inside knowing she’s mad at me or whenever we’re on bad terms and I come back to her and profusely apologize. I would get the worst thoughts whenever we got into an argument thinking “that’s it she going to leave me now”.
Then I started reflecting and started rationalizing these thoughts and just thinking it’s all in my head and if I do believe then they will actually happen. Until one day she came to me and confessed that she cheated on me. I felt any little progress I made with myself was gone. Despite her confessing it to me I still forgave her and continued the relationship because in my head I was thinking that she’s the best I could get and no one else would want me. 

Fast forward, to now I still find myself missing her and I’ve tried dating and all I could say is that my self esteem issues have significantly worsened. Facing rejections, mixed signals and ghosting it really took a tole on my mental health and it confirmed my worse fears that I’m not desirable for others and no one wants me. As well as, the attachment issues that I have and intense emotions I have for some of the ladies I talked to it could be a couple of weeks and I’d already feel like I want her and want to be in a relationship with her and it eats me up inside whenever I wait hours for their response. Thinking the worst scenarios as to why they’re not responding to me. I’ve even had mental breakdowns and crying thinking why am I not enough for people. 
I’ve missed out a lot of other details but I don’t want to make this too long

Waste of time? ,1716060133.0,"So I've been seeing the same psychiatrist for 8 months now. In that time she has prescribed me 10 different meds from high blood pressure meds to antidepressants to antipsychotics. She claims i just have anxiety. Even though she hasn't diagnosed me with anxiety. Shes diagnosed me with panic disorder, mood disorder, ptsd, and insomnia. My GP diagnosed me with agoraphobia with panic attacks and referred me to this psych. 

I have not seen any improvement whatsoever in these 8 months. She will not prescribe anything controlled. No benzos no sleeping pills nothing. Antidepressants and blood pressure meds. She says all my anxiety is from quitting drinking 10 months ago and antidepressants will sure be the cure all. 
She hasn't even acknowledged the agoraphobia that I was referred to her for. She just says ""well you already have a lot going on, let's focus on that."" 

I'm also diagnosed with adhd,ocd, and a few others from my GP. So im thinking about trying a different approach for my treatment plan. Instead of focusing on the agoraphobia and panic attacks i want to focus in ADHD and maybe my oanic disorder will be more manageable. Do you think i should ask my psychiatrist for stimulants or just go back to my GP and let him know everything the psych has done has been of no help. So he can refer me to someone new or start treating me himself.

I cry once I'm home after I hang out with my friends or girlfriend. Sometimes even while still with them.,1716059142.0,"Cross-posted from r/autism because another user said it would fit better here.

My only diagnosis is ASD so I'm posting here. It could potentially be related to another undiagnosed mental condition, but since I can't be sure, I won't post on other subs or speculate about conditions I may have.

I'm not gonna go into detail, but I have trauma related to friendships and relationships, for years on end, continuous, nonstop horrible experiences.
I believe this is the reason for my extreme insecurity, dependence on people, and lack of trust in anyone who claims to like/love me.

Even with ex friends this happened. I'd try to hold back my extreme emotions of overwhelming loneliness and hopelessness as my hangouts with them ended. I mostly succeeded, keeping my crying sessions at home after my time with them. However, I still sometimes can't hold it in and burst into tears right as I'm about to leave my friends for the day.

This is extremely embarrassing, but I feel the need to have a loved one with me at all times, as other people are the only way I value myself. I completely hate myself but if someone else doesn't (or acts like don't, since I still don't really believe in people tolerating me), it gives me a sense of value, it makes me feel like if I can't be alive for myself, I should be for this person.

My emotions are extremely unstable and sometimes I can't regulate them at all. I have random outbursts of sobbing, hyperventilating, screeching, and yelling. I frequently screech around my friends because I get jumpscared easily and get triggered by ""mild"" sensory triggers, like for example wind blowing on my waist. I'm extremely ashamed of this. I apologise to my friends about it. They don't seem to mind, but I don't buy it. 

Every time my time with anyone for the day ends, I get overwhelming feelings of ""why are they leaving me""; ""they hate me""; ""I have no one now""; ""I'm worthless""; ""they only pretend to like me out of pity"", along with urges to hurt myself and die.

I have had episodes with my girlfriend in public. All occurrences have made me extremely ashamed. She had to comfort me as I cried on a bench, for seemingly no reason, she had to lead me home because I was very certain I would run into traffic as a suicide attempt on my way back, she has had to be my crutch when I get physically weak. I always apologize and she says she doesn't mind, but again, I don't buy it.

what is happening to me???,1716059021.0,"hi i don't know how to start this but i think i'm losing my mind if i haven't already. i'm fucked in the head. i'm not a normal human being. there is clearly something wrong with me and i don't know what it is. i'm disgusting i'm a bad fucking human being i'm corrupted. i swear to god i'm not saying this out of pity i'm saying this because it is the literal fucking truth

i don't know what will happen to me but i know something will happen. my life is getting weirder and weirder and weirder. i dont want to get too personal but god what is actually wrong with me? at the moment i'm feeling very hyperactive and i can't calm the fuck down. i need to stop saying the word fuck. but my self esteem is very high at the current moment but i also want to straight up die.

life is so fucking terrible and people are fucking terrible. people are judgemental as fuck and they are fucked in the head as well. people are cruel to get what thet want. or feel better about themselves. but honestly am i any better? i'm crazy. if i was friends with someone like me i'd be terrified of them. because i'm a nightmare. why do i still think this if my self esteem is high? i can't believe all of this shit is real. it can't be. it feels like a movie really. a gross, disgusting, dark movie.

why do i think i'm a bad person? i'm not a judgemental bitch but i'm angry, i'm a porn addict, i have the most egotistic thoughts when my self esteem is high, i hurt the people i love, i'm always willing to seek revenge, i can't keep a proper friendship / relationship if i'm extremely close with them, i can be violent and lashing out, etc. i should change this about myself and i want to but i dont. and i don't know why. i'm always stuck because of myself. i am my own prison. in addition, the only positive thing is is that i'm still aware, lots of crazy people don't realize it. i deserve to not be alive. i hate people like me. i would absolutely hate someone like me

i miss being normal so much. i was really happy from the ages of 0-5, my issues started around age 6 but from ages 6-10 i lived a decent life. maybe a little therapy could benefit but i wasn't fucked in the head. 11-12 was the decline and so was 13 kinda but 14 is when shit blew, and now it is worse at 15. i look at my old videos or entries or anything and i'm just like 'god i miss being normal'. if she saw someone like me back then she would think they are crazy. it is so wild i was once normal. i had my insecurities and slightly troubled due to certain traumas but for a traumatized person i was extremely stable. all i ever wanted was to be happy again, and now i give up. i should just end it all

does anyone relate to what i'm saying? i hate this",teenwithdelusions,,False,1cv4l1i,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cv4l1i/what_is_happening_to_me/
I am scared for and of my sister,1716058406.0,"I realised that something was off around 8 years ago when she was 9, I started catching her lying about random minor incidents about things that happened to her during the day or something trivial like that. Making up stories which was obviously a little absurd but everyone just brushed it off. 
As she grew up I noticed that her behaviour was taking a turn for the worse. She didn’t stop crying until she gets what she wants, sleeping on the floor crying and refusing to get up, throwing huge tantrums, the list goes on. I thought it wouldn’t get worse until she hit her teenage years started and she started threatening my parents saying she’d kill herself for every minor inconvenience, like when she wasn’t given an iPad when she wanted to play games or when she didn’t get a desert after a dinner. Basically whenever she was told no. 

Around when she was 13-14, I caught her playing games with random men online and flirting with them on discord as she left her laptop open and I went there to shut it down. These men were 21-30 years old and there were around 10 people that she was talking to online. I told my parents about it and they scolded her once and I saw zero regret on her face. I deleted her discord took screenshots of those profiles and confiscated her laptop. 

Two years later, a random dude 20M texts me on Instagram and sends multiple screenshots of conversations with my sister sexting him. He was from the other side of the country and I don’t know how he got my instagram, I’m guessing my sister told him? But I didn’t understand why she would do that? I gave her an earful and we had a long talk about this with my family. At this point, all the threatening behaviour has worsened. She once said “I’ll call the cops and I’ll tell them that my family is abusing me.” Her tantrums looked l she lost her sanity. She blabbered random nonsense. “I’ll kill everyone in this family” whenever she was told to sit and study. “I’ll jump off a building” “this pen right here- it’ll be nice if I stab myself right now”. When my mom asked out of total defeat “where did you learn to speak like this?” She said “from you cause you’re mannerless” but my mom is the calmest and the sweetest person you’ll every meet. Just angry outbursts.

Some context about how she was raised- pampered and spoiled. She always got what she wanted and has always been babied in our family. 

And very recently she started posting explicit photos of herself on Instagram, mental rants about our family, one story where “sorry guys I couldn’t post pictures of today cause you know how my mom has trust issues with me🙄” when she went out to meet 5 guys. Meeting them is not the problem, no one really has a problem with it in our family. it’s the fact that she is making up stories about how I treat her, how my family treats her and how she’s suffering with us, all of this on social media with around a thousand followers.

 One of our family friends treat us so differently now, they are a family of four with two kids and the younger daughter is a year older than her. When I talk to her she gets visibly uncomfortable and does not respond to me. I do not know what my sister has been saying but it does not seem okay. 

I’ve tried to help her out so many times with kindness thinking she just needs some care and attention, but she goes back to doing the same things again.  

Today I got a call from my mom saying her teacher gave her a suicide letter that my sister wrote and apparently then passed it on to her friend, her friend has panicked and call her mom and the teacher. The teacher gave my mom the phone that I confiscated from her a few months ago. She has apparently been posting questionable things and the teacher has come across all of these somehow. 

The worst part is that both me and my mother knew that this suicide letter was just a desperate cry for attention. Although we aren’t taking it lightly, deep inside we both know it’s the stupid threat tactic that she has been using for years now. What is happening??

How does one go about this?
There are so many more things to this but this is how I have condensed it for now.

Rebuilding a life after mental illness and incarceration ,1716052979.0,"How do I rebuild my life after 2 felonies and possibly $1 million in restitution at age 37?

Hi all,

I was first diagnosed with bipolar around the age of 20 when I was in school studying finance.  I thought mental illness was bogus and was paranoid about the psychiatry field so I bucked the diagnosis and continued on with my life.

I battled through tremendous bouts of depressions to graduate from school and land a job in New York.  After 3 years, I switched jobs and ultimately found myself unemployed, but I had money in the bank so I continued to avoid facing my mental health struggles and instead volunteered in Asia and wasted a few more years putzing around meanial jobs here and there.

Eventually my illness started to present with religious zealotry and delusions / psychosis.  I wound up giving away all of my money and possessions and wound up living in the streets for a short period of time before my parents had me hospitalized.

Eventually it all led to one night alone in my apartment where I entered a psychosis state and felt impulsively compelled to burn an object for a religious purpose.  I had no fired place so I burnt it in my bathtub.  The tub later ignited and I knew I had to leave the apartment.  Just as I was leaving, I was reminded that I cancelled my insurance policy recently.

Long story short, I eventually was picked up for causing the fire and charged with arson.  The arson charges were later dropped and I was convicted of Causing a Catastrophe and Criminal Mischief.

I served 20 months in county jail and now am released in a mental health court probation program.  I'm facing anywhere from $650,000 to $1.5 million in restitution.  Presently I'm working in a deli at a supermarket.

I'm properly medicated now and am symptom free and hope to do more with my life than me menial labor, despite the fact that restitution will likely forever look over my head.

My question to anyone out there is how do I even start to pave a path forward?  How can I find a listening ear who may give me a chance at a salaried job?  What resources should I capitalize upon?

Any and all suggestions are welcome.

Moved out of state and mom guilt tripping me with C word,1716051731.0,"I am a 23 year old female who just moved to another state for the first time. I am now about a 9 hour drive away from my family. My 17 year old sister came with me to stay for a week or two to help me unpack and what not. To be honest, I wasn’t thrilled about the idea of her coming because we’ve never seen eye to eye and I like being alone. But despite not really being crazy about the idea, I thought since this is a huge change for my family, this would give us an opportunity to bond and what not and kind of prove that I’m not just leaving everyone behind. I just wanted to make her and my parents feel better. I have tried for years to have a relationship with my sister but she is mentally unstable and her personality in general makes it very difficult.

 Anyways, yesterday we got into a huge argument in the U-Haul over something petty. I wanted to brush it off but she was being difficult because she didn’t get her way, like always. I gave her some time to calm down and then maybe an hour later I asked her if she could help me bring a couple things from the U-Haul (air mattress, blankets, etc) so we could finally just relax since we were both exhausted. She had an attitude but agreed. We get outside and she starts slamming my stuff around in the U-Haul which set me off. I told her to stop with her attitude and that she has no right to throw my belongings around. We began screaming at each other and I kept telling her that she’s embarrassing me because we haven’t even been at my new apartment for an hour yet and I’m already in the driveway screaming like a mad person. I just kind of flipped out and told her that I knew it was a bad idea for her to come because she is insufferable. I called my mom to tell her that my sister is being disrespectful and that I was very upset. It turned into a huge thing. My sister kept following me around the house which pissed me off more because I kept telling her to get away from me and I just wanted space. 

Now to understand, here’s some background. My mom has a way of guilt tripping us every time something goes wrong. I can’t explain it but she just does and it’s very annoying. Whenever we get upset with her she says things like “I just need to die already because obviously everyone hates me and you guys would be happier”. As I’m on the phone with my mom she starts saying things like “this is my fault I knew I shouldn’t have sent her there with you” and I said that it would be fine and I just wanted to be left alone. Then she says “Yeah we know you want to be left alone. You left to get away from us so just be alone then how you want it then”. I then start screaming and asking her why she always has to guilt trip me and make me feel worse when I’m already extremely upset. Then I just hung up because I was way too overwhelmed between her, my sister, trying to get my things from the U-Haul, etc. 

And yes I was wrong in the situation that occurred next, but for the next few hours I was being very cold to my sister. I kept ignoring her when she was trying to talk to me and then I started screaming because I just wanted to be LEFT ALONE. My mom kept trying to call me and I kept ignoring her. I was just trying to unpack and I kept ignoring both of them for a few hours because I was just overwhelmed. 

My mom then texts me a long message (which she never does because English is not her first language and it’s hard for her to convey what she’s trying to say because of her grammar and stuff. But I kept ignoring her phone calls). She basically told me that she just found out a couple days ago that she has cancer and she sent my sister with me because she wants us to become closer in case anything happens to her. This made me very irate because I felt like why would she tell me this right now when it’s my first day in a brand new city and I’m already beyond stressed and can’t handle news like that. I called her flipping out telling her that I’m tired of her always making me feel guilty and I can’t believe she would spring this on me at the worst time. I feel bad for that now, but I wasn’t thinking straight and was having a mental breakdown. 

My mom and I are very close. We talk everyday on the phone, sometimes multiple times a day. I woke up today really sad about this whole situation, kind of feeling helpless. I called her and she told me, “it’s not for certain yet”and she still has to go for a cat scan and confirm but her doctor told her he thinks that this is what it is. This pissed me off because in the text she didn’t say that. She just said she has cancer. Then today she tells me they still have to confirm for sure. I just feel like why spring news on me like this right now, scare me and make me even more anxious than I already am, being so far away from them now. I don’t know why I feel mad at her, I just do. I’m also scared shitless and I don’t know what to do. I’m so stressed and I love this city but now I feel horrible for leaving her. She tried to tell me she’s going to be okay regardless, but now reality is hitting me hard that she’s getting older and one day I’m going to have to live without her. 

 I’m so fucking stressed and I don’t know what to do to make myself feel better. I was so excited to have a fresh start but now I’m feeling like I made the wrong decision. This is not how I wanted this experience to go and I’m annoyed because this was supposed to be a happy experience for me to get a new start at life. I can’t help but be mad at her and it’s making me feel worse because she’s obviously having a hard time right now. She was crying a lot for a couple days before I left which was weird to me because I never see her cry but I thought maybe it was just hitting her that I’m leaving. Now it makes sense why she was crying so much. I feel like a bad person. I’m extremely close to my mom and this whole situation is making me scared realizing that I’m going to lose her one day.

since then, they seem to have fallen back into similar spiraling thought patterns as back then, but this time mixed with this very inflated ego and some strange spiritual beliefs. they tweet *a lot*, and that is mostly where I'm seeing all of this. I had a friend who developed schizophrenia in his 20s, and this friend is about that age and is reminding me very much of that. I'm obviously not a doctor of any kind, but regardless those kinds of thoughts and actions concern me. I would hate for them to have to go inpatient again, and even though they seem to ride these extremely self confident highs, they also seem to be very distressed. everyone else who is friends with them have noticed these things too and the ones I've talked to also seem as concerned as me.

how do I talk to them about this? I know I can say ""the things you've been saying are concerning and I hope you are talking to a mental health professional about them"" but I feel like if that's all I said they might just disregard me as ignorant and not ""enlightened"" or something. is there anything else that is appropriate and helpful to say? I don't want to say too much, but I also don't want to say too little.

I haven't been returning their messages and have been avoiding hanging out with them because at first they were just saying some naive/rude things that really annoyed me, and I had been really really struggling socially and with depression, and I didn't have the patience for it at the time and felt it was better to just withdraw. I feel badly about that, especially now, but since then the things they have been saying have become very strange and confusing. even though I don't think I want to be friends with them right now/in the immediate future, I still care very much about them and we have had a lot of really lovely time spent together.

I'm not sure anyone else in their life at the moment is willing to approach them about this kind of thing, but I'm not 100% sure. they live with a parent who didn't treat them amazingly as a child and is now seemingly enabling them. they have said their parent seems to feel very guilty about everything and is now almost overly nice.

How do I (23m) get back to my old self?,1716050531.0,"How do I get back to who I was before covid?

TLDR: How do I become my old-self?

Hi

I've been in a horrible mental spot ever since covid with little to know improvements. Before covid when I was 18-19 I was someone who enjoyed being around people, had a lot of energy, extremely nice and fun to be around. I spent my time reading philosophy and was ties heavily to my hobbies. I was able to make friends and overall feel like I was worth something.
Ever since covid I've pretty much lost that light within me. I've become sad, bitter and miserable and it's almost as if all my emotions  and really my soul have just a blanket of anger and depression covering it. I've gone on anti-depression meds (tho I quickly got off it) and have been very close to ending my own life several times.
It's just feeling shitty all the time is exhausting. It's exhausting to fake being happy and to fake smile. I just can't atop seeing the misery around me.

Has anyone felt the same? How do you climb out of it? I don't know where or how to start.

Thanks for the help.

Why does everyone keep betraying me,1716049504.0,"I feel like I've been betrayed by everyone I love




I'm an 18 year old male. I've been diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and general anxiety for close to 5 years now. Before I've been able to find ways of dealing with it, but recently, it's become too much. Back in October, I had an argument with my mother about some of the things about my childhood. I told her my therapist said that the way she constantly threatened to leave and never come back was abusive and that she shouldn't have taken all of her anger out on me as a child. She defended herself and said I was crazy and making things up. I left without saying a word and went back to my dad's (parents divorced 5 years ago. I used to live with my mom and my dad equally). Later that week, I went to visit my therapist, and she informed me that my mother had removed her credit card from their system. I was shocked, and my therapist continued saying she tried calling my mother, thinking it was a mistake. My mother yelled at my therapist, telling her she was filling my head with 'dangerous' ideas and that she considered what she had told me to be 'imoral' and 'terrrible'. What my therapist told me was that my mother was an abusive narcassist who was actively emotionally abusing me. This did nothing but prove that she was right. I texted my mom telling her that I needed her to acknowledge that her stopping payment for my therapy was wrong. She did nothing but defend her actions, so, for the first time in my life, i stood up to her and told her that I couldn't take this from her anymore and I wouldn't talk to her until she acknowledged this. That's all I asked for. She told me she had done nothing wrong. That was 8 months ago. Since then, I have heard nothing back. I feel like my whole life was a lie, I spent my whole life giving my mother the benefit of the doubt. But it's only in hindsight that I can see how little she cared about me. 

Since then, my entire mom's side of my family, my 2 uncles, my grandma, and my sister had turned on me. They no longer speak to me. Thr only ones in my family that speak to me are my dad and my brother, whom both pressure me to mend things with my mom, despite me having done nothing wrong in my opinion except stick up for myself. I don't feel I've done anything wrong, yest the pressure to fix things is on me.

In October, a few weeks after me and my mom and I stopped talking to each other, I respectfully asked my ex girlfriend who I was very close friends with at the time if she wanted to become friends with benifits. As i felt extremely alone and needed some type of intimacy. She told me I was a disgusting person who only wanted her for her body. She then told me she had a boyfriend, which I later found out was my close friend and her best friend from when we were together. She lied to my face on several occasions about this. She told me she no longer wanted to speak to me. I don't understand how she could do this to me, she knew what I had just been through with my mom, she lied to my face and then told me she doesn't want to speak with my anymore. It doesn't seem like the person I had once fallen in love with at all. I tried on multiple occasions to mend things with her and reach out, but she has completely ghosted me. All of her friends, who were my friends, have stopped talking to me because of this.

Only a week after this happened, I started talking to this girl I knew in elementary school that I met through some mutual friends. We really clicked and started hanging out with each other basically every day. Things were getting flirty, and we began watching movies and stuff really close to each other (touching but not totally cuddling). I remember one night we were watching a movie and our mutual friend and my best friend at the time came over. He randomly called me and invited himself over. He came and we were watching the movie together and again me and her were really close to each other and i had my hand over her. She had to go to the bathroom and then my friend sat next to me so the only place she could sit was next to him. I didn't think much of this at the time, but when she came back, he put her arm over her and started cuddling with her. I thought this was really weird but I thought maybe they just had that sort of close platonic relationship since he knew I liked her and I thought it was insane for him to go for her in this instance. A week later, I had her over at my house, and we were full on cuddling. We watched movies for 6 hours when finally I asked to kiss her. She told me I had the wrong idea and left looking uncomfortable with my question. I was very upset but respected her decision. I texted my friend, and he told me I was weird for cuddling with her. I was confused by this comment of his. He then ghosted me completely. I found out a little while later that he had gaslight her into thinking I was forcing myself onto her (I asked if she was okay multiple times and we were just cuddling). He then proceeded to use that opportunity to have sex with her. They are now dating, and the moment I found out about this, I blocked both of them. 

I'm starting to lose faith in people. It seems like everyone just uses me, and when I stop serving my purpose, they get rid of me or do something terrible to me. I've never been suicidal but it's getting to that point. It just feels like nobody gives a shit about me. I lost both my best friends and most of my family. I don't know what to do. Does anybody have any advice?

he has never talked about anything like this before, so I'm pretty sure he's actually thinking about doing it.

I need your opinion and help me.,1716030816.0,"
Hi everyone, it's my first time here on Reddit. I was just wondering what your perspective is about my situation.

So, one year ago my ex-boyfriend and I broke up because he cheated on me. While being in a relationship with him, we did things that couples should not do before marriage, and my family found out about it. I don't know what to do. I'm so ashamed of myself. I sought help from my family and a school counselor, but nothing works. The shame I feel still haunts me. How do you overcome this?

Today, the feeling has gotten worse and worse. I even had suicidal thoughts because I've had enough of my situation. I cried a lot in front of people, even though I know I shouldn't, but I can't control my emotions. I'm ashamed of it. Even my mom cried when she heard about the things we did. It felt so awkward to know that my family knows what I did in the past. I didn't tell my school counselor about the things my ex and I did outside of school because I knew if I did, I'd be even more ashamed of myself. I can't stop overthinking about it. I feel like I'm being so dramatic. I want to get closer to God again.

So if you were me, what would you do? How do you overcome the feeling of shame? Have you ever been in my shoes?",Funny_Cricket_5554,,False,1cuuznn,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cuuznn/i_need_your_opinion_and_help_me/

In real life I have no friends. I left school nearly 20 years ago, married nearly 15. But over the years life has taken over and I’ve seen less and less of my old friends. They’ve moved on, I’ve bumped into them a few times in passing but it’s been awkward, we don’t really know each other anymore. Last time I met up with friends was to see Endgame back in 2019. 

At work, I work alone in an office, effectively a one man department. Some days pass at work without me speaking to anyone. It’s a small retail business, so no set lunch time for staff. I just eat at desk and maybe take a walk. 

I don’t have very sociable hobbies. I usually just game, watch movies, or walk dog. The dog walk was good when he was a pup cos everyone would stop to chat, now he’s an older dog nobody’s interested.

Trouble at home causing major anxiety (warning: mentions of suicide),1716024181.0,"Hi, my life is currently a very terrible whirlwind and I guess I wanted some advice. Almost 2 years ago, my older sister died at 18 after years of suicide attempts and drug problems. It hit my immediate family (parents only) very hard, and I feel like the consequences have begun to become very obvious now.

My mom (54) has always been severely depressed and never really had many friends, but ever since my sister's death it has only gotten worse. There was a brief period of time where she was seeing a therapist and getting better- working, meeting people at a volunteer job, etc- but stress from my dad's work has completely plummeted whatever happiness she had gained. Recently, she's been saying that there's a large, influential company trying to ruin her life- she's accused her therapist of selling off her information for money, that the people she met at her volunteer job were paid actors, even that they've caused our AC to break.

My dad and I are very convinced that it's some kind of developing psychosis (possibly a symptom of undiagnosed OCD, but we need to talk to a doctor abt that), and are very worried. She's been breaking down almost daily from the stress and I just want her to be okay.

On top of that, my dad recently tried to commit suicide around a month ago- he's okay and seeing a therapist now, but it was a very traumatizing situation for all of us.

Now, we are trying to focus on my mom, who has not realized that she is experiencing some kind of paranoid state. She promised me to see a new therapist and talk to her doctor next week, but refused to go to an emergency room until June bc she doesn't want to miss my graduation. She told my dad (when she thought I wasn't listening) that if she was locked up, she would kill herself.

I'm having a really hard time processing and dealing with all of this. I feel so anxious that one of my parents are going to die and that I'll lose someone close to me again- I feel like I can't leave either of them alone. Except in a few months I'm going overseas for university. I just want them to be happy, but sometimes it feels like it's impossible.

I've always had intrusive thoughts, but they've only gotten worse, and I can barely focus on school. I am trying to go out with friends more, but the more I'm out of the house, the more anxious I become.

I'm sorry that this sounds like nonsense, I just don't know how to make this better.",jacobsmonster,,False,1cuteot,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cuteot/trouble_at_home_causing_major_anxiety_warning/

TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ 


Feel free to answer one, none, some, or all of the questions. I need to discuss this


1. Is It Normal to Crave Be Sexually Assaulted and Abused? 

I ask this because I quite literally love the rush of it happening. It makes me feel good. I was abused and assaulted in my childhood. I don’t remember ever not liking it. This confuses me.
I am quite possibly sure I purposely put myself in situations where I could die or get raped.


2. If A Person Enjoys Endangering Themselves What Exactly Is Going On In That Brain Of Theirs? 

3. Is This an Obsession?

4. How Do You Stop It?

5. Am I Actually THAT Traumatized If I Seekk Out Traumatic Experiences?

6. It Feels Like The Second I’m Uncomfortable, I’m Into It, Does That Mean I Was Into It The Whole Time? 


7. I Am EXTREMELY Attracted To People Who Have Harmed Me, WHAT IS EVEN THAT?

The short version is that I suffered with intense anxiety, depression, paranoia, isolation for many years.. While at the same time being a caretaker personally and professionally. 

Eventually, I was able to live on my own, but I was drained. I developed a friendship with a neighbor, and it eventually turned intimate. However, I started to go through my most severe breakdown, and even today I can't fathom the state of my mind at that time.

I ended up getting in trouble with the police, losing a friend, and finding myself in the worst place of my life. Now, I have legal struggles, financial struggles, personal struggles, and have completely humiliated myself. It is bad enough I sometimes dont feel comfortable to leave my home.

Am I evil? ,1716020843.0,"I think I’m evil. Truly evil. And since I can’t go back in time and change things, I’m thinking about ending everything. I’m 25, graduated in college this year, unemployed, and still living with my parents. They don’t mind, in fact, they absolutely love me and the only thing preventing me from suicide right now is the pain that I would cause them. I’m an ungrateful piece of shit, a loser. My parents supported me all my life, and still do, even tho I give nothing in return. I do the bare minimum around the house. 

My mom has always been so good, nice and kind to me. Never demanded anything of me. But I’ve always been abusive and ungrateful with her and my dad. Also with my older brother, when he got a girlfriend (now his wife), I hated her and I used to do everything to annoy them. Till this day, I feel like they hold grudges towards me. I’ve been abusive with my only partner (now ex, for his sake), not to the physical point although sometimes I would push him away when he tried to come after me when I was upset. 

I gained over 30kgs (66 pounds) during the pandemic due to my depression meds, and one day my mom took me to a dietitian and it triggered me to a point where I took a knife in front of her and threatened to cut myself, and she begged on her knees apologizing, and I will never forget this image because it was so painful to watch her in so much pain, and then I kept mentally torturing her… I went to my room and locked myself, and swallowed like 10 of some random pills that I knew wouldn’t do any harm to me, but still I did it just out of pure evil, just to torture her. I then preceded to pretend to be fainted until she called 911 and broke into my room and took me to the hospital. I’m crying so much just writing this, I feel so much pain and guilt for what I did to her. 

Sometimes in some other episodes during my teenage years and my college years I was also violent towards her, not to the point of causing bruises, but I would grab her or push her, something a child (as an adult) should never do to a parent, but still, I did. I was also many times verbally abusive and manipulative with her.

I did all this and she still loves me and forgives me and worries about me. She still smiles at me, and tells me goodnight and good morning everyday. She still does everything for me. Why am I so violent and impulsive? Why did I do this with her, a person that loves me so much? What’s wrong with me? I just want to end everything and be punished somehow.

My gf's mom is abusive and it's killing our relationship.,1716016307.0,"I've been formally dating my current gf for two months now. We met at college and stated going out and now we're an item. At first, as with any relationship, we were in the honeymoon phase and everything was great. Now, as the relationship is getting more serious, I'm growing more and more concerned about her family.  
Her mom treats her like crap. She body shames her, offers almost zero financial support (actually steals her daughter's money sometimes), is known to physically abuse her and her dad (they're divorced), shows up unannounced at my apartment while I'm with my gf to pick her up, and just constantly takes a toll on my gf's mental health and self esteem. I can see how she's in a great mood when we're together or when she's hanging out with her friends and how angry, sad and unstable she is at home.  
I have been though a similar situation. My mom emotionally and physically abused me for years until I realized she would never change and moved out at 21. However, I had a support system, a safety network in my dad who offered his home. My gf doesn't have that. Her dad helps her out sometimes but won't have her move in. Idk why, if he knows her mom is abusive and has experienced abuse from her.  
Now, there is an age gap. My gf is 18. I get that she's just starting to become an adult and maybe it's difficult for her to understand how her family dinamics affect her and our relationship, but I'm really worried for her bc of how my own situation with my mother affected me and my relationships for so long. I'm 23 and currently live alone, for context. I know it's weird, even tho she's 18. I wasn't expecting to date someone so much younger than me, but things just fell into place, and now we're together and I love my gf. Our relationship is great in all other aspects. We treat and care for each other really well. But I feel like my hands are tied with this. I can't just tell her to move out. If I had the financial power needed, I would support her, but I currently don't. And I can't change her family or convince her dad to help out.  
I must confess. Bc of my household and previous problems with depression and anxiety and such, I haven't been in many relationships in the past. Only until my 20's have I started dating. So take that as you will. Maybe that has to do with the age gap too. But I do have experience with mental health. My own. I have been trough years of therapy and now I can focus on building my career and relationships. But I only know how to take care of my own and have no idea how I can help my gf.  
I only want her to be happy and to overcome this somehow, without it killing our relationship.

Cross post. I'm really struggling.,1716011053.0,"I can't believe that I'm blasting all of the following to the world, I just need help getting through the weekend until I can hopefully see a psychiatrist early next week.

I have recently received some extremely alarming and sensitive major family news affecting my entire family about very sensitive topics that I'm not even sure I can even discuss here. Tried Reddit CrisisLine, but nobody answered twice after 45 and 60 minutes. I'm really not sure of in any way considering self harm.

But it has thrown my already existing depression into a spiraling and crippling depression that is really causing me to want to just give up. Again I stress, not to the point I'd take action, but so close. But I just don't really care about life anymore. I don't have any fight left in me. On top of my myriad of current major medical issues that already have had me really weighed down and struggling, my sleep is down, serious weight loss in a short period of time (25% loss) I can count one time on both hands the items I've eaten this past week. Not taking meds as I just gag and barf them up, and honestly I'm just tired of the side effects. Daily migraines. Acute pain throughout body for decades, which is being treated through pain management specialist, but its still there. Anthropophobic,  agoraphobic, and SAD. New rheumatologist doc says maybe Fibromyalgia to add to my existing health stack. Which in itself, explains so much from the research I've been doing since. Shoulders and neck are rock hard. Nightly recurrent nightmares of being pulled under by water rapids, and I can't swim. I'm a recovering Norco and Soma addict. I'm working a program, just not NA. Treatment in 09, but I've had a few relapses since due to physical body pain that I'm be treated for. In irony, one of my many long term medical issues requires me to remain on the same medications I was addicted to. I've become even more of a recluse, only ever leaving home to get groceries (rare now) or to go to medical appointments. Like I know that I need help, I just don't have anything left in me to fight. Tired of health. Tired of family. Tired of life. I just exist day to day. Dreading to get out of bed each day to cope.

I had a really horrendous encounter as a youth in the psychiatric system and meds for gay conversion 'therapy' that I've never dealt with the aftermath of.

Additionally I've got significant church related shame and issues surrounding my being gay, so religion is completely out of the picture. And I've 100% zero desire to go back at all. This with even given that the largest LGBT church in the world is right here in Dallas. This is compounded by a marriage that I had to the pastor of the 2nd largest LGBT church, that viciously ended after 6 years of continual psychological and verbal  abuse for which I wasnt 'permitted' to seek help for outside of church by the board for what it could potentially do to harm the church.

* Adding today, I missed a call from my cardiologist today who indicated I need heart work and fast as I've got numerous blockages on my heart that could account for the off the wall arrhythmias I've been having. To be honest I'm not even sure if I want the surgery for it, hoping it will just kill me sooner. I'm just struggling to even comprehend this new news, given that I eat like a bird. This on top of everything else is just pushing me closer to the edge.

My own therapist is out of town camping for the  weekend until Tuesday and I've not been able to reach her. I don't currently see a psychologist. After months of trying to get into a psychologist that didn't have an extensive waiting list, I was finally able to schedule a psychiatrist visit and consult for next Friday the 25th of May. But I missed a call today from them as well stating that they need to reschedule. So now I have to wait some more, and who knows when that will be.

I also want to add that I have a very loving husband of 25 years. He's being so supportive, holding me constantly while I cry. He just doesn't know what to do either, other than to be there for me. He is the only one anchoring me at the moment. I know and understand and see that I'm catastrophizing in what ifs, but if he wasn't here, then I wouldn't be here typing this message, especially after today.

I was able to speak with 988 today, the National Suicide Prevention line. And I was able to barf all of these feelings out to him. But I'm still very raw and struggling. Been in bed all day, which has been my MO for a hot minute.

I've been zonked all day on my weed, and Valium from pain management just to cope as I was hysterical earlier after cardiologist voicemail. 

Does anyone know if there are weekend emotional support groups in Dallas, TX area that I could go to over the weekend.

I'm just adrift and looking for input on sensitive topics. Thanks in advance for any recommendations and comments.

DMs for advice from mental health professionals are fine. Encouragement and support groups info DMs are fine as well.

What’s left?,1716009388.0,"What’s left in this life? I had a love that was my everything. I would die for him. If he needed a heart I would die to give him mine. I have loved this person since the moment I laid eyes on him and always felt like we were meant for each other. We dated throughout high school but I broke up with him before senior year ended. It really was never bad between us… it’s just things happened that was emotionally too hard for us at that age to handle. We kept in touch for awhile but after a year or so we stopped talking. Once I was healed I realized I had messed up but he had moved hours away. I packed my car up and decided I was going to go win him back. I went gassed up and about to get his address when I checked Facebook…. “New relationship status”. My heart shattered. I went home and bawled myself to sleep and cried for at least a month or so… right then and there I promised myself no matter what point in my life I am at if he ever is single again, I will go after him and give it my all.. all of my relationships since him have been me just going through the motions and in some ways losing myself. Not caring who I am with to the point I started being abused. I was in a really low point in my life to the point I didn’t want this life anymore. But I couldn’t do that to him. I’ve stayed here for him, I love him, I want him. While being hit, thrown down, sexually assaulted, yelled at, etc…  I would lay there crying, my thoughts would rush to him and just thinking of him is what kept me here on this earth.. kept me mentally going. One day I was creeping on his mom’s facebook and realized he was now single… in that moment I jumped with joy. I broke up with my current hell of a relationship. I kicked his ass out of my house. I waited a bit and then reached out to him… we have been in contact ever since and to my knowledge it was bliss… he even came and saw me this past weekend and stayed with me. I have loved this person for half of my life. 12 whole years. To me he is the love of my life. I don’t think I will ever love anyone like this ever again. I don’t want to. Tonight he tells me that he doesn’t feel the same way, he hasn’t felt the same way since we started talking a couple months ago… he wanted to wait until we saw each other in person to say anything. Which I understand… I just honestly don’t think I can do this anymore. I don’t believe I can live this life without him. This whole entire time I’ve truly believed we were end game. I just want to end my life right here and now. He’s the only reason I’ve made it this far as it is…. I live by myself and it’s all I can do not to end it right now. Why should I keep going? What’s left?

Anyways to keep it short, I was such a good kid, I was like the golden child, I was well behaved, very active, extremely social, and just an amazing child overall, which is why I am confused why I am such a mess now at 20. If I was such a good child, what could've happened in my life to cause me to be so different. I can't go out of the house without fear of people looking at me, extremely inactive, can't keep any form of relationship or friendship.. well I've always had that issue starting freshman year of highschool... idk where that issue came from, probably the same place the rest of my problems originate from, but I have all sorts of awful mental issues, worst one being BPD, I hate BPD, it can go eat a fat pile of shit. I try to think back to where I changed, but I can't really think of it, nothing severe happened in my life, I didn't suffer a loss or anything, one day I was just a completely different person.. the old happy child me disappeared, and the absolute piece of shit me appeared, and has stayed since and I hate it  
  
But yea, I guess to sum everything up if I was such a golden child, what could've happened to make me just miserable, like everyday I feel awful, do things that I don't want to do, and am just so confused how everything went so wrong, I don't understand life, and probably never will, but why do these things always seem to happen to me.

Apparently after telling my mother what my psychiatrist said, she told me when I was a boy my psychologist made their report and told I had a ""schizoid personality"".

I am scared and a bit relieved that the symptoms I have been getting now make sense, but the first thing I have to do is escape my abusive Job.  All I could think of was creating a small funding so it helps me with the treatment and the amount of therapy, psychiatric sessions and medicine I'm taking. 

If you know about anybody who could help, even with a dollar, I would be eternally grateful. All my problems get worse on my job, and since I'm a contractor I don't have anything that would cover the treatment.

should I go to a ward?,1716006795.0,"Hi, first post in here. 

Long story short, Ive got a handful of disabilities including autism and because of that, I’ve never really been able to maintain strong relationships. I’m in pain all over 24/7 with zero support and I’ve been suicidal since I learned what it is, but my family aren’t the most functional people either and I know most methods would destroy their entire lives so I’m not an active risk. 
But at the same time, if I could click a button and be dead I’d do it in a heartbeat. If I had the money, I would buy a boat, go out to sea and do it there so my family doesn’t need to see my body and deal with the cleanup etc. 

I feel like I need to escape to somewhere with frequent and accessible therapy/support, simple routine and meet people who have issues as well but like… I’m not at risk..? I’m kind of just wasting my life away and waiting for one of my issues to be fatal, I’m too tired to take any action. I just wish I could function and be normal.

My mental health has been horrendous my entire life. Five years ago when I hit rock bottom, I decided to make a change.

In these five years I have done anything and everything to fix my mental health. That said, I have gotten no where, and in fact, I am worse now more then I have ever been. 

I lost all my, “friends” and friends, no chick wants to talk to me and they’re scared to even look at me. Talking to my parents doesn’t help because it pisses off my dad, and it gave my mom a heart attack that nearly killed her.

Ive been working with my 2nd therapist for a year now, and honest to god, I feel worse now then before I decided to try therapy.

I’ve tried and tried and tried and tried, and it just keeps getting worse and worse.


The only option left is to go to a psych ward, but they ignore my calls. 

Idk what else to do, I told my parents 10 years again when I was 14 that I planned on killing myself when they eventually pass away. 10 years later and this still holds true.

I’ve felt insignificant, less than, and mostly like a failed shell of a person my entire life

I’ll try and sum this up as best I can. I’m fully aware that I have a lot of childhood trauma I need to overcome. 

As I child I had epilepsy which lead to constant bullying from classmates and severely limited my ability to make friends 

Meanwhile, my parents are both alcoholic narcissists. My father would get drunk and physically abuse my mother in front of us, in turn she would cheat on him. They divorced when I was 10 and both remarried to people who wanted nothing to do with myself and my siblings.

My father remarried a woman who accused me of stealing bank statements to show my mother. My father believed her over me. He had two more children, and moved 8 hours away essentially abandoning us

My mother remarried a man who treated myself and my siblings like the scum on his boot. Always muttering under his breath and being completely hostile towards us when my mother was absent. I’ve also always felt like my mother has had a favorite and it wasn’t me. 

I moved out at 17 to get away from him and struggled to live on my own. Going through a few relationships that ended in me being cheated on. 

I managed to become part of a toxic friend group but eventually met the love of my life through that. We’ve been together now some 14 years and have 2 children and one god child. She helped me so much to work through a lot of my trauma but not enough. I still to this day have feelings of inadequacy.

I’m a singer/songwriter and all the while I’ve been pouring my emotions into my music to deal with the thoughts in my head. I’ve had dreams of getting my music out to help others but every time I think I’m at a point where I can afford to get some of them recorded some life disaster happens…….

I’m 18m and genuinely am out of ideas.

I get severe panic attacks, I’m depressed, and my anxiety is crippling. I’ve switched antidepressants 3 times over the last few years. Even though I want to improve, I can barely leave the house. Panic attacks are truly awful and aren’t something I’ve been able to work through or ‘learn from’. They are torture for me and make me feel ill for days.

Bluntly, im feeling hopeless. I’ve struggled all my life, and have never felt truly happy. I come from a bad home and don’t feel close to my family. My parents are divorced and not speaking with each other. They aren’t great people.

I’ve been to the GP SO many times. I’ve been with CAMHS, Mind, phoned helplines, spoken to CMHS (I’m in the UK). I’m not being taken seriously. I was on the phone to 111 (it’s like the NHS health helpline) yesterday and they said they don’t recommend hospitalisation because I can ‘get better at home’. 

My current ‘support’ is seeing the GP once a month or so and being told that I’m on a waiting list that’s over a year, and that despite being suicidal I’m not going to get much support.

I can’t afford private healthcare. I’m not in school or work so I don’t have access to the related counselling. 

I’m tired of being stuck in this hell. I’m tired of being told that I just need to ‘give it time’ and to ‘prioritise my mental health’ when that’s ALL IM DOING. I’m sick of being told to go on a walk or visit a self-help website. I’ve DONE THIS. I’ve done this time and time again. I’m not saying these things don’t help, but I am having a mental health crisis and need professional support. 

It feels like no one is taking me seriously and the world is moving on without me. I don’t just sit and wallow by the way- I try my hardest to push myself, to work towards improving my situation, but I cannot do this by myself.

My parents asked if I was suicidal,1715976148.0," For context, I have sh (though not really bad and I'm clean right now), and my mum saw the scars. She was crying and and asking me lots of questions, one of which being if I was suicidal. I said no, because obviously I don't want to worry her, but I'm not entirely sure what counts? 

 This is a really stupid question, but what is the normal amount of wanting to die? I mean, everyone has said something like 'kill me now' or 'I want to die' or 'if... I will actually kill myself'.

  At this point, my reaction to even a minor inconvenience is thinking that I want to die, and sometimes my brain just starts telling me that I should kill myself for whatever thing I did wrong last. I've thought about it a lot, and started clearing out my stuff so things would be easier for my parents to get rid of, or sort or whatever after my death even with no immediate plans. I stood on a hill above water for a while but ended up just going home (probably a good thing since in reflection it wasn't that deep and I probably would have just embarrassed myself).

I have no particular desire to live, i think I'm just sort of neutral on it at the moment, but I stay alive because I would feel guilty for upsetting my already struggling mum if I died. I doubt I could really go through with it anyway

I don't trust people anymore, I wanna love, but there's this voices or reflex that makes me subconsciously protect myself everytime I go help someone, like ""they will use you, say you are busy, say you don't know."". 

earlier I felt guilt, for saying I don't know, someone asked me ""can you go do and reset the cctv camera outside?"", I just turned it on and off and said ""I don't know how to do it, I just restarted it instead"" but at the back of mind "" I know, I can learn how to do it, I want to do it  but maybe next time it won't be just this."".

It is sad that they will just notice you when they need you, they will just be good to you if there's something they want from you, in the end there's really no one who could help you, when you need, even just someone to listen to you.

I get anxious for every little thing now, God, I don't know how to earn money, that's important in this world to survive, I can't even face new people with a calm mind, so how do I present myself? How can I present myself to anyone just to earn.

What can I offer to this world? am I really just this? will I never be able to support myself till the rest of my life? It is too much to depend on others, I felt guilt to do that too, I don't wanna be a burden to anyone, I don't wanna be seen by their eyes as that, I can't even look people around me right now, I felt so ashame to them and to myself.

I worry, they will see me as a toxic one, as a negative person, or someone too much to be with, and they will just leave me. That is why I just hide, I hide whenever I can't face them with a smile. Can't you just take me? I think I can't face tomorrow anymore, I wanna go now, I don't think I have reasons anymore to stay, they will be fine without me.

My mind is so all over the place, jumping from this one to that one, God, what should I do? I am quite not sure now, I feel like I will just make it harder for those people I love and those who love me, if I stay.

Not only am I not certain of if I can even have a normal conversation without getting paranoid, if I don’t, I don’t know what to say. If I try to listen to verbal words, I get distracted. If I try to understand, I misunderstand. If try to seek help, it often makes me feel worse or later seems entirely like it’s tricked me. If it doesn’t seem like it’s tricked me then it hasn’t helped. If it has helped, the help is brief. 

If I have learned something, it may be, regardless of what other people are like, at least don’t be bad, even if you disagree. I’ve also learned, sometimes you’ve just got to say “something!” On exceptionally rare occasions, I may lash out. If people seem to think virtually everyone is bad or even if they don’t, they criticise certain minorities or are maybe mistaken about individuals or they are totally intentionally or intentionally confusing you about whether they have morals anyway, what are you you supposed to do? Also, if I don’t want anything to do with the fight for what’s just or right or wrong, since, even when they’re fighting for what is supposed or what they perceive as right, also just causes more problems. It may be like I shouldn’t strongly stand for anyone or any group or anything. 

If I’m interested in problem solving but have problems with problem solving but also don’t want to make the mistake of being selfish or selfless or group narcissism or things like that, what’s left may be certain unusual people which I’d even want to speak to.

Im just gonna write my thoughts here about what has happened this last month

I lost a 12 year friendship and a a 2 year relationship/i mean yes it was toxic but i felt i had a goal.. We were stuck in breaking up and going back together I had to end it at some point Meanwhile in one of our break ups she was romantically interested in one of closest friends When i got back to her he never told about it After about 4 months i decided to finally break up for real and just find something more stable because i lacked it After a week i saw her naked in my friends dms I was really mentally unstable filled with rage... Couldn't sleep at all I know we broke up but it's still wrong...

After that i decided that i just wanna get married (relationships and dating is hard where i live)

I told a close friend of mine she agreed but told me to give it some time so we can settle things out After about a month she told me she wants to end everything... (Yesterday) Her reason that i was being too cold. Or I don't give her the attention that she' deserves'

She went to the hospital and i was busy at work she never told me..

she wanted me to call her while at work to check on her... She only didn't respond for two hours.. Went to her workplace (today) gave her breakfast and told her I'm sorry... Nothing worked... I want to try again after a week or 2 just giving her some space...

Now i feel really really lost.... I
 don't know that many female . Friends i

Im very introverted and lack confidence to make new friends or speak about myself. Even though I have a good group of friends from high school that I’m always in contact with I struggle to talk about myself and my problems to them. I haven’t had a girlfriend or in that case a proper one. The last one I had was when I was 17 but that was during covid and we both suffered with problems at that time so we decided to split even now with her in another relationship I still regret it.

All the girls I went to school with were either already in a relationship or weren’t really that nice of a person.

I do have a solid group of friends at school that I’m able to ‘hang out’ with during school hours but because i’m more introverted, the fact that i’m the only friend that has a job alongside school, and the need to prioritize assignments/work, I find it hard to talk to them and be able to hang out with them. I feel horrible about it because when i see their hangouts on social media that i wasnt even thought to be invited to,  inside jokes i’m not apart of and them being able to joke around so easily strikes a chord in my heart knowing that it’s hard for me to have that connection with other people. 

I wish I had a better social life. It seems impossible with my schedule and I’m not sure what to do about it because i’m not in the position to quit my job. i’ve learned to love being alone and having my own time and take myself out for dates and concerts but sometimes I wish I had a best friend that I could talk to/hang out with everyday, i wish i was able to go out and meet new people and hang out with those i’m friends with and most importantly, i wish i wasn’t seen as the “boring” or “side” friend. my friend group consists of 2 duos and i feel like a 5th wheel floater friend.  i’ve noticed they talk behind my back about how many plans i’ve had to cancel because of my schedule, and they’ve made snarky comments on how quiet i am and how i don’t add to their conversations. they don’t seem to understand how emotionally and physically drained i am everyday and it really hurts.

I genuinely don’t know what to do and i’m so torn about it. i don’t know if i need new friends, i don’t know if i need to sacrifice something for a better social life, but i just feel so lonely and isolated sometimes and i just need some advice if anyone has been in the same shoes

ADHD/ASD and my relationship with food is starting to scare me,1716034147.0,"So I’ve started my treatment again for ADHD and recently I’ve been really stressed and dealing with a lot of relationship issues, I have a load of university work and generally more anxious than I have been for a long while

I have always had a bad relationship with food, being a girl and my mother’s daughter it’s all I’ve really thought about from a young age. 

I have autism as well and always been picky. So picky to the point I went to a 3 day camping trip with my school when I was 8 and refused to eat for three days because there was nothing I considered safe. My mum told me I ate like a starved animal when I got home. 

All my life there were certain things I would eat and if they weren’t available it was that or nothing. 

My mum also has always commented on my body, I once remember her coming face to face with my stomach when she was coming up the stairs and poking at it. I was 19. 

She would ban me from eating bread, pasta, potatoes and such before big parties. 

If I said I didn’t think I looked nice in a dress, I would look for compliments but I would only get comments on my weight. I even once tried on an old dress of mine and couldn’t get it on and an old dress of hers and when I told her, she wanted to see if she still fit in it. She did and pranced about the house happily and with pride. 

She’s also mentioned my thunder thighs, tummy, my baby fat, how she slimmed down at my age and I would too on top of other stuff multiple times. 

In my first year of uni I thought this was normal, for mother’s to do such things, until my friends said they were surprised I didn’t have an eating disorder. 

My friend since first year admitted in the second year, that she did think I had an eating disorder when we met because she never saw me eat once. In second year I did lose a lot of weight rapidly because of meds, depression and stress and this friend would knock on my door when she noticed and make me cook and watch me eat, always get me snacks and offer food. 

She also would sit with me in my room after to make sure I wouldn’t throw it up. Once when she fell asleep I tried it but didn’t like it. 

I think this is when I really started seeing the decline in my relationship with food. I even lied during CBT therapy when taking the test for EDs. 

I lost a 1.5 stone (9kg) in 1 months, no exercise, I rotted in bed and just never ate. I regained in the summer of 2023 but when I restarted uni in the September, another month and I lost even more. 

By this point my mother, the one who would make so many comments. Actually grew extremely concerned. When I lost 9kg she commented on my beautiful figure, in the September when she visited me, she couldn’t believe how much smaller I was and since 15 I had practically maintained the same weight until the year I turned 20. I went from a UK size 12-14 to 10 (I have a larger bust so this was very concerning for my mum when I went from buying dresses in L to a S, I never was a S before).

It’s been abnormal now, always up and down. But this time it’s worse. 

My whole body aches, I am anemic, my heart is always pumping fast, I’m light headed, dizzy, can’t sleep, feel sick, getting stomach cramps, sweating constantly. My stomach is flat and boobs look weird and then I looked in the mirror, for the first time in my life my ribs are protruding and I’m not sucking in. I shake at the thought of food and my meds don’t make it easier. But if I stop taking them I will fail my degree. 

My face looks the same as far as I can tell, my thighs are no smaller, my arms are still “flubby”. 
But my torso has never looked like this before and my thunder thighs are still there but I’ve never had a thigh gap at all and now I do. Then I started thinking back to how much I’ve been eating. 

Barely anything at all, I have no motivation for it. I only minimally snack in front of friends to lower concern but none have seen me eat a meal and if they have I’ve never finished it. 

I ate this morning and the whole time I was extremely uncomfortable eating a meal I normally enjoy. I can feel it in me and knowing I have to do it again is a chore. 

My friend from second year took a leave of absence and I don’t wear a lot of fitting clothing so no one has noticed or cares to. My best friend is in recovery for drug addiction and anorexia so I can’t talk to her. 

I don’t want to see a doctor but I have counselling on Tuesday and gonna tell her, she can’t diagnose me but hopefully I can get some support. It’s gone too far and if I keep it up everything I’ve worked hard for won’t come to pass. 

I’m scared to weigh myself if I’m honest. 

I’m scared. I love how I look but this is not healthy.

I feel beautiful and my mind is so against it but I don’t want to hurt anyone. 

Hopefully I crack into gear soon

Wish me luck :)

Nah not luck, wish me wilful x

Is this dissociation or something else?,1716030861.0,"Is this dissociation? If not, any ideas?

Hi there. I've been experiencing something for a very long time now and the closest I've come to understand it is when I hear about dissocation, but I'm not sure if that's what this is exactly. If it's not dissociation I'd love other suggestions or things I could look into.

So what I've noticed is that after I have a difficult or stressful day and once I have an opportunity to relax or no longer need to perform socially, I find that I feel disconnected from my body in some sense, although it's not my whole body. It's usually just my face. I can still think my own thoughts and tend to have a full, detailed dialogue going on with myself in my mind but I can't will the words out of my mouth. I can't speak or show expressions. My wife asks if I'm ok and if I'm sad and all I can manage is a quick ""I'm alright"". She says I look really sad. I have thoughts that I want to get out to tell her but I just can't speak. I cant express myself. I can type things in full detail as you can see. But I can't say any of this out loud. 

I really can't figure out what this is. I have been diagnosed with combined type ADHD if that helps, and I take medication for it. However this has occured since before I started taking medication so I don't believe it's a side effect. 

I'm in full control of my body I and I can otherwise function as normal. I'm not a danger to myself or anyone else.

Hypomanic becoming manic??,1716020554.0,"Feel like I’m actually going insane 

I thought I was feeling stable after supposedly becoming hypomanic a week ago. The pattern so far is that i feel somewhat elevated then okay then down then elevated then okay and now I’m feeling super elevated again. I don’t want it to stop though. I feel amazing. I know it *should* stop because I might be feeling what may be losing control of myself. I haven’t drank in over 4 years because it was an issue for me but I’ve bought alcohol twice in the past 3 days (didn’t drink it so it’s pretty much just a waste of money with no benefit). I was searching around trying to find my SO’s car keys since we have to share a car currently but I think they hid them from me. I wanted to go buy a delta 8 vape even though it interacts negatively with my meds and makes me feel really weird mentally. While searching I found my sister in law’s pack of cigarettes and went outside and smoked one even though I don’t smoke. I used to vape (which is different) but haven’t in over a year. It’s 3:30am on a Saturday so it’s not like I can try to see my nurse practitioner today or tomorrow and we’re on a trip until next week.

My SO is the only one in my life that is actually concerned but they said it’s because they’re the one that has to deal with the consequences/aftermath. Everyone e,we just thinks I’m in a good mood and more talkative. I even told my friend how I have been feeling and that I left my house one day with a bag packed and she thinks what I’m feeling is “relief from realizing I actually want to leave my SO” which I’ve been debating ir trying to think if that’s true or not.

I’m not really sure what to do at the moment. I guess just wait and see if it levels itself out? Is this similar to anyone else’s hypomania or when you’re on your way to becoming fully manic??? This post is pretty late but I am really looking forward to any input people give.

I’m just really confused lately, it’s been a couple weeks of shifting moods but the overall reoccurring one is elevated and it’s been getting more intense each time.

Why do I want to get drunk or high or even smoke the cigarette like I did if I know they’re not good for me and that I shouldn’t? I haven’t actually drank but I definitely would have went and bought a thc vape if I had car keys… Also have had the recurring idea to download dating apps even though I’ve been in a stable monogamous relationship for over 8 years.

I didn't grow up in the city I live in, so I missed out on making those long-term friends from school that a lot of people seem to have.

I work as a solo gig worker, which means I don't naturally make connections like you would in an office setting. It's tough.

I try to go to events to meet people, but it's hit or miss.

Sometimes it feels like people don't really value new connections because they have so many options, or maybe it's just too much effort to keep meeting up.

It's hard dropping everything to meet someone, especially when the initial excitement fades and reality sets in.

I am not social/have no interest in being social. Mental health? Or just me? ,1716016333.0,"Hello,

When I was a child, I had friends, but a lot of my friends my parents didn't like and I was forced to stop having friends. In addition to that I was often grounded to my room for weeks-months at a time for stupid things...This has led me to being a bit of a recluse as an adult.  
I was forced to go to a lot of social events and shoved into uncomfortable situations by my paretsn...and a lot of verbal/mental abuse. (Not going into details, have seen a therapist!)

Now I am an adult, and for most of my life, I have noticed that I really have no interest at all making friends/keeping in contact with people or meeting up with people. Social events just really don't interest me and I would much rather be at home.

At work I made friends with people and I really got along with them, I liked seeing them on break and chatting with them, and we even exchanged numbers and spoke about meeting up outside of work. BUT I never messaged them and however much I like these people, I just don't care to meet up with them for coffee etc. I just don't really have an interest in messaging or staying in contact...It makes me feel like a terrible person.

I used to have social anxiety and I thought that this was probably why I don't enjoy social interactions with people...but with a lot of work, I don't have that anymore. I am actually very confident now. So much so that I actually like meeting new people and talking to them etc. BUT that's as far as it really goes with me interest wise.

This is also the same with family members; I just don't have interest in meeting up with them or messaging. Sometimes I even get annoyed when I get a message from someone (family or not), and maybe I will reply a once or a couple of times and then I am just not interested anymore and just don't reply. I don't often start up conversation becasue I just don't really want to.

The ONLY person I actually stay in regular contact with and enjoy talking with is my BF. We are currently long-distance but I talk to him daily and I do travel to meet him. I will start convercation with him and can enjoy talking with him.

In the past I have had close family tell me I am not normal and tell me I am unhealthy for not being SUPER social or outgoing....I have never been that ""party animal"" they wanted me to be.

I'm not unhappy, actually I am more than happy being alone. I have a dog who is my best friend but also am into dog training; personally I could be very happy never speaking to anyone becuase I have my dog...I know that is not normal, I am an animal lover and work with animals too....

\_\_\_\_

I feel like it's not normal and I am not sure if I should be worried about that or not. I know not replying to messages and just never talking to people is an a-hole thing to do.

I can fully see how this train developed in me from my childhood, but I'm not sure if it's something I should now fight against or not.

I guess what I am trying to ask is: Is this something I should be worried about/get therapy for? Or just accept this as my personality at this point?

People would say ""ew"" as they walked past me, teacher kept talking to me about drug use ( they thought I was using drugs because of my hair, never touched alcohol or drugs) and thus no one wanted be around me. I learned to be content. I became comfortable with solitude. My life just consist of going to work and coming back, but at work I began working with this women. She and I grew close she began opening up about her struggles and the tough time she was going through. We would spend time together and I just wanted to make her feel better because she told me she been abused her entire life and the sacrifice she had to make. She ended up losing her job and she asked me to lend her money for rent or she and her kids will get kicked out. I used my saving on her because I thought I could sleep in a car but a family cannot and didn't want that to live on my conscious. This is the first person I could call a friend and she made me feel so special and made me feel as if she was in love with me and was my girlfriend. This was a drug for me I didn't care what I had to do I just wanted to save her. The most painful things for me is I will never be able to relive those moments of happiness. I got her groceries and I took her family out to eat so they would be happy and I got her a better job. When she got the job and got back on her feet she began to turn cold on me and began to just drop insulting things about me.

With my wife things are just OK, just the typical discussions but nothing escalates, we don't scream at each other.

I met a guy, I thought he was cool, we talked, but he doesn’t seem to want to talk to me I guess. I think to myself and said “he’s probably not for me”, “we won’t end up together anyways,” “it doesn’t matter.” Then why I’m I thinking it’s my fault, that there’s something wrong with me? No matter how much I say to myself “don’t worry about what people think” i cant stop. Sometimes I feel left out or lost in a group. Do they really care about me? If I was gone, would they care? I’m really focused on my grades and try to score very high, and I do. That’s what brings me happiness and that my kept me going.

She gave me Buspirone to soothe the side effects from the sertraline! She told me to take 20mg of Buspirone and half pill of sertraline daily ! 

Actually I couldn’t do it! But instead as she told me to take Buspirone to calm my anxiety then I take the main SSRI! And I did 20 mg for 3 days and I got this vivid severe intuitive thoughts I was so freaking out but didn’t doubt it was actually the Buspirone. So out of fear I took half a sertraline and I felt so bad I felt like if have got hit all over my body and I was so angers with scary intuitive thoughts! I canceled many things and didn’t live normal life for like 5 days then I had voice insides me says stop -I’m not normally an angry person at all- I thought it’s the medication making me so angry. And I asked for another appointment. 

I went to the appointment and of course the doctor didn’t believe nor I was understanding what’s going on with my body !. She said I’m so impatient and I need to take things seriously! She gave me Paroxetine! I told her again ‘my life is very stressful, I’m 30 this year and I don’t have stable job and I don’t have someone in my life and I went back to my family house I feel lonely but this doesn’t need medication! Maybe talking to someone will help!’ But she convinced that I have a problem that needs to be solved by the medication! I got out crying like if the life had darken. She told me what i am just saying is another panic attitude and I need to stop! I reflected that to many decisions in life when I backed off on them I said yes maybe she’s right! I have to be okay I’m 30 !! 

I went back home! I have all hope though that day I had less effects from the medications as I stopped but I listen to that doctor and I took the medication for 3 whole days ! And I couldn’t know myself in the memoir I was soooo drowning inside ! And that night I was fighting bad intuitive thoughts that I really didn’t know what they are I thought I’m going crazy ! I suddenly slept on my bed hugging myself and then I woke up panicking I believe so much in god so I prayed and read Quran in cup of water -and I have to say this I didn’t believe in this but I did it anyway I was hopeless- and then I went to have my Buspirone with the water! I tried to drink it but it didn’t go downs I tried harder but somehow I couldn’t swallow it then it flew out of my mouth on table and I cough! Went to wash my face then I said let me try again but I thought ‘wait, usually this pill goes down without me feeling it! This is so strange’ so I googled Buspirone give me bad thoughts and I found this  [page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buspirone/comments/xxeit5/coping_with_a_major_uptick_in_intrusive_thoughts/) where people are talking about the same thing! I was happy and sad ! I thank god I thought I’m crazy ! I cried a lot for me and others who’s struggling! 

I stopped whatever she gave me ! I don’t even dare to go see it even! I prayed a lot more ! I have no one to talk about this anyway and I feel lucky I can pray it to god! And slowly I was feeling better to fight things within 2 weeks I kinda felt okay but it always goes back if I ate like : egg, tuna, green tea, ginger, banana! I don’t know why 

And then the starting of this week it all became so bad again! Like if I’m taking it all over again! Intuitive thoughts and confusion! Went to the hospital and no one dared to talk me through I feel so alone and trapped! I can’t eat food because I’m scared it will increase the serotonin! I can’t feel it ! I’m so hungry it will increase the intuitive thoughts and confusion and Agitation! And with that my anxiety goes so up fearing I might go crazy!  

I don’t know what I am supposed to do ! 
Today I thought to eat a little bit as I felt better I had bread with chips and mango!- and oh dear god I feel so bad ! So triggered!  Anyone can help please ! 

Sometimes I blame myself on how that doctor behaved! Maybe she saw me not too happy and not excited! Maybe I went to her with so much gloom that she thought I need that medicine but I hate I hate it I want my life back please please!

"When the hospital staff decide whether they should keep a patient in long-term care or release them, they ask both the patient and the patient's guardians. Which party would they listen to?",1716001472.0,"Last year while I was in a military school, I was hospitalized due to suicidal contemplation. After receiving medication and therapy for three weeks there, I was in a condition where I was no longer an immediate danger to myself. The staff asked me whether I want to return back to the military school or to stay in Kingston General Hospital to receive long-term care. I told them that I would like to return to the military school. They also asked my parents as well. My parents also agreed to have me return to the military school. I was then discharged from the hospital a few days after. Fast-forward to one year later. I am still struggling with suicidal ideation, although to a lesser extent than before. My mother told me that if I ever self-harm again, she will call the hospital and ""force"" me to stay in long-term care. She told me that she would prefer for me to end up as a vegetable in the hospital than to have any risk of me hurting myself. I think she is over exaggerating since I rarely self-harm now and I have kept my suicidal thought under control for the most part. She believes that if she had told the hospital staff last year that she wanted me to stay in long-term care in the hospital, that the staff would have listened to her over me.

Spilling myself out,1716001978.0,"Posting this outside my normal account because why not honestly 


Ive been pretty much isolated socially for about 4 years or so (more if you don’t count the times I have been in public school around what I can best call associates), and I’ve never actually retained a friend beyond a couple of months. 

For awhile I began talking to people online. It seemed to work for a bit. At some point, it started getting too personal. As it turns out, people who don’t actually interact with others in real life don’t know how to properly handle emotional problems. This was something I couldn’t handle, so I started becoming distant. I did make other ‘friends’, but the duration of those friendships kept getting shorter and shorter. I couldn’t (and still can’t) help beating myself up for not being there for people I’ve never even met. At some point, I’ve stopped trying.

As sad as this may sound, the only other person I regularly talk to is my mom, which isn’t saying much when you live under the same roof. She’s been a lot better in more recent years, but I have some vivid childhood memories. I can count 3 separate times she’s threatened to put me out (as early as 9 years old or younger), the screaming, the berating, and even one time she actually choked me. Family drama beyond just her didn’t really help much, so contacting a majority of them hasn’t really been of interest. 

My mom has always been cynical when it comes to people’s nature, so internally it’s made the idea of actually interacting a lot more intimidating. Ironically, she gets along with people much more easily than I do. Truth be told, the concept is kind of terrifying to me.

Before I stopped regularly talking to people online, I started cutting myself. I have already had suicidal ideations (spanning a few years) and other destructive tendencies (head hitting, skin picking, a few other body focused things) among a few other developing personal problems. I’ve been in a sort of gradual decline.

"Hi everyone, i'm tired.",1715996092.0,"I'm typing this while i'm crying and sitting on bed.

The last few years have been really messed up for me, I havent shared it with anyone cause i'm scared people might see me as weak or use it against me.

Let's start with my childhood,
I grew up in a household with 2 abusive parents , 1 brother and a sister.

I've been emotionally neglected by my parents, i've been abused physically and mentally by my mom and sister. My dad abused me more mentally but still didn't do as much damage as them. However he did abuse everyone else in the household.


Fast forward to me getting older, I would get bullied and I basically raised myself since my mom was working full time and had to deal with my mentally ill sister (at this point my parents were separated cause my dad held a knife to my brothers throat in front of me 2 TIMES , I was under the age of 11 when this happened)


I got older but the situation at home did NOT change with me having a depressed mom and mentally ill sister. I would find my escape online cause I was lonely and I used to get bullied in high school. This put me in unsafe positions, at one point I had multiple stalkers (i'm sure it was my sister). My sister was always jealous of me cause I was the skinny and ""pretty"" little sister while she was the overweight insecure sister who would get picked on by everyone.

My sister strangled me in my sleep,she made fake accounts of me, pretended someone else stalked me while she was the guilty one. My sister cut herself in front of me when I was little. All in all she did damage me

It's too much to share but I slept with men to feel something cause I felt so numb, I was not in the right place. I've had multiple abusive relationships. I'm 25 now. Emotionally exhausted.

My sister tried to kill her baby and ended up in jail and a mental hospital. 

This took a toll on my life
I've thought about changing my name and moving cause at this point in my life i'm just this hurt child who is scared to be nice and soft.

My little sister (F9) is very afraid of being alone,1716004377.0,"Before I begin, I'm aware my sister is young- she's 9, and it's normal for kids her age to be scared of being alone in rooms, or monsters

But I've been really worried- because this is to an extreme with my sister

She's so scared of going to the bathroom alone because she says she sees monsters, and I ask her where the monsters are, and she says it's in her mind - she always sees monsters in her mind

Everyday she leaves the bathroom door wide open while she takes a bath, and someone needs to be watching her while she's taking a bath - she doesn't care that people can see her naked

One time I accompanied her to the bathroom and I asked her what she's afraid of, and she pointed at fingerprints on the glass of the bathroom, and said she's scared of those, because she doesn't know why it's there, like it might have been a monster - that's when it really intrigued me that she'd take note of something as small like this

It's not just in the bathroom, but she's afraid of being anywhere alone in the house. Even when   the entire family is inside the house (our house isn't that big, and it's pretty noisy) she doesn't want to be alone. 

Even when it's daytime, and everyone's present in the house, and she leaves the door wide open while she takes a bath, she still is scared and needs someone watching her

If she's forced to take a bath alone, she shouts my name as loud as she can and asks if I'm still there numerously while she's bathing just to see if I'm still there

Her only response is that she keeps seeing monsters in her mind

I worry that this is something more serious. She's so afraid of being alone, and refuses to do anything alone even if it's something urgent. She just refuses to be alone.

I desire to isolate myself as much as possible, and I know I'm not quite thinking clearly.  I just feel flat and strange and yet somehow stretched out of shape. Not happy, and not sad, I don't know what I am. My thinking is so disorganized, and I sound so horrid when speak. My head is spinning and buzzing (not physically ofc) and it's driving me insane. I dread the future if I have to go on without improvement or answers to why I feel like this. My potential is rapidly deteriorating, and I can't grasp why? I don't know why I'm thinking as strangely as I am. What in the world is wrong with me?  Does anyone have an idea of what this is or what would help?? I think I'm pretty desperate at this point.

I can’t tell if i’m depressed or not,1716001618.0,"28m here. i can’t tell if there’s something clinically wrong with me or not, because i’m sad but it seems like a ton of people feel this way at least a little and i mostly function alright day to day. (have an alright job, a few friends, date here and there, hobbies etc.)

i first started wondering if i may have a mental health issue around 15 years ago. i’ve pretty consistently felt like i’m just more tired, slow and apathetic compared to my friends,loved ones and peers. i have trouble maintaining relationships. it’s like theres nothing inside me to give them so i withdraw or they do and i get left behind. 

i’ve never really admitted it or sought help but i frequently feel frustrated with life and wish that my existence would end or just had never started. i feel trapped alive, like now i have to do all these different things to make myself happy and upkeep a life that i never asked for. like everything i do is towards some goal i don’t even care about and if it were really my choice i would just leave. i have brothers and a mom and dad though so i can’t.

i don’t know how to talk to anyone in real life about my feelings but i know that’s what you’re supposed to do if you think you may need help. even this feels weird and embarrassing. i feel like the only way is to pay some professional stranger or just keep gritting through it internally, but what type of life is that? 

TLDR; i’ve been sad basically my whole life but does that mean i’m depressed necessarily or is this just a rational way to feel? thanks if you read all that

You’re mentally ill and we can’t help you with that ,1716000918.0,"Has anyone here ever been evaluated by a medical professional for symptoms you think may be unrelated to mental health but as soon as you tell them you take psych meds you’re immediately placed in a box and put on the sideline?

I‘ll be honest, I don’t know everything that’s going on with me mentally and with the ever changing state of my mental health it’s hard to pinpoint where every symptom or sensation comes from. I’m also not in peak psychical shape at the moment which intensifies the different ways I feel.

I am a diagnosed schizophrenic. I feel like nobody understands me.,1716000551.0,"Over the past year, I began to experience a lot of things that don’t make any sense. There are voices that criticize and make demands of me. Whenever I hear them, it feels like they are controlling my mind. I thought for a while that my step mom was responsible for it all. I’ve had so many near death experiences, feeling acutely in danger around people that I feel are after me. I thought that by removing my right eye I would be rewarded and cured of all my struggles.

My mom is trying to fight me and I don't know what to do.,1715999341.0,"TLDR: my mom is (consciously or unconsciously) making me out like I am a villain in her head and that I am constantly disrespecting her. She has a history of fighting with those close to her about this same thing and destroying those relationships, and I believe that she is doing the same to me with an even more tenuous grasp on the actual situation than in previous ones. It has become a serious drain on me and I don't know how to navigate this situation anymore.

I need help understanding what is going on in my mom's head, I can not tell anymore. I (23M) live with my mom (51F), or rather as I'd like to put it, we have lived together since the start of COVID. My mom has a long history of poor mental health, although I only really remember stuff from after I was about 16. She has SH'd at least once in her life, and has struggled with mental health issues since my sister was born 20 years ago. My family was born in South Africa and we moved to US in '03, it was really hard for her. My dad worked in the office, but my mom stayed home to take care of my sister and I when we were growing up.

Starting in about 2017, my family started to suffer with serious mental health challenges. My mom was having a really hard time herself, and my sister was in crisis all the time. My dad was not really emotionally available at that time as a result of his upbringing, so I took a lot of the brunt of emotionally taking care of my mom, which I did starting in about 2018. It took a toll on me, and I attempted SH in October of 2019 shortly after starting college. My mental health was poor for a very long time afterwards.

I moved back in during covid because I liked living with my mom more. I had a rough time for a while, having another SH attempt in 2022 after leaving college, and have had a long journey back to relative mental wellbeing. My life is starting to get back on track, and despite a couple things thats I still struggle with, I am happy with myself and where I am.

I have been the one to help my mom with her struggles since 2018-ish. She has very poor emotional and mood regulation and is prone to anger and outbursts over slights against her, perceived or real. The more troubling aspect is that she cycles through an ally-to-villain-to-ally cycle with many of the closest people around her. She has done this with my dad, who is still a villain to her because he left her. He did cheat on her, which is pretty important to the story, but she still hates him to her core to this day. She has done this with my sister, the cycle has come and gone at least 2 or 3 times now I would guess. I have tried to temper this, to console her but to offer her a differing perspective, but it has become less and less effective over time. At this point, I can't stop her anymore.

She has already started the cycle with me. There was already an incident last year and I basically had to walk her off the cliff, making major concessions to her just to be able to live at home. I was not really in a situation to live by myself and having my own dog makes it even more challenging. It has come back again this year, but now I can't stop her. She is picking fights over small things; how I do the dishes, going on <30min runs without telling her, etc. I have been trying to assert boundaries but she does not respect them. Last year it was her audibly *doing the nasty* with her partner while I was home, this year it has become making decisions for me about my life and encroaching on my autonomy. She has herself admitted that she can not really stop herself from seeing past her emotions, but her inability to take criticism means that I can't stop her because it will almost certainly make things work.

Tonight was a total shit show and she goaded me into a fight because she made major changes to my financial life, telling over text while we were both home, without any measure of consultation or discussion. When I told her later it was extremely disappointing that she did that, she retorted that I had been extremely disrespectful and uncommunicative, so it was justified. I disagreed, saying that a therapy session I had asked her to join was me trying to tell her face-to-face about what I had been struggling with our communication. Eventually, I walked away to return to what I was doing, and she muttered ""fuck you"" under her breath as I walked away. This was a childish comment and I got angry because of it, and a proper argument ensued.

What am I supposed to do here? We still have the session on Monday, but that will be more of a ""let's cool it off"" rather than ""let's fix problems"" session. What am I supposed to do in the meantime? Just let her talk shit and be disrespectful towards me? Live by her rules because if I don't she'll bottle it in until she finds a way to retaliate? While moving out is technically an option, it is not really a good one for me; I am starting school again next week and both that and my job would be significantly farther away if I had to move in with my dad.

Found my husband letters,1715998873.0,"Please tell me if I'm just overreacting, cuz this is causing me panic attacks all day.

I found some letters dated to 2010 from a woman he had a simi romantic interest in. It was way before he and I got together(2018). If I remember correctly it was his first. But it was long distance, and whenever they were together in person it was super awkward and it doesn't go anywhere not even sexual, but they're very chatty over letters and text. Even then I glazed over the letter, it wasn't very romantic either but I digress.

It difficult to explain, but I don't have a problem with history, but I have a problem with a lack of transparency. Because this issues started  when I found another woman's name tag from his place of employment on our damn fridge, conveniently placed where I wouldn't see it immediately and apparently has been there for quite a while. I heard about this woman from the stories he told but I did not realized they were friendship level enough for him to have a ""momento."" Why he has it is because she left to another state and he wanted something to remember her by.

I wouldn't have had a problem if he just fucking let me know cuz I had a history of being cheated and grew up from a broken home from it.

When I first saw it I was trying so damn hard to composed myself, but I lost it because of a different heated discussion and I just had to bring it out in the open. I'm ashamed and hated myself for it and I'm still so mad that he tried to dismissed it. It made me felt like he valued the friendship more than me.

I get the secrecy and I made it a doubt edge sword for him but dear God he cannot think that not telling me would be better.

I recalled him mentioning letters, and I asked to see it as he enjoys telling stories from his past but he seemed hesitant about it. Now that I found it, I've been holding it in cuz I know he's just going to dismissed, put a bunch of logic into it and tell me I'm overreacting. I'm so exhausted, I hate his idea of privacy. Plus it doesn't help that a bunch of non-related discussion is similar and I just can't keep doing this, I'm starting to regret so much.

It made me so mad that he tells me I need to let go of the past yet here he is reminiscenting about his!

DARK PASSENGER,1715997841.0,"Hey! I've been binge watching ""Dexter"" series in Netflix thus the title. I badly need insight/s.

TW: Dark stuff. Please scroll down if you're uncomfortable with this topic or may trigger you for some reason.

For context, I read a lot of articles about mental health and self diagnosed myself as bipolar and have anger issues. For my peace of mind, I went and have myself checked with a psychologist and psychiatrist last year and I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Consistently talking to my therapists (once a month) and taking anti-depressant (fluoxetine). 

But somehow, even if I am taking my meds, my ""dark feelings"" still won't go away. 

A little bit of history: I was SA'd as a child by a legally adult relative that went on for 2 yrs, and a neighbor (2 yrs older than me but we were both minor at the time) which went on for 5 yrs (never told my fam cause I'm scared of something that might happen to me or them).

I never knew what real love means and how it works. Thus me looking for love in the most bizzare and unhealthy relationshits - thus the PTSD. Because even tho my parents are not legally separated, they are physically and emotionally separated. Separate bedrooms, separate houses. They're emotionally absent towards us but financially responsible for our needs. 

Now here's my dilemma:

If I get in conflict with someone, anyone, my mind always think of every morbid scene I can do to that person. I always think of torturing & killing that person. And I fantasize it over and over until my brain focuses on other things.

I know it's wrong but I just can't help myself from thinking that way. I'm an alcoholic and working my way towards sobriety because I totally lose control when drunk and I'm afraid I might actually kill someone - which I almost did but thankfully I came back to my senses. I'm impulsive especially when drunk and never think of consequences until I actually did something and regret it. 

I'm a 100% lesbian (hard butch) but sometimes when I'm drunk, I find myself looking for guy to fuck (did it 3x) then regretted it and fucking sobbed the next day.

My therapist knows about me being an alocholic but doesn't know about these rage thoughts. I'm afraid that she might report me to the authorities or be held in an institution (I have panic/anxiety attacks when in enclosed spaces; with nowhere to go out to: I'm claustrophobic). I know there's so-called ""doctor-patient confidentiality"" but I think my situation is not covered.

I'm currently in my last semester of school, and I'll be starting my career as a psychiatric nurse practitioner in just a few months.

Welp... now what?,1715995619.0,"I've written at length about an experience I had a couple of months ago with a doctor's office that caused me a lot of grief. I won't go into detail here but if you check my post history it's all there.

Today, someone from the surgical facility where the procedure was performed called, and she empathized with how I was feeling, while putting up with a bad connection on the line and my own impulse to raise my voice whenever I didn't feel like I was being heard or understood.

She took everything I had in stride, and did an excellent job of explaining to me the things that nobody had before, during or after my appointment before. She listened when I told her that the tech that had worked on me was wonderful, and for some reason I felt like she might actually forward it along when I told her I wish that the tech had been informed that she made a difference for me.

I've spent nearly three full months emotionally wracked regarding this event, and unable to think about much of anything else. I have, and do still, feel sick to my stomach, my skin is crawling. Despite this, I feel like the shackles were taken off of my mind today by this woman's basic ability to empathize with what I was saying and how I was feeling.

Now, I'm still angry and hurt, but I feel like it's time to move on and I'm lost. I've pushed everyone close to me away because I've been irrationally angry and bitter... and I didn't want to hurt them as well.

I've been unable to get established with a counselor as they all want to do walk-ins and I need an appointment window as I can't take a full day off of work for this.

I still feel hurt, but I'm now realizing that there's really no good reason to... nothing about what happened was on purpose. If anything it was just a lack of empathy combined with my own lack of expression of how I was feeling at the time, and my lack of being emotive is not on the people working there just doing their jobs.

If anything, the doctor should have made sure I was physically OK (I was not) before letting me leave. Other than that I need to accept that this was SOP for the staff and they were doing a good job by any measure they were aware of.

I have very little memory of my childhood and yet I think I had a great upbringing? wtf?! ,1715995464.0,"I have struggled with this problem for a long time…I’m 39 years old and have very little
memory of my life 0-18. Of course I remember   moments here and there, some random, some significant but often I wonder if I’m actually remembering the photo evidence and not the actual memory if that makes sense? 

It has completely thrown me for a loop because I had/have wonderful parents, nothing traumatic as far as I remember but yet I can’t recall much. When I think back to that time I just know in my soul that it was comforting and I felt very loved and supported. Yet for ex, if I think about my grandparents whom I was very close to, and spent soooo much time with, I can’t even recall that many specific moments with them. Did my brain take all that time for granted and didn’t “mark it” as important? I could even say the same thing about childhood pets. I knew they were special and I loved them but yet very little actual memories.  

What would be the reason for this? The only thing I can think of is I started having panic attacks at age 26 and from there it went down hill..I’ve been on and off antidepressants for the past 7 years. Could an event like that erase memory or perhaps is it the medication?

Now I’m looking through his windshield and notice he’s making eye contact with me as I’m walking. I’m starting to panic a little now. He might have grabbed something large or small, maybe shiny, from his passenger seat and I notice he looked at me and then back down at something about 2-3 times. (A phone, a book?) 

I go back inside (keep in mind my whole trip from the front door to the bins and back took about 30-40 seconds if that), and look out my window right away and he’s still there for maybe 10 more seconds before driving off. He might have taken a note before driving off? He made no more stops on the street as far as I saw, and just continued on to the city street. 

I feel like I’m naturally an overly cautious and anxious person. I absolutely have social anxiety. I probably have some kind of undiagnosed mental disorder. This isn’t the first time I’ve been this stressed about something but I feel like this was way too specific of an event and immediately afterwards began to feel ill and theorize explanations. My head was spinning and my knees were weak and I felt faint. 

I’m afraid someone is after me or that it’s an investigator of some sort. Spoke to a friend and my mom and they told me it’s nothing to worry about, but I can’t shake it. Do you think I have some kind of paranoid disorder or is this logical thinking?

A little personal post. But if you have been struggling with depression or any other mental illnesses. How did you realized that you needed to seek professional help? 

I feel exhausted from constantly trying not to be sad. My body feels tired and I struggle to concentrate in things. I usually write in a journal when I feel overwhelmed but it's always the same issue that I am overthinking. I do not want to live in the past. I detest seeing myself still be in the same place I was 2 or 5 years ago while everyone changes and moves on. I'm not ambitious about anything and don't have any goals. I don't wanna keep being lazy and rot in my bed every time I have time for myself. I wanna be productive but once I initiate something I just can't go through it. Discipline and consistency is hard. I understand that you must start small and built up things but even doing that is so hard. I am 19 and will be turning 20 soon. I don't wanna keep thinking that someone will come and save me from myself. That's just unrealistic. I wanna be able to snap myself out of this situation. Obviously, the reason I am this way has to do with past events that occurred in my life. But even so I can't seem to move on.

I didn't achieve anything in my life - I feel worthless and stuck in life,1715991961.0,"I just feel like I missed a big chunk of my life. Like a part of a puzzle and without that, I just can't go forward. Life is just passing by while I can't do anything to change it. Sometime I feel like the odds are against me, because when I want to change things and take actions, unexpected things just prevent me from doing it…

For example, I wanted to gain professional experience by volunteering. First try, pandemic happened. Second try this year, my email never reached to the organization I was 100% sure to be chosen. I wanted to participate to a photography contest this week. It was raining the whole week and missed the deadline... I didn't see the northern light because it was cloudy all weekend (and rainy after that). I feel unlucky...

I know people keep saying to focus on good things instead of negative, but I just don't see anything good happening in my life.

I'm 30 and just worthless. Graduated in multimedia in college, but didn't go to university… Well, not true, I tried, but it wasn't for me. Didn't find a job after searching for almost 2 years. Before that I only got 2 x 6 months term position. I'm working at minimum wage, live with my parent, don't have a car, don't have friends who are inviting me to do something (I'm an introvert and I actually don't know what to do with people either) or nobody to bring me up.

On the other hand, in my family, my brother just followed the regular path of College -> University -> Dream Job. Or relative who are airline pilots at 22 yo, entrepreneur at 26 yo, etc. Last time we had a family meeting, I just didn't want to talk to people because I was ashamed of myself. People explaining everything about their exciting life while my life is just plain boring with only working a job I hate + sleeping.

It's hard to not compare yourself to others when you want to be somewhere else in life, but you aren't anywhere. It's like if I spent 30% of my life only doing 1% of what I really want. I need to do 99% in under 70 years (if I reach the age of 100).

I don't remember when is the last time I was truly happy. Probably when I was in College and was just learning new things and I did a volunteer camp abroad to dig on archaeologic site. It was fun and I met some great people. But that was about 6 years ago... Otherwise I try to travel once a year and every time I feel better. Most people like to return home after a trip, but it's the thing I hate the most. Why should it stop? Why can't I continue exploring the world? - Now back to work... I f\*cking hate my country Canada.

I didn't travel for a least a year now, because I just don't feel like 3 weeks vacations is really what I need. I think I just need to take a sabbatical and just go see the world without limit, but I just don't know what to do now. There are some lucky people who were raised in the good family and are able to do what they love for money. Others like me have loving parents, but parents who also want to control their child. I'm 30 and I feel like they consider me like a child. I know that I can just disappear one day and never talk to them again ever, but I'm not this person... I'm a bit of a people pleaser, introvert and everything make that I'm making sure that others are happy or I go against my own ideas because others think it's stupid.

Whatever, now I just feel useless. Nobody care about my skills and I'm at a point, that even if I did a bootcamp and watch tutorials online, I just doubt of myself. ""Am I really good? Will I ever find a job I like?""

My dream would be to work with animals, be able to live nearby a beach to surf and enjoy horse riding (that I already do a bit). Like that would be my peak happiness. Just live quietly and do things I like, but right now, in Canada there is no beach for surf, horse riding isn't popular and can't meet people and I failed biology two times, so can't work directly with animals. I try to work indirectly through my field of digital media, but I just can't get the experience to get a job. I currently waiting for some news about a job in Africa for wildlife conservation, but I really want to quit my job this summer and do something more meaningful for me like volunteering at an hostel in Europe, getting professional experience while meeting travelers and be in a new environment. Whatever, I don't have support for that and it's hard to say ""Let's do it!"" when everyone around you are like ""It's a waste of time, it's stupid, etc."".

I'm just hopeless. I don't see a bright future for myself.

I don’t know what’s going on,1715991590.0,"I don’t even know what I want to write so this might be a bit jumbled as I am having a crisis right now.
Ever since I turned 15 my mental state has changed drastically. Basically, It’s as if I don’t feel emotions as much as I should. Don’t get me wrong, there are things that make me happy, things that make me sad but all of it just seems so…insignificant???

I remember being at my grandma’s funeral(she died after this whole ordeal started so I know it’s not the cause). Everyone around me was devastated, my mom was crying, my brother was crushed even my dad was in tears, but me? Nothing. I just felt akward sitting there while people told me they were sorry for my loss when I, myself, wasn’t. I never even went trough one stage of those all famous “stages of grief”(I very much loved my grandmother so I should have been grieving too). On that note, when people say “I’m sorry for your loss”, do they actually mean it? Cuz I sure never have. I just do it because it’s the “polite thing to say” but I don’t actually feel sorry.
That’s the main crux of the problem really, I just feel like I have zero empathy. I mean if my friend’s family member passes away, I know that “this is terrible and they must be crushed” but that’s just the logical conclusion. I’m starting to feel like some sort of serial killer, cuz that’s what they do, right? They don’t have empathy. They don’t care for the pain they inflict upon others, they don’t feel for them.

Well, it felt kinda good to write that all out but what I’m really looking for here is for someone to tell me that they feel something similar so I know I’m not going crazy. Or, if you could provide a name for what I’m experiencing, that would be even better. Mental health is kinda stigmatized where I live not to mention my parents once told my brother to rethink his relationship with his girlfriend because she had anxiety. I tried google but the closest thing I found was alexithymia which I don’t really understand(what does it mean by “difficulty identifying emotions”??)

Existing after trauma,1715991124.0,"I, 24f, grew up trapped in a really abusive environment for the overwhelming majority of my life so far. My parents were emotionally and at one point sexually abusive. I grew up in poverty and had to move often due to my parents not paying rent. This eventually lead to us being homeless for a couple of weeks as we slept outside the house we were evicted from. To say I was depressed during this time is an understatement and my anxiety was worse.

My biological dad offer to let me and my younger sister live with him and while at first it was great the second half of that year was the worst time of my life.
He fought with his wife daily, physically most times, and was always drunk. He made explicit comments about his sex life towards me and my underage sister.
He made numerous transphobic remarks towards my sister and often commented on her genitals.
He would make food he knew we didn't like and then get mad and yell when we didn't eat it.
Once he was wasted and ate all his sushi then forgot he ate it. He got furious and told us he was going to lock up the fridge knowing I had things I bought myself in there. He also knew both my sister and I hated sushi but he said he had to punish everyone because he couldn't prove who ate. Keep in mind he ate it.
His wife was also, to be blunt, crazy.
She was convinced he was cheating and ""hacking"" the wifi and would cut it off for weeks at a time.
I couldn't contact anyone, not even my boyfriend of six years or my mom, during these blackouts.
I lived there for one year and was on the verge of ending it but my boyfriend, now fiancee, has brought me to his state to live with him.

I'm far away from my abusers but I still have so many problems.
I worry he's gonna get fed up of my constant baggage and send me back.
I'm trying to get on my feet, my parents never even got me my ID and I dropped out of middle school when I turned 16.

Social anxiety.,1715989124.0,"

I grew up in a small town in India where talking to girls was an offence and as i grew older and moved to a city where guys and gals interacted freely i was excited and happy and started talking to girls as if they were guys. It led me to trouble. People thought I was a creep so girls started ignoring me talking shit to me and got bullied by guys which led me to depression. Then switched schools a couple of times and again I faced similiar situation. So to feel that gap in my life I started talking to girls online. It went well first before but soon i also started getting blocked since I was needy and still am maybe. I started behaving rude to them online since they had much better life living in countries like us, uk etc and I started treating them like shit till I got blocked and i trauma dump this to everyone. I took therapy for almost a year and also took tms therapy which costed me like 7k rupees but it didn't make any change to my mental health. When I see some friend of mine online living better life than mine I treat them like shit and do it till I'm satisfied and till they stop talking to me since they wouldn't understand my problems. There is no solution to my problems either. People would tell me to join gym build confidence but it ain't possible since I was not also deprived of talking to girls but also had trauma with it so it makes my mind not interact with them at all. Doing it right now won't work since people who weren't deprived of all these had natural ability to pull girls. So if i start late i probably wouldn't be as good as them and my mind wouldn't let me since I have spent thousands of rupees for my mental health and it still didn't help. When I'm rlly frustrated I say shit stuff about Indian society to myself in my room act like a wild animal go naked and start crying including slapping myself a couple of times. I see no hope. I wish I could change my sexual orientation so I don't have to deal with girls ever again. Heck I can't even pull desi girls living around me let alone girls from other countries if i decide to study there. And even if i go there i would probably be depressed as hell seeing others with better lives than mine and seeing others making out and having sex.

Anxiety out of control following ozempic,1715985886.0,"Just a warning, this maybe a bit disorganized and or have poor grammar at times. 

Hello everyone, I'm at a bit of a bad place right now and I've been looking for information / support / acknowledgement that this exists from strangers. I don't really know what good it will do me, but I hope by getting myself out there it can help my mental health a bit.

Bit of a back story. I'm 36 now and I've had anxiety all my life. It started when I was 9 and I chocked on a tortilla from taco johns. From there I remember infrequent times where I was hungry I would shake uncontrollably. I didnt always have the best food options growing up but I learned to live with it. As an adult I would have panic attacks if I went to long without eating. The symptoms were essentially copy and pasted what hypoglycemia would look like. However my blood sugar during these times was fine.

I've been on lexapro for about a decade now and my anxiety was under control with the trigger listed above as the only thing I had to actively manage. With needing to eat to avoid panic attacks, you can imagine it was hard to control my weight.

Cue last september, I had a burning sensation when taking a pee. Turns out I was passing sugar in my urine. It's type 2 diabetes time! I immediately took control the best I could with dietary changes. I lost about 25 lbs in a few months on my own adding victoza about 6 weeks after my diagnosis. I had wanted ozempic as many of my friends were on it. I was also scared of metformin because of its rare interaction with alcohol. 

Late january we had a shortage of victoza here. At the same time I conveniently got a letter in the mail that my insurance would now cover ozempic. I had been stable and doing quite well. My weight had plateaued but my blood sugar was under control. Now it's time to restart the process but hopefully lose more weight! Around 2/23 I started my first dose of ozempic. 

April 10th was my first episode. officially I was diagnosed with fainting. I was sleeping in bed and I woke up and something felt off. I was overwhelmed with panic and rushed out and immediately fainted. I went to the ER and after a battery of tests nothing was found to be wrong with me. 

May 1st it happened again. This time my primary started my on buspar to help with the anxiety. I had high hopes that this was just my anxiety and this would fix it. It lasted all of 2 weeks.

May 15th was just a few days ago now. I've had some normal and some not so normal days between my last 2 dr visits but something broke for me this morning. I was looking at something and had a feeling of nostalgia and it triggered a panic attack. I was stuck in that moment and everything I did to look forwards felt hopeless. I woke my wife and tried to have her help calm me down. After talking to her I was feeling numb and felt like doing things to feel again. I wanted to hit the walls, bite myself, or anything to feel real. Thats when I decided to go in again, these thoughts were not my own. 

In the ER they have me ativan which calmed me down. I made an appointment with my primary and saw her that afternoon. We agreed to stop the buspar and the ozempic as well. We feel as if the ozempic nausea is triggering my anxiety and the buspar seems to have exasperated it rather than help. It's been 8 days since my last shot of ozempic. I'm taking hydroxyzine for the anxiety episodes. It helps but makes me sleepy. Last night I had nightmares and when I woke up i couldnt stay awake long enough to get away from them due to the sedative effect. I think I'll try and ride out the day without them. 

For now I'm trying to take it a minute at a time, an hour at a time, a day at a time. Each time I have a slight bit of nausea its sugar coated with anxiety. We are hoping that once the ozempic leaves my body ill return to how I was before and able to manage my anxiety.

I have four mental illnesses and it makes me feel behind in life,1715985607.0,"Let me start out by saying what I have in a list format.

1. Tourretes syndrome (mild no vocal tics)
2. ADHD (Combined type)
3. Depression (mildly-severe)
4. Autism (high functioning)

I feel like all of these make me feel inferior to those around me especially the ones who I label as smart, I frequently self sabotage myself and have had this pattern of gaining momentum towards something I want then just having it fall apart all around me because I wouldn't practice enough or broke the organization or consistency with whatever I was trying to do. And the weirdest part is I self sabotage on things I feel so passionate about but not really on things like my job.

I also have a narcissistic mother, she would frequently use all my siblings like she's playing chess to get what she wanted and if you disagreed you'd be as good as dead to her.

I have also this perfectionist attitude I guess you can call it seeing in black and white, but I also feel like I have a growth mindset and I hate how these two things clash so much it makes me feel like I'm dumber than rocks.

I've taken an iq test at multiple ages and I've always felt like I've lost some iq points since when I was younger. I was told in my most recent test that I had an average iq and an above average working memory. But when I was younger I was told I was smarter than what I really am, atleast compared to my most recent test I've done.

Also relating to the iq thing is the fact that I have a strange addiction to wanting to be smart or gifted or amazing at something, but never quite feel I can make it to that label in whatever I'm passionate about or if I do feel like I'm gaining momentum I sabotage myself for whatever reason. And onto of that I genuinely think I have made myself dumber overtime by a mistake I wish I never made which was taking weed only a handful of times maybe 5 or 6 times socially buy still while my brain is still in a functional state that can ruin my potential intelligence, which leads back to thinking I was right about being smarter as a kid than as I am now as a young adult.

My partner is struggling,1715982649.0,"
Hi everyone,

I (F27) have been with my partner (M29) for nearly 8 years. He has battled depression his whole life, but since we got together in 2016, he's been getting support and has been on medication, which has helped somewhat.

Becoming a teacher, a job he loves, has also been beneficial, though it requires a lot of work outside the 9-5. Because of his workload,in the past few years I've taken on almost all chores, which I didn't mind as he was often very grateful. However, recently his workload has decreased, and he's been spending his free time playing video games and barely talking to me. He falls asleep often, eats poorly, buys snacks daily, barely exercises, and has gained a lot of weight. 

I ask him to do one chore a week (putting the washing away), but it never gets done, and I end up doing it myself. His depression cycles between good and bad months, but it's really bad now. He avoids our friends, saying he doesn't like them, and I'm getting nothing from our relationship. I feel so lonely as he doesn't want to talk or spend time with me.

I'm struggling to cope and need advice from others who have dealt with similar situations, or suffer themselves. How can I motivate him to get healthier and more sociable in hopes of lifting his depression? Or do I need to just wait it out for this cycle to end?

I remember since I was a child, she would touch me between the legs. A lot. She’d tickle me or pinch me there to tease me. This has probably happened hundreds of times. I don’t think it really stopped until I was 18 or 19, maybe? It wasn’t under my clothing so I don’t think it was sexual. It was just weird.

She had a weird obsession with my underwear. She would smell my used clothes in front of me a lot. Sometimes she would call me over and smell my underwear while I was wearing it. If I told her no, she would tell me that it was her job as a mother to do this and that all moms do this with their children. She said it was her favorite smell. This kept going into my teenage years.

We had this weird joke about me not wearing underwear. So sometimes she’d check. She’d touch my butt or my genital area to see if she could feel it beneath my pants. Other times she’d also just pull back my pants and just look. The last time I remember her doing this was when I was 20.

She used to walk around the house completely naked, but stopped after my dad got angry and told her it was inappropriate to do that in front of us.

When I was around 16-17, she would force me to sleep in the same bed as her while she was naked. She would hold me against her body, and her genitals would touch my skin. When I told her I didnt like doing that, she would get upset and told me that it was natural. I got scared when she did this to me, and after I told her that I was scared she would rape me she stopped. I feel a lot of guilt for saying this.

Around the same time, I came out to her as a transgender man (and still am a man today) and she didn’t react well. Sometimes she would lightly touch my chest and try to get me to appreciate my female body.

This is all I can remember at the moment. I feel sick and scared when I interact with her sometimes, and I don’t know if it’s really justified.

Getting older and mental health diagnoses ,1715981362.0,"Getting older [30s] and mental health diagnoses.

I'm not here to claim any special diagnoses [I feel that's harmful to people diagnosed/there are lots of posers] however, I have a few questions

I'm 30F, and I always always considered myself a ""highly empathetic"" person. The thing is, I've been wondering if I've been using that to win people over so that their perception of me is good. I was told by an ex that she thought I was a psychopath because of my charm, and I still remember feeling conflicted by this. 

Generally in conversation I don't really care about it. I think people can be fascinating to get to know but I am typically bored by them in 3 to 6 months. I find most people boring. People don't find me boring, however. I think it's because I don't care at all about social stigma and I say what I want, which can be funny to those who are scared of acting out of a society!

I do like listening to their problems and gossips but i think that's because im bored and it's interesting. I think I also like being regarded highly by others as that fuels a non existent sense of self worth.

I'm curious by your experiences here if there are similar qualities to being bipolar or psychopathic. 

I experience NO violent tendencies, yet I enjoy stealing [I've lessened it to bars of soap so I don't get arrested because I wouldn't like that consequence]. I'll do anything for dopamine. I'll get naked in a river if it feels good. I have 0 shame at all and really only regret when peoples ideal of me sours. I'm not sure if I care if I hurt them, or if I care if I hurt their idea of me being positive. 

I'm relatively social, but I feel like I compartmentalize people. I.e this person is for playing magic, this person is for rock climbing with, etc. 

I'm currently going through a possible bipolar diagnosis from adhd/anxiety. I never sleep. I can exercise for hours on end. I can bake a cake at 2am every day.

I don't really know what I'm writing about but I have never really had a best friend. I have a partner and I really enjoy her but I think that's the only person on earth I love? There are times she talks about things And I'm bored and have to pretend, but I think that's normal. She's probably bored by things I say, I think when you live with someone for years thats how it works.  I genuinely don't care about my family. Most friends don't really know me. Life feels like a revolving door and I don't get the point. 

I will say I love having dogs, I'm not sure if that's a sign of empathy, but I find them cute and love to please them.

I guess what I'm asking for is that my whole life I thought I was this nice and good person, but after reflecting, I feel like I'm self serving and can charm anyone, and I don't feel like im.living a real life. Perhaps this is long term mania or a life of denial, but I'm wondering if there's something deeper here

Hallucinations or imaginative?,1715980304.0,"I have had history with delusions and homicidal thoughts/urges in the past, but I'm not getting into that. Just mentioning it incase it links.

Anyway, I have been seeing the same person/entity or being for the last several months and has started to creep me out and distract me, especially in school. It isn't like a full on hallucination, but I easily and realisticly see the same face in almost everything I look at. Examples are in normal pictures of nature or something, walls, clouds, or just in shadows. It's so strange because each time I see the shadow cowboy in different places, they all look the same and its really cool; it feels as if he's following me or observing my life. I also see other faces in things, looking at me, but the cowboy is the main one.

Enough with my yapping, I'm just curious whether this is me just having a creative mind or some kind of visual hallucination. Take in mind I've never had full on auditory ones but have had a lot of extreme delusions: religion demons, spies, my mission from God to unalive bad people (still currently have), and many more. I do also see coloured lights flashing a lot and that kind of stuff

Anyway there's my rant and if you actually know what you're talking about, please may you give me advice? I really appreciate the patience and I don't want more people saying I have schizophrenia as they're not a psychologist and schizophrenia is much worse, I wouldn't be functioning if I had it.

I was in a car accident in 2021 in which I broke my neck and back.

I'm too expensive and lacking in recent experience).

The first psychiatrist I saw said I had mild depression and anxiety as a result of the crash. My solicitors contested this and I saw a second psychiatrist in April. His assessment is far more thorough and he has diagnosed PTSD (delayed onset) alongside Adjustment Disorder.

How have you overcome the barriers presented in your love life because of poor mental health?,1715977142.0,"I’m worried that I’ll never get a boyfriend because of my mental health struggles. 1. It’s extremely draining for myself and the people close to me to deal with the every day stuff relating to my anxiety and depression. 2.

Even if I were to attract someone physically, I feel like they just wouldn’t be able to handle certain quirks (or faults) of mine. 3. I don’t get insanely jealous and ‘crazy’ in the way you might hear about in controlling ex-gf horror stories, but I can be very obsessive (not fun or cute at all) and my mood becomes dependent on the state of my relationship with whoever I’ve attached to. I get extremely insecure and feel unworthy. It’s not an issue of trust—so I’m not one to demand location access or do random phone checks, nothing like that—but a lack of confidence in myself. I’ve developed eating problems in the past just because I felt I wasn’t thin enough for the guy I liked.

how a seemingly good strategy toward social acceptance backfired pretty horridly,1715972502.0,"(if you just want to read the question it's near the end of this yapping)

I (18F) made several assumptions about persons or groups of people throughout my life. I often sense when someone’s being a dick and I’m often right, I think. Matter fact I may or may not have diagnosed myself with assholism in the past. 

But that's not the point. I live in eastern europe which is like the, piss voting, anti abortive, gayparadebrickthrowing side a little, least where i live. Now, kinda different thing: to be completely honest I can't imagine a woman having sex with a man, I mean, I can a little but it's, it's lacking to say the least, I can't imagine being attracted to a man and a woman having sex, this seems kinda odd to me, not even exaggerating, like totally unironically. Connect the dots yourself i don't know, actually I don't think there are any dots to be connected, I literally wrote it out loud. 
My point is, throughout my life, by observing my environment, I lowkey made a mental list of things to avoid doing to not be bullied. I’m not crazy, this is actually one of the sanest and most protective measures I’ve done in my life. This list consisted of things like: don't be lgbt, don't be loud, don't dress cute, because if you're fat you'll be a punching bag, don't look as if you care about your looks because if you do and still look like a pig then you’ll be a punching bag, don't say random and weird shit to people because they will tell other people and you’ll be a punching bag and so on. 

I thought that was lowkey smart strategy and I ended up living my high school as an npc for so fucking real. I dressed in dark clothes, never bought cute things for myself, dressed in second hand shops and I told people it was more environmentally friendly than buying clothes in fast fashion chain shops, but that was just part of the reasoning. I didn't talk if I wasn't spoken too, If I had a problem with studying I never told anyone, I would raise my hand only if I felt burning in my heart because I needed to express a thought so badly, I never engaged in discussions with classmates I didn't feel comfortable speaking with (i only felt semi comfortable with four (4) of them), barely made eye contact with anyone, zoned out on most lessons (my logic: If I look uninterested and get bad grades nobody will laugh, it'd be worse if I tried very hard and still failed). This was my hs experience. Literally denial and repression all the way through, to the point I started hearing screams in my head whenever I felt tired, I think it was a way of exercising a voice for my brain, because I talked very little through the day.

I actually might have lost my personality for real… How do I get my personality back no borax no glue?? (ps. it's really scary to break the npc persona because it's real comfortable + i don't want to get hurt)

The loneliness really gets to me sometimes. ,1715967688.0,"So im a 24 year old guy and have never managed to make long term meaningful friendships with anyone my entire life. I have had a few friends here and there but they always had closer friends and the friendships felt short term and always kinda faded for one reason or another. Some of them it seemed like we were becoming closer so it always hurt a lot when they suddenly left my life. 

I am still in community college because i changed my major a bunch of times and have finally decided what i wanted to study. It isnt really social here, people just want to go to class and get out so making friends hasnt really happened.

 I work part time at a grocery store 25-30 hours a week and this is where I get pretty much all of my socialization. Theres some people around my age who are also part timers in a similar life spot as me. The problem is i work in the seafood department at the back of the store and i cant leave my department to just go around and talk to people like other departments can. I have had a huge crush on a girl at work and we actually did an art class together outside of work which was cool but it feels like I cant get anywhere with her because i just dont have the time to talk to her at work. (I posted the full situation on another sub if your interested in reading) I have gotten a few invitations from people in the store and have went to some of them but a friendship never really develops since they were group oriented(birthday parties for example). Someone recently asked for my number, actually was a girl but vibes have been strictly platonic between us but ive been hesitant to text her since i have grown a bit of mistrust in people.

The crazy thing is I dont think i fit the image of a loner, i put effort into my appearance and hygiene, im not overweight, i can hold conversations and make people laugh, and people have said i have a good personality. I try to be the best version of myself and am getting outside of the house doing things and going to places. I try not to be boring and have been making a more conscious effort to invest more time into hobbies and fun things to do. People at work seem to atleast somewhat like me, but i feel like people rarely initiate any contact with me and for the most part im seen as just an acquaintance. 

I live with my mom and sister(I have other family but they live in other parts and i dont really talk to them) but they dont really do anything with their lives, no hobbies or passions so my relationship with them isnt fulfilling to me. (I still love them ofcourse). 

Since I have turned 23 I have been feeling really down about my social and dating life. I feel like despite my efforts of trying to reach people, i cant get past that acquaintance stage with anyone. I spend like 90% of my time alone. I wish i had some close friends i could talk to and hangout outside of work and a stable romantic relationship but I have no idea how to get there. It would be nice to have someone who is more than just an acquaintance. It’s starting to feel more and more like a far away dream as time passes. I downloaded meetup but all the events are just old people. Any advice?

it has gone downhill since then whenever theres arguments they bring up my attempt and how i should’ve just died from it. my sister made it a joke and brings it up whenever she can about how disgusting and pathetic im for attempting and even worse how i failed. she says these things front of my mum and sometimes my mum even agrees and says it back when shes mad. 

she now doesn’t trust me around her cat she thinks i might attempt again near her cat and leave harmful things behind that can harm her cat (i had od’d and left a pill behind according to her) i apologised over and over but she doesn’t care. she screams and cries if i go near our room (we used to share room) i sleep on the sofa now its worse than it was before i attempted. i just want to get away. its so embarrassing “surviving” a failed attempt especially since ive been depressed forever i shouldve thought it out better.

i’m being such a coward now to attempt again, my sister told me that the paramedics had a hard time carrying me down  because how fat i am (i have an ed and i struggle with my weight she knows this) she said i struggled with them and when she went to the hospital she saw little kids waiting while they were wasting their resources on me. i just feel so disgusted at myself. i cant cry front of them because it sets them off even more. i cant get away at all. i have stopped taking my meds because my sister especially and my mum will bring up about my od and just mock how i take medication. my sister freaks out about medication. i feel horrible perhaps i gave her trauma cause of it. even my younger sister is starting to act like her it hurts so much because we used to be so close. everything hurts so much i dont know what to do i just want to die.

It's not okay to not be okay.,1715962037.0,"People always says ""it's okay to not be okay"" but its total bullshit. You have to have a hard but *visible* struggles for people to acknowledge it. What I mean is that mental illness or issues behind closed doors are not to give a fuck about. 

I have to hear this shit almost everyday going to school, mostly from teachers. That I'm doing bad because I'm lazy, that others have their situation way worse but they still do well. I mean, they dont say it directly to me but I'm in the class yk. Besides that's a shit thing to say to anyone regardless.

Back then, I was the one being the smart kid teachers were comparing others to, but I still didnt like it. I dont like being percieved as this hard working, flawless student who is better than the rest of the peasants. 

Ngl, I would prefer to be the peasant rn if the teachers could just shut up or give out actually good advice rather than saying how dumb we are. And as I say, they dont care if you are struggling, especially if it's related to your mind. And the most important thing is that you *have* to get good grades for them to care.

If you have problems and you overcome those and become successful, you're a role model, a good citizen. But if you dont overcome those then you're lazy, a failure, not trying hard enough, you wont ever do anything useful for society. 

The only reasons mental health is being more addressed these days is

1. It's for profit. 
2. Get people to work and live in this shitty, unlivable world.
3. Do the bare minimum and be regarded as a saint for caring *so* much about the well being of people.

These are the only reasons I can think of is because it just seems people dont actually care. I have to constantly make up excuses, or simply lie to get out of some tiresome work.

suicidal thoughts ,1715961176.0,"I haven't scored good in my boards and i have accepted the fact that ya maybe i didn't study well, although i had tried my best under the circumstances i was in for last two years, but I did study the way i thought i won't break down or when i thought that i am stable. 

My score kept decorating because of the environment i was (no actually i am ) living in and truthfully i had NOONE to talk about my problems and even if there were I couldn't because i thought i would be called an ""attention seeker"", I was loosing interest in the subject but kept going thinking that its just ending soon and I'll be leaving my house eventually so that kept me motivated for a long time. 

I have never cried about it and because of how worst my mental health had become I usually had these thoughts to suicide and self harm, I did harm my self like banging my head on wall, scratching my hands and legs until they bleed or punching on the tiles of my bathroom. I never went and did anything which could leave me mark on my body cause i had hoped that maybe I'll survive and be better (although it never did) I still had hopes. 

During one of my paper,I tried very hard to keep my self calm but still I got one of the worst panic attacks ever in the past 2 years (there were a load of reasons).
I ruined that paper of mine and then the tension made me hell nervous while preparing me for other exams and subsequently it got fucked. 

I knew that I would fail in my exam and now i used to cry nights thinking how will i face everyone and finally thought to quit but then i always had the thought of my younger brother  and couldn't build up the courage, so i decided to spend as much time as i could with him just so he could have memories of his sister after she dies. And not just know me as a coward who died because she failed so i wrote everything i faced for past 2 years for him to know on his laptop ,when he used to sleep, in a hidden folder.

My marks came, and by god's grace I passed, i was on cloud nine and cried really hard thinking if i wouldn't have passed what would i have done to myself. But obviously marks wasn't up to the mark so my parents were upset and embarrassed to tell my relatives my marks, although they never talked to me about my marks but i could hear them getting awkward when my relatives used to ask them my marks and how shameful they use to feel.

Due to my marks there are no as such good college which would take me but the one which is taking me is way too costlier and i belong to a middle class family, although my parents were going to take loan anyways for any college, i couldn't get this guilt out of my chest that i am such a big disappointment to them. 

I could see through the eyes and voice of my parents of how much they didn't expect this from me. I wanted to work hard in my college life, enjoy my life there but maybe I won't be able to after all these realisation i have got.

How do I know how serious suicidal thoughts are?,1715958907.0,"I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was like 12. A lot of it is mostly just 'I don't deserve to live' kind of stuff, but I've also had pretty vivid dreams of people telling me I should kms and being happy when I attempted and didn't survive.

I have attempted twice, but I'd try neither methods again since they were so slow and (obviously) didn't work. So I don't think these thoughts are anything to worry about too much.

However, a lot of the time when I think about committing suicide, I think about doing it with a gun. It'd be extremely hard for me to get one here (UK), but if I did get my hands on one- which is possible- I'd definitely shoot myself with it. That's not even a maybe. I definitely would.

I want to get into hunting, but that would probably be dangerous for me because like I said, I'd shoot myself. Maybe not right away, but I eventually would. It's quick, and that's what I want. I want to just leave this world as quick as possible, and not have to deal with all this anymore, and for everyone else to stop having to put up with me.

But how serious is this? I mean, it's unlikely I'll get a gun anytime soon, and all other methods are out of the window.

That would make total sense if she wasn't also the most verbally and emotionally abusive person I know, who uses intense anger like a switch in order to get what she wants, leaving the person on the other end feeling humiliated, fearful, and degraded, while she moves on with her day like it’s nothing. If you stand up for yourself even a little bit, she acts indignant and hurt, as if you had attacked her and she's now fearful of *you*, even though no one would dare challenge her like that.


The fact that people with anger issues are sensitive makes sense to me, but this particular sensitivity seems contradictory, if not hypocritical. I don't want to be unfair, though. If shes is so sensitive to feelings and people’s pain, why does she behave the way she does? Do people with anger issues process these situations differently?

Can anyone give advice on childhood trauma?,1715959853.0,"
Before I explain I just want to say that I was in primary school when this happened. I would have been anywhere from 8-11 years old. I hit puberty young (when I got my period I thought I was dying) and I had no idea about sex at all. My sisters and I had been through a disgusting amount of trauma prior to this happening and I’ve struggled with SEVERE ocd and anxiety for as long as I can remember. My older sister is 18 months older than me and my younger sister is 2 years younger. I’m not sure if any of this information is relevant but I thought it might be helpful to whoever may be able to help. 

I was watching what I thought was an age appropriate film at home with my sisters. In the film, a couple were rolling around on a bed kissing each other. They were fully clothed, but we were curious because we had never seen anything like it before.
We played a game similar to “Mums and Dads” where my older sister and I would choose who was going to be the boy and who was going to be the girl and act out what we saw on the TV. It started out as kissing. I can remember my sister touching me inappropriately and getting me to do it back to her, but that only happened once. The kissing turned into acting out having sex with each other. We had our clothes on most of the time, and I can’t remember it happening on a regular basis. I think it just happened randomly every now and again. It felt good at the time, and we had seen adults do it so we just assumed that it was a normal thing to do. I only recently told my family about it because I used to feel disgusted every time I thought about it. I know this happened between my older sister and my younger sister too but that’s not my story to tell. I didn’t understand anything about sex properly until I was about thirteen, so I wouldn’t have realised at 8–11 years old that what was happening was wrong.
I’ve been through an unbelievable amount of trauma which I think contributes to what happened. It was just sexual curiosity which was taken too far but I’m not sure what to do about what happened. My sister apologised but it wasn’t anybody’s fault. I want to get on with her but it’s hard too. I looked up to her as a role model and thought I was doing the right thing but I obviously wasn’t.

He’s mentioned previously that he used to she shadow people at night in his bedroom or in mirrors, but I guess I never took it seriously since it sounded like he was just talking about when he was younger and I was thinking “well kids see things in the dark all the time, that’s a bit worrying but it was probably just nightmares or something”, but recently we were out with a friend and again he brought it up but mentioning it’s been happening more recently, which is concerning but I didn’t say anything. Then yesterday he came over to my house and asked if my cat was thinner than before, I was a bit confused said no and asked why, and he said something along the lines of “sometimes I just worry that my pets are replaced by like identical” I told him that thought was very worrying and he just said it was anxiety that he didn’t actually believe they were replaced. But I realized this has been a thing he’s down in the past, checking pets for birthmarks, even checking me for my birthmarks to make sure I wasn’t replaced, I realize as I write this it sounds stupid but I genuinely just thought these were weird jokes or something but now I’m realizing they might not be. He talked about how he just worried they were replaced by his parents or the government, but that he doesn’t actually believe they are replaced so it’s just anxiety. I think the reason I’m only just now worrying about these things though is that a month or two ago I read The Collected Schizophrenias by Esme Weiksner Wang so I guess it’s been on my mind and what he’s describing reminds me of the stories in that book. But im also not sure, what if im just overthinking things because I read this book and his thoughts are just normal? Im just worried about his mental health and don’t know how to get him to see this is a worrying issue that he might want to look into I guess? He’s had mental health issues in the past, he has depression, anxiety, OCD, and adhd as diagnosed by his psychiatrist and therapist. Im just worried because he says he tells me things he never told his therapist (he no longer goes) or psychiatrist and so if the seeing people or believing people would be replaced was something he didn’t tell them then what if he has a deeper issue that would help if it’s treated? I’m just worried about him, if he says he knows they aren’t replaced then could it just be normal anxiety and not something else?

Anyone knows whats happening?,1715955743.0,"I went down from 20mg escitaloprame to 5mg over a long time. Was on 10mg for years, worked very good for me, no downsides. 

1 month ago I reduced to 5mg. All good until monday. There was a funeral and since then I am slightly depressed and I am having panic attacks in the evenings. 

Is this because I went down to 5mg Escitaloprame, or it is just a normal trauma response because of the funeral? We weren't too close so its not a lot of sadness and grief involved, but the funeral itself and the thought of death hit me like a train. 

Or it is both, the reducing of the dose of escitaloprame AND the funeral / trauma response. 

Or do you think it could be that 5mg is enough for me, since it was for last 4 weeks, and what I am going through is more or less „normal“ emotional processing? 

My plan was to stay at 5mg or even reduce it to 0 because for the last 8 months I thought I dont need it anymore since I have changed a lot.

He has previously gone to therapy has a psychologist and for a time was at a mental health hospital for self harm and got diagnosed with anxiety, depression, adhd, and ocd, but I’m starting to worry there might be more, especially because he says he never fully opened up to his therapist and tells me these thoughts he never told his therapist.

To me this sounds very worrying and like some of the things described in the book I read, and like I’m worried if things get worse and if he should get help? I’m realizeing that might be a fucked up thing to think, I’m just worried for him and don’t want to see things get worse for him. Is he right that it might just be anxiety, because he said he doesn’t actually believe they are replaced that it’s just a worry?

Constant worry about my pets' health,1715950318.0,"Hello all,

A bit of background. A couple of years ago I had a super horrible experience with losing a dog to parvo/distemper. It was a week of psychological torture that drained me mentally, emotionally, spiritually, financially.

I suppose the trauma stuck. For my more recent pets, several months ago, I would constantly feed them snacks to make sure they're eating because I'm always worried that if they don't eat, that means something is wrong with them. Kept doing that until one day, one of them didn't have appetite and I panicked.

Fast forward, nothing serious happened, thankfully. However, now I always avoid when my pets are being fed (I'm not the one who feeds them) because I always fear that they wont have a desire to eat. I constantly check if their stomachs are full and I am worried at even looking at them because I fear their stomachs won't look full.

I'm just going to overshare cause a therapist  is too much money lmao(and I'm not going to stress my dad)

It's most likely a mental illness or stress, but I'm genuinely so angry all the time. I hate myself and others(but it's mainly people), I can tolerate but I cannot love my grandmother even though she took care of me for almost all my childhood because my mother was a fucking(and probably still is) a druggie that literally neglected me for her dead druggie friend; I like my father but only for the resources he provides(I think. I can't explain it).

I'm always so snappy with people, especially my dad's ex-girlfriend(""stepmom"") since she can't seem to find any self-worth for herself so she asks about my father(they were in an abusive relationship. My dad's ex-girlfriend is the victim) in order to ""see if he's dating some other bitch/girl"" so she can ""move on"" and this has been going on for a year and it's annoying as hell.

I've told her to stop so many times, most leading towards arguments because I'm mean about it(but I've made it clear so many times that I do not want to answer her questions, and she can't seem to understand that): but then she somehow convinces me to keep on answering her questions about ""Where he's at"", ""Did he go to work"", ""Did he leave"", etc and I just came to resent her.

I see her as pathetic woman and I know I shouldn't because she's an abuse victim, but I cannot empathize with her. I never did when we used to live together and she sees us as ""family"". I do not see her as family, but I still see her and don't want to cut her off because she has shit on my dad that could get him arrested(or fined, etc). I know I'm wasting her time with false love, but I don't want my reputation to seem like I'm also apart of the toxicity in my family even though I know I am because what good person would choose bad people over good?

She's emotional because she does have depression, but she's even more emotional because she's bipolar and it's annoying as hell. She complains to me 24/7, that's all she does when she has her own kid to take care of. 

I know I shouldn't be blaming the victim, I'm a piece of shit for saying all of this because it's not her fault she's like this; but I can't stand her. She places a bad taste in my mouth everytime I see or text her even if she's a very sweet person. 
I know I should hate my dad, but for some reason I don't. My father side of the family are toxic to people outside of the family(relationship wise) and I should hate them, but just because they're nice to me: I don't. It's stupid really.

And my school friends?? I fucking hate them also. I can tolerate them, but I cannot stand them at the same time. I'm snapping towards them when they tease me 24/7 then give them the cold shoulder but I still sit with them because I'm just going to ghost them after I graduate highschool(and I like where I sit. They're funny when they're not being dicks) and I don't want to see like a loser even though I already seem like one right now.

I'm always angry 24/7, I used to just feel numb(not in a emo way chilll lol) but now I just have this lingering angry feeling in my chest that I want to go away cause it's starting to make me suicidal.
I know I should die, I'm not a good person on the inside but I'm a pussy so(plus a minor so I literally cannot kill myself with a gun like I want to☠️)

Please help me support my girlfriend's mental health,1715858890.0,"First time poster, please give me any advice you can as I really don't know what to do.

I have been with my girlfriend for 6 years and I love her to bits. The problem is that her mental health issues are becoming more severe and more frequent. She suffers with anxiety and ADHD (undiagnosed but has all the classic symptoms), and it is getting to the point where it is really affecting her personal and professional life. At work she really struggles with criticism, and quite often is convinced that people do not like her, and are treating her badly because they don't like her. She has worked at 5 different companies since I have known her, at each she has had a problem with her manager, or the wider management team. Often she spends a lot of time analysing their motives and actions, convinced that flaws in their character (arrogance, misogyny, poor communication, general bad management etc) are the root cause of her being unhappy at work. Two of her last three job changes have been directly to get away from her manager. She also really struggles with the kind of office environment BS that most people face (others not doing what they should, people claiming credit, office politics etc), taking this things far too personally in my opinion.

This all leads not only to her feeling down and anxious, but also chronically tired and lethargic, brain fog and difficulty communicating. I have tried to be as supportive as I can, listening, trying to understand, offering love and support and advice where I can. However it all seems to be getting worse, and I don't know what to do. Every work day is an ordeal for her. I regularly message her through the day to see how she is doing, and talk to her about it every evening. It's always negative, it's always a bad day, someone has always treated her badly. I sympathise, empathise let her know how much I love her and that I'll do anything to help, but I don't think that anything I do is actually helping. 

Counseling didn't really help her, although I have suggested trying again. Doctors just prescribe anti-depressants, which just seem to numb her without any real benefits.

I am quite different from her, which I worry is preventing me helping her, or even perhaps making her worse. I'm generally confident, not too bothered whether people like me in a work setting and the kind of person that just gets on with it. This can make it hard to relate to her problems at times, as she sometimes reaches conclusions which make little sense to me. For example if someone doesn't complete something I need from them, I would think ""they are a poor employee"", whereas she would think ""they deliberately didn't do this because they don't like me or want me to look bad"". I do try to be very sensitive in these situations, but it can be difficult. I don't say this to her, but at times it feels she's creating her own problems. 

Obviously all this impacts our relationship, but I'm not going to go into that. I know if I can help her and make her happy(er) then I will also be happy. 

If anyone has any advice please share. I don't know what more to do and am scared I'm making her worse. Thanks",Equivalent_Visit_447,,False,1ctanxu,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ctanxu/please_help_me_support_my_girlfriends_mental/
"My father died a year ago, and I never shed a tear. Help. ",1715863701.0,"I created this reddit account to let this off my chest and I want to know if I'm okay.

I was born and raised for the first 6 years of my life with my parents, but me and my brothers moved to another country and my dad said that he will catch up to us and travel soon to live with us ""soon""

Soon turned into 19 years... He never came to us, we kept on video-calling him, he kept sending us money (to me and my brothers and mother) my parents aren't separated, still married, but and I quote: ""I have a business here, I cannot just leave everything and come to you"" 

He didn't have a secret life or anything we know him, we are Muslim and so was he, we don't do such stuff, he didn't cheat on my mom and he was working up to his eyeballs. 

I loved him and we all loved him, my mother didn't love him as much because he preferred business over his family where he stayed in one country and we stayed in another... 

He died due to heart related problems, doctors told him to do something and he did other things so it's like he wanted to die and he did, it was his own choice to ignore what the doctors advised him to do..

After he died I felt sad and heartbroken, but I did not shed a single tear, the only thing I was worried about is: who will send us money? I'm a student and I don't have a job...

A year later my family dog died, he was 15 years old and we grew up together... The messed up part is... I cried for 7 days, I would be in the shower, bed, standing, sitting.. I'd just punch the wall or my bed and just cry in anger because I couldn't do anything and I loved my dog, he was like my little brother...

I tried to show emotions, I tried to mourn him I tried and overthinking made me go nuts I don't know what is wrong with me... Why did the death of my pet best friend made me ooze up tears and the death of my father didn't hit me like it did with my pet?
Am I sick? I was sad yes, but didn't I feel as devastated or depressed when I saw my dad's dead body on a video call, and whenever I thought of him..

How can I stop ruminating? ,1715869229.0,"Today I found out I got 19.5/20 on my math quiz. It's not that bad, it's not bad at all actually because our teacher rounds the score so I got a full mark. The 0.5 mistake I made does not affect my grade at all but somehow i'm still stuck with my ruminating thoughts. The fact that I made a mistake doesn't leave my mind and I need a heavy distraction for me to stop thinking about it (watching an interesting movie/ youtube video), scrolling through social media doesn't keep my mind off it, I end up thinking about it again. It's extremely tiring, my teacher announced everyones scores and I couldn't help but feel a mix of embarrassment and regret.

I just want to go on top of a hill and scream my heart out, my chest constantly feels heavy and it feels very derogatory. I am a perfectionist and iv'e realised not every aspect in life is perfect, except for again, academia.

I'm worried I have an ED but nothing I research is right about me,1715878841.0,"It started like 7 months ago. I just lost my whole appetite. Im never hungry and when I am hungry I just can't bring myself to chew and swallow food anymore, and being hungry just feels like a bad stomachs ache. People in my life are starting to worry about me and I really don't want them too because it's not like it's so terribly bad.

Reddit should not allow certain subreddits to exist and here is why,1715889159.0,"I think Reddit should engage in a lot more moderation. There are tons of actually harmful subreddits with toxic concent. Just imagine a 15yo going through puberty to then stumble across /nihilism (btw this subreddit deserves to be deleted imo, it is harmful and people literally tell people to do something to themselves). 

I am convinced that 99.9% of people who identify with pessimism, nihilism or even pessimistic nihilism are mentally ill. Don't roll your eyes, here me out I beg you. 

You are not smarter than all people around you. Everyone around you is not coping with illusions. There is lots of meaning in this life and you can create meaning for yourself and others. It might actually be YOU whos dealing with illuions. 

Nihilism is flawed, it likes to declare it knows what is the ultimate truth - but it doesn't.  
A person with an ill brain, which is chemically imbalanced, that can only experience the negative, certainly is not in the position to decide whats true about human existence and the universe. 
You should also not follow the ideas of a mentally ill person, especially since severe major depression exists.

Happiness and meaning are no illusions, they do exist. Theres lots of it! It is a given fact, meaning can be subjective or even objective. Existence is complex, it cannot be reduced to rational points of views. Emotions are what makes humans special, relationships, love, compassion and empathy cannot be reduced to „illuions“. 

What matters is your perspective. As long as there is no other intelligent race, we must assume or perspective is the best way to go. But like I said, a healthy brain won't focus entirely on the negatives. 

Like Schopenhauer claimed, there only is suffering or the absence of suffering. This is so wrong, I don't even know where to start. 

Then there is … lets just call it cosmic anxiety. The sun will likely die in a fee billion years, the universe will continue to expand, etc. 
This is mostly the number 1 argument for nihilism - here and now do not matter because one day we die and in billions of years our sun might die. 
At this point, it should be clear why this does not come from a mentally healthy state of mind. 
But again, they are so sure that this its true I must say I think thats impressive. It is quite absurd. Our understanding of the universe is arguably at the beginning. Few decades ago we knew way less. Just 100 years ago we got general relativity. A little more than 100 years ago, the first plane was constructed, now we have Eurofighter jets. 

For me it astonishing that people are able to act like we know it at, I guess there is arrogance in depression. 

By the way: for something to be meaningful, it has not to be throught something divine and it can be temporary. These people think if something isn't „forever“, whatever that might be, it is not worth having. 

(Theres also tons of edgelords in these subreddits but lets just ignore them for now).

The problem, at its core, is the following:

People can't understand that their thoughts might be wrong, might be harmful. Yes, your thoughts most likely aren‘t true when you're suffering from mental illness. Thats why therapy and meds are extremly important. I‘m not gonna mention the topic of suicide, what they say in these subreddits is just disgusting and I truely despise it. 

To allow these subreddits to exist is morally wrong - it might push people into a harmful and wrong (yes, it is wrong and I hope more people are able to give into it) philosophy 

Not really a fan at all but Jordan Peterson also has made many great points against nihilism.

!! I labeled this with the suicide-content warning, although I‘m not referring to the subject directly. But it is a major part of nihilism and pessimism, thats why it needs to be labled like that.

"Languishing, an ignored problem?",1715910492.0,"When I read the article, my first thought was that there are probably many who are diagnosed as depressed when they are actually not. And how many with poor mental health are assumed to have a mental illness, which is not the same. There are those who really are depressed and have an illness, which of course is something that should be taken seriously, but it is also also a problem if a problem is not addressed properly:

>""Grace Wade: What is languishing?

>Corey Keyes: Languishing is the absence of well-being. It is when people feel they have nothing positive going on in their lives. No meaning. No mattering. No warm, trusting relationships. No happiness or joy. Yet it doesn’t necessarily mean negative emotions like sadness or fear. People who are languishing almost feel nothing. They describe it as being numb or dead inside. I call languishing the neglected middle child of mental health, since it falls between mental illness and mental well-being.

>How is languishing different to depression?

>Only one symptom overlaps between depression and languishing, and that is a loss of interest in life. The remaining signs of depression are all about sadness or malfunctioning on a daily basis: you sleep too much or too little, eat too much or too little and you might have suicidal thoughts. Depression is defined by negative symptoms, whereas languishing is characterised by the absence of positive ones.

>Some people’s descriptions of depression may fit languishing because it is possible to be depressed and languishing at the same time. That isn’t to say they are the same thing.

>How can someone be languishing and depressed at the same time?

>My research has shown that mental wellness actually exists on two dimensions: mental illness and mental health. People can have no mental illness and poor mental health – in other words, they are languishing yet don’t have a mental health condition. Or they can have a mental illness and high mental health.""

The article was written as a response to the covid-19 lockdowns, when people were physically isolated. But many live in an invisible prison on a daily basis due to a situation in life, which is often related to baggage from the past. Which is why it is important not to confuse if with depression.

I go to a pretty competitive but small highschool with a grade total of above 75 kids that come from all over the region. it’s an academically focused school so everyone is really the smartest from their respective regions. so naturally, clubs, extracurriculars and even sucking up to teacher for recs is smt that students in our school do. i am on council this year for a club in our school, one that’s known to be one of the biggest in our pretty small school encompassing nearly everybody in our school. i don’t want to go too much into or i’m going to start crying all over again but king story short, my then best friend and I had a falling out and it’s not been the same. it was over something so trivial now that i think abt it but ig then it really wasn’t. it was an opportunity to go to states for the club i was in and essentially we both tried and i got it and she believed the circumstances were in my favor however, i just was presented with an opportunity that i took. and before u get back at me, when i tell u literally ANYONE in my position even she said she was wud have taken the opportunity if she was in my place but she just quickly distanced herself. i was devested and ig then i really realized how close i was to her. she was the close connection to me and since my school was small, we were divided into groups of 25 that’s we wud have all our classes with and in my class that only “clique” u cud say i was a part of was with my then best friend. it’s crazy to think that i was happy at one point. this all happened i wanna say 4 months ago but it’s rlly taken a toll on me. ig the most disheartening thing was that i have nobody anymore and everyone had their friend groups and when i tell u it’s too late to join another grp per se it just doesn’t work out. like today in gym we had to make groups of 4 and evry dog got into a group except me and i srsly wanted to cry and i did end up joining a group but all i was thinking is that this sucks and like everyone was staring at me without a group and i was literally on the verge of tears. not to mention that my academics life also has dropped significantly i went from being an A+/A student to now b and c grades I was have passed out if it was a few months before. i’ve lost all motavation and i can’t track to anyone and i know this isn’t like end of the world like but i just realized i have no one anymore. today after gym i had to work on a project with my then best friend and she invited me to watch a show with her, a show we watched when we were friends and they had realized a new season just today actually and while watching it with her i realized how much i missed her and i know it can’t be the same anymore but i just don’t like life anymore and i don’t know how to keep going. i know i will but how i’m not sure how.

Do I deserve to die at a young age? ,1715926730.0,"I'll try to sum up everything here, but I'm leaning towards ""yes"", than anything. This could also be a sign of depression, but I don't want to use that word since I don't consider myself as being that. 


Anyways, here we go: 


**1**. My father (42M) currently owes anywhere between $25k - $30k in back child support, and it accumulated after him and my mother (47F) separated when I was a toddler. 


**2**. He was not active at all in my upbringing, and he is selfish. In August of last year, he whined to me about being depressed too much, and that he was seeing a therapist to better himself. Then the **next** month, he tried to pressure my mother to take him off of paying child support, even after he still owes money. 


**3**. My mother holds resentment towards him, and also me for the whole situation. In October 2022, she got drunk at my uncle's birthday dinner, and told him and his fiancé, whom she just met at that dinner, about an argument me and her had four months prior that involved me not liking her manipulative, and a liar of a best friend who was staying with us at the time. Right in front of me! I had to get up from the table, and go down to the basement to basically cry and let out my emotions. 


**4**. The last five years has really shown me a lot about myself, and my situation. When I was a teenager, I had really horrible attitudes towards my mother (which she says I got from my ""father"", and she had to bring in her best friend who I mentioned earlier to straighten me out, and make me tougher. They called it ""boot camp"". It was a rough process, and I could see a bit of a difference, mainly with the attitudes stopping. But overall, I still feel like a weak coward lol. And I am a coward, since I had attitudes towards my mother, who worked her ass off homeschooling me throughout the entirety of elementary school, and worked night-shift jobs. I'm a piece of shit. 


**5**. My mother *only* married my father because she was pregnant with me. After what will be 21 years later in December this year, him and her are still married. She's sent him divorce papers to sign before, but he wouldn't sign them. I don't know what the process is to get a divorce, but I always that both parties had to consent to get it. 




With all of that being said, I think I do deserve to die at a young age, but I'm just making this post to see if I'm the only one who feels this way. I mean, in all honesty I **did** mess up my mother's life, as another person online told me lol.


I don't have any friends, or any outlet in real life, and I don't think I deserve any. I do deserve to die, and that's it. 


I do think I deserve to die at the age I am right now too. I don't deserve to live at all. I'm not a good person. I've been a piece of shit ever since I was conceived, messing up people's lives.

Having family, friends, a support system to help you through the hard times, yet sleep in a bed which is ice cold, cuddling into your pillow like you're sleeping on the chest of an imaginary lover. You dreams are either haunting threats of dying alone or taunting memories of partners come and gone. The loneliness is an elephant baring down on your chest, heart racing and breath caught in your lungs. All you want to do is lay in bed and cry to songs and ballads of heartbreak and tragedy. But your friends care, right? And your mother loves you more than life. That's all that matters, all that's supposed to matter. Desiring a lover when your mind is already so fragile is selfish. That's what you keep telling yourself. You're just working on yourself, you're fixing yourself up so your future partner has the best version of you that you can offer. If you desire children, you wonder whether, if push comes to shove, you could take care of a child on your own.

Dealing with abandonment issues.,1715929544.0,"I’m going through a difficult time. I (42F) just met my bio dad four years ago, and we have a fairly good, if not super close, relationship. We have so much in common, and we have always understood each other quite intuitively. I think he doesn’t communicate with his wife about our conversations, though. Understandable, since we are still getting to know each other, and his wife seems jealous because she says I am his “new plaything”.

I am so desperate to spend time with him and so when I made plans with him, I was devastated when he cancelled due to his wife making other plans. I don’t think he even told his wife I wanted to meet up. We live 8 hours away from each other, so it’s not like I can just run over and see him any time I want. This wasn’t a surprise visit. I told him about it and asked if he’d like to get together a month ago. Confirmed plans last week. Only to have the carpet pulled out from beneath my feet. 

Why didn’t he say something when we were making our plans? I am so afraid of rejection I kept saying ‘if you’re ok with hanging out let’s get together.’ He never said no, but now there’s other plans—made by his wife. She is making him be there. 

So my dad couldn’t tell me no I can’t make it, but he couldn’t tell his wife no, I need to see my daughter. Aside from this incident and another similar occurrence, we have a good relationship, and I’m lucky to have him in my life. I’m just so upset he didn’t prioritize me.

My sisters mental illnesses is making me sick,1715930247.0,"My sister has always been very needy growing up. My parents really sheltered her and removed every obstacle form in front of her. In high shcool she began isolating herself and cutting off any friendship she had. There were a lot of red flags that her mental health wasn’t great as we were growing up but my parents ignored them- honestly there were a lot of things that my parents ignored until her mental health got so bad that they physically couldn’t ignore it (she would stay frozen on our dining chair and not move for hours). I spent a lot of time blaming them but I now see there’s no point in pointing blame. 

She was diagnosed with OCD and got medication for it- she spent a few years at home dealing with the OCD and then Covid hit and she didn’t leave the house for 3 years- literally. She has self diagnosed herself with a lot of things (BPD, borderline personality disorder etc) but honestly I feel like every healthy person would struggle with their mental health if they never left their room and had no purpose in life. She’s turned really bitter and blames my parents for where she is in life and her mental health (I can see where she’s coming from in come areas but at this point there’s no point in blaming people- she needs to work on fixing her life) she’s 27 and has threatened suicide more than once. At this point none of us know what to do. I find myself thinking about the situation with her almost every day- whenever I have a free moment that’s where my mind wonders. I wonder how she will fare in the world in 10 or 20 years when it’s no acceptable for my parents to do everything for her. My parents are getting old and I see the toll this has taken on them - the last thing I want to do is tell them how much this has been affecting me because I know they don’t have the mental capacity for it. I worry that she’s going to hurt or k*ll herself one day and there’s nothing I can do- it’s like watching someone slowly die in front of your eyes. No one knows what to do and I feel so helpless. I’m 25 and not thinking about kids yet but sometimes I wonder if I would ever want kids because I see how miserable my parents are now and they gave their lives up to raise us as best as they could.

My dad died April 14th 2024,1715930638.0,"My dad passed away April 14th 2024. He wasn’t always the greatest man or even the most truthful. It feels like my entire family hated him before he died except me and my mom. After fighting cancer for 6 months, he got an infection and died. It wasn’t the cancer that took him out, it was the infection caused by the hospital. We didn’t have enough money to pay for a funeral so we got a cremation. I feel like when he did die, everyone cared for about two weeks. They were all compassionate and caring. But when those two weeks were over, it went right back to normal. Everyone started treating me how they used to before and everyone forgot about it. School just piled work up and didn’t care. I asked the councilor and he told me it’s easy work just do it. But I mentally cannot, I don’t even care if I get held back or anything. I just want to be in the hospital room again playing Xbox together for eternity. Or in a hotel room watching grown up’s 2 laughing our asses off. But that’s impossible so whatever. I was supposed to visit him before he died, The night he died. But I decided to take a nap and so did he. My last text to him was “Dad don't be mad but can I come another day I can't stop sleeping I'm so tired” he didn’t even get to read it because they rushed him into the ICU at around 3 AM. My uncle rushed over to him and told us his last moments he said he loved us and held his hand before blood shot up his breathing tube and he died. My mom woke up and had the text from my uncle. She came upstairs to tell us and my sister didn’t care but I just sat there processing it, thinking, reflecting. I gave my mom a hug and didn’t think about it. I was on TikTok later that day and saw something about a girl in college calling her dad to tell him she loves him. I thought in that moment, I’ll never be able to call my dad and tell him I love him ever again. I went outside to see my mom and she was talking to my sister through her bedroom window. I stood there waiting trying not to cry. Then they were done and my mom hugged me. And just like that it all came out. I couldn’t stop crying for an hour straight. I’m not a crier at all. She offered to bring me somewhere to get out of my house to soak it all up so we went somewhere else. I came back with a somewhat good memory of that day. But the next week was grueling. My sister only really cared for the week she got to say home from school. Sure that was nice but I didn’t heal after. I didn’t tell anyone at school to make sure no one made fun of it because I know how people are. But now, nobody even cares. My mom and me were up late one night crying together about him. And I keep getting stuff that reminds me of him, jackets, shirts, beanies, shoes and other stuff. I don’t even want the money, I’d feel guilty using it, I might donate it or use it for college. But honestly who cares what I do with it. No one really seems to care. 

Everyone’s saying I should be depressed which I think in a way I am. But I’m not gonna start acting different. I can’t say sucide hasn’t crossed my mind but I’m not gonna do it.

Feelings of depersonalization AFTER quitting weed?,1715937631.0,"TW: mentions of substance abuse and suicidal thoughts.

Hey everyone,

I was a heavy user of marijuana for a little more than three years. I began using it every single day almost immediately after trying it for the first time when I was 19. I also have struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation since I was 15 years old (I just turned 23).

Recently, I decided to kick the weed habit entirely. I’ve taken a few breaks before, but this is my first time trying to cut it out for good. It’s been five days.

I’m not sure if this is the right word, but I feel like I’m depersonalizing. I experienced that sometimes while high, but never while sober. Tonight I was lying in bed and suddenly began feeling disconnected from memories from before I began smoking, and also from the period when I was smoking.

I feel like I’ve changed so much as a person in the last three years and now I can barely recognize myself. Like I spent these years on another planet and now I’ve come back to something totally different. I’ve dropped out of school, lost contact with so many friends, gotten more distant from my family, and all I can think of is that the person I thought I was would never have done these things. Even the new hobbies/interests I picked up during my addiction (which I DO enjoy) suddenly feel strange to me. The jobs, relationships, living situations, etc that I was in while addicted almost feel like they never happened. I feel so much shame and disconnect and confusion, and I’m afraid that I’ve lost myself.

Is this a common experience when quitting? Does it get better? What can I do? I don’t know where to start with rebuilding myself.",christisanders1,,False,1cu0wm3,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cu0wm3/feelings_of_depersonalization_after_quitting_weed/

How to work on social skills?,1715935438.0,"23M

I’m awkward a lot of the time. I really try to be more social and connect with friends as well as strangers but it’s just so dry and awkward. I spend already a lot of my time around people since it’s required for my work and studies so I get a lot of social “practice” and I have been improving a lot, but still I struggle. 

Last night I went clubbing with a bunch of friends which I usually don’t do. It was fun at first, having the usual conversations and having a bit of fun, but when it came to dancing to music that isn’t my taste I was just there trying to act like I was having fun while all my friends were actually having fun. At one point I lost my ability to have the fun conversations I usually have, which was not because of the alcohol but just because I started to feel alone and isolated even though I was around people. 

I tend connect quite easily at first, but then some hours into the night I feel like I lose that connection. Sometimes I solve this by ending the night early while the rest of the group enjoys the rest of the long night. 

Clubbing music is really really bad though in my opinion, even while drunk. I’m more into raves but there’s not always a rave happening around here, only occasionally. I guess this could explain my struggle too. 

I might be on the spectrum which could explain some things, but I haven’t done any tests. Do you think it’s important to do a test?

I'm falling behind in school, losing friends, and having trouble sleeping. I have medication for my ADHD so I feel like I have no reason to be struggling with turning in my assignments on time and completing simple tasks. I go to a private high school, so I am surrounded by people who are constantly overachieving. At my school it's the standard to succeed and anything below an A is seen as a failure (at least by my peers). My struggle to turn in my assignments has led to bullying from my classmates because it has caused me to do poorly in some of my classes. The bullying has caused me heightened feelings of depression and anxiety. Next week is finals week and I feel like I'm drowning in all the work I need to do to prepare, and still have time to work enough hours at my job to support myself. I need to ask someone for help because I feel unstable and scared. My parents ""don't believe in mental health"" and tell me to suck it up and wait for the real world. My teachers tell me to turn in my work on time because it's ""not that hard to just do your work"". I have no idea what to do and am scared that I'll fail my classes and have to retake them next year. I've been breaking down in tears every night in my room and it's exhausting. I know these probably seem like tiny problems so I'm sorry if this is dumb. I just want someone to let me cry and tell me I'll be ok.

Here's a poem I've written to describe my struggles with mental health,1715933511.0,"Wake up with the feeling. 
What does all this mean?
How has life become this way
Surely it's a dream?

Questioning existence
A dark and lonely place
A tormenting reality
Which everyday I face

Why cant i stop thinking?
Now I'm torn apart
I wish that I could rewind time
And make this never start

How can someone feel this?
Why will this not leave?
Now my mind is taken
There's nothing left to grieve

Every day I'm hurting
My sanity's the cost
It hurts my body deep within 
The life that I have lost 

It feels like a prison cell
It feels like certain death
You pray that when you next lie down
You'll take your final breath

Its my life, my right to choose
You'd take this path if in my shoes
Youd take the choice to end the pain
And never feel this fire again

I wish that i could let you in
To show you all the pain within
I wish that you could feel this way
To feel how i feel, every day

A question now, where i belong
If all goes quiet just know I'm gone
In the morning when i wake 
I pray the lord my soul to take

Overwhelmed by a petty family conflict,1715932542.0,"My parents and older brother are going on a trip, leaving me alone with my younger sister, and we fight a lot. My dad already threatened me earlier that he's gonna kill me if he hears one single thing from us during their trip. 

Yesterday, I decided to go into my sister's room just to be a little silly, make her laugh and stuff, and she instantly screamed at top of her lungs for me to get out, which provoked my dad to scream at me for it, not wanting to listen to my side of the story at all. I tried to explain I wasn't trying to annoy her, but he cut me off, threatening me not to do a single thing to her during the trip or I'm dead, and knowing him, he's gonna lecture me again tomorrow about it as if he didn't twice already. He's not going to hold back. He's gonna come at me without restraint. He always faces small, petty crap with everything he's got and then some. He blows everything out of proportion, and it's mentally draining. 

Both my parents keep insisting I'm always equally at fault, despite how many times I tell them I don't try to provoke her, and my sister barely gets lectured for her behavior to begin with. I told my mom the whole situation is affecting me mentally and emotionally and she didn't say a single word in response. 

I don't know if I'm overreacting because of past unrelated trauma, but I just wanna cry. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I don't want to be here anymore. I tried numbing my emotions completely, but that failed miserably. I don't know what to do. It feels like no one in my life cares at all.

i went through about 2 years of constant abuse due to an “angry man” in the house. he would do alcoholic and drug induced benders where i was trapped in a room with him. one bedroom house, i slept on the couch he would refuse to go into the bedroom and sleep and instead would torment me and make it so i couldn’t sleep. either it would be yelling song lyrics, loud vomiting, breaking dishes, screaming at me, lighting the stove on fire— he was an adult toddler. you get it.


two years of this. 3-4 times a week he’d go in benders that would last for 10–20 hours after his either 8 or 16 hour shifts. god knows how he did it. anyway as previously stated, he would NOT leave the room i slept in, making me unable to sleep. 



i just learned about the concept of sleep debt. how the FUCK would i calculate how much sleep debt im in? does that even matter? ive been perpetually exhausted since i was like 19, maybe even since i was 16. i lack ALL of my energy, mental and physical. physically im doing a tiny bit better since i moved out.

how do i rest better? how do i RELAX? how do i have me time by the way? how do i PROPERLY RELAX, and also how do i make up for YEARS of inability to sleep? 


god im so stressed. please someone with actual advice on how to relax help me. nothing helps anymore, i just wake up exhausted mentally and unable to sleep more without making myself sick physically.

My anger problem and my sister's mental illness,1715931499.0,"I have an older sister who has thought OCD and major depression. This was triggered after our dad died 14 years ago. She is on medication and gets on and off therapy. She has no friends and me and my mom are the only people in her life that hangs out with her. She has been through a lot of fucked up situations in her life and I am not going to go into details regarding them with respect to her privacy, but just know that these situations are enough to give her trauma and make her mental illnesses worse. 

My mother and I try our best to support our sister. We try to do anything that would make her happy, listen to her problems, and just be there for her whenever she needs us. My sister behaves extremely bad with my mother whenever my sister gets really angry, for example, she gets physical with my mother sometimes and verbally abuses her and blames her for everything that went wrong with my sister's life. She genuinely believes our mom is the reason why she has ocd, depression and went through a lot of traumatic experiences. My mom is extremely patient when my sister is being like this with her and tolerates everything that my sister does to my mom.

Another issue is that, I have an anger problem. I never went to the doctor to get tested because it took me a long time to accept this about myself. But i am not able to control my anger. When I get really angry, I feel like i have to do something or say something to the person who made me angry even if I am aware that it will make the situation worse. So, everytime my sister is physically or verbally hurting my mom, I get involved. I swear at my sister or if she's being physical with my mom, i try to hit my sister. My mom always tells me to not get involved when my sister is being like this, but when I see her hurting my mom, I can't stop myself from getting involved. And I can't even lock myseld up in a room when something like this happens cuz i worry what if my sister hurts my mom too much, what if my mom gets hurt rlly badly. 

Everytime i swear at my sister, after a while, i regret everything i'd done. Because i know she's just angry at my mom and she feels deeply wronged when she gets angry and just like me, she feels like doing something. I know when i get involved i am just making the situation worse for my mom because my sister becomes more aggressive with my mom when i get involved. I don't know what to do when this happens. It makes me even angrier at my sister when i see that she does not regret the things she does to our mom. I keep thinking my mom's gonna have to live her whole life like this until she dies.

If I try to fight back then I am the bad guy, I am the problem.

It is the darkness inside of me, the monster.

But it's OCD, right? That's what all the specialists say, but it just sounds like all my trauma? And that would mean that ""the dark"" is dissociation.

I deleted this post originally, it was a bit of a pain to get most of the text back; couldn't get all of it though.

But im so tired of keeping this inside of me, and I don't want to talk about it because if it's OCD then I'm not supposed because it makes it worse. I'm having a lot of fun if you can't tell.

Or is it tactile defensiveness? Is it autism? Is it tourettes syndrome? Hm? I don't fucking know. Unless psilocybin can cure fucking neurological disorders I don't see how it can by either of those three. But apparently I was born with them.

I'm so worried about what other people will think, say or how they will respond to this.

I'm not that great at it—I know the basics, understand the moves, and have fairly good tactics. I go to chess.com to play rapid games against random people. Winning or losing doesn't usually matter to me. However, I always lose when I play against my boyfriend. It bothers me a lot. I understand why: I make careless moves and sometimes blunder. But losing these games to my boyfriend hurts significantly. It makes me feel dumb. I've never been so shitty towards myself as I am during a chess game against him. I can't help but call myself dumb and stupid for making those moves. He doesn't gloat about his wins either. He praises the moves I make and advises me on what I could've done better, but I still can't help feeling upset with myself. My boyfriend is the smartest man I know. He's better than me at coding, calculus, and just about everything that requires significant brain power. I admire him immensely for all his accomplishments. Yet, I can't shake the feeling that he's dating someone stupid. I know he doesn't see me that way, but I do, and I can't get rid of that thought. He's unaware of these feelings. I came here to ask if these feelings are normal. I want to work on myself because having mental breakdowns, crying every single day, over feeling like a failure over something as trivial as a fun chess game is taking a significant toll on me. Even crying over my grades when I compare mine to his is a problem. It’s probably me being insecure about myself. I just don’t understand why it hurts so much to the point where I cry for hours.

Anyway it occurred to me that this is the only time I’ve been outside of state that doesn’t border Ohio since I graduated high school ten years ago. It’s been ten years and this trip is the only substantial thing I’ve done with my life in that time. It been ten years and I’m still as scared and lost as I was when I first graduated. In fact. I’m in an even worse position since the cost of living has become so much worse. I’m still financially dependent on my parents, despite working full time I still rely on them more than I want too, and I have no great path towards financial independence, and I’m all too aware my parents won’t be around forever and then I’ll be completely alone and probably homeless, at which point I really don’t think I’ll have the motivation to hold on, in other words if the next ten years is like this, I’m just gonna call it right there and end it all, I don’t want to but I’m worried that financially I’ll be forced into it. Ten years and I still have a nothing job that I could have worked in High School, still have never been in a real relationship, and really have just spent a decade trying get my mental health under control and really have only managed to put a band-aid over it while not making life any less overwhelming. I guess it’s a little better, in that I’m largely depressed over things outside of my control overwhelming me instead of hating myself, but still.

Not sure what I can even do to improve things, it’ll be nice to get settled in somewhere I intend to stay for a while, it’ll make investing in relationships more doable, though I’m not really sure how to start dating, as far as I know nobody has ever been interested in dating me and apps have been a fruitless effort.

Career wise I’m equally lost as pursuing education never actually translated into a job, and now it’s kinda too late to go back to school, at least full time. So idk, I’m completely lost and scared to death.

I live in Germany. I have been diagnosed with a moderate major depressive disorder for 3 years now and likely additionally have some of the following: ADHD, social anxiety, OCD, insomnia...  
  
But mainly,  I almost definitely struggle with autism, BPD, or both. I have read some studies and a literature review. Unfortunately, there is little research on the differences and potentially comorbidity, if it even exists.  
  
I have had different licensed professionals express, with relatively strong confidence, that I have one and not the other - both ways.  
  
I am now searching for an institution or professional that, while diagnoses are obviously separate, considers the alternative option and, tho likely not officially, can provide more details on whether my diagnosis is mainly based on shared, or separate symptoms.  
  
I haven't found any institution nor professional that both considers the two illnesses and is officially recognized. Does anyone know where or how I could find that?

My mental health is being ruined day by day and I want to kms,1715883719.0,"I '16F' am in senior year of highschool. I've been depressed for years and was finally diagnosed with depression anxiety and insomnia a month ago. I just want to go somewhere without anyone knowing

 My relationship with the people in school is terrible I'm not sure where to start but I'll keep it short. For starters this began during my middle school (2019), the boys mostly flirt or have a crush on me because they think I'm pretty/beautiful but I've always been insecure and all those guys are bad toxic rumour creating people. I do well in my studies and come in the top 3 ranks and I'm not sure but the girls seem to be my friend but always end up holding a grudge against me due to this I hated everybody from school and became completely silent during lockdown(2020-2021) when school reopened(2022) as normal I was extremely anxious would always be scared to read in front of the class etc and during sophomore year(2023-2024) I had no one to talk to even a word I couldn't focus nor concentrate even during exams as day goes on I'm afraid of everything. 

My relationship at home is not good either. me, my mom, my brother, my step dad and my grandpa live in a 3 bedroom house so the space is pretty cramped and I don't have any freedom. I dont like my step dad as he's been toxic during our childhood but nows he's changed a lot but still I don't think I could forgive him. My brother(18M) is always absent, never at home never helps around the house or even takes me to shops for grocery or stationery. My granpa is the egoistic kind you would see who thinks they're right in everything. I pity my mom who has to put up with all this. All three of these males don't help with chores and so only me and my mom have to do them. My mom is the breadwinner of the house and my dad does not work domue to health reasons. In this summer break I've left house like 10 times and I'm going insane. I have no friends to go out or talk to otmr play with I'm very much all alone. 

My brain cannot deal with this even thought its been like this for years.I don't like to eat I don't want to eat I don't love the stuffs I used to nor do I do my creative crafts anymore . I'm lost. I forget everything I'm scared :( . Harming myself give me joy I see blood and for once I feel something which I know is very wrong but otherwise I feel nothing.

my life amounts to nothing and I have no support system,1715881854.0,"I have no highschool diploma, I have no friends, my older brother abuses and intimidates me daily as he has done all my life and my family protects him and I am supposed to let everything slide. The situation I am in and with my mental health I will never be able to amount to anything. I will never have a normal relationship with anyone because I'm so extremely scared of people my heart starts to race when someone tries to talk to me or if I'm in a situation someone might talk to me even to say hello but I so desperately want a connection with someone but my entire body just stops me from doing so. Sometimes I start to feel light headed when I'm surrounded by a lot of people I'll start to dissasociate I'll start to shake and sweat etc. so it's just extremely hard for me. I didn't finish highschool because I got bullied a lot and then eventually my friends started bullying me and I tried to talk to teachers and my parents about it and yet the school decided to do nothing about it and I eventually had to redo my grade and I can't remember exactly how it happened it's all a blur now but I dropped out with my parents support after that I went through multiple therapy programs even ones where you stay at the therapy place (Im not sure what they're called in english it's not my first language) and it's now been 6 almost 7 years since I dropped out but nothing worked. I've gone nowhere. I've tried to study again back in 2022 but after almost finishing my year my mental health became detrimental again and I got panic attacks again so I quit again and now I feel like such a big failure my whole family thinks I'm a failure which I am. Everything I tried to do I failed at. I used to love art but got told by my family that it won't make any money so to stop wasting my time on it. They told me that when I was around 10 years old. I often think about all of the times they corrected my behaviour and how now I have an extreme fear of making mistakes. I used to always believe in karma and that all of the bad stuff that happened to me throughout my childhood and teenage years would eventually balance out in my adulthood and that good things would come my way but I don't think they will. I feel like I was meant to die young and to be that kid who commited suicide that made the news and the example of why you should cherish life. I wish people cared but they don't and they haven't all my life. I wish I had someone that genuienely cared about me and someone who wanted the best for me. I don't think that person exists. I feel like it's only going to go more downhill from here and that the only escape I have is death. I want to die but not experience the pain that comes with it so I just keep on living. If I could press a button and kill myself without any pain I would've pressed it a long time ago. It's like I'm in limbo. Anyway, I just felt the need to shout this out into the world because I need to sort out my thoughts and this helped a little. Throwaway account btw.

I have doubts God is real but I REALLY need Him.,1715881822.0,"I have nightmares, intrusive thoughts, OCD, panic attacks, I’m on four different medications, I really do need more mental professional help, but if there is a God I desperately need Him. I hear music constantly and thoughts/voices telling me to kill people sometimes, disturbing and evil terrifying stuff.

I am 28 years old, and I don’t know if I’ve been going into psychosis, but I have been feeling especially evil attacking me for the last 7 months, absolute Hell specifically the first month.

I hate my dreams, even when they’re not necessarily nightmares, they’re vivid and ridiculous.

I just had one that I don’t know why it made my scream, I literally just opened my mouth and screaming came out in the dream, and then I woke up screaming as loud as I possibly could for real. And then I felt like I had not screamed loud enough and an odd number of times, so I had to do it again as really loud as I could and longer.

I need a higher power, beyond myself, that’s for sure.

I don’t want to end up in a mental institution, and I don’t want to go to Hell.

My mental health is obviously more unpredictable unstable and serious than I take it to be. Some of these dreams that make me scream aren’t even actually scary or terrifying.

I literally just saw my work schedule being a strange odd time, and now was about to call to clarify it, but and I opened my mouth and screaming came out by itself, against my will. Then I screamed for real, waking up.

Fortunately my mouth doesn’t scream on its own just from opening it, but I still have feelings and episodes.

I feel so detached from reality sometimes.

I’m afraid of facing my family after I wake up screaming. They’re worried and concerned, not mad, but it makes me feel worse, I’m embarrassed and ashamed.

I’m so tired, stressed, hate my life, struggle with too much, and my own mind is like Hell, and a prison, inside of me so I can’t escape it.

I’m ashamed but life is demanding more than I feel capable of functioning.

I just bag groceries and push shopping carts mostly as a job. I’m ashamed that that’s the best and most I seem to be able to do at my age too.

I’m exhausted, but terrified I will have more nightmares and wake up screaming again, it’s pure psychological Hell. I rather be dead than deal with this. If God is real, I think I’m going to Hell though, I am definitely a sinner, who deserves punishment, which I guess is eternal damnation according to the Bible, even though that seems cruel, unfair, and unjust.

For the longest time I wasn’t simply an unbeliever, but pretty much ANTI-GOD. I thought He made me just to watch me suffer, so I cursed Him and defied Him. Why would He forgive me? I figured that’s why all this was/is happening.

I don’t know if the beings I see are actually demonic spirits or my subconscious or what, but I have brain tingling and needles stabbing me in the brain sometimes too, it feels like that, and confusion and loss of balance. Psychiatrist just gave me more pills (for nightmares, helped a lot but I guess nothing is 100% forever) and said an MRI would be too expensive for me.

I can’t even physically rest as I need, and mentally definitely not.

I’m aware of too many little things and details, and they’re ruining my life even more.

I gave into the OCD more too, bleep it!

I want to die, but I don’t think I’m going to Heaven. I’m afraid I’ll suffer even more, and eternally.

Honestly I’m afraid even with God this won’t completely go away for good, whether it’s because God uses these things to test people, or just can’t or won’t stop everything? I don’t know, but my mind is definitely particularly abnormal.

I’m afraid I’m going to ultimately end up being told that this is all my fault and that it’s all “in my control” and I need to just stop even though I can’t. Look at how police deal with people having mental health (or spiritual?)crisis.

People don’t believe these things, and think it’s all an act or that you can just stop, even in a mental hospital. You just get demanded to stop and tackled and charged more. And if you end up in court you’ll be accused for everything that it’s all your fault as if it was all in your control. As if anyone would CHOOSE to act this way.

I feel other personalities sometimes, I feel evil, terrified, and like I’m not me. When I was 13 I woke up and got up and felt scared and then started BARKING and screaming and swinging my arms around and everything was blurry, and it stopped after I called out to God and begged for Him to make it stop. I should take that more as evidence of God’s existence, but I still have doubts and lack of faith.

I can’t always tell what’s real or not, especially with such convincing dreams, I can’t remember if something was a dream or real, and reality just feels, different sometimes. 7 months ago when this particular severity suddenly started, the first month was excruciating derealization and depersonalization, and terror and paranoia……

I feel like this will escalate to a point where I completely go insane and cannot control my actions in real life.

Should I Admit Myself to Hospital Again?,1715891754.0,"It’s been just over a year since I’ve gotten out of the hospital for psychiatric care and I had been going amazing, a couple hiccups but otherwise it’s been good.

Mental exhaustion and depression from life,1715895167.0,"Hi everyone, I've never really written about personal things publicly on the internet before, but I really don't know where else to turn. I'm feeling incredibly lost in my life right now. I've been confused for a while, I don't have many friends, and the ones I do have, I don't feel like I really have anymore. I'm 21 years old, from Slovakia, and I'm studying at university. I always wanted to go to university, I was looking forward to it, but I've realized it's not what I imagined. I'm not enjoying it at all; classes are boring, I don't want to be there, I'm not interested in what I'm learning. Honestly, I want to leave, but I can't because of my parents; they don't even want to hear about it. I had a boyfriend, it was complicated, and we broke up because I cheated on him. I was talking to another guy, which he didn't allow. (This topic is really complicated to explain, so I'll just say that what I did was really awful, and I shouldn't have done it. Also, I want to mention that I wasn't completely satisfied with our relationship, and I had been considering breaking up. He found out himself, and we broke up, even though I feel bad about it, but the breakup didn't affect me much - I was more upset that he was sad and suffering. - We were together for almost 5 years, but it wasn't the same from my side, and it really affected him). But that's not the main reason I'm writing. What surprised me more was the reaction of our mutual friends. He decided to message them on Discord, saying he was leaving the server because I cheated on him. I was fine with that, but they started asking and messaging me to confirm if it was true. Of course, I didn't want to deal with it, as I believe private matters should remain private. Then I got banned, and when I contacted a friend who owned the server, I was told I got banned because they didn't want to deal with or hear about the breakup stuff. I understand that and immediately assured him that I didn't even plan to do anything like that. Then he said we couldn't talk anymore - without a proper reason why. When I continued messaging him, I found out he banned me from our private conversations too, so I asked another friend to just pass on a message. He didn't respond, so I think he banned me too. And almost everyone left our common Instagram group. I replied to another message, asking what's going on, and when I asked him why he behaved like the others, I got the response, and I quote: ""If I acted like them, you would've banned me a long time ago xD."" At that moment, I realized I don't have any friends anymore; everyone turned their backs on me because of something that doesn't really concern them. It saddens me deeply because just a few weeks ago, I told them I love them and that I finally feel like I have friends. But apparently, they weren't really friends. I don't know if they were just with me because of my ex, or if it's because of what happened between us. But I didn't expect it to end like this between us. Sorry, it's so long. I don't know what to do now. I'm the kind of person who's afraid of being alone, not just in relationships but also with friends. I've never had friends, and I don't think I'll have any now. It's very hard for me to meet new people. I'm alone, and I feel like everything I touch, I ruin. I'm not successful in life, in any aspect. I feel like just giving up and not being here anymore, but I'm afraid to do it.I really don't know what to do; friends meant a lot to me. I feel very down, and I can't imagine going through the whole summer alone. Whether physically or online, without friends. I feel like I can't handle it, and I'll go crazy. I'm extremely scared of that. And when I realize that no matter how exams at university turn out, I'll have to go back there again in September, it's terrible. On the other hand, when I think about doing something else instead (which won't happen because of my parents), it's also terrible. I don't even know what I need in life to truly feel inner happiness. I always mess everything up. I'm super depressed about it. But if someone has read this far, I'd appreciate any feedback or maybe a message if someone could advise me or talk to me if they're going through something similar and feeling devastated. Thank you.

"Mom showing signs of delusions, not sure how to approach her. ",1715906998.0,"My mother is 55 and just got out of a bad relationship with her ex of 2 years. Ex was a meth user and I don’t know if she ever used with him but according to my sister she did exhibit signs of being high off meth once in January. We believe that this may have caused something in her brain to cause her behavior now. 

She spends a lot of her time watching YouTube tarot videos and believes them and also ties them to any event that has happened in her life. She goes to “brujas” or witches in Mexico to see what they tell her and she truly believes these things. She says that my grandma (her mother) feeds her witchcraft in her food and that 2 of my cousins are messing around with her ex with no proof of this. Mom told sister that she follows cars cause she KNOWS her ex is in the cars that she follows because he “phone tells her” but she opens her maps and I’m not sure if she thinks her own current location on the map is him. My brother told her other wise but refuses to believe it. This caused the cops to show up at her house asking why she was following someone in the car. Mom said she was looking for “x person” and cop said “x person is not in that car, the name of the person in that car is not that”. Cop left and mom told my brother that she knows it was him in the car and she dismissed the cop. She asked my brother just recently if I’ve given him a lightbulb recently because she thinks I’m doing witchcraft. When my brother asked her why she was saying that she said “that’s what he’s saying (referring to the tarot video on tv)” my brother told her to turn that crap off and it was all nonsense and she said “you don’t understand”. My brother says that my mom mentioned to him “everyone treats me like I’m crazy”. 

There is a lot of other things that I can go on about that she’s been exhibiting in just these past 4 months that I have not seen for myself but that my sister and brother tell me. I have not visited my mom is 3 months because I’ve been very busy, I’ve also haven’t had any communication with her. 

My mother has believed in tarot reading and witches but it’s never been anything like this where it’s causing her problems and obviously feeding into her delusions. She is also doing risky behavior where I’m afraid she’ll get herself hurt or someone else.

"I am not ok, anyone have their own stories? Or relate to mine?",1715837995.0," I've been recently diagnosed with Quiet bpd, and tbh it makes sense. There was always a sense of instability in the air growing up. As well as both physical and emotional abuse.

Sometimes I can enjoy myself, but those moments are short-lived. The endless pain always comes back. To be honest the slightest disturbances in my life right now can make me feel like shutting down and make me just feel like not existing anymore would be better than this. To be honest I've felt somewhat suicidal for a long time, so it's not like I'm going to follow through, especially since I see some big changes in my life ahead. I guess I just wanted some perspective on this platform. Is it pathetic of me to feel like I don't have a goal yet?

"Struggling with mental health, finishing school, and wanting to live",1715833758.0,"Hello everyone,

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Ended up being a very long post. This is my first personal reddit post. I’ll give you the background about myself and then a snapshot of what I am struggling with now. I’m hoping that someone may be able to give insights as to what might be helpful.

I am a female, just turned 26 today. I have struggled with mental health for the better part  of my life- low mood, depression, high social anxiety. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and social anxiety disorder in my very early 20s. Ive been working with my therapist who is also a clinical psychologist and I have also been recently diagnosed with autism. For the most part this had been extremely validating as I do believe the root of my social anxiety is having a hard time with social syntax, cues, understanding interactions, etc. I come from an ethnic background that is highly “traditional”, grew up with strict Christian parents. I while I do identify with Christianity, I have also been struggling with my sexuality so you can probably imagine why that is difficult. I struggle with this because I have no negative thoughts about the queer whatsoever community, however, the fact that I am highly resistant and distressed by the thought of me being not straight makes me feel as though I am a bad person/ have poor insight to an internal bias maybe. Along with being autistic, growing up as the only non-White person in my school, and feeling as though I never fit in, I feel this way about going to church and now my faith is something I struggle with because of the sexuality issue.

Now, I’ve always been described as ‘Type A- again, I think this may actually be the preference for routine and being rigidness in the way I perform as an autistic person. Heres the funny part- I am a registered nurse who works in psychiatry and currently in school for my Masters in nursing so you would think I have the answers to these problems loll. But I have always struggled with insight into why I myself struggle. Also, I think I like working in mental health because human patterns of behaviour don’t come naturally to me. Anyways, my other current distressing problem is that after 2 years of extremely hard work, with no breaks, working almost full-time hours at times, Im almost done this Masters degree but I’m getting so so burnt out that I don’t think I can do it. I only have 9 weeks left of a clinical placement. Just to top it off, my clinical preceptor is making my life a living hell- not providing thorough orientation, made me present at clinical rounds without preparation me, had me complete assessments and update the psychiatry team. I made a fool of myself because truly I wasn’t expecting to do this on day 1. She is wanting me to do more than my school is even suggesting- taking on the full clinical nurse specialist case load by week 7. She told me I needed to work on time management, mind you this is halfway through day 2 of her showing me how to do nothing. With the social anxiety, I have a hard time sticking up for myself and in general, its really frustrating when, as a student, I verbalize a need for support and it’s ignored. I also have a project that I am to be working on for the placement (policy implementation or education related) and she is wanting me to do an inservice presentation for several of the units. With how much Ive been struggling, limited time (9 weeks left), and extreme social anxiety, I just cant find myself to do that. I spoke with my school and I briefly talked about options I have. I feel ridiculous taking a 1 year leave (my next opportunity to finish clinical would be spring 2025) when I have a little over 2 months left but I’m crying everyday, having meltdowns, very overwhelmed, and with everything going feeling suicidal. I feel very embarrassed to tell everyone, especially family and friends who prematurely celebrated, that I won’t be graduating. 

Had anyone else had a similar experience with their mental health or schooling? Any thoughts or suggestions on how to handle this? I just need some relief so badly but I want to finish school. Any contributions would be much appreciated, thank you so much.",iobi98,,False,1ct4p8h,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ct4p8h/struggling_with_mental_health_finishing_school/
My over/critical thinking is driving me into an intense depression. ,1715834543.0,"I dont really know what to write here, or even why i'm writing here.  
just maybe for conversation with people that could possibly be able to level with me, and actually read/listen to what im saying instead of calling me crazy.   
im a severe alcoholic, and have been clean for almost two years from alcohol.  
life has seemingly went extremely downhill for me, and not because my environment, or any losses, or anything like that. But purely because my enjoyment of life has hit absolute rock bottom.  
which is confusing to me because i am extremely passionate about so many things. (which i believe is the main cause for my depression, my passion, which i will explain.)  
I've become a real recluse, a nobody, and a willing but also unwilling outcast.

i have my babies, which i love dearly.  
i have my girlfriend of 10+ years who i love dearly.  
I believe i have always been like this, but i have hit the gas pedal recently on my views of the world.  
there are so many tiny little details that build up a situation like this, as im sure many of you here will understand.  
i've always been depressed since a child/teenager, over thinking every single tiny little detail. when i was younger as a child it was things like: why do they look at me that way? why do they seem to carry conversation better than me? why do they get along and have a friendship like i've never had? ect.  
but as ive gotten older (almost 30) my causes of depression have matured and strengthened themselves. 

i have extreme views on religion, i honestly have never meant to insult or offend anyone, but it is all fake.  
i dont believe religion is fake, i know its fake.   
with my understanding of the world, and the logic that i use, i would like to say that i have a dead accurate bullshit radar.  
(please do not let me offend you, i am just truly explaining what is happening with me and my thought process.)  
all i have to say is that i know dead people are worm food or ash. nothing more. science tells us that, and science is the only ""belief"" that strives to find the actual truth, therefore being the only logical ""belief"". 

Everyone around me tells me im crazy and outcast me, i can truly never have a friend for the rest of my life, my views wont allow it, and i wish this wasnt the case. (not just because religious beliefs, but because of MANY more personality traits i think are repulsive to people.)

my young kids tell me things like ""theres a man in the sky"" and ""people float to the sky when they die""  
and ""we all go to heaven."" and ""adam and eve"" ect.  
they are being told these things by people and family when they visit.  
I tell my children the truth and that none of it is true, and they have gotten very sad, and even cried just from me telling them the truth, and choosing to believe others. (people that i consider to be actually crazy)  
  
telling them the bible says things like Noah was 900 years old and a drunk when he built the ark, and i tell them that science tells us thats impossible, but they tell me that they want to believe it. and then they go and visit family again and tell them all the ""horrible"" stuff ive been teaching them, when really... ive just been teaching them about reality.

This causes people to look down on me, and make me feel like shit that im ""brainwashing my kids"" when im not brainwashing anyone of anything. The religious stuff they are being taught by others is actual brainwash.  
like burning in hell if you dont worship something there is absolutely no proof of even existing.  
i am their father, and i consider that brainwash. but even my children are approaching me differently because of it. (we've always had really great relationships, and still do, i love my babies.)

all of this causes me to feel like everyone around me is brainless robots pulling the strings of my life. i almost feel like Arnold in the movie Total Recall. like everyone is purposely trying to push me off an edge, like they are all hive mind executing a plan to destroy my peace.  
I am so passionate about this because, in my view, my positions on this stuff are rock solid and backed by facts and science, not just the religious stuff im speaking about, pretty much everything.  
i feel like EVERYONE around me goes through life so mindlessly using words without meaning, having false beliefs. for example my girlfriend claims to be christian when she doesnt believe in probably 75% of writings in the bible. i tell her then she isnt a christian, and if christianity was real, that she would go to hell anyway because she not a complete believer. and she says that she can believe whatever she wants (which she can)  
but i tell her, i beg her, to at least use logic behind her beliefs instead of just believing things that literally make no sense if you used half a brain cell, believing just because its the popular/normal thing to say, without actually using any logic to find a solid belief to lean on. 

it is completely breaking me down, me being so passionate about critical thinking, its costed me alot of relationships, and caused alot of hard days, making me feel completely alone wondering if there's anyone out there that is actually real. (i have literally questioned if I, or they, were even real)  
Everyone seems so fake, fake personalities, fake friendships, and fake beliefs.

Not only on the topic of religion, but me and my girlfriend disagree on literally almost every single thing, and im a piece of shit for my view, but shes not for hers? they're not for theirs? is it only me? they make it seem like i am wrong about everything. it further pushes me to cut off all relationships. and i tell you its a very sad thing to be in love with someone that you hate. i dont activley hate anyone, but my views and passion about things cause me to hate, not anything in specific, but just hate in general.  
i have loads of hate. and it really destroys my energy, my drive, my ambitions, and i let it control me. 

the religious stuff is just recent stuff thats really driving me nuts. its not at all the reason for my mental health problems. i have huge amounts of self hate, and over analyze every single thing in my life, my past, my decisions, my fuck ups, and i put them on a projector and blast them all to the fore front of my mind daily, and i cant stop it. i dont think theres a pill that could fix this, no therapist, no friend, no preacher, no god... nothing could fix this, my brain works well for critical thinking and reasoning, but i think too well causing me to just over analyze everything and drive myself absolutely nuts, in turn causing a host of emotions that i cant control, extreme anger, sadness, and absolutely no forgiveness for me, or anyone else.

nobody really knows the things im struggling with, and talking to someone, im so passonate about everything, i guess i seem too wild to conversate with.  
some times i wonder if im the only one around me that has actual thoughts. everyone is so at peace and happy, and i really think there is nothing but air in their heads, and at the same time im extremely jealous.  
i would NEVER commit suicide, but the thought of it has probably crossed my mind over a million times since around the age 10.  
and that leads me back to over analyzing the reasons my thought process became this way, and i just cant pin point it. i have had spurts of mindlessness and happiness, but they never last long.  


Like i said, i dont even know why im here, but i am so close to relapsing, and going and buying some alcohol. its the only time i feel happy. i can remember the last time i was truly happy in the moment, and it was when i was drinking.  
but at the same time the drinking drastically causes my mental health to decline, but at least i have some sort of relief sometimes. as of right now, there is no relief.   
nothing gets me out of this rut. i exercise everyday, and have for years. im in good shape, im strong, i consider myself a decent looking human being, and i dont really value any of it at all. I just dont care.  
im constantly just trying to find something to get my mind to stop over thinking, but its impossible.

Unless i go and buy some alcohol. and if i do that, it WILL relieve me. but it will also be a downhill ride lower than ive ever been, because im probably at my lowest currently, and one sip of alcohol and whatever there is left of me that im holding together will surely fall apart.

theres a million more pages i could write but i should probably stop, because im currently thinking about not clicking ""post"". so im just gonna finish here, and to any eyes that read this, thanks for the time, i cannot actually talk to anyone about any of this without being considered an absolute lunatic.

TW: mention of suicide attempt,1715871778.0,"I feel useless and helpless at times because of my life decisions and the fact that I believe I basically ruined my own life.

I dropped out of high school after struggling with it for long due to my mental health. In the time I was studying, I have attempted suicide three times and I ended up at a psychiatric hospital twice (I swear, psychiatric hospitals are some vile places).

I figured that since I was failing school bad already, it would be best to leave the school and prioritize my health, hoping things would get better. Now I am struggling to find a job of any kind, and the jobs I've had have been very taxing both for the body and mind. I've also not been able to keep a job for longer than three months (I either get fired or leave because of the horrible conditions. I regret leaving high school and the worst thing is, I can't bring myself to start studying again.

Mainly because the period of time I was in high school was the worst I've ever felt, and I am scared that if I do return to school, I will feel like that again. Right now, I don't know what to do in my life. I am just hoping a miracle happens, and I somehow land a decent job that I'll be able to stay at long term. 

I know that I should at least go to a psychologist, I am just scared. Most of the psychologists or psychiatrist I went to did not take me seriously.

ive been diagnosed with a plethora of disorders and i dont believe them except maybe bpd. ive been diagnosed with bpd, bipolar, schizoaffective, mdd, gad, and adhd. my problem is that even though i do hallucinate and i have had a lot of delusions in the past, i think its not schizoaffective. the voices in my head have their own personalities and influence my behavior and decisions and help me navigate life. and when i get stressed or uncomfortable they comfort me and take care of me but sometimes they scare me too. and sometimes i feel like im completely different like sometimes i feel like different ages and i feel different abt everything. when this first started, almost 10 years ago, i hallucinated and saw this lady who claimed to be my mother and shes been the main one in my head taking care of me and ""handling"" certain situations for me.

my actual mom thinks i have cptsd which i dont know a lot abt but i do get flashbacks all the time and i guess i dissociate a lot. i especially dissociate more than ever these days and i dont know how to deal with it. especially when im hanging out with someone and i start acting younger and like i cant control it. especially when im being intimate with my partner i cant help but dissociate and i guess i feel younger and i dont even know how to tell him so i dont really plan on telling him. like ive told him how sometimes i dissociate and sometimes i dont feel like myself or in control of my actions and thoughts and how i have voices in my head but i havent told him that when we're intimate i either feel a lot older or a lot younger.

my therapist keeps bringing up the idea that i may be faking for attention but she says thats because i said i dont think there's anything wrong with me but i said that because one of the voices in my head doesnt think theres anything wrong with me. my psychiatrist keeps trying to give me medications but im scared of meds now because one of them gave me a tumor and some of them made me pass out and another one made me gain like 20+ lbs and im tired of taking pills. and now hes gaslighting me into believing i havent taken abilify but i have and i didnt feel any better. at least i dont think i did. i quit all my medication like 2-3+ months ago i think(just abruptly stopped) and i think i feel relatively the same except more stressed but thats because im in college now and im exhausted.

I need to vent a bit,1715911625.0,"for context: I literally just got off a call with an insurance company asking me about things I had no idea about. My dad had discussed changing my car insurance but never told me he was changing it at a specific time when I was working from home. The insurance company was asking me questions which were obviously based on answers that my dad provided online. Answers which I had no idea about. This was fucking pissing me off that dad had done all this behind my back and I went into a call with 0 context, information and no time to mentally prepare. My parents must think I’m joking or exaggerating when I say that I hate phone calls but this actually gave me anxiety. When I had a go at my dad he said “it’s just confirming your information” which isn’t true. They were asking me to make a decision on if I would accept the quote and all the other extras chucked in there which I had no idea about. 

All I was doing was relaying information from my dad who was mouthing answers and writing some down on paper. Surely there’s a fucking option for him to talk on my behalf because I felt so useless. I wasn’t in the right head space for this call and now I’m expected to answer questions that my dad had already answered online (supposedly). My undiagnosed ADHD was going mental as I can only focus on one thing at a time. I was finding it so hard to focus on my dad’s mouthing, writing and on the phone call all at once. My parents hate it when I self-diagnose things and try to laugh it all off “oh you don’t have that”. They are supportive of mental health since I do some community work with it but when it actually comes right down to it, they don’t fully understand it and what my triggers are. They don’t understand the day to day things that happen and they seem to think it’s just depression and suicide. It just made me feel really uncomfortable but of course they don’t understand that because they went through so much worse and turned out totally fine 🙄 they put it down to me being so dramatic but anyone who knows me knows that I am the least dramatic person of all time.

It’s slightly muted out the constant anxiety, but sometimes there’s occasions where I still get a bit depressed or anxious, my boyfriend notices and asks me “what’s wrong?” I tell him I’m feeling a bit anxious and he obviously seems very irritated at the fact that I’m feeling anxious, because I have severe health anxiety and I tell him I’m afraid to get this, get that blah, blah etc, which yes I understand can be very overwhelming for someone to take all at once to understand, but he told me once “well you might as well die then.” Or “it’s not that hard to focus on calming down” Which obviously hurt me a lot, but to shed light my boyfriend is a very good guy, it’s frustrating because he belittles my feelings when he knows I have more of a struggle of dealing with it, but at the same time I don’t want to seem like i’m using him as a therapist..am I overreacting over this?

I feel like im losing control and nothing is real,1715917839.0,"In the past 4 or 5 years my mental health has gone to crap and it's just getting worse and worse. I go through waves of short highs and really long lows and a lot of the time I don't feel real, it's always something in the back of my mind. I could be doing my favorite thing ever and then I start to slowly lose it and within a couple minutes it becomes a major problem and I usually can't continue on with my day, even if I try. Sometimes it can last days or even weeks. It makes me feel like I'm not in control. I often find myself trying to figure out what's real and what's fake.

In order to cope with this I've kinda built my own world in my head. I've taken shows and movies I've watched and they become characters in my world. I've created my own character, like the exact person I want to be but a little different to match whatever world I'm in (I have multiple) but the problem isn't that, it's that I act it all out. It looks like I'm just walking around or doing daily tasks and talking to myself (sometimes the talking is all in my head to not bother others around me) but to me I'm talking to these characters but then I'm also acting out their personalities and their body language (each character is very in depth at this point) and I often get lost in it and forget what I'm doing or forget where I am. I get so lost in this fake world I've created that everything else gets tuned out. I can't really do anything without pretending these characters are there, talking to me and just interacting with the other characters.

I'm not very good at communicating with other people so it's been hard for me to bring it up to my partner but we've talked about it a little and he's been there to help me when I start to lose it but I'm usually alone (long distance) and I'm always too scared to talk to him. I feel like a burden when I do.

Unfortunately, therapy isn't an option at the moment. Insurance won't cover it and I don't have the money for it. Talking to my family also isn't an option, I try to keep my contact with them as minimal as possible due to their beliefs on mental health.

Honestly, I just want to know if this is something that could potentially become a problem. I've replaced my old very unhealthy coping mechanisms with this but I feel like it's making it worse.

I know something is wrong and I feel like people don't listen,1715907278.0,"I have a few grips so I'm going to cut to the chase, and I'm not self-diagnosing I just want to talk about this; I feel like I have BPD. I say this as it's what makes the most sense. I've always felt unreasonably irritable, I do SH often especially when I feel overwhelmed with my negative emotions. When I find someone, I really like hanging with, friends or partners, I will freak out if I FEEL like they're pulling away. Like, leaving voicemails of my crying, sending message after message, saying I can't go on without them in my life etc etc. I don't have stable relationships with friends or family. And I can have extreme mood swings. To me, that sounds like BPD, right? But when I brought it up to my therapist, when I had one, she just said I have relationship depression and with better relationships I will be fine. I will admit I didn't tell her about the SH but when I would bring up the rage, she would just say I was burnt out. I feel like what she told me isn't right. If that was all that's wrong, why aren't I getting better? I tried to make and keep friends. I work out. I journal. I meditate. I do the breath exercises. But it doesn't help. Why doesn't it help? Maybe something is just wrong with me and there is no explanation to it, no cause. My old therapist even said I'm resistant to therapy so maybe I'm just this way and there's no fixing it just managing it. She isn't the only one that doesn't listen either. I've had people offer help, for non-mental stuff, and just never help. Like I'll ask a teacher to help me, and they'll say for sure and then never do it. I'll ask a friend if I can vent, and they'll say yes and then not respond to me. Why does this keep happening? Genuinely, what is wrong with me?

How do I understand the reality of mental health?,1715912647.0,"I have a hard time with accepting “mental health” as legitimate medical reasoning due to my background. For context: I had no one to rely on since I was 14/15 and if I “didn’t feel like it” or was feeling “crushed” it was either figure it out or homelessness, no food, etc… as a result of this prolonged environment I have become desensitized to other’s plights because in my mind no matter how bad “if they actually wanted to they would.” Emotions don’t fix problems but doing something tangible about it might. 

I understand people suffer, but how can I gain back some of my empathy that I’ve lost or see mental health as legitimate and be more mindful and not out of instinct think “suck it up” or “get over it.” I’m not interested in validating feelings but I’m interested in making someone productive again when there are serious risks on the line. I am aware stress leave is not a joke but I recall thinking “I wish I had all that free paid time off work for some issue that has no physical barrier.”

Coping with OCD Predictions and Fear,1715910684.0,"How can someone approach this in a logical manner? Essentially, I've been grappling with an obsession tied to a specific fear for quite some time. I make numerous predictions daily, roughly 3-4 times a day, for about 1-2 years. Most of these predictions never come to fruition, although some have. However, there's one incident that I've been struggling to rationalize and need advice on.

Here's the situation: About one year ago, I was at the park and believed I had touched bird droppings, which triggered a panic attack. Subsequently, my mind made a prediction or bet that if I were to encounter a dead bird, it would confirm a certain fear (""x"") to be true. The next morning, I discovered a dead bird on my patio, and I panicked. Despite it happening over a year ago, I'm still grappling with this event due to my OCD.

Here's the logic I've used against this thought: Firstly, I live on the first floor, surrounded by trees and bushes teeming with wildlife, including numerous birds. Secondly, my roommate initially informed me that they had seen the bird days before and dismissed it as a pinecone, which provided me with some relief as it meant the bird existed there before my bet. However, because I recently got triggered again, I revisited this coincidence in my mind, particularly because it exacerbates my magical thinking. I reached out to my roommate again after a year, and they informed me that the bird had been there 2-3 nights before my prediction because they remember smoking weed on the balcony at night and spotting it.

Despite this reasoning, I'm still struggling with this event, primarily due to the timing of it all. What steps can I take to combat this? Because the fear (""x"") is something I cannot accept as true, as it would render life meaningless.",Afraid_Data_6912,,False,1cttv00,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cttv00/coping_with_ocd_predictions_and_fear/

managing anger? ,1715908245.0,"
I grew up with parents who slammed doors/objects, cabinets and dishes, stomped on the floor, screamed, and were overall aggresive when angry.  Long story short, they didn’t having good coping skills for their anger and it passed down to me.  I’ve tried my best in the recent years to learn better coping techniques for anger like writing down my anger, taking deep breaths and getting away from whatever made me angry, yelling into a pillow, etc.  

But I’m struggling.  I feel the urge to be more aggressive with inanimate objects, like doors, when I get angry.  I don’t do it often at all, I’ve done it maybe once or twice in the last year but I end up feeling so guilty.  I tell myself it’s fine to do when no one’s around, but I did it once when someone in my house made me angry and I regretted it so much.  It’s so hard to feel better when I try other coping techniques.  It feels like I have to be aggressive for it to be truly cathartic, and I’ve been holding in SO much anger in the last year because I’ve been mistreated horribly by so many people.

"Lonely and depressed, it's my fault ",1715907096.0,"It's my fault, I needed to do better but took long to learn. Pity post 

Well, I've always struggled socially, probably due to my messed up family and the anxiety that was instilled in me. The constant moving in my childhood, being dirt poor didn't help. 

Started as a new student in grade 9 ( last grade in that school) after moving Junior high schools, so everyone knew eachother for 2+ years before I camee.

They were nice to me initially, but my anxiety got the best of me, I kept to myself. I ended up being friends with 2 other fuck ups and we just skipped school and did stupid shit. There was another new kid when I started, and he was able to fit in and have a big group of friends. 

Pretty much same fucking story in university, except I got invites to multiple things and just didnt follow up, now I realize it was a sincere invite and people WANT YOU to ask to be involved in shit. I also barley spent time socializing in groups and just got left out. 

Same thing happens at my recent job, except I had health issues and kept to myself ( declined invites to shit to deal with it)  with about 8+ other people of similar age. I tried to reverse it, but by that point I was an outsider and pushed too hard to the point they would lie about their plans not to invite me. Their not bad people,I'm just ""not right"".  Someone else started a year after me, and their involved in so many group chat and activities. 

I fucked up, grown ass adult in my 30's, maybe 2 or 3 friends in this world that I see once in a while. Could of had 20 or 30..... Fuck does this hurt, the kind of hurt that just sticks with you, reminded of it daily.....

And I don't think I'm going to get another shot in my 40's. I got no one to blame but myself, same small missteps and you go from having a great life with many people in it, to a lonely sad life.

Am I a bad person for this addiction? How can I get help and turn away from it,1715905433.0,I’ve realized over time I had taken an interest to gore. Unfortunately what started this was an online friend when I was 12 sending me a video from live leak. At the time it terrified me and made me sick to the stomach but around 13/14 I became more and more intrigued by it. I would go on shock sites that were still up. The main one I would look at is goregrish.com and it got to a point I was told by family I was on a “federal watchlist” not sure if that was true or not but who knows. Then it got to a point when I was just bored I would watch it for fun. Maybe about 3/4 months ago my therapist put restrictions on my phone to block out any violent/adult websites but still I will come on here and look at medical gore and nsfl. At this point I do not feel affected by it (unless it is a child or animal) it doesn’t disturb me or scare me anymore. I am currently 16 and this has been going on for a while now and I don’t know how to stop it. I would love advice or suggestions for help or just asking in general if this is terrible of me. Edit: thank you all for your concern it means a lot. I am in home/in school therapy and also doing a 18 week horse therapy program.

I’m just curious about these things I’ve experienced a while and still don’t understand ,1715904963.0,"Hi, Im Makayla and I’m a 16 y/o and I’ve been trying to figure out why I do these things. So first off when I’m usually stressed, upset, depressed etc. I tend to act very energetic at immature and that’s become all of the time now. Usually people think I’m “annoying” or tell me to be quiet and that hurts when they say it. Personally I think a cause may be childhood trauma and not having a motherly bond and feeling unwanted and not payed attention to. I honestly wish I didn’t act like this but it’s just naturally how I am. The main reason I don’t like it is because others responses wind up hurting me more. Okay one more thing I’ve been a bit worried about is the fact that I usually don’t cry about serious situations much anymore or I’m not great at comforting people anymore. This has been going on the past 6 months I would say and I honestly don’t know why. A lot of times sadness will feel like emptiness.

How to manage emotions about something out of my control,1715900495.0,"I rent a condo in an HOA development.

Though I have no agency in common areas of the development, especially as a tenant here, I wanted to hire an arborist to assess it. I'm a PNW tree enthusiast and I just... care about the tree.

Long story short, I'm pretty sure the HOA has decided to cut it down. They had a landscaper of questionable qualification take a look at it, not an arborist. They further justify the act to help the grass grow, which makes little sense given the orientation of the landscape, but I won't go into it.

Everyone is telling me to let it go and to save my energy to fight another battle. I'm trying to come to terms with it. I care about something I have no control over (stoics would be slapping me in the face).

traumatic experience (idk if i’m being overdramatic),1715900342.0,"not involving me being sa’d or anything of the kind, i’ve never spoken about this outside of small close circles and never had the chance to open up to a therapist about it. i want to know if this even counts as traumatic or if i’m just being wildly dramatic. 

HUGE TW for talk of fictional incest, sa and necrophilia.

it’s a weird case of being exposed to something i definitely shouldn’t have seen or read as a child. i ended up reading a fanfiction (i know lol) of two characters who are brothers, so incest off the bat, and it devolved into beheading, sa, and necrophilia. i was 10. possibly younger but i can’t remember, honestly i didn’t know much of what was happening apart from it made me feel violently ill. i wanted to skip school because i felt guilty, i had read it on my school laptop and got so paranoid about it that they’d find out. i faked vomiting to get out of school. deleted my history. lied to my parents about it. despite this i remember having ‘roleplays’ with myself about it, they weren’t indicative of me i know that - but it still disturbs me. 
it genuinely i think changed my perspective on sex and fucked with me for years. it still does. i don’t know if this is a stupid thing to get so worked up over especially considering people actually go through so much, but it scarred me at least somewhat. it ended up with me going down that edgy pipeline of gore extreme horror and whatnot. mostly to try and desensitise myself. i still consider myself too emotional.

i don’t really know what else to say. does anybody else have similar experiences? has it messed with them? even if fictional, as a child it was something that i really shouldn’t have ever read. internet trauma is something downplayed and i can’t help thinking that it’s just stupid.",nonsensethrowaway_,,False,1ctqgf0,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ctqgf0/traumatic_experience_idk_if_im_being_overdramatic/

No way out (M15),1715899773.0,"I’m in a situation and I don’t know what to do anymore. When I was 10 my family went on a trip to London, when we were there my dad massaged me until it was full blown SA. I didn’t know what to do so I didn’t do anything, I didn’t enjoy it and at that time I didn’t know what sex was. He continued to regularly “play” with me on a daily basis. He did this until I was about 12 and then abruptly stopped. I was so confused. For some reason my brain thought it was a normal occurrence for children to go through that and it just wasn’t talked about. As time went on I slowly started naturally learning about sex and then I realized. It’s not normal. I had been taken advantage of. I told my mom and she went home and said she scolded him. She said he was so scared that he was vomiting and crying. Life just kind of continued and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I felt so bad and sick every day. Fast forward to now (15 year old now) and i fully understand sex and what he did to me. I’ve had multiple evidences appear that make me wonder if my siblings (m14, m7, and f5) are victims too. These evidences include, my 7 year old brother (he was about 5 at the time) did the typical little kid thing of running out of the bathroom nude. Obviously I closed my eyes, my dog ran over to him and I heard what sounded like “suck it” from my little brother before he ran back into the bathroom . I could have very well just have mistaken it but it’s very concerning. And the other evidence is that my father keeps randomly going into my siblings rooms at night and insisting on giving them a shower. I decided to check if he had changed his ways by “asking him about some bumps that had appeared on my parts” (there really was at the time) and he assured me it’s normal. After a day or 2 hr asks if he could “check the bumps again” and as expected he SA’d me again. I also got him to massage my back to see what he’d do but I noticed he was touching himself while doing so. Since I’ve confirmed that he hasn’t changed I stay up almost every night to make sure he doesn’t enter my siblings rooms. I can’t get him arrested because he’s our income and my depresssed mother wouldn’t be able to feed us. If I tell my mom about the evidence she would mostly likely end her life.

"Was told today that I may have Schizoaffective Disorder, I need advice please",1715897368.0,"I (23 F) have been diagnosed with Bipolar, ADHD, and social anxiety for a few years now, starting Sophomore year of college. I never really agreed with the Bipolar diagnosis. I didn't feel like what I had was mania, though I did relate to a cyclical type of depression and periods of higher mood and motivation, not as much with the super fast talking or no sleep. I do get really bad irritability (just in general, but it gets unmanageable when I'm depressed). I'm also very prone to isolation, impulsivity, and rumination, and have avoidant tendencies. Since the start of the year, I've had 3 social outings that lasted a few hours each. I work remotely,and rarely leave my house.  
  
For context, I was always very motivated in school and went to a really good university for an engineering degree. I recently graduated and I'm now a Software Engineer. As soon as I started college, the ADHD symptoms and other mental health struggles started taking a toll on my grades, which was really debilitating. At 19, I got on Adderall for ADHD, and was smoking weed heavily, and for a period I was abusing my adderall, which I now greatly regret. At the height of this, I had a bad case of persecutory delusions that were scary as hell. Typical ""CIA is after me"". I got off adderall for about a year, and it was so hard to feel motivated to do anything, and studying was very difficult. I was still having suspicious thinking, but I was smoking weed a lot less and not taking any stimulants, and it didn't reach a full-blown delusional state.  
  
I finally started with a new psychiatrist, and today we had our second visit. I explained that I'm scared to go on an antipsychotic because they can cause cognitive issues and in my career, I can't afford that. He concluded that what I have sounds more like a thought disorder, along with a mood disorder -- He said it possibly could be schizoaffective disorder. He said since Adderall helps a lot, we could switch to Ritalin which has a lower chance of psychosis, and add on Vraylar. He said Vraylar is good for my concern with a lack of motivation, and fear of cognitive decline with other antipsychotics.  
  
I'm scared because this thought disorder thing feels spot on. My whole life, my intellect is the only thing I feel has gotten me through life. And now I have this thing that is basically characterized by ""illogical thinking"". And it's true. In those heightened delusional states, I can feel my mind connecting dots that have no business being connected. And it's getting worse. And Adderall, the thing that feels helpful, may have exacerbated this. I'm only 23, I'm only just starting my Software Engineering career, and the thoughts that ""I'm getting dumber"" since I was 19 are proving to be true. I'm honestly terrified. I feel unable to function without Adderall, but I'm also scared that I'll just become more psychotic if I keep taking it. What do I do... I've been considering going back and getting my master's in Computer Science because I want to work in AI, but I would feel incapable doing it without Adderall. And now I feel like either way, this ""thought disorder"" thing will worsen and I won't be able to do any job that requires logical thinking because my brain is just broken. I broke my brain. And I'm only 23. I've always been an intellectually curious person, I feel so hopeless right now like what is the point of living this way?",berry_strawman,,False,1ctpdbm,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ctpdbm/was_told_today_that_i_may_have_schizoaffective/
Why can’t I get my words out?,1715897235.0,"This is so frustrating for me. In relationships I will know exactly what i want to say but its like theres a mental barrier stopping me from saying it. Its like anxiety. Even if I know something is safe to say, I cant get the words out. I usually resort to typing it in a message instead which feels so immature. Partners get frustrated at me and beg me to speak and I cant. The more time that goes along without me saying something the harder it gets to say. 

The earliest memory I have of this is asking my parents to go to friends houses. Any time I’d be invited somewhere or want to ask them something Id text my mum instead. My mum I can talk to her about anything and I’m very open with her and trust her.

Im not feeling good.,1715896682.0,"I feel so much anger to some people that are close to me and it all comes from something that started off so inocently. I injured myself on a workout one time,it was January 17. It was my knees... I was doing a lunge and whole my knee was in the position where its closer to the ground,i pulled my body upwards way too fast and i felt sharp pain in my right knee,i didnt think too much of it at the time becouse i thought it would go away in a day or so. After that, i proceeded to do the same set with the samr number of reps but with my other leg,where i somehow managed to injure my left knee without even without pulling upwards so hard. Months later, i visited the hospital many times,i tried bunch of different medications and most of them dont work. I went to electro-therapy which barelly helps and i cant walk without the knee support on my both knees. I would say my right knee is pretty fucked up,bunch of play in it i would say,while on the other hand my left knee is still fucked but not as much. The problem is that i cant ride my bike which was one of my main hobbies,it allowed me to control my anger and it kept me sane. I rode at all times of the year including winter,i rode in all kinds of weather too. After 4 years of this i stopped becouse i was injured. Its driving me insane... as stupid as it sounds,whenever i was angry i could take out the anger on the bike without harming anybody and i would feel better. I also workout which doesnt hit the same becouse i cant hit legs which was one of my favorite things to do. The doctors cant tell me when i can ride again becouse i still dont havr a diagnosis. I will get an MRI done on the 30th of this month,till then i gotta get 40 quid for the pills (i am struggling finnancially) and i gotta get more of the gel that they prescribed me,which helps with the pain.

The day got away from me,1715894712.0,"For context, I have anxiety, ADD, & have been dealing w/ a health issue (which I’m leaving undisclosed) for the past 2 1/2 months, so naturally, my health anxiety has been through the roof.

I woke up & got ready for my day as usual w/ no distractions, but then my anxiety took over. The weather has been AWFUL all week where I live so of course that helped set the mood. I’m also on summer break & had the day off from work while my parents & siblings were at either work or school, so I was home alone all day. From 8-9:45am I was either pacing the house unable to control my breathing, or sitting & staring at the wall crying my eyes out. I picked myself back up & made breakfast while I watched TV.

By this point it’s quarter to 11 & I planned to finish a season for a show, but my nonexistent attention span got the best of me & I doom scrolled on my phone for almost an hour. I end up getting to my show but later pause it so I can work out. By this point it’s 1pm. Halfway through my workout I take a breather, but a quick thought ends up distracting me & I then pace around my room for 15 minutes in a tearful frenzy for no reason. Again. I regain composure, finish my workout, & shower. It’s now 2:30.

I go downstairs to make a late lunch where I was going to use the oven. I smelled burning from the oven & in a complete panic over possibly setting off the smoke detector, I shut the oven off, open all of the windows & doors, & have a full blown panic attack.

I called my Mom completely defeated. Nobody was home & I felt so isolated. It was so cloudy & gloomy outside that all of the rooms were dim, even w/ all of the lights on. In the blink of an eye the whole day got away from me & I felt so useless as if I haven’t done anything all day, even though I really tried to be proactive. The setting & mood for both my house & the outdoors felt like a blank void where time didn’t matter. It was as if I was stuck in limbo for the entirety of the day. I felt so pathetic having a breakdown over the phone w/ my Mom even though I’m almost 20. She consoled me & gave me a very gentle pep talk, which fortunately assured me.

I ate my lunch & drank some tea while I threw on a show I enjoy. I reminded myself that it’s not too late to turn my day around. By 3:15 I left the house for the first time all day, went thrift shopping, & grabbed some boba. I’m now home & it’s 5pm. I’ve just been lounging on my bed for the last hour or so. My hair is a frizzy mess from the weather, I’m dressed in grey sweats, I’m broken out all over my face bc I’m due for my time of the month soon, & my eyes are red & puffy from crying all day.

I’m gonna dress cute later & head out w/ my family to see my sibling perform in a school concert. I’m gonna finish that season of my show, & get ready for work tomorrow. I had a very off day, but everyone will have them sometimes. The day went too fast for my mind to handle, but at least it didn’t drag. The weather here should clear up by Sunday or Monday. I need to learn to let go of bad days & not let my obsession w/ structured routines get the best of me. Every day is going to look different, & it’s certainly not good to be busy every day of the week to the point of being overworked.

I can’t guarantee myself that tomorrow will be better, but there is always tomorrow. My health issue will eventually go away. I’ll be happy again. I have family & friends to reach out to if I’m having a hard time. My life is filled w/ blessings. My mind is always drawn to the brightest side of life. Happiness & joy are meant to fill every part of me. I’m healthy. I’m loved. Bad feelings are only temporary. I’m safe. I’ve done this before so I can do it again. I’m capable. I take things one step at a time. I inhale peace & exhale worry. I choose to feel good.

I've ranged it anywhere from ADHD, autism, or BPD, I really have absolutely no clue. My image of self is very blurry and I really have no clue how I am perceived by others.

How can help me and help my mentally ill GF,1715893208.0,"Tldr: my gf of years has really terrible mental health and its driving me into oblivion. How can i help her while saving myself?


My (32m) gf (35f) have dated for 8 years. I authentically love her. Theres so much beauty in her character and a depth i havnt found with anyone else in my life. 

The last few years of our relationship have been plagued by her mental health. Its been everything. 

Manic episodes (months long) depressive episodes (months long), infidelity, hypocondria,  rage and paralyzing anxiety. 

She is getting every treatment available. 

Meanwhile i built a life for her to join (financial independence, a home, a place away from her traumas) 

Ive pretty much given her every second of time i have free and emotional energy i have. 

A few months ago i caught her, for a third time, flirting with a guy (50+) who was actively trying to destroy our already weak relationship.  I confronted her and told her it was time for us to move on. This thrust her into a huge depressive state (stopped working, stopped eating) 

Our intimacy is non existent.  She doesnt even hug me, and only recently started getting physically close to me again while we sit on the couch or the bed. 

I told her i would stay in her life but need some emotional space. I have truly tried to be the best man i can be in her life. Im definitey not perfect by any metric. 

Ive also shut down since then.  Ive stopped pretty much functioning and to put it lightly become a zombie.  

Ive stopped being ready at work, ive stopped excercising, eating healthy and become incredibly heathanistic.  

I feel like if i can help her i can help myself and vice versa.

I was battling a felony case (first time), coming home from living abroad, dealing with heartbreak from my ex still, broke, living in a shed off grid, unemployed and then had a major death in the family. Somehow she didn't care. She stayed with me and loved on me. I continued to sleep with another girl during the first few weeks we were dating. I passed an STD to her. When I came clean and told her the truth she was devastated and never got over it. More than a year later she holds it over my head daily. I don't know why she didn't just dump me.

Things got better, I beat the court case, got a job and some money saved, bought a house for us, Still she could not let it go that I was seeing another woman when we met.

Help with overcoming academic anxiety / terror,1715885255.0,"I'll keep the description brief. I suffer from generalised anxiety disorder, depression, and early signs of psychosis. 

I have always been an extremely high achiever my whole life and took great pride in my work and enjoyed doing my work, especially in mathematics, physics, and computer science.

Around a year ago I started to get hit by extreme hestitation and doubt whenever I would try a problem, or listen to something in a lecture (I'm at university right now). It eventually grew into full-blown terror so now whenever I look at something that even slightly requires any kind of logical thinking I get hit by a surge of anxiety and terror and become unable to process anything. In fact it has gotten so severe that my brain instinctively avoids thinking too hard about anything by shutting off whenever I'm approached with any kind of logical problem, which is very frustrating because it makes me function like an idiot in day-to-day life (I get confused from things like doing my laundry, or putting on clothes, or even tying my shoelaces, when these are things that have NEVER caused me any difficulty my whole life).

I was wondering if anyone has suffered from something similar and if so what were the main things that helped you recover. The way I see it is that I need to re-train my brain to not be afraid of these things, but it's extremely difficult and I don't know what the best way is to do this.

Why can't I take criticism? ,1715884258.0,"'ve been struggling lately, both at my job and with learning to drive. In regard to both, I am not doing well and am having to get a lot of coaching. I'm relatively new at both, despite being mid-30s. I lived in a big city most of my life and had an older sister who died in a car accident, so I put learning to drive off for a while just in case anyone was curious on why I am learning so late in life.

Regardless, my issue is that I spiral when I get instructed or criticized, even when it is constructive. I intellectually know that I'm learning and shouldn't be hard on myself or feel slighted, but I can't seem to help it. If I am not getting something or if I am making mistakes I get really depressed and anxious and just want to quit. For lack of better term, I become a bit of a wimp about it.

I have MDD and have discussed this with my therapist and we've spoken about how things worth doing are challenging and finding ways to be ok with discomfort, but it drives me nuts when I get like this. I just had a not-so-great performance review at work, so I am in a really bad headspace right now. I want to quit my job right now even though my wife is being very encouraging. In fact, for some reason when someone is encouraging, I actually want to quit more...it's so dumb. I know right now I am catastrophizing, but what is this? Low self-esteem? Defiance disorder?

My Nan just died,1715881245.0,"I feel like I need to talk about this.

My Nan just died. I wasn’t there because they’re in England and we’re in Canada. 
I have a feeling my mum is going to go over there when the funeral happens (at least I hope she does because she’s her mum.) 

I’m trying not to get emotional about it but I can’t help it. 
To imagine all the memories I’ve had with my Nan to them come to the conclusion that she is no longer here any more, it feels empty. 
I can imagine her in that hospital bed, until she takes that last breath and then she’s no longer there any more. Just empty.

My Nan and grandad came over every summer for a week or two and we would go out and do things even if we’ve already done them before last summer. 
I remember during one of there visits, my Nan started having problems with her leg, it would swell and she would have trouble walking.
Just went downhill from there.

And my mum couldn’t do anything to help because she’s all the way in another country. So I can’t imagine having to keep hearing that certain people involved in the medical field were being assholes, she wasn’t getting right care, she kept falling over, she kept getting worse. And my mum felt like shit not being able to do anything but listen to my grandfather struggle. 

I don’t know. I don’t know how I’m going to help mum if I’m emotional myself. 

I know this could sound shitty in a way but I am slightly, ever most slightly relieved that she is gone because that’s it. All the pain and suffering is over and it doesn’t string along family for thinking that she’s going to bounce back because that’s what doctors kept trying to do. 
Whether or not they were being honest, I don’t know. But she wasn’t ever good, wasn’t ever taken seriously from what I was told when she first started having issues just given a drug to see if it would fix it and when it didn’t just put her on another. Until she was taking over 50 tablets a day (maybe even more) and just a few weeks ago the professionals thought to themselves “huh this seems kind of strange, were going to look and see if these medications are effecting one another?”
WHEN SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

Seems so easy to be angry.
But anger never lasts and she’s gone now and I won’t have any new memories of her and I curse myself for not having a fantastic memory so that I can remember her more clearly. 
Just no new memories to have. But she’s gone, she’s resting, all that pain isn’t going to bother her. Maybe if she’s a ghost (something my mum believes) maybe she’ll visit us.

I think I’m scared of confrontation as well, my neighbour died months ago, my mum’s, coworkers husband died months ago and my great grandmother (mum’s side) passed away too.
Seems like death is all around us at the moment.
I’m not so scared of confronting death but confronting the people it affects. I don’t know the right thing to say, maybe nothing at all but I don’t want to come off that I’m ignoring it because that’s hurtful. 
Maybe I’ll never find the answer for it.  Maybe that’s the point.

I keep doing these little actions that I can control, but don't want to.

 I also do other small actions (that might just be habits) like cracking my neck, blinking in a certain manner, or twitching my lower eye socket on purpose in a certain rhythm. 

When the room is silent completely, I just have this urge to make a noise (which sucks during exams). If I don't, I feel distressed. It's really upsetting my daily life.

I've searched it up, it might be OCD, and the only way to stop it might just be medication and/or therapy, neither of which are available at the moment. Is there anything I can do to stop it?

My best friends have abandoned me during one of the hardest points in my life ,1715877816.0,"I thought I’d share over here, perhaps at least one person will be able to relate? It’s been an incredibly hard few months for me. I am newly diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. And have had major depression disorder and anxiety since a very young age. I just got out of rehab for a weed addiction a few weeks ago (very successfully - I am not on any substances anymore and don’t plan on it again). Since being out, I’ve found it incredibly hard to adjust back into my home environment. Everything was so safe and I was so protected in the clinic. They even decreased my meds because I was doing so well. 

Fast forward to coming out and back into my home environment and I’ve never been in a worse place in my life. On top of this, two weeks ago, I found out my friend took his life. When I found this out, I tried to call my one friend, but she ignored my phone call because she was too busy smoking, knowing that I needed the support because I was alone, and one of my conditions were for my friends to please not smoke in front of me. So she didn’t pick up and chose to smoke with my other friend instead of them asking if I maybe wanted to come over for some company to grieve with them. Then, I had asked my very best friend if she would be around for company and support after my friend’s memorial. She said no, it’s too much for her. I will admit that I started lashing out on both of them after those two occasions, which I’m not proud of, but because my friend had just died and no one wanted to be around. At some point I pulled back. 

They haven’t spoken to me for two weeks, and don’t plan to. My best friend said “she just wants her old friend back”. Which makes me feel hurt because I’m still here. I am her friend. The same friend I’ve been for years. I’m just not the perfect version of myself that she wants me to be right now. I can’t have people in my life conditionally based on my circumstances. I would do anything for my friends. Especially if they were at their lowest points. I am in such a bad state that my mom is on watch for me in case she has to take me to the hospital to be under observation if I am a danger to myself. And my friends? No where to be seen. Not only have I lost my friend who took his life, but now I’ve lost two of my best friends after the fact as well. And I am alone in my grief. I just feel completely helpless. I’ve had to delete social media because they’re posting petty things to their stories. I’m finding it hard to accept that these friendships may have run their course. Because they’ve been in my life for years. But I just think it’s such a nasty thing to do, especially considering my best friend is a psychology major, who was so supportive of my diagnosis and one of the only people I opened up to about it. And is in her mid 30s, so it’s not like I can even chalk it up to an age thing. Which is such shocking and juvenile behaviour for someone in her position. I am beyond hurt.

(Only mention of SA! No description!)
I’ll start by saying, yes, this is about sex, but not exclusively. Lemme clarify that sub drop can be used to describe the emotional drop a submissive has after a BDSM scene, but it can also refer to the emotional drop any party experiences after sex. 

With that cleared up, emotional drops also happen outside of sex. Like, feeling really depressed after a social event or trip. I’ve had emotional swings towards unpleasant feelings after big highs my whole life, it’s a part of having mood swings. My previous therapists have reassured me that, as long as they’re not too bad, they’re perfectly normal to experience and don’t indicate instability.

Lately I have been struggling a lot with emotional drops/mood swings after sex. Usually the whole day after I just feel kind of. Funky. Unpleasant. I am always in a safe environment with a partner I trust and who listens to me, I always focus on aftercare, and I usually feel pretty good for about an hour or so afterwards. Sometimes the drop comes on right after sex, but more often not until several hours after. During these drops I feel upset, very irritable and insecure about myself. I’ll feel out of body or I’ll have mean thoughts about my body, and even myself as a person. I struggle to communicate and feel mad or resentful towards my partner. I’m a high needs person in the day following sex, and I’m trying to work on what parts of support for me is on me and what is on them. They are generally very supportive and caring. Very helpful in general, and my upset towards them is about things they Didn’t do (and I didn’t ask for) or small things that wouldn’t normally upset me. 

Additionally, I’ve been having emotional drops badly after non sexual activities. Like working out or going to work (going to work makes more sense as it’s a frustrating environment.) None if my friends understand being overcome by great dread, unhappiness and self loathing after a good workout. I often drive home and cry for 30 mins of my drive. I was not upset at my workout or immediately after. 

I’m in the process of searching for a therapist covered by my insurance, but this will likely continue to be a long process. I have unaddressed CSA trauma, which I assume is causing my feelings after sex. But, why does my downwards slope of emotions last so long? Why do I have such bad mood swings after anything that makes me feel really happy?? Is managing this just a matter of “getting in a routine” to keep my depression/emotions at bay?

These issues and traits make it very difficult to make and maintain friendships or relationships. They are quite off-putting to others and reasonably so, I don't think other people should need to put up with things like that. In order to avoid hurting others, I think it is better to not try to initiate contact or relationships with others.

This leaves me in a situation where the only thing left for me to do is to accept that I am not built for healthy / moral friendships or relationships, where the other person would not get significantly hurt. It is a difficult thing to accept, as a part of me wants to hold on to hope that one day, things will change, one day, someone will be patient, but I don't think those are reasonable or logical thoughts to have. It's not fair to impose that on someone else.

Has anyone else accepted a similar thing, and if so, how? Being hopeful is immensely painful, and I would like to get rid of it.",Ok_Indication_8959,,False,1ctgc1m,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ctgc1m/advice_for_acceptance/
Why did she act this way? Was i in the wrong?,1715875187.0,"In a short story, basically im about to graduate highschool. And its one of my last days on the bus.

But As We ride the bus together on the last day of the bus. She was sitting behind me but wanted to tell her friend something but hesitated because she whispered “but”. But still proceeded to sit directly parallel from me. So For 15 minutes straight I had to listen to her talk about how she was on ft with a guy basically having phone sex. How she did new things with him. How she didn’t expect it to go that far. How she loved it and she wanted to go crazy for him. While she was bouncing up and down in the seat and making sex movements.

Raised by a grandiose narcissist mother like the classic obvious type, knows everything about everything, cheater, shopping addiction, grandiose ideas and so on. Married young, now add 20 plus ish years onto that and we arrive closer to present day. Spouse had a psychotic break last year at which time it becomes clear as day that she is q covert narc.

Sometimes I actually think I have it all under control. What I'm actually realizing (from getting super frustrated with my own lack of mental health healing) is that I'm just constantly walking on egg shells altering my own true self in the hopes of keeping it all together. 

I guess what I'm asking is this, is it possible to heal myself in an environment where the other adult in this relationship is severely mentally maladjusted? It's hard because thru my own mental health work I've heard over and over and come to intimately learn that other people's mental health isn't my responsibility and that I am only responsible for me so it gets confusing to me.

Should I go to a professional to see if I have ADHD? ,1715802151.0,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit but I'm willing to take my chances:   
  
So, for the past 2 years I've been wondering if I maybe have ADHD. I resonate with a lot of experiences that people that do have ADHD describe, but I ofc don't want to self diagnose. 

So, for most of my life (probably until I was like 13) I never paid attention to a thing in school. All I could do was go to school and get lost in my thoughts/day dream. In hindsight, Idk if back then it was just bc I thought school was useless, or if it was my inability to pay attention.  But anyway, that wasn't really a big deal.  
  
 Fast forward to 10th grade when my studies actually mattered, I realized that I kept getting distracted and my efficiency was so low. I could be sitting there for 10 whole hours and only read through 10 pages the entire day (and I'm not even exaggerating). A lot of times, I could THINK about doing something. Even if I really really want to do it, I just CAN'T do it. And before I know it the entire day has passed. It stresses me out that I'm not doing it but I'm still unable to do it and I feel like in the past few months I've insanely become addicted to mindlessly scrolling through the internet ( esp instagram ) Like that's literally the only thing I'm able to do. Literally, my entire school year was me having to do something -> being unable to do it -> the entire day is over and i haven't done anything. 

The thing is, this is mostly for things I don't want to do - so is it just that I have trouble motivating myself? Like, it's not as extreme for things I don't have negative feelings associated with. I still am not as efficient as a person should be but it isn't as bad. I feel like this is affecting all aspects of my life - just bc I'm focused on a few things that im unable to do, i engage in mindless scrolling etc and because of that I can't even enjoy things that I actually want to do.

Also, I've always been horrible at time management. Ever since I was a child. I can't do anything until the last minute and im probably late to every single thing. I'm literally EXACTLY on time or late. Like, I've been taking the bus to school since 4th grade and I""m in 12th now and despite my parents getting pissed at me for it, I literally can't get to the bus until the last minute (or until i'm like 2 mins late). I don't understand how this hasn't changed in 8 years. 

Another thing is that my parents would probably describe me as a very forgetful person. That's basically been my identity in their eyes for all my life. Like forgetful/always day dreaming, etc 

Also, I would say that I'm pretty unhappy in my life. Idk if that's a symptom or something or just a result of me being frustrated with being unable to function like a normal human being idk 

OHOHOH I almost missed this out - I also resonate with a lot of ADHD SAT test takers. So, the SAT english module requires us to read dense texts and answer questions regarding them and I initially just couldn't CONCENTRATE on those passages yk. I just couldn't register it in my head and stuff. It's been a while since i took the test so it's hard for me to describe my experience but ik at the time I took it I felt like something was wrong. I ended up doing well on it tho ( got a 770) but I was literally the only test taker in 100+ who had to use a paper to jot down points to properly focus on the passages

My sister has depression ,1715801540.0,"I literally just opened an account because I need some advices. First things first, English is my second language so expect mistakes here and there or even nonsense. I’ll try to explain myself later.

I literally have no idea how to help my sister and there are times that I feel I need the relationship to end for my own happiness. Am I too selfish??? We don’t have our parents so we only have each other.

She has been in a relationship over 15 years, living together but not married. Since I met my husband she has made comments like I want to marry one day but not with him, I love him to death but I don’t want him to be the father of my children. We have discussed MILLIONS times that she should end that relationship because it’s definitely not what she needs. Time passed and nothing changed. She cheated on him a few years ago, and never told him, felt like crap about it but he never knew. She has cheated on him AGAIN, she has depression from a long time ago and she claims that she found what she needed in that guy but ended it. I have been listening to her since the end of last summer about how much she wants to end the relationship but she doesn’t know how. When I try to talk to her I supposedly become this person telling her what to do, with cero empathy and I have no idea of life and cero idea what she is going through. She has decided multiple times no to tell me anything else because of my lack of advice and then two days passed and she always come back to tell me the same crap. If I stay on the phone listening to her, it’s a problem that I stay quiet, if I try to give her advices, I shouldn’t have to tell her what to do and I have cero respect for her feelings. I have tried to talk to her and said I’m confused, I don’t really know how to approach. She calls me almost everyday to talk about the same thing and how much she has cried that day. She reminds me every time that she has depression. Oh I forgot, she’s in therapy since before Christmas. She said she has gotten better but I don’t see any changes. 

I have been listening for about 7 years that she doesn’t want to be in that relationship but she doesn’t want to hurt him. Then she cries because she loves him and wants a future with him, she just wishes that he could give her what she needs. But people don’t change, and it’s definitely not getting better and 7 years is a long time to know what you want and do nothing about it. In December she was gonna leave him, in March she was gonna say that she cheated and tried to fix it. In April she didn’t know how to break up. Yesterday she wanted to be with him and tell him about the infidelity again. Today she called him and said we should break up. She called me and said but I love him too much what am I doing?
Too much inconsistency for me.

After this long time talking about the same thing, it’s starting to affect my own mental health. Every phone call is one hour of negativity and I can’t take it anymore. I have found myself feeling mad, with anxiety, crying, screaming and frustrated every time I talk to her. My day gets completely ruined and I wish I could find the balance and dont let affect me. But I can’t, after so many times and a long time, I can’t anymore. I see that she is calling me and I know everything that’s coming after. 
I have tried to tell her that she is in this toxic routine and she needs to get out. I have said that they are hurting each other more than they are loving each other. I have said all the truths I know. And when I do, I’m a horrible person that has cero idea how to deal with mental health. I have said hey, I can’t help you, I’ll be here always but I don’t have the experience or knowledge to help you. She agrees and then she comes back wanting advices. 
I don’t want any more of this. A lot of things are going bad on her life also besides this. I wanted to tell her that I need a break from her for my own mental health but I feel I’m the only thing left that she has. How am I gonna do that? 

I don’t know what else to do or how to approach. I feel I have tried everything. My husband keeps telling me how happier I am when my sister and I have fought and haven’t talked in months in the past. One part of me wants to say, leave me alone but another one is scared that she gets even worse because I’m leaving her.

How can you help a person with depression that doesn’t want the help and their actions are not helping?

Car accident? ,1715873667.0,"Any advice after a car crash please anyone been through this? 

I was rear ended going while I was going around 65mph luckily I managed to walk away and so did the driver but it's caused me to feel really bad. The driver is being prosecuted for dangerous driving by the police, he was arrested at the scene. Witnesses who rung the police said they thought he was going up to 140mph so it was quite bad. I went to first physio today and my cars been wrote off. I later found out from the police officer dealing with it that the driver said to them he actually purposely wanted to crash but wanted to hit the barrier not me I don't know how true it is. I've been rear ended before as a passenger and had no problems so I'm finding it all stressful this time. What made it worse was because the driver just stayed in his car (probably in shock) in the overtaking lane and it was quite busy with cars going past beeping at him so I couldn't even cross to get over to check and couldn't see anything as his airbags had gone off so I rung the emergency services in thinking he/any passengers may be seriously injured or worse. Then after I had no updates because he was just taken away and arrested then I saw in an article he had been taken to hospital (only a few days later the police told me this was just a precaution). My insurance company passed it over to a 3rd party which meant I didn't need to pay my excess upfront who were awful and asking the most ridiculous questions like how many seconds I was in the lane before being hit, I was constantly being asked the same questions, to go over and over it and even a week later hadn't even contacted the drivers insurance company (who accepted liability straight away once they had so a lot of the questions were unnecessary). Thankfully I decided to change and pay my excess and its been 'easy' to deal with them since.  

Also I wasn't given a courtsey car (because 3rd party actually thought fault could be disputed without even speaking to his insurance) so I've not been driving since and the thought is making me sick, even as a passenger I'm not good when before I had no problems. I'm sweating like mad and freaking out if cars are getting too close it's making me really on edge. I've actually put a deposit down on a car today and someone else is driving it back for me but I don't know how I'm going to ever drive again.

Around a week after I mentioned to my GP I wasn't in a good place (after her actually asking how I was feeling) but she just brushed it off and moved on to my physical injuries. It's almost a month on and I still don't feel any better but I'm not sure what to do. It doesn't help I'm extremely nervous of medical stuff, I've not been to the GP in over 5 years so my experience going has made me feel even worse. I've just had started physio for physical injuries but to be honest compared to how I'm feeling mentally its way worse.

Can prolonged panic attacks cause chest muscle strain?,1715873575.0,"I’m having a rough time and getting panic attacks pretty much every day, especially at night. It’s hard to sleep and it’s quite fitful.

Today and two days ago I’ve woken up with pain and tension in the centre of my chest. When I press on the small spot it feels tender like a bruise. I can take a deep breath and no pain, breathing is completely fine. It only hurts when I move certain ways, like lifting myself from sitting - which is why I feel like it’s muscular. 

It hurts the worst in the morning and then gets better. I didn’t have it yesterday, which is interesting because I didn’t have panic yesterday until going to bed last night, and that pattern holds true for when I had it two days ago.

I know chest pain shouldn’t be taken lightly, but it really doesn’t feel like anything serious, I’ve googled what the concerning symptoms are so I know what to look for. But I still have anxiety about the whole thing, which probably isn’t helping.

They’ve turned a blind eye to how the house is dirty and unsafe for me and my cat and the only time they have ever truly paid attention they’ve yelled at me and blamed me for it which I can admit that I haven’t been doing much lately but I feel so under pressure and the entire house is just to much it’s depressing for me and most days I seriously feel like I can’t do it anymore and I have tried bringing it up with my parents but they’ve brushed it off saying I’m just going through stuff or how I’m sensitive or dramatic which is apart of the main thing I’m trying to ask I don’t know if this is truly neglect but my parents have truly never helped with cleaning and have never helped me with schoolwork for years I’ve been struggling to do it on my own and they have helped me when I was distraught and struggling

my mom overall hasn’t paid barely any attention to my mental health and the only times she has she’s made fun of me and refuses to take me seriously and she genuinely treats me more like something lesser than her because I’m a kid and treats me like an employee instead of her child It’s been years since she has said that she loved me or accepted the affection I’ve tried to give her she’ll just get angry at me for it 

My stepdad is disabled and really can’t do much to help unlike my mom which I fully understand but he’s still been difficult He’s constantly switching his mood and often picks fights with me when I’m trying to help him clean his room or do whatever he wants I can’t deny him help or take time for myself because he ends up going to my mom complaining and I’m forced to help him sometimes we do talk and slightly connect but he’s older and is hard to deal with I try to reason with him but he usually ends up screaming at me as well and made fun of my just like my mom 

They both are easily offended and quick to get angry at me and I truly just hate both of them for the years that they haven’t helped me or used me basically as a maid and not sending me to a school or helping me with the little bit of schoolwork I do have

My Boyfriend’s Abusive Mom is Starting to Affect Me Too,1715799643.0,"I’m not really sure where to start or why exactly I’m posting this. I’m not necessarily asking for any answers however comments and inputs are greatly appreciated. I need to know I’m not just dramatic. So to start, me (15F) have been with my boyfriend (16m) for almost 6 months. We can refer to him as D. In the beginning of the relationship it was always me staying at his house because my mom is a bit strict. At first it was really good. His mom (40F) was super sweet to me and would compliment me on my hair or piercings or whatever. This is important later. She also went out of her way to tell him how pretty I am. We can call her R. For some backstory, R is bipolar and unmedicated, as well as a recovering addict. She has 4 kids, 19m, 16m, 15m, 10m. They have been taken by CPS and put into multiple foster homes for most of their childhood. She is not a fit mother and does not provide for her children. 
So, over time she started deciding that I need to stop eating at her house, because she claims she spends more money on food for me than she did for her 19y/o before he moved out. I know this is not true because I’m 5’1 85lbs and I eat once a day. I struggle a lot with body image and her telling me I eat sooo much made this so bad. Next, she discovered a hole in her shower. One of her kids explained how it’s from his shower chair, but she didn’t wanna hear that. She started screaming at me to get out because according to her, me and D broke the shower while having sex in it. This is not true. So then she decided I’m not allowed to shower and D can only shower every few days. Then she turns nice again and compliments come back. Then one day she comes home and the dishes aren’t done and she freaks the fuck out. Screaming at me and D to get out and to move out and just screaming for like an hour. We left and came to my house. She started texting him to come home and he told her, “you told me to leave” and she claims she didn’t say that. So we sent her a video of her saying that and her response was “You’re abusive” then blocked D. She is a professional piercer, and a few weeks later she was nice enough to come over and pierce my tongue for free. (She steals all of the equipment after everyone leaves the shop she works at.) She told me a story of ONE time she messed up a piercing, then does that same thing to me. I think it was intentional. And now here’s where shit gets real 

She’s been texting My boyfriend D telling her she loves and misses him but he hasn’t responded. Then he texted her asking her to delete pictures of his ex off her social medias. She flips out and says it’s weird and toxic, and she blocks him so he can’t see it. Then she texts me, telling me I’m toxic because her son won’t talk to her unless it’s something like this, and I’m ugly and her son can do better than me. I’ve always been nice to her. Remember when I said she called me pretty? Yeah, she’s manipulative. The dirty cunt says whatever you want to here so you validate her back. She only tells D she loves him because she wants to hear it back and gets mad when she doesn’t. She’s disgusting. I don’t feel bad talking about his mom this way she’s a piece of shit who abandoned her family for drugs. Gross. I can provide screenshots of some of this. 

oh not to mention 1. She does OF with other men (she’s had a bf for about a year but they do porn with other people) 2. She posts naked pics on the insta she follows her kids on 3.

Finding A Supportive Work Enviornment,1715788982.0,"Have you ever worked on a team at work where you felt they supported your mental health journey? Or everyone was in the same boat, figuring things out together?

I’m currently job searching and aside from the other steps I’m taking to deal with decades old trauma (therapy, research into support groups, self-care, targeted therapies), I thought that maybe seeking a supportive environment at work where I can find myself would be helpful. I want there to be steady work, but not a high-pressure situation, like I’ve been doing— product design for startups.

I want managers who are role models of good behavior, and teachers of their craft (but not school marmey). Perhaps the atmosphere can be laid back, flexible schedule, where I can dip in/out of assignments as I work through stuff. Perhaps this is a temporary need, and a way of repairing myself. I’m not sure. 

The job market for my field right now is bleak, so I don’t know what to expect. So that is another reason why I’m wanting stability, normalcy, and time to recover. So far in my career, I’ve repeated the relationships I had in childhood. Which has meant, I’ve always been going through it, alone. It would be great to have people who could guide me in my career. 

I would really like to hear how others have balanced healing with work, for those who have done it, and what they seeked out to give them the healing they needed. ",thehobbyhorse,,False,1csofjp,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1csofjp/finding_a_supportive_work_enviornment/
How do you respond to someone saying I’m suicidal?,1715788610.0,"I said I’m feeling suicidal and depressed to a friend…. Her response was what else is new? 

I’m suicidal a lot…..but this morning, the thought I’m all alone in my depression  went through my head….. not expecting a crisis reaction but what else is new seems invalidating….. makes me wonder if I should just completely hide it behind a smile even with people I have no filters with even if they don’t want me to hide it…… being fake takes less energy than dealing with emotions after being invalidated……

It’s one thing to not tell someone you’re suicidal…. I don’t expect others to just figure it out…….. so getting no support is the only option in this scenario….

Drawing Helps,1715871885.0,"If you are 😰 stressing out, just draw something on a paper, it helps at least just for that moment, but it may help you to stay calmer level!!! 

Lately I have been dealing with something very bad in my life, relationship vise. And it has put me through a lot of crap mentally! I won’t get into details, that’s not what this post is about. The crap I’m going through made me realize a lot, about people especially close to me, about myself, and the whole world in general! One small thing I realized about myself that drawing ✍️ stupid weird stuff helps me relax and come down! No I’m not an artist and I’m not good at drawing, and no I’m not unique, I know that it’s a science fact. But I never thought of it before. Really, when you stressed out 😰 just grab whatever piece of a paper you have, a pencil, pen or marker or whatever. And just start scribbling, whatever it’s, don’t matter, don’t think about it, just let your hand do its thing, let the vibrations in your soul and body caused by the stress dictate what your shaking hand will draw on a piece of paper 📄. 
This morning when I came to work, I found a sticky note 📝 with kind of a spiderweb looking drawing on it (too bad I can’t attach it here). Honestly I don’t even remember doing it,  well I do remember scribbling on a paper, but I didn’t realize what I drew until I saw this morning. 
but last night closer to the end of shift, I was on a phone with a subject person, and conversation wasn’t very pleasant. At the end of convo person said that surprisingly I handled myself very well unlike usually when similar convos happen. And I guess it’s because the whole time I was drawing ✍️ on a sticky note, it’s pretty much filled with ink, but has a pretty nice geometric/spiderweb type pattern to it.  

Next time you are stressed 😫 out, JUST ✍️ DRAW! Hopefully it will help you!!!

Why does Coffee improve my mood so much?,1715870230.0,"For some reason, my mind appears to have a negativity lens or and general low mood especially when I'm tired. I've managed to observe this mood as separate from me, so I am intellectually unbothered by it. However, it feels like there is always resistance, and for a few minutes at a time, my mind's mood can sometimes bring my thoughts down with it before I mentally check it. So while moods come and go, I'd still rather not have this down feeling.

One interesting thing is that this filter is removed when I drink coffee, and I feel at ease. A lot of people I know don't seem to view coffee like this, so I'm wondering if there is some underlying mental condition I have that could be a reason for this. 

Like for others, coffee still builds a tolerance for me, and unfortunately, drinking for too many days straight leads to a worse condition than the default condition. Therefore, I use it as needed.

 facial pain and throat inflammation. ,1715865745.0,"Hello, I would like to describe my current health issue to you, including my hypotheses about what might be causing it. I would like to hear your opinions on what it might be and how I should proceed. Keep in mind that I am already undergoing medical consultations and will have more, but so far, I have not reached a conclusion, so I would like as many opinions as possible.



If you need more information, feel free to ask.



For about two years, I have been experiencing facial pain and throat inflammation. I have never had these issues before. They started occurring after I had COVID-19, and I'm not sure if this is coincidental or a consequence of the virus. Initially, these pains were infrequent and mild, but in the past few months, they have become much more frequent and intense, significantly affecting my productivity, energy, and concentration. The pain is mostly noticeable upon waking, but sometimes it persists throughout the day. When the pain is less intense, it almost completely disappears after breakfast or lunch. However, when it is more severe, it doesn't go away at all, forcing me to rest in bed. Sometimes, even taking Tylenol does not relieve the pain.



The facial pain is located under my cheekbones, along my jaw, behind my eyes, and when it's very intense, at the center of my head just above my nose. The pain is continuous on both sides of my face and does not worsen with touch.



As for my throat, it feels like there's a constant lump at the lower part, as if it were scratched. It hurts continuously, not just when I swallow.



These pains occur year-round, regardless of the season.



Regarding medical checks and existing conditions, here are the details:

- I’ve had an eye exam, and there has been no deterioration beyond my existing myopia and astigmatism.

- I’ve been checked and do not have sinusitis.

- X-rays have shown no issues with my cervical spine.

- I likely clench my teeth at night and should be using a mouthguard.

- I need to have my wisdom teeth removed (I’ve only had one extracted so far) because they have not fully emerged and are pushing against the other teeth.

- I am allergic to dust mites.

- I have L4-S1 discopathy.

- Blood tests for thyroid issues showed no problems.

- I am currently on a treatment of Nicetile 500mg (L-acetylcarnitine HCl) under the assumption it might address nerve inflammation post-COVID, but there have been no changes after 15 days.



These issues also cause poor sleep quality. Despite sleeping for 7-8 hours, I wake up feeling tired and as if I need more rest, even if I did not exert myself physically or mentally the previous day.



From the beginning of May onwards, I experienced two weeks where every day I had a sore throat, headaches, and excessive tiredness, despite having taken antihistamines and cortisone spray for more than 20 days in April. I had a flu in early May and felt very ill; all symptoms (sore throat, cold, headache) were amplified and kept me in bed for several days, as if I had COVID. Even after the flu passed, I continued to experience throat lumps and headaches, along with excessive tiredness that rest did not alleviate.



I maintain a fairly balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity. I am physically at a normal weight.



My hypotheses:

- Depression/anxiety

- Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia, or hypersomnia

- Chronic fatigue syndrome

- Long COVID

- Symptoms of a dust mite allergy

- Dental malocclusion and teeth grinding at night

Please help me support my girlfriend's mental health,1715859748.0,"First time poster, please give me any advice you can as I really don't know what to do.

I have been with my girlfriend for 6 years and I love her to bits. The problem is that her mental health issues are becoming more severe and more frequent. She suffers with anxiety and ADHD (undiagnosed but has all the classic symptoms), and it is getting to the point where it is really affecting her personal and professional life. At work she really struggles with criticism, and quite often is convinced that people do not like her, and are treating her badly because they don't like her. She has worked at 5 different companies since I have known her, at each she has had a problem with her manager, or the wider management team. Often she spends a lot of time analysing their motives and actions, convinced that flaws in their character (arrogance, misogyny, poor communication, general bad management etc) are the root cause of her being unhappy at work. Two of her last three job changes have been directly to get away from her manager. She also really struggles with the kind of office environment BS that most people face (others not doing what they should, people claiming credit, office politics etc), taking this things far too personally in my opinion.

This all leads not only to her feeling down and anxious, but also chronically tired and lethargic, brain fog and difficulty communicating. I have tried to be as supportive as I can, listening, trying to understand, offering love and support and advice where I can. However it all seems to be getting worse, and I don't know what to do. Every work day is an ordeal for her. I regularly message her through the day to see how she is doing, and talk to her about it every evening. It's always negative, it's always a bad day, someone has always treated her badly. I sympathise, empathise let her know how much I love her and that I'll do anything to help, but I don't think that anything I do is actually helping.

Counseling didn't really help her, although I have suggested trying again. Doctors just prescribe anti-depressants, which just seem to numb her without any real benefits.

I am quite different from her, which I worry is preventing me helping her, or even perhaps making her worse. I'm generally confident, not too bothered whether people like me in a work setting and the kind of person that just gets on with it. This can make it hard to relate to her problems at times, as she sometimes reaches conclusions which make little sense to me. For example if someone doesn't complete something I need from them, I would think ""they are a poor employee"", whereas she would think ""they deliberately didn't do this because they don't like me or want me to look bad"". I do try to be very sensitive in these situations, but it can be difficult. I don't say this to her, but at times it feels she's creating her own problems.

Obviously all this impacts our relationship, but I'm not going to go into that. I know if I can help her and make her happy(er) then I will also be happy.

What are the best ways to deal with mental health online? ,1715862483.0,"Hi friends, I've been dealing with serious anxiety and depression for over 3 years. My first panic attack was rough and not sure I've ever got over it. I still get anxiety attacks which sucks. My anxiety steams from relationship, finances, doubt in my future. 

I personally have found 1 on 1 therapy to be OK. While its nice to talk to someone, it just feels its a paid session to vent while and wait to do it again next week. Not to mention, it all adds up. 

What are some social apps/site you've found useful online thats FREE. I believe its all about the community, support of peers kinda going through the same things that can help each other.

I am in the process of trying to work on my own idea to focus on this and helping others in the same boat. Reddit is cool but doesn't feel as intimate or personal  - but prob the best option.

Should I tell my dad about my MH issues?,1715861672.0,"I (23m) should preface this by saying that my dad's not a bad person, but he has very old-fashioned (shitty) views when it comes to mental health and talking about emotions and feelings.

A few years ago, after a traumatic incident, I developed anxiety or depression (or rather, the low-lying, easy to ignore anxiety and depression I always had got much, much worse). Growing up with the idea that men should bottle up their emotions and never be vulnerable, I kept it to myself for far too long. I eventually told my mum, my brother and a few close friends, and got professional help, but I've still never been able to tell my dad. As a kid, he would roll his eyes or sigh when people spoke about their feelings, and had a big stigma about people with depression, and I internalised this for so long (until the point where I HAD to confront my depression and get help).

So, he and I are going abroad over the summer, just the two of us, with him as my carer as I'm disabled, and I feel I need to/should share some aspects of my MH with him. I know I probably don't owe him anything, but can't shake the feeling that he should probably be aware of some of it beforehand.

Feeling nostalgic or melancholy whenever I do not feel depressed?,1715860871.0,"This is a weird one I think but I've recently noticed how I sometimes ""miss"" my depressive episodes. Whenever I have them I feel horrible and I want out of it because it's just this horrible numb feeling following me everywhere I go. 

Yet for example right now, I miss it. In a way I felt comfortable just being in my bed or on my computer for the whole day. Listening to some music and not being able to manage my time. When I felt really bad I'd stay up until who knows how long, just having something on in the background to occupy my mind and I remembef falling asleep on my desk regularly because I just didn't have the energy to get up and move. 

And so I wonder why I now feel nostalgic for that. It is such a terrible time whenever I actually have an episode so I don't know why I would feel this way.

First session and I’m a bit disappointed,1715859485.0,"Hi, so to add some insight. I had been experiencing some chronical health issues for a period of time until I got somewhat “healed” to a normal level. I have to add I have been undiagnosed as my doctors could find nothing on my tests (haven’t done many I have to admit)

Yet, when I went to my psychologist, that I happened to meet today, for less than an hour. She declared that my illness was anxiety. Amounted 8 years of painful illness every day to that, and I felt very devastated.

It’s not the first time someone has jumped to that conclusion without even knowing me, it’s the easy answer. And I can more or less understand, mental illnesses are tough, but it felt crushing because it isn’t. And there is yet another person that won’t bother even check before spitting that.

She also was very prideful and cocky and addressed how studious and updated she was, while advising me “that if I liked psicology I could study it, if I was capable of doing so” (as if I were capable mentally, as if many people were stupid enough and incapable enough not to. I know because she made sure to make the point clear 😭. Man rereading all my psychologist is an ass.)

I am willing to give it another session. But this honestly didn’t help me much. I tried to address it nicely yet she seemed insistent on knowing it better than I did :/. She also briefly complained about others about” them demanding instead of being thankful, as I was”

This is the gist of the session. I am disappointed and concerned. Have in mind these psychologists are state workers so they get paid nonetheless of what they do. I think I’ll just be one malpractice more in a sea of overwork and carelessness. It didn’t appear too professional.

Middle school memory,1715858323.0,"So, in the last couple of months I've been in a safe enough space to begin healing from some of my past trauma and building my self esteem and self-love as a neurodivergent person. Honestly, it's been some of the most peaceful months of my life, but there have been, as I expected, moments when some events from my past and my childhood would resurface. I just remembered something that happened when I was around 12, so I wanted to share, because even though it's something that hurt me, there's a voice in my head that's telling me it's not that big a deal. So I'm hoping to get some outside perspective.

So basically, my class was preparing some sort of play. A few of us were chosen to act in a skit. However we weren't given a script, we were told to improvise. I cannot improvise at all, I've never been able to. I also always have bad social anxiety. Regardless, we all had to do it. When it was my turn to say something during the first rehearsal, I froze and just stood there awkwardly. It happened every time we rehearsed. And when it happened the teacher would turn it into a learning experience for others. While I stood there on the edge of tears, other kids would discuss my behaviour and why this would happen. Eventually, the teacher saw that I couldn't participate in the skit, so she gave me a different role - to help backstage. I was the only person who did this. My teacher had a rule where everyone had to participate, so I guess she had to find me something to do. While everyone was performing on stage and showing off their talents, I was delegated to carrying chairs. I ended up not showing up to the play at all. Figured they wouldn't miss me.

I don't know how it's affected me honestly. I didn't even remember it until just now, but the moment I did, the whole memory really started hurting. Everyone acted like it wasn't a big deal back then, so I believed it too, but now I can't help but feel like I was treated unfairly. Instead of giving me a chance or helping me find a way to participate, I was put on a spotlight in my scariest moment to be scrutinized by others and then cast aside.

Would it be wise to take leave of absence?,1715855721.0,"I’ve been trying to get on the right medication for my anxiety and depression. 

I took 20mg of my lexapro over a month ago for 2 days straight after not taking it for a while (over 6 months) and it gave me the worst persistent anxiety I’ve ever had. Like 24/7 panic attacks. 

Went to the doctor to sort it out. They prescribed me Zoloft and hydroxyzine. I took the Zoloft for a week and developed breathing issues (shortness of breath) which made my anxiety worse, ruined the vacation I was on with my family. I took hydroxyzine at night but I didn’t feel right at all. I stopped taking both after a week of being prescribed. 

Within the last month my mental health has been suffering more than ever. Every day has been getting worse to a point where if it persists I will get desperate if you catch my drift. 

My boss knows how bad I am, and I’m not the same at all. I am not well. But they are picking me apart, putting me down. Took away my promotion. The pressure is getting too much. I cry every day at work. The mask is slipping and customers see it and have been less than forgiving. I am truly miserable. I don’t know how I’ll get better. 

I have a doctors appointment today so I can explain my situation with the Zoloft and hydroxyzine. I wanted to bring up taking a leave of absence so I can just focus on getting better, I just don’t know if I can afford it. It’s either that or a mental hospital. 

The only thing stopping me is burdening my job and family. I have not talked about this with my partner bc I’m scared they will not agree with taking leave of absence, especially if it’s unpaid. I don’t know what to do but I cannot heal like this. The work place is very toxic and high pressure. I want to start looking for another job but I need to be well.

Why do I forget who I am sometimes?,1715855104.0,"I don't mean this materially. It's the subjective of who I am. Let me explain the conflicting experiences I had today. I'm a guy, and I have been getting into goth. I did some trad makeup and wore it to my retail job. I didn't do a great job and the thickness of my wings made it look like drag makeup, which I felt uncomfortable with. I got a lot of stares and at my worst at about 8 pm right before I got off, I started crossing the threshold into suicidal thoughts. Not ruminating on them, but I did have them. I also put myself out there a bit to a few of my female coworkers, and they ended up completely rejecting me after being initially accepting, ignoring me after we exchanged numbers, ignoring me in person, just fucking sucky. It made me start to feel disgusted with myself, like I'm a big dangerous disgusting man and they would never want to associate with me, and that I'm going to be just like my boring sad male coworkers who are much older than me because I'm a man and childhood is over now. 

It made me feel so bad that I started a conversation with a newer young male coworker who looks like the guys who bullied me in high school. He was actually really nice and talking to another human felt like I got filled with warmth again. But before that I had truly believed that that's who I was and was acting accordingly. Like not talking to female coworkers my age or even looking at them because I am a disgusting creep who is harassing them. I do not always feel this way about myself, but no matter how many times I come back from it, nothing stops me from going back into it and believing it. When I got home, I still felt incredibly guilty and regretful of dyeing my hair black/wearing makeup. The second thing that started pulling me out of it was scrolling instagram reels and seeing pink famingoes and rocky horror edits, which my mom showed me. At the time she did I was happy and it started making me feel really loved and excited seeing that world again, like I was remembering that I'm not a disgusting person. 

Then her boyfriend woke up and started rolling his suitcase out. It gave me a flashback to when I was younger and we would travel a lot, back before my parents split up. There were a lot of late nights coming home and the sound of suitcase wheels as we unloaded. It was such a good feeling and for a moment I felt it. And I had such a clear sense of who I am. I still do, although it's fleeting, but that's why I'm writing this. I felt so safe and relieved coming home. 

I never feel that way anymore. I never feel sure of myself anymore to the point that I genuinely, fully don't know who I am. Not feeling sad. Genuinely, I forget. I become convinced that I am harming or burdening those around me, especially women my age who I find attractive. It is not self pity. It is a genuine belief. I genuinely believe they feel that way about me even if they've never said it and I've never done anything. To me in those moments it is just the vibe of how I'm being that's enough to warrant it, like how girls sometimes gang up on creepy guys and tear them down with a passion because they're trying to regain power as a unit. If I glance at someone it's staring and I'm ogling them so I don't dare to look at them because I know if I do their friends will be staring daggers at me and ready to launch a verbal tirade to tear me down. I believe it so completely that I feel a sense of urgency to take action somehow to ""fix"" myself or my behavior. Why do I experience this? Is it disassociation? Psychosis? Paranoia? Why does nothing I do fix it? I am aware of the existence of CPTSD and BPD, but this feels like something else because I have a very complete and secure sense of self, it's just that I forget it and become something else for a minute.

My wellswishers feel sad for me as I have no dating life. I also have no willingness to find a partner or any optimism towards getting married. I cringe at the thought of developing feelings again for anybody like how could I be so stupid to have done so in the past. I feel ashamed and embarrassed when people ask me about my dating life not because I don’t have any but because i put myself in some stupid situations in the past. 

I am not depressed. I’m just 🤷🏻‍♀️ I don’t care about any of this shit. My friends/family are really stressed thinking about my further and mental well being and old age. If I have to marry I’m pretty much ok with marrying anyone like what they say is an arranged marriage where you are just married off and there’s no interaction involved none of those show your feelings and choose a person BS.  Because then it’ll be done with. 😅

"I have violent non-sexual fantasies, is there something wrong with me?",1715848943.0,"I've (21F) always been an angry person, but lately I've started to realize some of the ways I think is not normal. 

Whenever I get angry at someone, I wanna hurt them. I wanna punch, kick and hit them until they are limp and bloody. I wanna make them feel pain. Whenever I get angry, I can only calm down if I have a vivid and very detailed daydream about beating the subject of my anger half to death. I imagine the blood, the screams, the pain and it calms me down. 


But I don't have these thoughts to ANYONE who makes me mad. My sister makes me mad but I never thought about her this way. I only want to hurt the bad people. Narsistic, egotistical, unempathetic, lying, evil people who hurt others. 

What scares me the most is, I don't think this is wrong. I can recognize that it's not NORMAL but I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting the hurt people who hurt others on purpose.

Can relationships with a mildly paranoid relative ever get better?,1715846789.0,"Has anyone had dealings with relatives with mild paranoia (or maybe its borderline personality, but just a general extreme distrust) where they somehow managed to get to a reasonably good relationship and/or the the person got any better? Or is it all just hopeless?

I've experienced this extreme level of distrust when I tried to help her. She turns on everyone she is close to eventually and did turn on me finally. As she gets elderly it gets worse. If you try to resolve an issue it turns into prosecutorial combat with hellish, long conversations raking over the coals, and both parties feeling worse at the end. She's tried therapy , but unfortunately didn't get a good one, and she gave up on that rather than trying to find a better fit.

But here's the thing. Over the years, she had several experiences when people really did truly try to harm her or others and she had to fight very hard to escape from it. So she is probably somewhat traumatised. Of course, if you were to say to her that she is over-reacting or being paranoid... well, lets just say that would be kryptonite.

It's got to the point where I just have to keep my distance to protect myself. It's all a bit sad.

Do your parents affect your mental health?,1715846083.0,"24, recently had to move back in with my parents after a fallout with roommates and my own mental health issues. I am grateful of course that my parents have let me move back in and have always said the offer is there if I need it. 

My issue I'm finding though, is now after being back for approx. 5months, I'm finding I don't want to be home or around them as often as they are both hoarders (mum moreso than dad but still), they have their own health issues and I do take that into consideration but they aren't trying to actively help themselves or the house. They are aware of the state of the house and just point the finger at each other. I have helped tidy and clean a number of the rooms to help but they are already gradually building stuff back up. 

I have spoken to my mum about seeing a professional to help her with the house but also the idea of counselling to support her in changing her habits and she is not against the idea, but weeks, hell months go by and nothing happens. 

I am diagnosed with depression so I do understand the struggle, I really do. My mum is also going through her own issues with this, and I have tried doing my part to support her but it is hard when I have my own mental health to take care of as well. 

I don't even know where I'm going with this post now. 

Basically, I guess. How do you know where to draw the line? I want to support my mum and dad, it can't be my responsibility solely, but it feels as though if I'm not the one sorting the house out, then no one will, and I feel like I cant just continue to mention it or try to have the same conversation over and over again.

Therapy isn’t working. Talking to my therapist about my problems just makes me feel slightly better in the short term, but it’s had no long term benefits even after two years.

I have less than $20k in the bank, and the cost of living in my area and the surrounding areas is something I’ll never be able to afford.
I have no friends. I’ve had opportunities to make friends, but I just cant hang onto friendships so I don’t bother trying anymore. I haven’t had a true long term friendship since I was 13.

I’m terrified of relationships with both men and women too. Any kind of relationship. Friendship, romantic, physical. 
I don’t trust anyone enough to get truely close to them. I just have a hand full of people I work with that I trust enough to have a casual conversation with during lunch break and that’s it.

I don’t want to do anything, and it’s not because I can’t be bothered putting in any effort, I HAVE put effort in and it’s gotten me nowhere. Nothing has changed. All my lifelong traumas are still haunting every aspect of my life as if I’m still currently living them.

We are unable to pinpoint the reason why the moods intensified  but he’s regularly on a verge of either anger outbursts, depressive mood , crying or all of it. Most of the time there is no particular trigger  - his mood spins out of control during an evening at home whilst watching a movie, other times it’s whilst playing a video game, sometimes it’s just whilst outside on a walk. Once an episode starts, it lasts around 5-6 hours and is usually in the late evening, costing us both night’s sleep and is then followed by guilt, shame and self hatred the next day for him.

Every day is a battle against the weight of expectations. I juggle full-time work and college, pushing myself to the limits. The morning routine is a facade; I wake up at 8 but lie there, wrestling with thoughts until 9. The shower is a mask I wear to face the world.

I'm a man.

My worth is measured by what I can provide, not by my emotions. Tears are forbidden; they're the mark of weakness. Venting is a luxury I can't afford; I'm expected to swallow my pain, to grin and bear it because others have it worse.

I dared to open up, seeking solace in someone who claimed to care. Instead, my vulnerability was met with silence, with a coldness that cut deep. In that moment, I was reduced, deemed lesser for showing what I thought was strength—my honesty.

Society's definition of strength is suffocating. Emotions are a battlefield, where showing vulnerability is equated with failure. I carry the weight of unspoken words, the burden of unshed tears, all while maintaining a facade of stoicism.

The longing for understanding, for empathy, echoes in the silence of unspoken conversations. I yearn for a space where I can unravel the complexities within me without fear of judgment. But the walls of expectation seem insurmountable, trapping me in a cycle of silent suffering.

How to authentically laugh?

Let something save your life.

Closing my eyes feels like leaving a crowded room,

until memories sting like text alerts, flinching.

How the hours hurry when I am finally left alone to —

sigh.

The hours skate by,

each hour hurries,

that stomach-smack of almost falling

again and again.

There are a million ways to trip on this loop.

Outside, the threat of a warm morning

spreads across my window.

It's true I begged for summer, but now I stumble towards it,

second-guessing the sun with cold feet.

The heat always feels like this—

parkgoers' giddy shrieks from below,

the overheard kind of fun,

like wishing something was canceled.

My 27th birthday looms like a warning.

Still such cold feet.

All blessings disguised,

DIY panic attack.

24 y/o with mobility disability battling failure and depression ,1715831018.0,"I’m 24 and love with a permanent disability called Cerebral Palsy which affects the muscles in my body and I have a hard time with my mobility. 

I studied Graphic Design and graduated from college 4 years ago. I was lucky as I got a job straight out of college and loved it but as my health conditions got worse due to a collapsed ankle and other issues, I was laid off for medical reasons. 

Through that layoff I became so depressed and closed off from everything and everyone I loved and it cost me my relationship at the time. I also stopped taking of myself and let myself get worse through it all. 

Last spring after searching for a job for 6 months I lucked out and got another graphic  design job only to be let go about a month ago due to lack of work and am now stuck waiting on unemployment and have been living off the remnants of my tax return. It’s caused me to go back into a depression as I haven’t been to find new work due to the limited roles I can do with my disability and am barely surviving / making ends meet. I haven’t heard back from any applications I’ve sent in. 

I’ve also made many attempts at my own business over the years but none it of was successful. 

I feel as though everything I’ve ever done has been a complete and utter failure and I’m to the point where I don’t see what my future holds or what’s in store for me anymore. I’m so tired of pretending everything is okay when it hasn’t been for the last 3.5 years for me. 

I used to be so outgoing and passionate about everything I did. I used to be the life of the party, always cheering people up. I’m just not happy anymore and I don’t know if I ever will be again. 

I have 15-ish days left to find a new job if my unemployment doesn’t come through or I have to move as I can no longer afford to cover rent and bills. And can’t afford the moving costs.

"I’m throwing my life away. I’m aware of this, I know what to do and still i can’t change.",1715830534.0,"I’m posting this on main because I don’t care anymore and I hope this gets a bit more traction. I started college this year and ever since I moved out my life has been falling apart. I mean, it’s been declining for years but now it’s going down faster than ever. I mean I made a bunch of friends, started going out and having more fun and became a more outgoing person which is good, other than that it’s been a disaster. I failed pretty much all my classes, I stopped caring about my health, I’ve been skipping meals left and right and eating like shit, I sleep 10-13 hours a day, i can’t get out of bed to do anything and I just avoid every responsibility 24/7. Problem is that my parents are dumping thousands of dollars on me in hopes that I can be successful, I’ve got good friends to guide me and help me make good decisions, I’m in a prestigious college, shit, people would kill for the resources I have and I’m here throwing them away. A million people caring for me and acting in my best interest and I’m single handedly shitting on their collective efforts. Most of the time if my family or friends check in and ask me if I’ve studied and been eating and sleeping right I just lie to them out of shame. I know exactly how to proceed and I got everything I need to have a good life, it would be easy for me, really, but I just don’t want to. And this is obviously an irrational desire, I want to make my parents proud and my friends and myself happy but I don’t feel in control of myself. And people will say “ah you just gotta take control and do this and this”, i don’t want to. No matter what I do, in order to get better I’m gonna have to do things that suck to my brain, but I’m too stubborn to follow through. The drive I think I had to go through bad times to achieve good things is gone. But it’s not even totally gone, I can still do it for others, I just can’t do it for myself. I can only do it performatively, I don’t know if this makes sense. If someone is there to feel bad for me and think highly of me I can do it, if it’s a personal achievement that only I recognize I don’t bother. I always want to focus on others to forget about myself, which is why I practice selfless acts in a selfish way. It’s always about me but I use others as stepping stones. The self sabotaging thing also stems from this, I always act like everything’s in control because i want people to think I’m reliable and upstanding, because I need them to think highly of me. The worst part is that this is only for people who I consider strangers or authority figures in my life. And “strangers could be people that I know, just that I’m not very emotionally connected with. The people who I consider my friends I treat like shit. I discount all of my frustrations on them in the form of not caring for their feelings or wellbeing in the slightest. This is because I know that they’re not gonna stop being my friends, if things do get shaky I’ll “remember” how to be their best friends and things get patched after some drinks and a good time. Why I manipulate my family and friends and play with their feelings is beyond me. After these big introspections I always get to the same conclusion, which is that I don’t know what the fuck is the answer but this time I wrote it down in hopes that a stranger might make something out of it. So yeah, venting to the internet feels pretty good. Thanks.

Asking for Advice from anyone who has dealt with diabetes and mental health ,1715829194.0,"This incident happened a few days ago.

I have a younger brother who is type 1 diabetic for the last 15 years.  He was diagnosed early in adulthood. Since then he has constantly struggled to keep his levels in check.  He does well for a few years at a time but has emergency incidents every few years where he is on the verge of a diabetic coma or has had a severe car accident because he passed out on the road.  His most recent incident (the other day) was compounded by depression due to a series of extremely stressful events he’s been having in life.  This most recent incident (his blood sugar was at 305) had him feeling suicidal and hearing violent voices that made him feel like he was going crazy. He’s always been a quiet and mild manner person so this was extremely off from who he is. In that moment he was telling us he was cursed and the voices wanted him to die and he was telling us goodbye. Because we were afraid for his well being and had never seen this behavior before we contacted the suicidal hotline and they recommended a 5150 hold. This then led him to a psychiatric hospital for a few days.  Sorry this story is soo long winded.  The doctor diagnosed him with depression, bi polar, and schizophrenia. They said he was in mania. He was prescribed and now taking antipsychotic meds and anxiety meds for the past few days. The doctor mentioned that he could have been battling the underlying mental conditions and when his diabetes got out of control it brought forth a condition he already had for years. We had known that he would talk to himself from time to time (most of his adulthood) but never thought anything of it. We would wonder why he would be talking to himself but say he was thinking about his day out loud. 

He’s been home from the hospital after a few days and now he is saying he’s better, no longer hearing voices, and it was all related to the depression and not acknowledging being diagnosed with schizophrenia even though he’s taking this new medicine. Not having much experience with mental disorders  how do we proceed from here?  I am nervous for my family as he’s in the home and find it concerning that someone who went through such a traumatic experience is saying he’s fine. Is this common or is significant issue waiting to happen if this is all bubbling below the surface? Also being on antipsychotic meds is there some difference we should expect?

Express self or relieve stress,1715828165.0,"I feel stressed and depressed and I think it stems from resentment for my wife. Fo the past 13 years she has suffered from anxiety and ocd with obsessive thoughts about “things from the past” that she wont elaborate on. She has finally started to see a therapist and is on new medication. This year has been especially hard as she has become more aggressive , blammed me for agitating her and causing her to be suicidal. She has even threatened to kill herself in front of me and held sharp objects to her wrist. 

For the last 13 years I have been the financial provider (which I dont mind) but I do this because she was really mean and hateful to me when she was stressed from work. I do the majority of the chores, all the cooking and I am expected to bring her food to bed for every meal. She is not physically handicapped but insists it is something I need to do to show love to her. When I ask her to help out a little by serving her own food she threatens to get a job (which she knows causes her to be mean) , tells me to stop cooking for her and becomes really angry an agressive then it turns into a mental roller coaster where I am again the reason for her suicidal ideations. 

I dont mind taking care of her but I feel more like a servant. I work long hours. Serve her. And our sexual relationship is non-existent as in the past 15 years we have maybe had sexual relations 10 times.

"I want to die so badly, but not kill myself.",1715827224.0,"This is my first time posting on reddit, I don’t know why I’m posting this, I don’t know if people care, and I’m scared this will somehow be linked with my reddit account and people I know will know that I have said this.

I am a 17M and I go to a fairly-prestigious private school and take sports where I have to get up at 4:45 am, practice until 7:30, then school from 8:00 to 4:00, then practice again until 6:30 pm, and blah blah blah. 

The point is, for the entirety of my teen life all I have known is work, work, and work. I once said to my parents (I have a complicated relationship with them) that they may work from 9 to 5, but I work from 5 to 9 (which is really 11). 

Life has been hell for the last few years, I have lost all my friends due to speaking out against a sexual assaulter, I have lost all my prestige and skill in my sport due to physiological conditions causing unfathomable levels of pain, and my parents are mentally unstable and take advantage me and make my life a living hell every day.

This, combined with the shitstorm on the horizon that is worrying over college, getting a job, owning a home, and I think I somewhat speak for the rest of my generation when I say this, trying to f survive, I have had nobody and I guess I could say this really turned me on to God, and meditation, and other stuff to try and make swallowing the pill of my existence barely manageable day by day.

When I was 15 I was lucky enough to experience love, and I’m not going to blabber on about the details since you guys probably don’t care. What seemed to be a once in a lifetime experience, especially, from the way I see it, for anyone in my generation, I have looked everywhere to try and have someone who could love me like that, that I so wanted, especially in my time of need.

But I never found it again. Something about women in this generation is deeply repulsing. I don’t know how to explain it, but just all the pornography and sexual stuff on the internet, the fact that women my age post bikini pictures of themselves and constantly hooking up “to the highest bidder” (whoever is richest, has the nicest stuff, whatever) and are doing this for months on months on end sickens me somewhere to the core. My crush the first day I stepped foot in high school, who behaved in such a way that was so polite and refined, has hooked up with her 6th dude now (who is in college) to go to prom with.

In every trial I have gone through in my life, never had the conditions been as dire as the one I am going through now. I do not have friends; I purposefully hide in back corners of libraries and lunchrooms to avoid being ganged up on, and my parents are beyond incompetent. These would be manageable for any teenager, but given the circumstances of the world and the future for us, it isn’t like there is anything concrete or positive that awaits us somewhere out there.

Anyways, the meaning behind the title is that every night, when I am alone and scared over the work of the next day, or what may happen, or whatever, I have developed the unhealthy habit of imagining some blank-faced figure loving me; someone holding me, telling me everything is okay; caressing me in her arms and saying that she will be there for me, that she justifies my existence on this planet.

And then reality hits, in my bed, when nothing is real and it’s all an imagination, and it hurts even more than before. This is a spiral, and it gets so bad that in my dreams “she” comes to me, and when the alarm wakes life’s pain is multiplied by so many degrees. Even the agony my physiological conditions gives me during practice (btw, I still HAVE to practice in agony for colleges, and the job prospects, getting a house, starting a family, and whatever in this chaotic collapsing nation), with its searing and paralyzing pain, is nothing like this.

Anyways, I guess after throwing a hissy fit and vomiting all this text for you to read, I do now have some questions. Do I sacrifice my self dignity and future for someone to possibly take advantage of me, and receiving affection in return? Or do I keep going down this path of misery which I have no idea how much longer I can bear?

Hi,

This is my first time really discussing getting mental health help/talking about what is happening in my life. I am using a throwaway because I don't want to get doxxed.

I am a 20 year old going into my junior year of college in the fall. On paper, I feel like I shouldn't have any reason to have trouble with my mental health. I was raised in a good family, although my parents divorced when I was young, I am in a fraternity, I have friends, I have a long term girlfriend, and I don't ever really have to worry about money thanks to my family.

I have noticed a downturn in my mental health for the past couple of years. In the past I dealt with feeling bad (attributed to my first heartbreak) but never got professional help before. Recently I have been feeling an aching sadness in my chest and stomach that seems to appear out of nowhere. I try to be emotionally intelligent and never hold back my emotions with my friends and family, so I feel like my sadnesses never really have the opportunity to build up and burst. Though in recent times I will get hit with waves of sadness out of nowhere. I feel worthless, I feel like I'm nothing, I feel like I don't deserve to be alive. I know that I shouldn't feel these things and that I AM worth something. I feel like I love myself and I shouldn't change anything about me.

Despite my efforts at trying to keep a positive mindset it always feels like I come back to the same feelings of low self-esteem and self-pity. I cannot keep myself from tearing up in the car and I don't understand what is wrong with my own mind. 95% of the time I feel perfect and on top of the world, I'm blessed to live a fortunate life full of love and good relationships. 5% of the time it feels like the world is crashing down on me and I can't do anything. The feelings aren't extremely severe, but I always have motions of feeling like a nobody and I should hate myself. I hate that I'm a people pleaser, I hate that I can't confront people when I should, I just spiral into a series of negative thoughts and recently this has started to affect other aspects of my life.

Today I started feeling a wave of sadness again and I couldn't even kick it when I went out to dinner with my mom and brother. I just don't understand what is wrong with me. When I feel okay again it seems laughable that I even had those issues. I insist that everything is okay in my life and that everyone goes through ups and downs. I don't know what to do anymore. The sadness hits in waves and seems to be random when it comes in periods. I will go months being okay and then spiral down into bad mental health. I feel like my condition isn't serious enough to warrant a diagnosis of anxiety or depression or anything, but I just feel like shit sometimes.

My brain tries to rationalize it by saying that everyone gets sad, but when I get down and have those feelings of low self-worth I cannot seem to get rid of the nagging voice in my head saying I need help. I haven't talked to my parents about this and I have never been to therapy before. I have talked to my girlfriend a little about it but I don't want to burden her. I am completely lost. I want to emphasize again that 95% of the time when I feel no sadness it literally is laughable that I was ever sad in the first place. I don't understand what is happening. Where do I go from here? I am so scared to talk to my parents about going to therapy. I don't even know how to bring it up. I have been very stoic all of my life and am trying to show my emotions more, but my parents have no idea I've been going through this for the past few years.

Over the past two years, I would say I have had probably had 3 1-2 week spirals of ""going through the motions."" Is this normal? I am lost. When I get down all I know is I feel bad, sometimes it gets to the point where I feel like I don't even deserve to exist, although I know that's not true. Would anybody be able to point me in the direction of what I should do, should I keep going on without getting professional help? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Even now I feel silly for making this post. I don't know why my problems seem so little when I start feeling better. Sorry for the ranting/ramble. I appreciate you all for reading if you make it this far.

I've just realized what my problem is...,1715826087.0,"I've been pretty content with my life overall for a long time, but I've never been just happy, and I think I finally realized why. I don't think I have a personality. I feel like I just copy what everyone else around me likes, or what a lot of people seem to like in general, and just accept that I like those things without actually enjoying them. Most of the time, I'm fine with the things I do, but I want to be more than fine. I want to enjoy things. I used to think I liked playing video games, but those got pretty boring after a while, and playing them now just feels like I'm looking for something engaging to kill time, instead of playing because I enjoy them. I used to think I liked anime, but I've convinced myself it's a bad idea to get into it, just because I know it would waste so much of my life away if I were to (and I know I would) ever get addicted to it. I used to think I liked playing soccer, but other than being mildly more fun than the other things I've described, it's the same story.

Im thinking maybe I need to do a dopamine detox to get back into enjoying life, but how can I do that when I don't even know what to take a detox from. Life seems boring. I still have responsibilities like studying. and preparing for college, but doing something out of necessity without having any positive or negative feelings about it seems bleak as well.

I'm not particularly depressed, but I'm not happy either. I just kind of exist and life on every day. What can I do to fix this?

Cant take it anymore,1715825804.0,"Last night I had a dream where I was in a school, and I saw a girl crying, so i went up to her and gave her a hug and began to comfort her. Next thing i knew, I was in a hospital room sitting on the edge of the bed, the same girl who I guess was my nurse walked up. Long story short parts of her body were invisible (chest, legs, etc) and she said something like ""sorry you cant see those"" and I remember replying with ""I dont care about those, all I want it you"" then I remember being in a strange place with many people my age, and this same girl. I kept asking her to give me and chance, then I began to sing a song to try and impress her, some other guy copied me, so I began to sing a different song (its beginning to look a lot like christmad) but then quickly switch to the song I dont wanna set the world of fire. Then I received a text in which she said she'd said she felt the same about me. I remember holding her and she felt so real, I dont know how to describe the feeling it gave me. I didnt even think about sex or anything like that, I just felt loved. Truly loved, I felt companionship. I woke up clutching my pillow like I usually do and it hit me that it was a dream. The whole day I waiting for the night to come so I can return to my dream, if that even happened. I hardly get dreams like this, if I do its usually a ""luustful"" dream that I try to forgot. I just want to stay in that dream forever... I'm not even 16 and I'm going thru a midlife crisis. It's not even funny the shit I go through.

Sleeping problems,1715825561.0,"Hi all! First off, I don't really know how to explain this properly and It could just be nothing to worry about but for years I've been hearing voices in my head as I'm trying to fall asleep or extremely loud bangs like a bloody bomb has just gone off, enough to make me jump a mile!. They are really sudden and so unexpected. 

The voices can be male and female, usually it's a female voice though and can range from my name being said or someone trying to say something to me, sometimes I can understand what this ""thing"" is trying to say but never remember by the next morning. 

You might say to write it down or why haven't I and tbh it's because I've been having them for so many years I'm really not bothered 'persay' in the voices and what they got to say, so I never feel the need. Tbh in a strange way I find it quite cool but kinda scary at the same time. 

I know about that ""half awake / half asleep hallucinations "" but why does it happen so random-frequently and the really strange thing is...

Why doesn't it happen NOW that I use noise cancelling earplugs?. 

I found this out a few years back because funnily enough...🙄...me girlfriend snores like a sodding trooper! So the only way to sleep properly is alone and with the earplugs in and ever since I've not had a loud...BANG!!! So suddenly and...well... the only shame is the voices, really.  because I don't hear them either anymore. 

It's rather strange I know but when you've had something like this since being a kid and you've always been curious to what it is,.. is it all in my head?, am I loosing the absolute plot?, or is it something from somewhere else? 🤔. 

'Probably the plot one though! 🤣🤣'

I'll leave this one upto you's.

Dealing with INTENSE suicidal ideation.,1715825344.0,I have nobody to talk to right now. My emotions and thoughts are so intense that I'm in tears. I don't know what to do.

Why do resort to hitting myself as a coping mechanism,1715824648.0,"
I am sorry for the post being so all over the place. I had another episode of hitting myself and so I am very upset :/

Whenever I get upset or emotionally unstable (which is often the case) I hit my head or slap myself extremely violently until either my hand or body is bruised. I didn't use to be this bad but I almost wonder if I have hormonal imbalance issues or if I really am mentally extremely ill and I would have to talk to a professional to solve this. 

Is there anyone who was able to get out of self harming tendencies without therapy or drug intervention?

I have been struggling with emotional instability for the past 7 months or so. I have always been an ""over thinker"" and rather emotionally sensitive but the past few months have been especially challenging for me and it has gotten significantly worse in the past two months.

Long story short, although my self esteem has always been very low, recent relationship + family + job issues all kind of blowing up at the same time pushed me to a worse place. 

But the thing is I'm not trying to put the blame on certain bad events that happened in my life—I think I have almost gotten used to negative thinking that regardless of how catastrophic some event is, I know I would choose to do make bad decisions (such as self harm, getting angry at closed ones, etc) because often times I feel like my life is already so fucked up and feel trapped because I am seemingly unable to improve a lot of the things that *I* messed up and just want to stop living life entirely. And then I feel irresponsible and pathetic for not being able to change myself and change my life towards a good direction.

I tried to at first do simple things that actually don't involve reflection of abstract, almost daunting existential questions (such as what is my purpose in life, my goal, what kind of person I am) because frankly I have spent the past seven months being so miserable for who I am. And somehow those grand questions made me feel even more hopeless.

So it started with working out. Eating healthier. Doing music (I very much enjoy playing my instrument) and all those things.

But still, this issue of me having explosive blowups/meltdowns/self harm tendencies are yet to be resolved.

 I almost wonder if I am narcissistic because I can find reasons to hate myself in essentially everything/everyone I see in life and it's almost like I'm hyperfixating on ""how fucked up I am"" more than anything else.

 For example, if my boyfriend is struggling emotionally/mentally with something, and I sense that I cannot make him feel better, instead of just understanding that ""yeah he must really be having a hard time and doesn't really have capacity at the moment to necessarily discuss these with me. I will just provide him support and company"" or something like that, I just drag out all negative events/emotions that happened both within and outside the relationship to feel anger because:

1. I am a worthless girlfriend because I can't make my boyfriend feel better but I make him feel worse
2. I can't even do one thing correctly my life is completely fucked up

So yeah if there was a flow chart to my thought process, all the arrows would just end up at ""my life is fucked up and I'm worthless"" 

Which I think may be narcissistic qualities. I just don't really have a good picture on what kind of reflections could help...

It's essentially ruining my life and also my relationships. My family is abroad and I cannot rely on them nor do I feel relaxed when visiting them. I don't really have friends and my relationship is also at jeopardy  since I have been so emotionally unstable.

TLDR; I have anger issues, I hit myself to release self hate but continues to put me at a deeper hole. I want to live life",99jlj,,False,1ct1ycw,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ct1ycw/why_do_resort_to_hitting_myself_as_a_coping/

So I've just turned 17, Shit felt really slow and enjoyable maybe because I didn't know much of the work back then ever since I was a kid till 2017.  
In 2017, maybe because I got a little more serious in life and started worrying more about my career and also started wasting around 6 hours of my life on the PC playing roblox or watching youtube like every other guy in my class. Maybe that contributed, Or maybe the constant stress that I had about my future like what collage would I go to and shit and the constant stress from the bullies or people that I overfixated on back then COMBINED with the thousands of hours that I wasted on the screen in between 2017 to 2019 made me escape and just make the phase unenjoyable and not so memorable.

And then the infamous 2020 era from 2020 till 2022 left a really shit impact on me, I started indulging in all of the bad habits that you could think of other than substances. Wasting probably around 10+ Hours of my day on the screen consistently between the time period which is probably the main culprit that has caused me to think that time flied past. I got so so used to that phase of mine that I still feel like was just yesterday

I’m stuck in one place while everyone is moving on ,1715813176.0,"Hello. I’m 18m (and autistic).

For the last few years, I’ve tried being as independent as I possibly can. I had a bad upbringing from a broken family and was abused by my stepfamily (who are gone now after my stepdad cheated on my mum when I was 11).

I absolutely hate relying on people, because I was taught from a young age that my anxiety was a burden and it made me unlikeable.

I’m so angry because of how difficult it is to GET help though. I have bad panic attacks, bad anxiety, and depression. I want to be proactive and get better, and I’m willing to put that work in, but the most I’ve been able to get is antidepressants that haven’t helped. I spoke to a doctor today who felt bad for me because he was convinced I needed urgent help but couldn’t really do anything aside from trying to refer me to people (with waiting lists longer than a year).

I feel so angry because I want to be successful. I want to be able to leave the house, get a job. I want to indulge myself in education and get better qualifications. It seems though no matter how hard I try, no matter how hard I push myself again and again, I just cannot do it? I feel like a coward because of this. I’ve been trying to take the bus and leave the house, but I am so scared.

I’m not mentally well enough to get a job, but I’m not actually getting any mental support? It’s such an awful place to be stuck in. Im not waiting for someone to save me, but I’m also aware that I do need professional help. I can’t sit in the car for 10 minutes, or be out of the house for long. 

My friends are all going to university and celebrating together right now (I’m not in school), and I hate that I feel jealous. I’m happy for them, but it feels like they are celebrating everything I can’t do. They are going on vacations and spending time with their families, while I am at home trying to find remote work and failing. I feel so ashamed of myself.

I feel myself spiraling in my body image issues and i'm not sure what to do,1715810822.0,"I'm 19F and am back home for the summer after studying at university for first year. I've always struggled with depression and anxiety and have been diagnosed with both since I was a young teenager. I've only been able to seek treatment for it earlier this year since I moved out of my family home and first year of uni was super stressful. 

One of the biggest stressors in my life in general has always been my body image. As a young kid I was super active and was always really skinny, however around when I hit puberty, my depression began and I withdrew from the world including all the activities I did before. This led to some weight gain in my middle school years though I was always teetering the line between ""healthy"" and ""overweight."" I never faced any judgement or remarks from my peers and I had great friends throughout middle school and high school that significantly made my life much better. 

The worst treatment I got came from my family members. I come from a background where the vast majority of people are really thin and my family members are no different. As a teenager, my extended family would constantly call me names and would talk amongst themselves about how my parents were terrible people for letting me get so ""fat."" This led to my parents repeating these behaviours towards me as well and I recall one time where my mother cried to me because everyone in my extended family thought she was a bad parent and that I made her look like a fool. This behaviour by them was on a daily basis and I even lived with some extended family members so I could never really get out of that environment. I always knew that this treatment was hurtful and wrong, but my family lived in the same area as one another so it was difficult for me to get away. 

I never had a diagnosed ED and I honestly don't think any behaviours I've done are significant enough to even fit the diagnostic criteria (i've tagged this post as such just to be safe but i'm **not** looking for a diagnosis here lol) , however I have always been in cycles where I would eat lots of food to ""spite"" the people calling me names and then restrict my food intake due to guilt. This carried on all the way until I entered university where I was able to finally seek treatment for my other disorders and managed to get a healthier relationship with food.

Being back home, though, sort of sends me back into the same mindset as I was back in middle/high school. My parents have gotten nicer, yes, but they still feel the need to make unnecessary comments about my body even though I've lost a significant amount of weight since they last saw me. I've started going to the gym about 5x a week and have also found myself tracking my calories so I don't eat as much and I also have refused to see any friends back in my hometown as I don't want them to look at me at the moment. Additionally, when I told my mom I started going to the gym, I felt such an immense amount of shame that I don't think I've ever felt before. 

I'm not really sure what's going on, but I don't think this is a very healthy spiral I'm going down on. I see a therapist every week, but I've only started going to her recently and I'm not entirely comfortable with spilling all this to her yet (even though im currently doing so to a bunch of online strangers lol).
