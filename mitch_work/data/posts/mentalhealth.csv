To feel mentally ill has honestly got to be the biggest curse ,1716150922.0,"I’m at the point in life where I feel so much grief. I feel so much grief over the person I could’ve been have I grown up in a better environment. Had I grew up with parents who were emotionally intelligent and took consideration of my emotional and mental needs. I get tired of hearing “you need to get over your past”, when someone’s past is a major part of them. I’m not saying it should be a reflection but it’s definitely hard. I’m such an emotional over thinker and it’s exhausting. I just feel as if I’m so detained and there’s nothing I can do at the moment to escape not feeling so down about my life. The biggest thing I want in life is be financially stable and successful.

I feel empty if i am not waiting for something,1716150854.0,"I don't understand how this works, but I don't experience anything exept nothing if i don't wait for something 

For example, a year ago my phone was broken and i was waiting for my birthday to get a new one, then - emptiness 

Same when I was waiting for Christmas, after - nothing 

Now - i had a crush on one girl and waited for a month, feeling emotions as usual, then after confession (and my first ever rejection) - I feel empty again 

How do i stop this feeling?

Or will life will always keep me waiting?

Is this platonic love or “love” love (romantic),1716146508.0,"Hi all, 

So I have this friend from work with whom I talk daily since Dec last year. We have shared almost all of our darkest secrets and we call each other brothers. 

Last weekend he called folks from work for a weekend party. He was really busy with them (and called our common friend “family away from family”). This is a regular pattern with me that whenever he gets too comfortable and talks with his other friends, I become extremely jealous. Last week he was saying words like “bro you are the best” “you are my family” and it hit me so hard. I was depressed and felt that in this friendship, I don’t mean that much to him as he means to me. 

This is so weird. Is this normal friendship jealousy? 

1. I always wait for his calls. Whenever he calls, my mood lightens up and my day becomes happier. It’s fixed he will call for sure, but then again I am just waiting and waiting and thinking about him all day. 

2. He has a habit of saying “bro”, “you are so good bro” “you are the best boi” etc to others. But still I feel jealous. 

Am I experiencing platonic love? I will be honest here, I sometimes watch gay porn but I have no romantic interest in men. I sometimes think about hugging him and all. But I don’t want to suck his dick. I just want to cuddle him like a kid, kiss him on the head and say that I am lucky to have a friend like him. I just want happiness for him is all. 

Any advice what am I experiencing? ",But_how23,,False,1cvw1c1,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvw1c1/is_this_platonic_love_or_love_love_romantic/

Does being sexualized as a child effect you like this?,1716142747.0,"As an adult i am scared of intimacy, being sexualized, and just relationships in general, I think it might have something to do with my childhood but idk. So as a kid I talked to random strangers online and got groomed. But I always had a feeling it was wrong so I never let them like do anything sexual. But they still sexualized me despite saying it made me uncomfortable. And me being uncomfortable with sexual stuff made them sexualize me more, because I was so “innocent, pure, and quirky”. There was one particular guy that I talked to for 2 years ish, from age 14-16, he was 2 years older than me. He confessed his love for me so many times and dated my friend and other people to make me jealous, but it didn’t work because I absolutely hated him and wanted him to die. He’d always manipulate my friends and me saying stuff like “I should just commit suicide, no one would care anyways”. Please do. I remember praying to god that this man would kill himself, or die in some way. I told my friends I hated him and didn’t want to talk to him but they wouldn’t take no for an answer and kept making me talk to him. He said he had wet dreams about me and a bunch of other stuff happened and it all made me uncomfortable. I think It really made my personality switch. He’d always say how I was kind, pure, and innocent. And how I was so nice to everyone, so I just tried to be a total bitch. And I don’t know if I ever stopped. I was also sexualized by older men, growing up I worked at a restaurant with my mom when I was 13-14 ish, and old men would always compliment me but in a really weird way. “You’re so much prettier than your (adult) sister”. “You look like you’re old enough to run the bar!” And a bunch of other crap like that. I’ve had many other creepy coworkers since then, I think the most appalling one was “don’t worry daddy’s got you”- a 50 year old man after i made a mistake. But also as a kid I wasn’t allowed to hang out with my best friend (who was a boy) because my parents thought we’d do sexual acts together, MIND YOU THIS WAS LIKE 2ND-7TH GRADE. I remember bawling my eyes out in the church basement because I was so sickened that my parents would think that about me. I remember just wanting to not be sexualized. My dad also is kind of sexist and says stuff like; “when women started voting this country went to hell” “I can’t imagine being a women and being infertile, I mean that’s my only purpose” and just a bunch of stuff like that. I told him how I wanted to move to a city one day and just try it out and he was like but the end times!!! And so I said I’ve spent my whole childhood caring and grieving about politics and the end of the world, I’m so tired of caring, it’s not good for me to worry about that stuff. “Well you’ll be caring when they’re raping you!!” What. What the fuck? My parents are Christians and taught me what’s right and wrong from an early age so I think that’s just been drilled into my brain and effects the way I live now. But I don’t know, I’m just kind of mad at myself because I don’t want to be in a relationship and never have even though I’m 18. I feel like I’m missing out but the idea of doing all that disgusts me.

"Feeling hopeless, no resources",1716141407.0,"Hi, 

I would like to apologise in advance if this comes across as whiney or rambly.

I have been struggling a lot recently. I have anxiety, depression and ptsd. I have been described as neurotic and I would unfortunately have to agree.  

So here’s what’s been happening:

My marriage is breaking down and I am in contact with a solicitor trying to sort out a legal separation. (I have to be legally separated for 12 months before being granted a divorce in the country I live in).  I got married in the hopes of having the stability and family I never had as a child. I know it was stupid. Our differences are irreconcilable and they will never put me before their drinking. They have also told me that they dont want to make any changes because it is “too hard” so I am currently running myself ragged trying to save us from poverty. It is what it is. 

My remaining family members genuinely do not care about me. It’s not an exaggeration or pity party, it’s just a statement of fact. We grew up in terrible circumstances and as a result have gone our separate ways. 

I have a job that I previously loved but my manager does not like me. I have tried to be on his good side and complied with everything but I ended up on stress leave (which my manager encouraged me to go on). When I returned from leave, I was met with a “PIP” despite no issues being raised with my performance and passing my probation with no concerns last year. I am devastated and humiliated because I know what a PIP means for my long term career. A PIP is usually given after an extended period of time with poor performance and a minimum of 3 warnings, it basically means “we want to fire you but we can’t yet.” My colleagues were shocked to hear I had received this.

Given the divorce, it’s looking like I will have to sell my house and split the proceeds and with the state of finances in my country, there is a good chance I will not be able to afford even a 1 bedroom flat.  

My one thing that is keeping me going are my animals. They are my entire life and I love them with every fibre of my being.

I have a history of self harm and suicidal ideations. I thought I had kicked these when I was a teenager but they have resurfaced alongside stress induced hallucinations (I have never experienced this before but my gp is not concerned as I can tell instantly if it’s a hallucination.)

I have reached out to my gp multiple times and a local mental health organisation but there is little interest or support other than “take time off work and stop stressing.” and “if you tackle the source of the stress, the hallucinations will go away.”

I tried to explain that this is a crisis but they cannot help. One organisation did offer me an appointment for speaking therapy in about 2 weeks which was very kind of them as I can no longer afford my private therapist (I’m £900 into my overdraft and my car keeps breaking down)

I reached out to the only sister I remain close (ish) to and understandably she cannot help.

My friends are getting tired of me not being fun anymore and are getting noticeably irritated with me so I am distancing myself from them (I did try to tell them a bit about what’s going on but it doesn’t really make a difference.)

I can’t tell my workplace.

My world is falling apart but I can’t kill myself because I cannot trust my ex partner to take care of my animals. I also do not want my ex to lose out on my life insurance. If I cause my own death, they will not receive any money and I know they cannot afford the mortgage and bills alone. They do not love me but I do not want them to suffer.

I am lost and feel hopeless. Has anyone else experienced any of the above? Do you have any advice or can you share your story with me?

Thank you in advance and I sincerely apologise for any grammatical or spelling errors.

How do i stop being friends with someone online?,1716137309.0,"I decided i want to delete all of my social media accounts which i did. I feel better without them. But i have one account left and i made an online friend there. We've been talking for +/- 6 months and i dont want to leave without a word. It was nice at first, she was really kind and i think maybe too kind. I dont know if i was love-bombed. I never felt fully comfortable with her, and sometimes i was wondering if she really likes me. When we didnt talk i felt like she saw me as enemy but when i texted her she told me she was worried and she miss me and cried over me. She started talking to me first when we met but after some time if i didnt text her it was silence for even a month. Sometimes when i told her something she missed a whole point. We had few deep convos till late night and it was nice but everything feels weird lately. I cant talk to her, i already destroyed my mental health talking with her. Deleting my account means not talking to her again but i dont have a heart to hurt her. Social media is draining me and online friendships are not for me. I know if i text her about leaving she will say she understand but i know she will cry and i dont want to hurt her. 
She told me many times im good person and she was sending me long paragraphs that im an angel and she wants to meet me one day. I dont want her to think im bad person, i just feel the spark is gone and i learned my lesson. I changed a bit since we meet and I want to focus on myself, my health and future and i think a break from internet will be good for me.

My sister went to a mental hospital at the age of 14 and now she’s more manipulative than she was before ,1716140559.0,"My sister had problems with her mental heath and ended up going to a residential. She was there for 3 months. Prior to this she didn’t know how to express her feelings without yelling, and would get agitated easily. She also has a problem “dating” people and getting really attached and shing when they break up. She’s 14 and has had over 20 “boyfriends” as soon as one leaves the next comes. 

She’s always had a problem going to school. Well now she’s dating a kid who doesn’t go to school either and has a dying grandpa(mirroring her,) and she’s particularly attached. She says the kid is nice to her and helps her but he comes to the house and just plays video games and when she calls him he doesn’t talk to her because he’s playing video games. He’s sat in her room and said nothing while she’s SHing. He threatens to beat up his caregiver. 

My mother told my sister the kid wouldn’t be able to come over any more and he’s grounded. Sister stole moms phone and started freaking out saying my moms a liar(she usually is) and then started taking pics of my moms texts to the kids caretaker. When I asked her what she was upset about she just kept saying “moms a liar” and eventually told me stuff we already knew (my sister and her boyfriend lied about going to school and then they went into my parents room and took down the security cameras they had in my moms room). 

I told her I didn’t understand why she’s so upset. We already knew this. I told her I can’t understand her and she’s gotta stop screaming and crying if she wants to talk cuz I can’t understand her. She then starts to scream bloody murder at the top of her lungs and I tell her to take a deep breath and she starts saying I’m yelling at her and runs out the door. (She hasn’t eaten since 9 last night, she doesn’t drink water, she’s probably a little bit stoned, and doesn’t have shoes on) so I tell her to come back inside and that the only people inside are me and the cats. She starts to run away screaming at me saying I’m yelling(I do have a problem with raising my voice that I’ve been working on cuz my sister says it triggers her) I was not raising my voice. She then picked up a bike and chucked it in my direction and kept yelling at me saying I’m yelling at her. I told her to just go back inside, she kept screaming and I said finallly “so you get to be mean and yell and scream but yelling triggers you?” She went inside. 

She started throwing stuff inside and then shoved me and scratched me cuz I was standing by the door she wanted to go in. 

She knows about triggers and stuff now but she’s worse in almost every way than when she went into the hospital. It’s like she went in there trying to absorb the knowledge to fix other people and didn’t focus on how to help herself.

Mental Breakdown - Advice Needed,1716136276.0,"My family and I are in desperate need for some advice on how to help a family member currently having a complete mental breakdown.   We know drugs and alcohol are a factor, but he seems to be showing signs of bipolar or even schizophrenia (whether chemically induced or not, we do not know).  

In the past week, he has sent out an email to VPs at work with whistleblowing type accusations, pushed a coworker,  kicked off the property of work and told not to come back. He thinks he’s on vacation.   After all of this, we receive a call from police Thursday evening saying he has locked himself in his apartment and is destroying it.  He is a gun owner so they were afraid to enter.  They were called after several neighbors saying he was walking around saying he was lost, then when he made it home he went out on his balcony nude, yelling profanities.   After not letting them in for 2 hours, they left to hopefully de-escalate the situation.  That night he destroyed his apartment (tore cabinets off walls, ripped faucets out - breaking pipes and flooding his and surrounding apartments).  

The kicker is, after that night, he wakes up to said destroyed apartment and acts like nothing happened and everything is fine. Not denial, truly believing nothing is wrong even surrounded by his destroyed apartment.  The neighbors took his dog in all of this and he doesn’t even notice until the next evening, then claims the dog has been with him this whole time (he is also saying the dog can talk to him).  He truly believes he was asleep this whole time and the police came in and destroyed his apartment.  The following evening, he started tearing up the flooded floors in his apartment, making it sound like he was working a job site and fixing the floors. 

He refuses to get help (my parents are now with him from out of state) and truly does not believe anything is wrong. Nothing he is saying makes sense to anyone but him.  We have tried everything we can think of but he needs to be in a mental health facility.  We are afraid he may hurt himself or others if he comes back to reality and realizes all that has happened.  

The police have been zero help.  We obviously would prefer he be in a  facility over jail cell but don’t know what to do.  To get an involuntary mental hold (since he is unwilling to walk in), we need medical proof that he needs it (makes zero sense, Texas sucks). 

Is anyone in Texas that is familiar with the laws and anything we can do?  We just want to help him.  This isn’t him, but no one seems willing to help him unless he physically harms himself or others.

"I feel like most of my peers either ignore me, laugh at me, or outright hate me— I think they don’t understand me. (M23) Can someone read this short version of my adult life so far and give me some advice or encouragement? I feel really alone..",1716135729.0,"I don’t really know where to begin. I guess with describing myself; I’m an I usual person in my eyes at least. I’m heavily interested in topics no one else is like history and politics but also have super high aspirations of being an entrepreneur (am in school for business). My 23 years of life thus far have been anything but easy for the average person: since birth both parents either in jail or rehab, raised by grandparents until just before high school, foster care 4 years of high school, covid pandemic second semester of college(dropped out). The most negatively impactful experiences on my adult life have been the following: late 2020 I began a relationship with a woman who would end up taking me through a rollercoaster of a toxic relationship and that brought the out the worst in me. This relationship was filled with manipulation, mind games, verbal abuse, and even some serious domestic violence/threat against my life on one occasion; all done to me by her. This relationship left me with absolutely no sense of myself, I did not know what way was up or down for the longest. The relationship ended late 2022 but even now almost 2 years later I’m not still fully recovered. During the time between the relationship ending until right now at this very moment I have lost three love ones: my grandfather who raised me, my grandmother who raised me, and my biological father just three months ago. As you could imagine I also struggling with alcoholism and substance abuse but never hard drugs (was just a really bad pothead like all day every day). 

That’s the background and context to myself, I should also add this all takes places in a small town where everyone knows everyone, now for why I’m really here:
It feels like the majority of my peers either ignore me, laugh at me, or hate me; and for no good reason. It’s almost like they don’t understand my weirdness and also don’t understand mental illness. I’m a rare case in that I’m a man who was in an abusive relationship with a woman and have C-PTSD from it (yes I see a therapist). I really try not to care what people think/say about me but it’s hard when it feels like it’s everyone. Really the only ones who care for me are my foster family and maybe 3 friends but I never ever get to see those friends as they have full time jobs or work, so I’m a pretty lonely guy. 

I just wish someone would take the time to listen and understand. I’m not ugly, mean, or rude; I’m not a comedian but I’m pretty funny, I am not ugly in appearance but also not strikingly handsome. I like to think I’m a pretty decent human being just one who’s been through a lot. Idk what I’m doing wrong. Maybe it’s because I’m a male and maybe people automatically assume mental health struggles means you’re crazy. (I’m only slightly crazy but not straight jacket crazy lol)

My manager has been keeping telling me, and even whisper at the other employees and managers that I was slow, even when I did everything to get alittle faster but she still thinks my techniques are slow, she always expect everything to get done, even with the trays, people would just throw the trays and just wash them, even when sauces are still there, so I had to do 10 second timer to make sure I got everything done and making sure it's clean, cause I kept seeing reviews how customers complain how the trays are never clean. ( I work at Burger King)

Then just everyone expect you to do there chores for you, I can't handle more then 3 or 4 task at once, one women just handed the stuffs to me, shouted "" Ok I'm done"" and just clocked out, I was confuse and pissed. Then she complained how I didn't do the dishes right, and got upset when I explain it needs to hand wash, telling me"" That's not how our managers told us?!"" Which just pissed me off more. 

I can't handle when people called me slow, lazy, or even just even people making me do things for them, cause being treated differently, expectfuly people thinking ADHD people are weird. So I had to be fast as I can just not to upset someone, but to my boss I'm still slow to her, she didn't even tell me how to make things faster, for days until she told me how to do it, I asked "" Why didn't you just show me sooner instead your just saying I'm slow"" which she didn't say anything and just walked away, even when there was a couple of times I couldn't come in to work, expectfuly when I'm sick, she tried to make me feel bad, which sometimes works, but even when I'm sick, I told her I couldn't come in, and she demanded that I did, I had to remind her I could end up everyone getting sick and she has to find extra new employees to hire, which made her shut up and left me alone.

Another girl at work won't stop begging me to buy her food, I kept lying telling her I had to get groceries, or order for my family, which there are times that I even see couple people that are slower then me, and still never get bothered, when I do chores, she demanded I'm faster, which is just annoying and a mental break down at this point. 

I hope this explains everything, I just hope I get an answer or just advice, please and thanks. ",Key_Cry_5520,,False,1cvqed6,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvqed6/should_i_look_for_another_job/
I’m not sure what’s going on…,1716129832.0,"I recently had a baby shower and I wasn’t really given the choice about it. It was kind of thrust upon me. A family that doesn’t like me or my husband threw us this party. The dad of the family is the reverend of the church that I used to go to and that my husband and daughter still attend. They aren’t really friendly or warm people. I had this vibe that it was more  obligatory than something they actually wanted to do. And I said a few things to subconsciously push people away like I do at the shower. I regret that but I also feel very bitter and angry and hurt that these people did this. Like they got to check off on their personal moral list that they did something kind for someone they don’t like and aren’t interested in. Also my husband’s boss’s wife also helped organize this party and I felt that I couldn’t say no. They just texted me one day, we’re having a shower for you and will let you know some dates you can choose from. I’m feeling really depressed and upset about it. Thankfully we got to hang out with another family that we love after the shower and that helped me not to spiral. Also, I want to add that these people are status people. They want to hang out with their kind and they want to be with people they like. It’s so cliquey. It’s so typical church and it really upsets me.

Reached financial independence but I'm not happy with my life,1716128285.0,"I'm a 25 asian male who lives with his parents. I currently have plans to pursue dental school. I've worked in dentistry while preparing my application in dental school. For the past few years, I've only been making 80k/yr (I live in a HCOL so this isn't as much as it seems) living with my parents to save money. After 6 years of investing in the market, I saved a fair amount which was enough to not need to contribute to retirement accounts (coastFIRE for anyone part of the FIRE community haha) and still retire comfortably early at 50. This was a huge goal of mine and I thought I'd be happy once I reached this- this freed up my saving to allow me to buy whatever I wanted but it turns out there's not really many things I want in life. I've spent most of my past years saving every penny to invest in the future, and that future is finally here. And yet, I'm not happy in life.

My goals when I was younger were just to buy whatever video game I wanted and order UberEats whenever I wanted. The problem is I'm on a diet trying to get lean so I meal prep everything which I already outsource. I tried ubering everywhere but I felt very uncomfortable with other people driving me around so I drive or my boyfriend drives me. I thought I'd be happy buying a Tesla but it turns out EV charging is very annoying + Teslas are very annoying to work with so I ended up not getting one after borrowing my friend's. I also thought about getting a luxury apartment nearby that's 4k/month but its honestly less convenient than living at home as I'm a few minutes away from work...The ""solutions"" to spending more money just end up creating more problems.  I've bought a bunch of lululemon to augment my wardrobe, finally got a new phone after 8 years, upgraded to Tmobile from Mint, got a new laptop, basically bought a bunch of material stuff I've been staying away from. I went on a few flights and decided to just buy business class tickets for the fun of it and yes, it was nice, but my day to day happiness is still pretty low.

I also received a massive inheritance that basically means I don't have to work if I don't want to. The obvious question is well why don't you just quit your job? Well...I still really want to achieve my goal of trying to become a dentist and to do that, I need support of dentists to back my application which is why I still go to my job. I also really do love my work/patient interactions and work in a good environment, and something about having the freedom to say ""Fuck you I quit"" whenever I want makes my job a lot more enjoable. In the future, my goal is to become a part time dentist and treat my friends/family for free/charity cases, and spend the rest of my time with my kids/family/hobbies. There's also a great deal of pressure from my parents to become a dentist- they know financially I'm set (and by extension them as I've managed their portfolio for many years with great success), but this doesn't matter as I'm still not a dentist.

While I'm sure this sounds like a great problem to have, I just don't understand why I'm not happy in life. I think it's because I'm still not yet in dental school/a dentist whereas all my friends are successful in their careers but maybe there's more? I do want to get a therapist but I don't even know what I'd talk about. I know exactly how I sound: I have so much money and I don't know how to spend it wow and I""m not happy. Like jesus what a douche- this is also why I can't share this with my friends, because they'll just think I'm being a dick.

How do I move on from something I loved?,1716127299.0,"I graduated college recently and am not happy at all. During my senior year, I had the opoortunity to work with one of our college's sports teams and loved it. I didn't feel lonely, found something I was passionate about, and made solid connections. I became heavily invested in what they're doing by attending every practice, traveling with them on every road trip, and voluntarily cutting uo film for them. I was searching for jobs throughout this time, but considering I didn't have a car, my options were limited. Deep down, what I was doing won my heart over and I was really hoping that the work I put in would pave a path for me to return, even though it was a one-year commitment due to graduation (and likely a lack of budget). Unfortunately, that didn't happen. 

There's mutual interest in a return, especially with the value I brought with cutting up film, but I'd have to do so under the condition I'm a grad student going for my master's degree - something I cannot afford out of pocket. I need to get a Master's Degree to pursue my dream of working in college athletics, but the debt I'd be taking on doesn't support the ROI. Unless I receive enough funding to make my return a reality (which feels unlikely at this point), there's no way it will happen.

I have no idea where to go from here. I'm considering taking a ""gap year"" which allows me to save up for a car, wait for next year's batch of GA positions, and get myself in the right place physically and mentally. I can do so as I have an internship I can place on my resume in the meantime. How do I move on from something I loved?

Can someone please help,1716087939.0,"Hi everyone, I usually don't post on reddit, and there is no way on earth I could summarize what happened or how I feel and even I did, I doubt anyone would read through 10 pages of text, so I will try to summarize how I feel now vaguely

  
I am a male in my late twenties in a third world country, there is no father figure, I got a little sister and my mother, gratefully, I have pretty much taught myself everything and parented myself, bought everything I own and almost everything my mom and sis own too, I keep finding things the hard way and I wish if someone taught me these things earlier whether it's my non existing womanizing father or my naive innocent mother who needs help herself, I barely open up to people, I try to never show that I am negative or going through anything to anyone, except 1 childhood friend I trust and no one else, I find it super hard to make new friends as I get super anxious of being backstabbed again or somehow losing a good person, and I did put efforts into this, I did therapy, I did go to the gym and I still do, I read books, I ask for help, I improve my skills, my language fluency, I check for Visa programs and I am working on it to try and change my life / my mom's and sister's financially, a lot of people actually get close to me quickly, consider me their friend, compliment me, call me funny or smart or charismatic, but I can't believe it, I just see I am a bad person and I hate myself really hard, and I am super anxious and stressed, I have literally cried every single day in the past couple of months without missing one, and I can't help it, only my grandmother was a kind soul and she was a real mother to me, she died a few years ago, my father is crazy and he never cares for me or my sister, my mom barely got away from him and and he was literally giving death threats, it is very hard in my country for a woman to divorce her husband as well, so, I went on a marathon of self improvements on the inside out and yet I still feel so broken and sad and lonely and scared, I keep blaming it feeling like maybe it's cuz I am not smart enough, maybe I am not funny enough or maybe it's cuz I am ugly, male friends always compliment my photos like crazy and tell me I could ""model"" potentially, but the two girls I have opened up to in my entire life did not reciprocate feelings at all, the latter seemed like she did have feelings and I did my best to be the best version of my self in all aspects of my life, why? Cuz she in particular, made my eyes light up, she made me so happy when I never felt so happy and I know, I shouldn't be a relationship if I am expecting someone else to make me happy, and I am not fixed myself, but I wasn't looking for one, she entered my life so unexpecdly and she was so kind to me, she was so loving and caring, I felt love and good treatment I never knew even existed in my entire life, I was so happy I didn't overthink, I didn't feel bad or sad or lonely or scared, I felt so strong around her, and I doubled / tripled my income, became so much better at taking care of my health, I became almost the best verison I have ever been of my self, because deep down I was so scared of not being enough for her, and I made sure to communicate with her in every healthy way, I watched tons of guides on how to healthily communicate, attachment styles, giving space, etc etc, it was going so well, then suddenly she said she wasn't ready for a relationship, I looked back at my actions, every single one of them, every word I said, and I couldn't get my hands on something I might have messed up, I was joyful and normal, I didn't act differently around her from the way I did on day 1, I showed my best friend every action I could have done wrong, he kept saying you did nothing wrong, I still believe I did, anyway, ever since I got back not only to my old self, but hell, my negative thoughts 100xed, I reached out for help, moving phase they said, I cried, griefed all I could, I focused on myself and kept going to the gym, kept eating healthy, I have quit porn forever as well, been porn free for as long as you can count, I never get the urge to watch it again, all the urge I get is I wanna have a person like her, and I wanna be successful and change my moms / sisters life, I do help them and buy appliances/  gifts to them and I try to be kind to them, I do my best in my jobs / I am working on a business with my friend, I am going to the  gym except for this week where I have lost my mind I think, first time I don't go is this week, look I can't write everything, I just wanna feel loved and I wanna enjoy being alone and stay focused on my missions for myself and my family, but, at the same time, I get super high levels of stress and negativity and I keep crying, in fact I am crying now, it's 5 AM and it's a weekend, I pulled away from most of my friends except my best friend whom I am grateful to have, but I am tired of venting out to him, I feel like he doesn't deserve this, I can't afford to vent out more to him, even tho he does to me too, but not as much as I do, I feel like I put enough on his shoulders and he has helped me enough, I know a million people have it worse than me I feel bad for them and I cry when I see a homeless person okay, I have good health, I have an ok job and I still have my mom and sister, but I can't help it, I literally cry till I can't breathe, I am so scared and I am so lonely, I thought maybe it was the idea of having a partner who lit me up, but no, it was just her in particular that was so kind and caring, and this is not a relationship subreddit, nor is it the main theme of this post, TL;DR I just can't help it, I feel so bad, I feel so unloved and no one gives a shit about me, I even feel like my mother doesn't care, I am also scared when the day comes that my mother is too old or she is gone, as at least she is the only soul that was genuine to me, I don't know what to do, focus on yourself, there are people that have it way worse than you"" I know but I can't help it, and I do everything possible to be my best self and I don't see results, I work two jobs so I can afford the gym calories and protien intake + pay for mym om and sister's college, I dont have time for the gym mostly, so I can't really get rid of my skinny physique which my mind thinks is why she wasn't ready for a relationship, or maybe it's affecting my self confidence, maybe it's cuz I am not tall, I don't know, most of the people I know have loving girlfriends and some of them even cheated, or were complete jerks, I try my absolute best not just in relationships, but also in business and in fitness, but I see no results in any aspect of my life, except the income increase recently but money isn't really helping, I wish if my father taught me a thing or two, I don't know what to do, I don't know how to live basically like how are people not just like wanting to end themselves and how can they be loved and be happy and effortlessly have someone that loves them, even when I don't put effort because maybe you think I am putting too much into my relationship or I am pushy, people just don't give a damn, it's like I am either super ugly and my friends are gaslighting me, or I have something wrong with my head, I am too stupid and I can't realize what's wrong with me, why me like, I see a guy who is a jerk and he is alcholic + smokes and everythin, and cheats and his GF loves him more than the world, friends respect him as well, while I don't smoke, I don't watch porn, I work out, I provide for m family, I try to parent myself, I try to self reflect, I keep doing self improvement, I try to jooin fun activites and hobbies, I am doing my best to have my own business even though I barely have enough time, but nothing is working out, what is wrong with me? I am so stupid + ugly thats what I genuinly think, I don't wanna do any black or redpill bs okay, I don't believe in any thing specific, I just don't see why this is how it is, like listen, I wasn't always try harding, I was younger and I was not thinking about any of this, I just liked video games, movies, animals and I had friends too in school, but when I am in my 20s I see that I am just becoming like, an outcast, like, I can't have a gf, I can't have free time, I can't figure out what am I supposed to do, and if I am afraid of leaving my family and focusing on myself because they have no one  but me, literally, just me, I can't travel and afford to leave them, I tried suicide over two times in the last few months, I can't figure anything out, and I don't know why can't I have the courage to end my life either, it's like I am hoping something will work out and my life will change for the better and I will feel content, the only bright spot in my entire life was her, and I am so sad that I probably messed it up, I don't know what to do, the advice I will probably get is just keep working out, keep saving money, but guys what if I am 30 and nothing changes, I can't just cope everyday I can't, it's sooo heavy, I am tired of crying I am tired of venting to my best friend, I am tired of feeling so anxious and lonely, I tried therapy but therapy won't change the fact that I am unloved and just have something wrong with me, like is it my genetics or i dont know, what am I lacking, what did I do wrong for her to change her mind, and why can't I open up to any other girl, and it is so difficult to find a good hearted kind souled girl like her, I wanna learn how to be happy on my own, but it is so hard, like I just can't, I don't know why am I even writin this here, no one knows all the details and I doubt that anyone cares either, I am forced to work for my mom and sis, if it werent for them, I would probably work a simple job and just isolate, I have to do it as it is the best paying job in case they need anything, I am not even close to being rich, I am not handsome and I am not tall, I am not funny, and I didn't have the best upbringing, my city barely has activities and I can't move out now, I googled piano classes, dance classes, archery, I did martial arts, I keep coming back to the gym, I read books, I eat healthy, why is nothing working guys, all I am asking for is just like one person to be kind to me as she was, honestly a part of me also just wants to be in a relationship as I wanna have great / carefree memories with another person that will also care for me, not just be one sided with my family, I just wanna love and feel loved, I want a nice kind girlfriend and to find a way to travel out of my country, the companies that sponsor visas just prefer engineers or super highly skilled individuals I am trying to be that, but its not working and I am not that bright or smart, also, I am afraid even if  I go to a first world country I will be even lonelier + I will leave my family behind to starve, honeslty, I don't know what to do, I feel like I am doing everything by myself all my by myself mentally and physically, and I have 0 support, if it weren't for my best friend I wouldn't have been alive, but I don't want to vent out to him anymore and give him negative energy while acting like nothing is off to me to the rest of the world, I wanna feel loved and recognized, I wanna have a car and a good looking body, I wanna be content and confident and have a girl friend that will commit to me too, but these things are taking so long that I feel like they will never come, and I will just keep woring 1-2 jobs till I lose my hair and die alone and miserable, a failure with wasted potential, I don't know why am I even writing this, and I don't know what am I supposed to do, ALL I am asking is a way not to feel shitty for a single day, so I can keep doing what I am doing, and that only happened when she was in my life, not it is worse than ever, and I cannot find a fix, honestly, I don't know what am I even writing at this point, hopefully I will die soon painlessly and forget everything",Bright-Notice-3190,,False,1cveisc,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cveisc/can_someone_please_help/
Am I right?,1716116196.0,"Hey!

I'm currently 24 years old and I'd much appreciate your honest opinion. 

I was se#ually a#bused when I was 6/7 years old and to ask for your opinion about the consequences of this I'd have to tell you how it went down. 

My aunt had a boyfriend whom my grandfather did not like so she had to hide him from sight. She had a separate room from the house, so she kept him there but she'd bring him food instead of having him go inside the house because of my grandfather. I can't remember she asking me to bring him dinner, but all I remember was that I had a plate on my hands and I was walking inside her room, knowing he'd be there. When I walked in he was on the bed, wearing nothing but my aunt's underwear. That's when the paranoia begins... 

I never thought this occurrence had affected me in any way, shape or form, but I think it did and more than I can realize. I say I don't think it affected me because it wasn't violent, and said person made me believe I wanted that (I know, i only recently came to realize how stupid that is of me to think), and he did not have intercourse with me, or so I don't remember. 

There's a lot of questions about this night that I wanted answered, one is how is a child left inside a room with a stranger and no one comes to check? Paranoia 1 is that my aunt and/or grandmother (who raised me) knew about it. 

Paranoia 2 is that the fact he was wearing my aunt's underwear was the reason I began having severe gender dysphoria throughout my life only now realizing it fully and considering transitioning. (yes, stupid, I know, but please bare with me, this causes me great confusion.)

Paranoia 3 is that it didn't affect me and the problems I have right now are due to other circumstances in my upbringing (chaotic family, substance abuse from family members that usually led to fighting and yelling, severe untreated depression throughout my whole teenage years that led me to isolate entirely to the point I did not leave my room - this stopped around 18/20, but I still suffer with social anxiety).

I guess what I'm trying to say is... Could this ab#se have caused me to develop gender dysphoria? Am I right into suspecting my aunt and/or grandmother knew what was happening? I don't know if it happened more than once. I'm only know paying more attention to this and going back because I was forced to tell everyone about said occurrence by another aunt whom I relied this information to, the only person in the family - she threatened to tell everyone so I did it instead, otherwise I'd probably have forgotten it.

Scared to take SSRI’s and SNRI’s any other type of effective anti-anxiety med suggestions? ,1716089483.0,"I was recently diagnosed with PTSD, GAD, OCD (and probably ADHD but I can’t afford the official diagnosis but my psychiatrist says it’s likely). My psychiatrist and I both believe that my GAD is causing me the most issues right now so that is the priority with my treatment. That being said, she wants me to take Prozac to treat my GAD, OCD, and PTSD at the same time. But I’ve read about the risk of sexual dysfunction, which can apparently continue even after discontinuing SSRI’s and SNRI’s. The other two meds my psychiatrist suggested both have these risks as well and I feel VERY hesitant to take a medication that could destroy my ability to enjoy sex again, as some people have apparently lost the ability to orgasm permanently. 

I was wondering if anyone has experience with any other type of meds to treat GAD, it would be great if it helps with PTSD and OCD as well but my priority is GAD. I’ve heard some doctors use Wellbutrin off label to treat GAD but I can’t find much about that online.

Any suggestions would be really really appreciated 🫶🏼

I can talk with my mom about this I guess but she also deals with a lot of death in her profession and she already griefs a lot and so does my dad about the dog. One of my siblings will avoid the subject entirely and the other one will ridicule me. I don't know how to cope with death I've only had one death in our family which was my grandfather when I was 8 years old I didn't know him very well though. I didn't see him on his deathbed I only saw him after he died I carried him into his casket. (Why did they make an 8 year old do that? No clue but it definitely did something with my development) so I don't know how to cope. About me dying, I don't really care. If the universe decides it's my time I'd be at peace with it.

Volunteer in Ukraine. At my breaking point.,1716064480.0,"I gave my whole life up to be here, to do work that directly support the troops defending their nation, to allow Ukraine and Ukrainians the chance to enjoy the peace and safety I enjoyed for 38 years of my life.

I left my home my family, my amazing GF and love of my life, and a decent job to come over. There is no going back, there is nothing to go back to.

But with the recent events at the front and the internal politics of my NGO I feel like I've literally walked right into the end chapter of my life.

If the Orks don't kill me, I can't go home. There is no work, no home to rent, nothing. Even my family has disowned me for my choice.

And here in Ukraine I don't stand a chance of making a new life for myself. Most I have is a Temporary residence status.

Money is running out, I can't even afford new shoes.

All I have is grueling 13+ hour days doing what I do, which is being a kitchen porter. I used to be a chef, a damn good one too. I came here in the pretense I would be paid following a probation period, But because I got on the bad side of my trainer (a Ukrainian half my age and a quarter my experience) for reasons unknown my NGO leader sees me as a liar and functionally useless. Just a body for the line.

I feel like this is the end. I keep thinking about this beautiful spot in Poland, secluded and peaceful, right by the river. I think it would be a good place to see my end. It has a beautiful view of the sunset. Dress in my chef Whites one more time, knife roll by my side. sit down with a good bottle of Cognac, down a cocktail of muscle relaxants and sleeping pills and watch that beautiful sunset.

Don't even think my NGO or anyone I work with would notice I'm not there. Doubt anyone back home would either.

I don't know why I feel this way, I'm a hopeless romantic, love and fight for what I love untill the end and then.

I think I'll always feel like the helpless little girl who cannot defend herself ,1716066648.0,"Hey so 21 F here , my life seemed alright to me until when I was 13-14, after which i started getting these dreams/ flashbacks of my cousin SAing me. It got really frequent and i would just lay there reliving it unable to move. It was like that for about 2ish years and near the end i almost got them every day, one of the flashbacks was of me telling my mum and her crying. i wanted to ask her if it actually happened but i thought it was a really grave accusation and i wasn't even sure it happened. i think near the end i was sure about it happening because i could actually feel him over me during the flashbacks and I felt absolutely helpless. During this time the same cousin frequented my house and I just thought that wouldn't have been the case if it was actually true. After all this the pandemic hit and I was depressed and suicidal. i almost killed my self, but i didn't at the last min. I got a lil better w the help of my friends and n sisters. they didn't know anything tho. After this I started dating my best friend and was in a better place but those flashbacks started again and this time it was worse. i confided in him n my bsf. he actually gave me a lot of strength and i actually gathered the courage to ask my mum. she seemed very irritated when i asked but she confirmed that it had infact happened. The SA had started when I was only 7 years old and my cousin is atleast 8 years older than me. It continued until I was 11. I was very frequent and I'm sure it has happened hundreds of times. i didn't know what was happening to me was wrong. He made it into a game at the beginning. he would partner up w me during hide and seek and then took advantage of the opportunity. He built stories around it and told me that was everyone was doing it. I was always in pain because of how frequently it happened. He would say that there was something wrong with me and I was being a bad girl because i wasn't enjoying it. i believed it to be true. I seem to unlock new memories even now. My now ex bf was there for me through it all and i don't think i would've had the courage to ask my mum if it weren't for my ex and my bestfriend. At that time it kinda felt that it was just a part of my story and it had made me stronger. i wish i felt the same even today. to get back to the timeline my parents didn't react that well they just told it that i should just move on n these things happen to a lot of people. the SA stopped the day I told my mum. she had given me the whole good touch bad touch lecture earlier that day. that night I told her. i did not know that what had been happening was wrong. i don't remember much of what happened later. i just know that i kept seeing him later as well. i also have this distinct memory of my mum asking me if I had enjoyed it because she saw me playing w him. Now she completely denies it. my parents refuse to talk about it and act like I'm harrassing then by asking questions. i have confronted my parents about why they didn't do anything multiple times.i asked them why didn't you guys report it to the police or at the least made sure I never had to see his face again.They gave vague answers and at one time my dad pulled out a knife and was like fine i didn't do anything but he asked what had stopped me from murdering him. Yes he actually did that. 
Anyways in my mind, i still cannot associate what my cousin did it me as a child to the adult him. i had repressed the memories for so long and honestly even after that he was always around. Growing up i didn't know that he was in the wrong. he was not punished or even treated differently. My parents act like im overreacting and my mum gives me examples of people who were assualted my their own fathers and told me that a lot of evil happenes in the society. She has also told me that it's because of adolescence and that kids get urges but i told her I have been through adolescence but I have never forced myself upon anyone .
About a year ago I was almost SAed by my friend.i don't wanna get into the details now because I feel like it will get too much for me.
but now I feel like I'll always be the helpless little girl and I dont think I'll ever get out of this.

I’m going to die alone,1716066834.0,"My whole life my biggest insecurity has been romance. I don’t rlly have an issue with small talk with girls, but I’m 20 years old now and have 0 romantic experiences in the slightest. I also have 0 female friends. The only girls I have ever been close to are my mom and sister. Im also just weird/socially awkward. Most of the people I meet might laugh at some of my jokes and have a surface level friendship with me, but don’t really like me beyond that.

 Idk if I’d ever be able to have a romantic relationship that would work out in the end. I make way too many dumbass jokes and am not the most masculine guy ever (am in self improvement, but idk how much looks will even help me). Even if I do manage to pick up a girl, It would most likely be at a bar and our personalities probably wouldn’t mesh. I’m a gamer nerd who says some of the dumbest shit imaginable and I’m pretty sure I also have OCD.

Every time I think about having a gf or whatever it just seems so unrealistic. Like a fairytale or some shit.

I’ve tried to devalue love, and not think about it as much while I develop myself, but it’s hard man. There’s also so many ppl who just wanna hook up nowadays and that’s just not what I want at all. It feels weird to say that despite struggle with a porn addiction for many years but idk I just feel like hook up culture isn’t for me. 

My family is now starting to get on my case about it and it’s depressing. I already beat myself up about it enough and now I have them poking me to get a gf? Fucking horrible. I would just shoot myself in the brain but idk if I could do that to my parents/siblings. If I do I need to somehow make them hate me first, so when I do commit it won’t hurt them and I can just be forgotten

I don’t have a strong bond with anyone I know, so I don’t openly talk about my struggles. I’ve had suicidal thoughts before, but I thought there’s no way I’d actually go through with it.

Can repetition of stimuli cause anything adverse mentally?,1716076979.0,"Can being subjected to the same audible cue repeatedly for extended periods of time constitute psychological torture even if it's not intended to be?  At work today my (for real) autistic coworker listened to the same 5 second clip of a song for roughly 5 hours or so between tasks.  After a couple of hours it started getting to me, but I didn't want to say anything because I've noticed that he's self unaware to such an extent that when you point something out like this he clams up immediately and shuts down for the rest of the day.

He does this kind of thing often too.  Sometimes he'll listen to the same short clips of car accidents from various old NASCAR races repeatedly, or he'll repeat something to himself over and over and over again.  He doesn't seem to be aware he's doing it either.  Like I mentioned before, he's extremely self unaware about these sort of things and when you point them out he basically... shuts down I guess.

I dont know how im going to get through this. The pain is unbelievable.. ,1716074616.0,"My love, the mother of my child, left abruptly 5 days ago now. We have been together and living together for 4 years and our daughter is 3. I got home from work Monday and she moved out everything while I was at work. I got home to a mostly empty house and endlessly broken heart. I was lied to so that I would give consent for my daughter to go away with her parents for the week. I was led to believe this was a date night. She asked when I would be home from work so that way she could have everything gone by The time I got home. Her parents thought I knew this was going to happen. That's why they took my little girl. No one will answer my phone calls or texts or tell me when my daughter is coming home. I cant get more than, ""I'm leaving"", ""we will talk later"", ""I'm not yours anymore"", And many other hurtful things as a response from her. I have given everything. Everything I do and provide is for my girls. I have worked so hard to get my girls in a space where they can have room to grow and be independent. I don't know how I could ever look into my daughter's eyes and tell her mommy isn't coming home, and I don't know why. My abandonment wound is ripped wide open again and my soul is scarred for life... Im trying desperately to make it through the pain of waking up every day and realizing this isn't a bad dream.. I can't wake up because this is really happening to me.

I had such a crazy panic attack yesterday when I woke up I almost had to call 911 because I couldn't breathe. I woke up with an incredible weight on my chest and a pounding heart and no matter what I did I couldn't catch my breath. I assume it was a panic or anxiety attack but it lasted for several hours and I was scared out of my mind. I don't have a single person I can call here to get so much as a hug, talk to me, or Even take me to the hospital. My entire life is completely upside down and I have absolutely no idea what I did to deserve this.

And even worse is that nobody will answer my calls or texts. None of her friends or her mother who literally has my child. I just want to know when my little girls coming home. I provide day-in and day-out for my girls. I pay all the bills I provide the place to live I've worked and given and sacrificed so much for this family and I am utterly destroyed and cannot comprehend how someone can do this.

Of course, there are more details because there always are. I'm a very reasonable understanding emotionally intelligent person and there's no circumstance in which this should be handled like this.

Any advice on what I can do or how to make it through the days and the pain would be helpful. I have ceased communications with her, despite how incredibly hurt, angry and in disbelief I'm in. What can should my next steps be? 

I will post a link to some messages to give maybe a little more understanding on the situation.

I’m moving away and am never going to see my friends again,1716074296.0,"A couple of years ago I had to move across continents, but I knew I would still be able to visit where I had spent most of my time growing up. After moving I became extremely depressed and had no friends, so I eventually got the opportunity to move back and be with my friends I had grown up with.

A year has passed since then and now I’m 18, and leaving again. Where I live everybody moves very far away, and I’m really struggling with how to cope with knowing I am almost certainly never going to see my best friends ever again. This is the same situation with my ex girlfriend, she didn’t treat me well and we were always on and off, but now I know I am probably never going to see her again I don’t know how to cope at all. 

I really struggle meeting new people and making new friends and I’m so worried about going back into that situation I was in a few years ago. I don’t know if I’m being silly but I feel very very upset and distressed over this, I can’t deal with these feelings at all and don’t know what to do. 

I’ve realised despite all the problems I have where I live, that I’m happy here, have friends (especially one) that are super important to me, and don’t feel like I can do better than this. I also realise I do still care a lot about my ex and I can’t imagine never seeing her again and that door being fully closed forever. All these people have been so important in my life and shaping who I am and I’ve never felt so awful or scared.

I isolated for a year and now idk how to get back to normal,1716072738.0,"In high school I never really made friends myself, I met everyone I knew through basically one person. Never really felt like I fit in with them, constantly was awkward and weird and it only got worse the longer it went on. So after graduating I just wanted nothing to do with them. I stopped talking to all of them hoping I would make friends in college. Tried college, dropped out due to mental health, now I haven't socialized in a year.

There are a few old friends I could reconnect with but I don't want to explain my situation when they ask, nor do I want to be even more weird and secretive, nor do I want them to realize I just got worse instead of growing as a person in that year in any way. It took me a while for it to hit me that I have no social life at all since I have some good online friends. But suddenly, out of the blue, I feel completely alone.

Now I'm afraid of spending my 19th and 20th birthdays alone, The passage of time in general is freaking me out. I'm afraid of never being able to make friends again or never being in a proper friend group again. I just can't see it happening. If it does I'll probably have already turned 20 and the thought of that number is terrifying to me. I'm taking a few community college classes next year but I doubt anything will come of it. I could also get a job over summer but I'm honestly afraid of seeing any old friends by doing retail jobs.

how can someone with selective mutism ask for help?,1716072512.0,"my wife has autism, generalized anxiety disorder, almost certainly has ptsd, and has selective mutism sometimes when her anxiety gets really high. i respect all of that and we're working on some things long term to help her.

the problem is that we have kids together and sometimes she needs my help with parenting them. a direct request is obviously not possible during those times that she is also mute due to high anxiety, but just not communicating or waiting for me to notice that she has gone mute are also not options because children's needs don't wait. i don't always have my phone on me and, even when i do, her anxiety doesn't always allow her to text. i offered the idea of some kind of signal agreed on ahead of time, like placing a specific item in a conspicuous place, but that was also too direct and too stressful for her to consider. please help us! how can she ask for my help when she is mute?

just in case anyone gets worried about this: our kids are fine and not neglected in any way. my wife can be home alone with them and take care of them even if she goes mute because that situation itself of being the sole caregiver provides the focus necessary to do whatever they need. the problem only exists when i am home and she knows that me doing something is an option and she could really use my help but i'm not even aware that she has become mute.

"People with Bipolar disorder, what do your manic episodes look like?",1716070335.0,"I dropped out of college as a psych major and have invested a lot of time in my life to study mental disorders. Mostly anxiety, depression and personality disorders, but not too much on bipolar. I know it's a behemoth and very difficult to deal with in day to day life. 

Recently I have made the decision to join the US army, I've always had a sense of adventure and have had the army in the back of my mind for a couple years now...but recently I have gone all in, I'm hoping to get a special forces contract so I've begun to train for it. I'm training non-stop just obsessing over it, taking martial arts classes, going on runs, lifting weights, and I feel so great. I'm happier than I have ever been in my whole life, I finally feel like I'm on the right path. I've never truly known what I want to do and I feel like a massive weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. 

However, having studied manic episodes I know that what I'm feeling is similar to what someone may feel if they have an episode. I'm not sleeping well, I can't fall asleep and I can't stay asleep. I sleep for about 2 or 3 hours at a time because so much is going on in my head. My mother is also diagnosed with bipolar II disorder so I know I'm already at risk for it. 

This is NOT me asking for any sort of medical advice, I'm simply using the responses as a mild guide as I go consult a professional. As I mentioned earlier in this post, I haven't really done a lot of studying for bipolar disorder and it's almost impossible to look at yourself objectively. Although, if your experiences are night and day different than what I'm feeling right now, then obviously I wouldn't need to spend the money on a professional in the first place. 

Lastly, I'm not trying to insult anyone or claim that I have something I don't. It's just that in my life, I have not gotten very many wins. I'm not happy often and maybe part of me feels like I don't deserve it or it's too good to be true. Also I just want to hear about people's experiences because it is something I enjoy talking about.

The past few months, maybe more, she's been talking to me about how she's been having crazy vivid dreams, and she connects this with spiritual reasons, but she describes these as like insane dreams and I can't help but wonder if it's something medical? Or just aging?
Lately it feels as if her theories and nonsense are getting worse and more intense. She called me today saying she had an epiphany, saying she had felt something crazy. She kept looking at me saying I looked peaceful, which could be normal for her, but she kept repeating it, and I swear she had a crazed look in her eye.

and it sparked a thought in me , if you ask anyone if they would ever commit violence aginst another human being (exluding self defense) they would tell you that , no , they wouldn't of course , and then you'd ask them ""why?"" and they'd respond with ""well, because it's wrong""

""well i don't do it because what i can lose is bigger than what i can gain""

My first post in this sub (need help),1716068209.0,"

I am a 20 y/o student, living alone and this is my very first post in this sub. There was a time I got bullied in school and sports club. I have a difficult relationship to my parents. I was never able to talk to them about my problems, I was silent instead. My mother was very controlling and patronizing. My father only cared about my school grades.

After a long time of self reflection I realised, that I'm seriously suffering from:

-social anxiety: I'm often trying not to behave awkwardly, because I care too much what people think about me and I feel watched many times. I have problems approaching stranger people. Also, I often feel caught in normal situations, for example when someone is entering the toilet and I'm styling my hair in the mirror. I'm getting a bit sweaty and my heart pumps. I have these problems especially when interacting with women.

-porn addiction: it literally slows down my life. My dopamine level is constantly low in phases of watching porn (rn I'm trying to beat this stupid habit). It isolates and destroys my social life. I'm not getting my things done and porn changed my view of women. I'm very ashamed of this, ashamed of sexulizing women. And I really don't want this any more.

-depression: tbh I think depressions are the result of the problems I mentioned above. Negative thoughts only come, when I'm alone at home for a longer periods of time. Times of feeling hopeless and helpless.

Yeah......,1716067909.0,"Hey, so since I was a kid I have always been the black sheep in my family. I don't don't know why they always take out everything on me. If My siblings do something I get beat up with them(my other siblings don't) . Even now, whenever my sister fights and yells at him he tells her, ""this is not you I bet that bitch is filling your head with none sense"" Another thing is that once  she shouted at him his solution to that was punching me in the eye  and there are so many stories something else  is when my mother gets upset at my father she  takes out her anger on me. Even if I didn't do anything wrong and she does it so often that now at home or outside with my friends and with the people, even if I don't do anything wrong I start to panick and start imagining them being mad at me  and we start to worry and be afraid, and my heart starts  pounding, and I  let people make fun of me laugh at me, and take advantage of me, so they don't hate me 

Something else is that I have never felt loved when I was young by my family. They never hugged me or kissed me , and they didn't tell me we love you. (Especially my dad to the point where now I go and seek attention and validation from my older professors hoping I'll get from them the love I never got from him.) I have also been compared all my life with my sister, my classmates and cousins they say I am the ugliest and most stupid out of all my siblings and for years all they did was criticize every little thing I ever did.

Now that I am grown up(20) it has gotten kind of better but I hate myself  I have no self confidence my self esteem doesn't exist, I am  afraid of everything and of all people. I feel that I don't deserve good things In this world, I  feel that people outside do not love me, and that I do not deserve to be loved. And I always feel ashamed of myself, of everything I do even if it is the most normal thing(I have toxic chronic shame)

The worst is I don't even know if what I am feeling is actually true or if I am just victimizing myself

Help me, I swear to God, I don't know how to live like this. How can I manage? How can we get together? How can I stop being worried,afraid, and sad all day? How can I love myself ? Please help me.

I'm a 24f, in 2 weeks i will officially graduate from the university. Then im planning to start working full time in the industry, which probably means moving cities / countries. 

I've always been the less important friend. The one you ignore and forget about, despite being loving and invested in all the relationships i had. I thought that I finally made friends at the university (postgraduate), but then last week I discovered they organised a meeting literally 300m from my building, behind our backs (around 10ppl on the meeting, around 20 of friends intotal), and inlt was not the first time, just smaller groups earlier. 
I've tried dating, I've been on over 35 first dates in the last 3 years (ages ranging from my age to +20 years), but since I moved abroad (nordics), i can't find anyone that would be even a little bit invested in building any kind of relationship (""casual dating"" society), meanwhile im craving a deep connection, doesnt have to be romantic. Additionally, i trust people too much because of the fear of abandonement and put my health in serious risk last week, that can give consequences soon.

Today I feel so lonely for the first time since I finished therapy 8 months ago. I'm staring at the ceiling and crying.

Why could I be experiencing déjà vu daily?,1716061119.0,"Sorry for any grammar mistakes in advance. English isn’t my first language.

Recently, or rather, for a little more than half a year, I've constantly been experiencing severe cases of déjà vu. Every time something new or slightly noticeable in life happens it’s just like ‘Oh, I’ve done this before’ and that on almost a daily basis. It happens so often that it feels like I’ve lived that exact moment already.

I looked into it and the internet said it could be a neurological problem. But I had an MRI a year ago for other reasons and everything was fine then. I also didn’t get hurt in any way by then. (Underwent an MRI because I’m experiencing terrible headaches on a daily basis.)

I don’t know if it’s important to mention, but during the same period, I started seeing angel numbers everywhere I went. ‘Angel numbers’ are what my friends and I call it when the time shows, for example, 11:11 or 15:15 o’clock. Usually I see them when opening my phone on accident or checking the time. There have even been instances where I woke up at night only for the electric clock in my bathroom to show 04:04 or other times. Also, after a few months, I’ve been counting how often I see those numbers daily, and it’s between 3 to 8 times on average. I don’t know if it’s even worth mentioning, but it’s making me feel almost paranoid and stressed to look at the time when I’m already bothered by Déjà vu daily. (+ since two months ago I have encountered weird combinations such as 12:21 or 13:31.) 

Speaking with any professionals isn’t an option due to my bad relationship with my mother, and getting an MRI for the headaches with no explanation for my headaches is already making her think that I’m just seeking for attention.

Why do I feel the need to always be with someone ?,1716060435.0,"Hello everyone, idk how long this will be but I’m just writing whatever’s on my mind and haven’t organized my thoughts so sorry in advance.

I (22M) got out of a 4 year relationship about 3 months ago. During those 4 years I’d say I was not the best partner that I could be. I had a lot of issues with self image, self esteem and just being generally insecure. I would just feel like my partner would leave me for another man at any day. This has led us getting into many arguments and us giving silent treatment to each other. However, I would feel terrible and so awful and feeling like my chest is closing inside knowing she’s mad at me or whenever we’re on bad terms and I come back to her and profusely apologize. I would get the worst thoughts whenever we got into an argument thinking “that’s it she going to leave me now”.
Then I started reflecting and started rationalizing these thoughts and just thinking it’s all in my head and if I do believe then they will actually happen. Until one day she came to me and confessed that she cheated on me. I felt any little progress I made with myself was gone. Despite her confessing it to me I still forgave her and continued the relationship because in my head I was thinking that she’s the best I could get and no one else would want me. 

Fast forward, to now I still find myself missing her and I’ve tried dating and all I could say is that my self esteem issues have significantly worsened. Facing rejections, mixed signals and ghosting it really took a tole on my mental health and it confirmed my worse fears that I’m not desirable for others and no one wants me. As well as, the attachment issues that I have and intense emotions I have for some of the ladies I talked to it could be a couple of weeks and I’d already feel like I want her and want to be in a relationship with her and it eats me up inside whenever I wait hours for their response. Thinking the worst scenarios as to why they’re not responding to me. I’ve even had mental breakdowns and crying thinking why am I not enough for people. 
I’ve missed out a lot of other details but I don’t want to make this too long

Waste of time? ,1716060133.0,"So I've been seeing the same psychiatrist for 8 months now. In that time she has prescribed me 10 different meds from high blood pressure meds to antidepressants to antipsychotics. She claims i just have anxiety. Even though she hasn't diagnosed me with anxiety. Shes diagnosed me with panic disorder, mood disorder, ptsd, and insomnia. My GP diagnosed me with agoraphobia with panic attacks and referred me to this psych. 

I have not seen any improvement whatsoever in these 8 months. She will not prescribe anything controlled. No benzos no sleeping pills nothing. Antidepressants and blood pressure meds. She says all my anxiety is from quitting drinking 10 months ago and antidepressants will sure be the cure all. 
She hasn't even acknowledged the agoraphobia that I was referred to her for. She just says ""well you already have a lot going on, let's focus on that."" 

I'm also diagnosed with adhd,ocd, and a few others from my GP. So im thinking about trying a different approach for my treatment plan. Instead of focusing on the agoraphobia and panic attacks i want to focus in ADHD and maybe my oanic disorder will be more manageable. Do you think i should ask my psychiatrist for stimulants or just go back to my GP and let him know everything the psych has done has been of no help. So he can refer me to someone new or start treating me himself.

I cry once I'm home after I hang out with my friends or girlfriend. Sometimes even while still with them.,1716059142.0,"Cross-posted from r/autism because another user said it would fit better here.

My only diagnosis is ASD so I'm posting here. It could potentially be related to another undiagnosed mental condition, but since I can't be sure, I won't post on other subs or speculate about conditions I may have.

I'm not gonna go into detail, but I have trauma related to friendships and relationships, for years on end, continuous, nonstop horrible experiences.
I believe this is the reason for my extreme insecurity, dependence on people, and lack of trust in anyone who claims to like/love me.

Even with ex friends this happened. I'd try to hold back my extreme emotions of overwhelming loneliness and hopelessness as my hangouts with them ended. I mostly succeeded, keeping my crying sessions at home after my time with them. However, I still sometimes can't hold it in and burst into tears right as I'm about to leave my friends for the day.

This is extremely embarrassing, but I feel the need to have a loved one with me at all times, as other people are the only way I value myself. I completely hate myself but if someone else doesn't (or acts like don't, since I still don't really believe in people tolerating me), it gives me a sense of value, it makes me feel like if I can't be alive for myself, I should be for this person.

My emotions are extremely unstable and sometimes I can't regulate them at all. I have random outbursts of sobbing, hyperventilating, screeching, and yelling. I frequently screech around my friends because I get jumpscared easily and get triggered by ""mild"" sensory triggers, like for example wind blowing on my waist. I'm extremely ashamed of this. I apologise to my friends about it. They don't seem to mind, but I don't buy it. 

Every time my time with anyone for the day ends, I get overwhelming feelings of ""why are they leaving me""; ""they hate me""; ""I have no one now""; ""I'm worthless""; ""they only pretend to like me out of pity"", along with urges to hurt myself and die.

I have had episodes with my girlfriend in public. All occurrences have made me extremely ashamed. She had to comfort me as I cried on a bench, for seemingly no reason, she had to lead me home because I was very certain I would run into traffic as a suicide attempt on my way back, she has had to be my crutch when I get physically weak.

what is happening to me???,1716059021.0,"hi i don't know how to start this but i think i'm losing my mind if i haven't already. i'm fucked in the head. i'm not a normal human being. there is clearly something wrong with me and i don't know what it is. i'm disgusting i'm a bad fucking human being i'm corrupted. i swear to god i'm not saying this out of pity i'm saying this because it is the literal fucking truth

i don't know what will happen to me but i know something will happen. my life is getting weirder and weirder and weirder. i dont want to get too personal but god what is actually wrong with me? at the moment i'm feeling very hyperactive and i can't calm the fuck down. i need to stop saying the word fuck. but my self esteem is very high at the current moment but i also want to straight up die.

life is so fucking terrible and people are fucking terrible. people are judgemental as fuck and they are fucked in the head as well. people are cruel to get what thet want. or feel better about themselves. but honestly am i any better? i'm crazy. if i was friends with someone like me i'd be terrified of them. because i'm a nightmare. why do i still think this if my self esteem is high? i can't believe all of this shit is real. it can't be. it feels like a movie really. a gross, disgusting, dark movie.

why do i think i'm a bad person? i'm not a judgemental bitch but i'm angry, i'm a porn addict, i have the most egotistic thoughts when my self esteem is high, i hurt the people i love, i'm always willing to seek revenge, i can't keep a proper friendship / relationship if i'm extremely close with them, i can be violent and lashing out, etc. i should change this about myself and i want to but i dont. and i don't know why. i'm always stuck because of myself. i am my own prison. in addition, the only positive thing is is that i'm still aware, lots of crazy people don't realize it. i deserve to not be alive. i hate people like me. i would absolutely hate someone like me

i miss being normal so much. i was really happy from the ages of 0-5, my issues started around age 6 but from ages 6-10 i lived a decent life. maybe a little therapy could benefit but i wasn't fucked in the head. 11-12 was the decline and so was 13 kinda but 14 is when shit blew, and now it is worse at 15. i look at my old videos or entries or anything and i'm just like 'god i miss being normal'. if she saw someone like me back then she would think they are crazy. it is so wild i was once normal. i had my insecurities and slightly troubled due to certain traumas but for a traumatized person i was extremely stable. all i ever wanted was to be happy again, and now i give up. i should just end it all

does anyone relate to what i'm saying? i hate this",teenwithdelusions,,False,1cv4l1i,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cv4l1i/what_is_happening_to_me/
I am scared for and of my sister,1716058406.0,"I realised that something was off around 8 years ago when she was 9, I started catching her lying about random minor incidents about things that happened to her during the day or something trivial like that. Making up stories which was obviously a little absurd but everyone just brushed it off. 
As she grew up I noticed that her behaviour was taking a turn for the worse. She didn’t stop crying until she gets what she wants, sleeping on the floor crying and refusing to get up, throwing huge tantrums, the list goes on. I thought it wouldn’t get worse until she hit her teenage years started and she started threatening my parents saying she’d kill herself for every minor inconvenience, like when she wasn’t given an iPad when she wanted to play games or when she didn’t get a desert after a dinner. Basically whenever she was told no. 

Around when she was 13-14, I caught her playing games with random men online and flirting with them on discord as she left her laptop open and I went there to shut it down. These men were 21-30 years old and there were around 10 people that she was talking to online. I told my parents about it and they scolded her once and I saw zero regret on her face. I deleted her discord took screenshots of those profiles and confiscated her laptop. 

Two years later, a random dude 20M texts me on Instagram and sends multiple screenshots of conversations with my sister sexting him. He was from the other side of the country and I don’t know how he got my instagram, I’m guessing my sister told him? But I didn’t understand why she would do that? I gave her an earful and we had a long talk about this with my family. At this point, all the threatening behaviour has worsened. She once said “I’ll call the cops and I’ll tell them that my family is abusing me.” Her tantrums looked l she lost her sanity. She blabbered random nonsense. “I’ll kill everyone in this family” whenever she was told to sit and study. “I’ll jump off a building” “this pen right here- it’ll be nice if I stab myself right now”. When my mom asked out of total defeat “where did you learn to speak like this?” She said “from you cause you’re mannerless” but my mom is the calmest and the sweetest person you’ll every meet. Just angry outbursts.

Some context about how she was raised- pampered and spoiled. She always got what she wanted and has always been babied in our family. 

And very recently she started posting explicit photos of herself on Instagram, mental rants about our family, one story where “sorry guys I couldn’t post pictures of today cause you know how my mom has trust issues with me🙄” when she went out to meet 5 guys. Meeting them is not the problem, no one really has a problem with it in our family. it’s the fact that she is making up stories about how I treat her, how my family treats her and how she’s suffering with us, all of this on social media with around a thousand followers.

 One of our family friends treat us so differently now, they are a family of four with two kids and the younger daughter is a year older than her. When I talk to her she gets visibly uncomfortable and does not respond to me. I do not know what my sister has been saying but it does not seem okay. 

I’ve tried to help her out so many times with kindness thinking she just needs some care and attention, but she goes back to doing the same things again.  

Today I got a call from my mom saying her teacher gave her a suicide letter that my sister wrote and apparently then passed it on to her friend, her friend has panicked and call her mom and the teacher. The teacher gave my mom the phone that I confiscated from her a few months ago. She has apparently been posting questionable things and the teacher has come across all of these somehow. 

The worst part is that both me and my mother knew that this suicide letter was just a desperate cry for attention. Although we aren’t taking it lightly, deep inside we both know it’s the stupid threat tactic that she has been using for years now. What is happening??

How does one go about this?
There are so many more things to this but this is how I have condensed it for now.

Rebuilding a life after mental illness and incarceration ,1716052979.0,"How do I rebuild my life after 2 felonies and possibly $1 million in restitution at age 37?

Hi all,

I was first diagnosed with bipolar around the age of 20 when I was in school studying finance.  I thought mental illness was bogus and was paranoid about the psychiatry field so I bucked the diagnosis and continued on with my life.

I battled through tremendous bouts of depressions to graduate from school and land a job in New York.  After 3 years, I switched jobs and ultimately found myself unemployed, but I had money in the bank so I continued to avoid facing my mental health struggles and instead volunteered in Asia and wasted a few more years putzing around meanial jobs here and there.

Eventually my illness started to present with religious zealotry and delusions / psychosis.  I wound up giving away all of my money and possessions and wound up living in the streets for a short period of time before my parents had me hospitalized.

Eventually it all led to one night alone in my apartment where I entered a psychosis state and felt impulsively compelled to burn an object for a religious purpose.  I had no fired place so I burnt it in my bathtub.  The tub later ignited and I knew I had to leave the apartment.  Just as I was leaving, I was reminded that I cancelled my insurance policy recently.

Long story short, I eventually was picked up for causing the fire and charged with arson.  The arson charges were later dropped and I was convicted of Causing a Catastrophe and Criminal Mischief.

I served 20 months in county jail and now am released in a mental health court probation program.  I'm facing anywhere from $650,000 to $1.5 million in restitution.  Presently I'm working in a deli at a supermarket.

I'm properly medicated now and am symptom free and hope to do more with my life than me menial labor, despite the fact that restitution will likely forever look over my head.

My question to anyone out there is how do I even start to pave a path forward?  How can I find a listening ear who may give me a chance at a salaried job?  What resources should I capitalize upon?

Any and all suggestions are welcome.

Moved out of state and mom guilt tripping me with C word,1716051731.0,"I am a 23 year old female who just moved to another state for the first time. I am now about a 9 hour drive away from my family. My 17 year old sister came with me to stay for a week or two to help me unpack and what not. To be honest, I wasn’t thrilled about the idea of her coming because we’ve never seen eye to eye and I like being alone. But despite not really being crazy about the idea, I thought since this is a huge change for my family, this would give us an opportunity to bond and what not and kind of prove that I’m not just leaving everyone behind. I just wanted to make her and my parents feel better. I have tried for years to have a relationship with my sister but she is mentally unstable and her personality in general makes it very difficult.

 Anyways, yesterday we got into a huge argument in the U-Haul over something petty. I wanted to brush it off but she was being difficult because she didn’t get her way, like always. I gave her some time to calm down and then maybe an hour later I asked her if she could help me bring a couple things from the U-Haul (air mattress, blankets, etc) so we could finally just relax since we were both exhausted. She had an attitude but agreed. We get outside and she starts slamming my stuff around in the U-Haul which set me off. I told her to stop with her attitude and that she has no right to throw my belongings around. We began screaming at each other and I kept telling her that she’s embarrassing me because we haven’t even been at my new apartment for an hour yet and I’m already in the driveway screaming like a mad person. I just kind of flipped out and told her that I knew it was a bad idea for her to come because she is insufferable. I called my mom to tell her that my sister is being disrespectful and that I was very upset. It turned into a huge thing. My sister kept following me around the house which pissed me off more because I kept telling her to get away from me and I just wanted space. 

Now to understand, here’s some background. My mom has a way of guilt tripping us every time something goes wrong. I can’t explain it but she just does and it’s very annoying. Whenever we get upset with her she says things like “I just need to die already because obviously everyone hates me and you guys would be happier”. As I’m on the phone with my mom she starts saying things like “this is my fault I knew I shouldn’t have sent her there with you” and I said that it would be fine and I just wanted to be left alone. Then she says “Yeah we know you want to be left alone. You left to get away from us so just be alone then how you want it then”. I then start screaming and asking her why she always has to guilt trip me and make me feel worse when I’m already extremely upset. Then I just hung up because I was way too overwhelmed between her, my sister, trying to get my things from the U-Haul, etc. 

And yes I was wrong in the situation that occurred next, but for the next few hours I was being very cold to my sister. I kept ignoring her when she was trying to talk to me and then I started screaming because I just wanted to be LEFT ALONE. My mom kept trying to call me and I kept ignoring her. I was just trying to unpack and I kept ignoring both of them for a few hours because I was just overwhelmed. 

My mom then texts me a long message (which she never does because English is not her first language and it’s hard for her to convey what she’s trying to say because of her grammar and stuff. But I kept ignoring her phone calls). She basically told me that she just found out a couple days ago that she has cancer and she sent my sister with me because she wants us to become closer in case anything happens to her. This made me very irate because I felt like why would she tell me this right now when it’s my first day in a brand new city and I’m already beyond stressed and can’t handle news like that. I called her flipping out telling her that I’m tired of her always making me feel guilty and I can’t believe she would spring this on me at the worst time. I feel bad for that now, but I wasn’t thinking straight and was having a mental breakdown. 

My mom and I are very close. We talk everyday on the phone, sometimes multiple times a day. I woke up today really sad about this whole situation, kind of feeling helpless. I called her and she told me, “it’s not for certain yet”and she still has to go for a cat scan and confirm but her doctor told her he thinks that this is what it is. This pissed me off because in the text she didn’t say that. She just said she has cancer. Then today she tells me they still have to confirm for sure. I just feel like why spring news on me like this right now, scare me and make me even more anxious than I already am, being so far away from them now. I don’t know why I feel mad at her, I just do. I’m also scared shitless and I don’t know what to do. I’m so stressed and I love this city but now I feel horrible for leaving her. She tried to tell me she’s going to be okay regardless, but now reality is hitting me hard that she’s getting older and one day I’m going to have to live without her. 

 I’m so fucking stressed and I don’t know what to do to make myself feel better. I was so excited to have a fresh start but now I’m feeling like I made the wrong decision. This is not how I wanted this experience to go and I’m annoyed because this was supposed to be a happy experience for me to get a new start at life. I can’t help but be mad at her and it’s making me feel worse because she’s obviously having a hard time right now. She was crying a lot for a couple days before I left which was weird to me because I never see her cry but I thought maybe it was just hitting her that I’m leaving. Now it makes sense why she was crying so much. I feel like a bad person. I’m extremely close to my mom and this whole situation is making me scared realizing that I’m going to lose her one day.

last year they were admitted into emergency inpatient. they explained to me afterward that they essentially had a psychotic break with overwhelming delusions and etc.

since then, they seem to have fallen back into similar spiraling thought patterns as back then, but this time mixed with this very inflated ego and some strange spiritual beliefs. they tweet *a lot*, and that is mostly where I'm seeing all of this. I had a friend who developed schizophrenia in his 20s, and this friend is about that age and is reminding me very much of that. I'm obviously not a doctor of any kind, but regardless those kinds of thoughts and actions concern me. I would hate for them to have to go inpatient again, and even though they seem to ride these extremely self confident highs, they also seem to be very distressed. everyone else who is friends with them have noticed these things too and the ones I've talked to also seem as concerned as me.

how do I talk to them about this? I know I can say ""the things you've been saying are concerning and I hope you are talking to a mental health professional about them"" but I feel like if that's all I said they might just disregard me as ignorant and not ""enlightened"" or something. is there anything else that is appropriate and helpful to say? I don't want to say too much, but I also don't want to say too little.

I haven't been returning their messages and have been avoiding hanging out with them because at first they were just saying some naive/rude things that really annoyed me, and I had been really really struggling socially and with depression, and I didn't have the patience for it at the time and felt it was better to just withdraw. I feel badly about that, especially now, but since then the things they have been saying have become very strange and confusing. even though I don't think I want to be friends with them right now/in the immediate future, I still care very much about them and we have had a lot of really lovely time spent together.

I'm not sure anyone else in their life at the moment is willing to approach them about this kind of thing, but I'm not 100% sure. they live with a parent who didn't treat them amazingly as a child and is now seemingly enabling them. they have said their parent seems to feel very guilty about everything and is now almost overly nice.

How do I (23m) get back to my old self?,1716050531.0,"How do I get back to who I was before covid?

TLDR: How do I become my old-self?

Hi

I've been in a horrible mental spot ever since covid with little to know improvements. Before covid when I was 18-19 I was someone who enjoyed being around people, had a lot of energy, extremely nice and fun to be around. I spent my time reading philosophy and was ties heavily to my hobbies. I was able to make friends and overall feel like I was worth something.
Ever since covid I've pretty much lost that light within me. I've become sad, bitter and miserable and it's almost as if all my emotions  and really my soul have just a blanket of anger and depression covering it. I've gone on anti-depression meds (tho I quickly got off it) and have been very close to ending my own life several times.
It's just feeling shitty all the time is exhausting. It's exhausting to fake being happy and to fake smile. I just can't atop seeing the misery around me.

Has anyone felt the same? How do you climb out of it? I don't know where or how to start.

Thanks for the help.

Why does everyone keep betraying me,1716049504.0,"I feel like I've been betrayed by everyone I love




I'm an 18 year old male. I've been diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and general anxiety for close to 5 years now. Before I've been able to find ways of dealing with it, but recently, it's become too much. Back in October, I had an argument with my mother about some of the things about my childhood. I told her my therapist said that the way she constantly threatened to leave and never come back was abusive and that she shouldn't have taken all of her anger out on me as a child. She defended herself and said I was crazy and making things up. I left without saying a word and went back to my dad's (parents divorced 5 years ago. I used to live with my mom and my dad equally). Later that week, I went to visit my therapist, and she informed me that my mother had removed her credit card from their system. I was shocked, and my therapist continued saying she tried calling my mother, thinking it was a mistake. My mother yelled at my therapist, telling her she was filling my head with 'dangerous' ideas and that she considered what she had told me to be 'imoral' and 'terrrible'. What my therapist told me was that my mother was an abusive narcassist who was actively emotionally abusing me. This did nothing but prove that she was right. I texted my mom telling her that I needed her to acknowledge that her stopping payment for my therapy was wrong. She did nothing but defend her actions, so, for the first time in my life, i stood up to her and told her that I couldn't take this from her anymore and I wouldn't talk to her until she acknowledged this. That's all I asked for. She told me she had done nothing wrong. That was 8 months ago. Since then, I have heard nothing back. I feel like my whole life was a lie, I spent my whole life giving my mother the benefit of the doubt. But it's only in hindsight that I can see how little she cared about me. 

Since then, my entire mom's side of my family, my 2 uncles, my grandma, and my sister had turned on me. They no longer speak to me. Thr only ones in my family that speak to me are my dad and my brother, whom both pressure me to mend things with my mom, despite me having done nothing wrong in my opinion except stick up for myself. I don't feel I've done anything wrong, yest the pressure to fix things is on me.

In October, a few weeks after me and my mom and I stopped talking to each other, I respectfully asked my ex girlfriend who I was very close friends with at the time if she wanted to become friends with benifits. As i felt extremely alone and needed some type of intimacy. She told me I was a disgusting person who only wanted her for her body. She then told me she had a boyfriend, which I later found out was my close friend and her best friend from when we were together. She lied to my face on several occasions about this. She told me she no longer wanted to speak to me. I don't understand how she could do this to me, she knew what I had just been through with my mom, she lied to my face and then told me she doesn't want to speak with my anymore. It doesn't seem like the person I had once fallen in love with at all. I tried on multiple occasions to mend things with her and reach out, but she has completely ghosted me. All of her friends, who were my friends, have stopped talking to me because of this.

Only a week after this happened, I started talking to this girl I knew in elementary school that I met through some mutual friends. We really clicked and started hanging out with each other basically every day. Things were getting flirty, and we began watching movies and stuff really close to each other (touching but not totally cuddling). I remember one night we were watching a movie and our mutual friend and my best friend at the time came over. He randomly called me and invited himself over. He came and we were watching the movie together and again me and her were really close to each other and i had my hand over her. She had to go to the bathroom and then my friend sat next to me so the only place she could sit was next to him. I didn't think much of this at the time, but when she came back, he put her arm over her and started cuddling with her. I thought this was really weird but I thought maybe they just had that sort of close platonic relationship since he knew I liked her and I thought it was insane for him to go for her in this instance. A week later, I had her over at my house, and we were full on cuddling. We watched movies for 6 hours when finally I asked to kiss her. She told me I had the wrong idea and left looking uncomfortable with my question. I was very upset but respected her decision. I texted my friend, and he told me I was weird for cuddling with her. I was confused by this comment of his. He then ghosted me completely. I found out a little while later that he had gaslight her into thinking I was forcing myself onto her (I asked if she was okay multiple times and we were just cuddling). He then proceeded to use that opportunity to have sex with her. They are now dating, and the moment I found out about this, I blocked both of them. 

I'm starting to lose faith in people. It seems like everyone just uses me, and when I stop serving my purpose, they get rid of me or do something terrible to me. I've never been suicidal but it's getting to that point. It just feels like nobody gives a shit about me. I lost both my best friends and most of my family. I don't know what to do. Does anybody have any advice?

I need your opinion and help me.,1716030816.0,"
Hi everyone, it's my first time here on Reddit. I was just wondering what your perspective is about my situation.

So, one year ago my ex-boyfriend and I broke up because he cheated on me. While being in a relationship with him, we did things that couples should not do before marriage, and my family found out about it. I don't know what to do. I'm so ashamed of myself. I sought help from my family and a school counselor, but nothing works. The shame I feel still haunts me. How do you overcome this?

Today, the feeling has gotten worse and worse. I even had suicidal thoughts because I've had enough of my situation. I cried a lot in front of people, even though I know I shouldn't, but I can't control my emotions. I'm ashamed of it. Even my mom cried when she heard about the things we did. It felt so awkward to know that my family knows what I did in the past. I didn't tell my school counselor about the things my ex and I did outside of school because I knew if I did, I'd be even more ashamed of myself. I can't stop overthinking about it. I feel like I'm being so dramatic. I want to get closer to God again.

So if you were me, what would you do? How do you overcome the feeling of shame? Have you ever been in my shoes?",Funny_Cricket_5554,,False,1cuuznn,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cuuznn/i_need_your_opinion_and_help_me/

They’ve moved on, I’ve bumped into them a few times in passing but it’s been awkward, we don’t really know each other anymore. Last time I met up with friends was to see Endgame back in 2019. 

At work, I work alone in an office, effectively a one man department. Some days pass at work without me speaking to anyone. It’s a small retail business, so no set lunch time for staff. I just eat at desk and maybe take a walk. 

I don’t have very sociable hobbies. I usually just game, watch movies, or walk dog. The dog walk was good when he was a pup cos everyone would stop to chat, now he’s an older dog nobody’s interested. 

I do miss school and uni days, when friends were everywhere. After school clubs, sports etc were easy to join. I was quite involved at school and had a good cross section of social circles. 

But now I’m an adult I’ve lost all confidence. I’ve tried to join groups but I’m just an outsider, a quiet one making up the numbers.

Trouble at home causing major anxiety (warning: mentions of suicide),1716024181.0,"Hi, my life is currently a very terrible whirlwind and I guess I wanted some advice. Almost 2 years ago, my older sister died at 18 after years of suicide attempts and drug problems. It hit my immediate family (parents only) very hard, and I feel like the consequences have begun to become very obvious now.

My mom (54) has always been severely depressed and never really had many friends, but ever since my sister's death it has only gotten worse. There was a brief period of time where she was seeing a therapist and getting better- working, meeting people at a volunteer job, etc- but stress from my dad's work has completely plummeted whatever happiness she had gained. Recently, she's been saying that there's a large, influential company trying to ruin her life- she's accused her therapist of selling off her information for money, that the people she met at her volunteer job were paid actors, even that they've caused our AC to break.

My dad and I are very convinced that it's some kind of developing psychosis (possibly a symptom of undiagnosed OCD, but we need to talk to a doctor abt that), and are very worried. She's been breaking down almost daily from the stress and I just want her to be okay.

On top of that, my dad recently tried to commit suicide around a month ago- he's okay and seeing a therapist now, but it was a very traumatizing situation for all of us.

Now, we are trying to focus on my mom, who has not realized that she is experiencing some kind of paranoid state. She promised me to see a new therapist and talk to her doctor next week, but refused to go to an emergency room until June bc she doesn't want to miss my graduation. She told my dad (when she thought I wasn't listening) that if she was locked up, she would kill herself.

I'm having a really hard time processing and dealing with all of this. I feel so anxious that one of my parents are going to die and that I'll lose someone close to me again- I feel like I can't leave either of them alone. Except in a few months I'm going overseas for university. I just want them to be happy, but sometimes it feels like it's impossible.

I've always had intrusive thoughts, but they've only gotten worse, and I can barely focus on school. I am trying to go out with friends more, but the more I'm out of the house, the more anxious I become.

I'm sorry that this sounds like nonsense, I just don't know how to make this better.",jacobsmonster,,False,1cuteot,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cuteot/trouble_at_home_causing_major_anxiety_warning/

Feel free to answer one, none, some, or all of the questions. I need to discuss this


1. Is It Normal to Crave Be Sexually Assaulted and Abused? 

I ask this because I quite literally love the rush of it happening. It makes me feel good. I was abused and assaulted in my childhood. I don’t remember ever not liking it. This confuses me.
I am quite possibly sure I purposely put myself in situations where I could die or get raped.


2. If A Person Enjoys Endangering Themselves What Exactly Is Going On In That Brain Of Theirs? 

3. Is This an Obsession?

4. How Do You Stop It?

5. Am I Actually THAT Traumatized If I Seekk Out Traumatic Experiences?

6. It Feels Like The Second I’m Uncomfortable, I’m Into It, Does That Mean I Was Into It The Whole Time? 


7. I Am EXTREMELY Attracted To People Who Have Harmed Me, WHAT IS EVEN THAT?

The short version is that I suffered with intense anxiety, depression, paranoia, isolation for many years.. While at the same time being a caretaker personally and professionally. 

Eventually, I was able to live on my own, but I was drained. I developed a friendship with a neighbor, and it eventually turned intimate. However, I started to go through my most severe breakdown, and even today I can't fathom the state of my mind at that time.

I ended up getting in trouble with the police, losing a friend, and finding myself in the worst place of my life. Now, I have legal struggles, financial struggles, personal struggles, and have completely humiliated myself. It is bad enough I sometimes dont feel comfortable to leave my home.

Am I evil? ,1716020843.0,"I think I’m evil. Truly evil. And since I can’t go back in time and change things, I’m thinking about ending everything. I’m 25, graduated in college this year, unemployed, and still living with my parents. They don’t mind, in fact, they absolutely love me and the only thing preventing me from suicide right now is the pain that I would cause them. I’m an ungrateful piece of shit, a loser. My parents supported me all my life, and still do, even tho I give nothing in return. I do the bare minimum around the house. 

My mom has always been so good, nice and kind to me. Never demanded anything of me. But I’ve always been abusive and ungrateful with her and my dad. Also with my older brother, when he got a girlfriend (now his wife), I hated her and I used to do everything to annoy them. Till this day, I feel like they hold grudges towards me. I’ve been abusive with my only partner (now ex, for his sake), not to the physical point although sometimes I would push him away when he tried to come after me when I was upset. 

I gained over 30kgs (66 pounds) during the pandemic due to my depression meds, and one day my mom took me to a dietitian and it triggered me to a point where I took a knife in front of her and threatened to cut myself, and she begged on her knees apologizing, and I will never forget this image because it was so painful to watch her in so much pain, and then I kept mentally torturing her… I went to my room and locked myself, and swallowed like 10 of some random pills that I knew wouldn’t do any harm to me, but still I did it just out of pure evil, just to torture her. I then preceded to pretend to be fainted until she called 911 and broke into my room and took me to the hospital. I’m crying so much just writing this, I feel so much pain and guilt for what I did to her. 

Sometimes in some other episodes during my teenage years and my college years I was also violent towards her, not to the point of causing bruises, but I would grab her or push her, something a child (as an adult) should never do to a parent, but still, I did. I was also many times verbally abusive and manipulative with her.

I did all this and she still loves me and forgives me and worries about me. She still smiles at me, and tells me goodnight and good morning everyday. She still does everything for me. Why am I so violent and impulsive? Why did I do this with her, a person that loves me so much? What’s wrong with me? I just want to end everything and be punished somehow.

My gf's mom is abusive and it's killing our relationship.,1716016307.0,"I've been formally dating my current gf for two months now. We met at college and stated going out and now we're an item. At first, as with any relationship, we were in the honeymoon phase and everything was great. Now, as the relationship is getting more serious, I'm growing more and more concerned about her family.  
Her mom treats her like crap. She body shames her, offers almost zero financial support (actually steals her daughter's money sometimes), is known to physically abuse her and her dad (they're divorced), shows up unannounced at my apartment while I'm with my gf to pick her up, and just constantly takes a toll on my gf's mental health and self esteem. I can see how she's in a great mood when we're together or when she's hanging out with her friends and how angry, sad and unstable she is at home.  
I have been though a similar situation. My mom emotionally and physically abused me for years until I realized she would never change and moved out at 21. However, I had a support system, a safety network in my dad who offered his home. My gf doesn't have that. Her dad helps her out sometimes but won't have her move in. Idk why, if he knows her mom is abusive and has experienced abuse from her.  
Now, there is an age gap. My gf is 18. I get that she's just starting to become an adult and maybe it's difficult for her to understand how her family dinamics affect her and our relationship, but I'm really worried for her bc of how my own situation with my mother affected me and my relationships for so long. I'm 23 and currently live alone, for context. I know it's weird, even tho she's 18. I wasn't expecting to date someone so much younger than me, but things just fell into place, and now we're together and I love my gf. Our relationship is great in all other aspects. We treat and care for each other really well. But I feel like my hands are tied with this. I can't just tell her to move out. If I had the financial power needed, I would support her, but I currently don't. And I can't change her family or convince her dad to help out.  
I must confess. Bc of my household and previous problems with depression and anxiety and such, I haven't been in many relationships in the past. Only until my 20's have I started dating. So take that as you will. Maybe that has to do with the age gap too. But I do have experience with mental health. My own. I have been trough years of therapy and now I can focus on building my career and relationships. But I only know how to take care of my own and have no idea how I can help my gf.  
I only want her to be happy and to overcome this somehow, without it killing our relationship.

Cross post. I'm really struggling.,1716011053.0,"I can't believe that I'm blasting all of the following to the world, I just need help getting through the weekend until I can hopefully see a psychiatrist early next week.

I have recently received some extremely alarming and sensitive major family news affecting my entire family about very sensitive topics that I'm not even sure I can even discuss here. Tried Reddit CrisisLine, but nobody answered twice after 45 and 60 minutes. I'm really not sure of in any way considering self harm.

But it has thrown my already existing depression into a spiraling and crippling depression that is really causing me to want to just give up. Again I stress, not to the point I'd take action, but so close. But I just don't really care about life anymore. I don't have any fight left in me. On top of my myriad of current major medical issues that already have had me really weighed down and struggling, my sleep is down, serious weight loss in a short period of time (25% loss) I can count one time on both hands the items I've eaten this past week. Not taking meds as I just gag and barf them up, and honestly I'm just tired of the side effects. Daily migraines. Acute pain throughout body for decades, which is being treated through pain management specialist, but its still there. Anthropophobic,  agoraphobic, and SAD. New rheumatologist doc says maybe Fibromyalgia to add to my existing health stack. Which in itself, explains so much from the research I've been doing since. Shoulders and neck are rock hard. Nightly recurrent nightmares of being pulled under by water rapids, and I can't swim. I'm a recovering Norco and Soma addict. I'm working a program, just not NA. Treatment in 09, but I've had a few relapses since due to physical body pain that I'm be treated for. In irony, one of my many long term medical issues requires me to remain on the same medications I was addicted to. I've become even more of a recluse, only ever leaving home to get groceries (rare now) or to go to medical appointments. Like I know that I need help, I just don't have anything left in me to fight. Tired of health. Tired of family. Tired of life. I just exist day to day. Dreading to get out of bed each day to cope.

I had a really horrendous encounter as a youth in the psychiatric system and meds for gay conversion 'therapy' that I've never dealt with the aftermath of.

Additionally I've got significant church related shame and issues surrounding my being gay, so religion is completely out of the picture. And I've 100% zero desire to go back at all. This with even given that the largest LGBT church in the world is right here in Dallas. This is compounded by a marriage that I had to the pastor of the 2nd largest LGBT church, that viciously ended after 6 years of continual psychological and verbal  abuse for which I wasnt 'permitted' to seek help for outside of church by the board for what it could potentially do to harm the church.

* Adding today, I missed a call from my cardiologist today who indicated I need heart work and fast as I've got numerous blockages on my heart that could account for the off the wall arrhythmias I've been having. To be honest I'm not even sure if I want the surgery for it, hoping it will just kill me sooner. I'm just struggling to even comprehend this new news, given that I eat like a bird. This on top of everything else is just pushing me closer to the edge.

My own therapist is out of town camping for the  weekend until Tuesday and I've not been able to reach her. I don't currently see a psychologist. After months of trying to get into a psychologist that didn't have an extensive waiting list, I was finally able to schedule a psychiatrist visit and consult for next Friday the 25th of May. But I missed a call today from them as well stating that they need to reschedule. So now I have to wait some more, and who knows when that will be.

I also want to add that I have a very loving husband of 25 years. He's being so supportive, holding me constantly while I cry. He just doesn't know what to do either, other than to be there for me. He is the only one anchoring me at the moment. I know and understand and see that I'm catastrophizing in what ifs, but if he wasn't here, then I wouldn't be here typing this message, especially after today.

I was able to speak with 988 today, the National Suicide Prevention line. And I was able to barf all of these feelings out to him. But I'm still very raw and struggling. Been in bed all day, which has been my MO for a hot minute.

I've been zonked all day on my weed, and Valium from pain management just to cope as I was hysterical earlier after cardiologist voicemail. 

Does anyone know if there are weekend emotional support groups in Dallas, TX area that I could go to over the weekend.

I'm just adrift and looking for input on sensitive topics. Thanks in advance for any recommendations and comments.

DMs for advice from mental health professionals are fine. Encouragement and support groups info DMs are fine as well.

After searching for a job for the past five months, I finally got an offer from Goldman Sachs, which is a big deal, yet I still feel insecure. I thought landing a job would make me happy, but it hasn't.

I'm also trying to lose some weight I gained in college, and seeing everyone looking perfect on Instagram discourages me instead of motivating me. I keep comparing my job to others' and what people are doing with their lives. While I'm trying to save up for an apartment, it bothers me that people my age are already living in beautiful high-rise apartments in the city. I’m in Chicago, by the way.

Everyone around me seems to be in a relationship, even those who mistreated me in the past. My last relationship ended more than two years ago, and I want a boyfriend, but I don't feel confident enough in myself to be in a relationship. I feel pressured to find someone soon to get engaged in my mid-to-late 20s, following society's ""timeline.""

I haven't bought new clothes in a long time because I'm losing weight, so my outdated wardrobe makes me feel insecure.

What’s left?,1716009388.0,"What’s left in this life? I had a love that was my everything. I would die for him. If he needed a heart I would die to give him mine. I have loved this person since the moment I laid eyes on him and always felt like we were meant for each other. We dated throughout high school but I broke up with him before senior year ended. It really was never bad between us… it’s just things happened that was emotionally too hard for us at that age to handle. We kept in touch for awhile but after a year or so we stopped talking. Once I was healed I realized I had messed up but he had moved hours away. I packed my car up and decided I was going to go win him back. I went gassed up and about to get his address when I checked Facebook…. “New relationship status”. My heart shattered. I went home and bawled myself to sleep and cried for at least a month or so… right then and there I promised myself no matter what point in my life I am at if he ever is single again, I will go after him and give it my all.. all of my relationships since him have been me just going through the motions and in some ways losing myself. Not caring who I am with to the point I started being abused. I was in a really low point in my life to the point I didn’t want this life anymore. But I couldn’t do that to him. I’ve stayed here for him, I love him, I want him. While being hit, thrown down, sexually assaulted, yelled at, etc…  I would lay there crying, my thoughts would rush to him and just thinking of him is what kept me here on this earth.. kept me mentally going. One day I was creeping on his mom’s facebook and realized he was now single… in that moment I jumped with joy. I broke up with my current hell of a relationship. I kicked his ass out of my house. I waited a bit and then reached out to him… we have been in contact ever since and to my knowledge it was bliss… he even came and saw me this past weekend and stayed with me. I have loved this person for half of my life. 12 whole years. To me he is the love of my life. I don’t think I will ever love anyone like this ever again. I don’t want to. Tonight he tells me that he doesn’t feel the same way, he hasn’t felt the same way since we started talking a couple months ago… he wanted to wait until we saw each other in person to say anything. Which I understand… I just honestly don’t think I can do this anymore. I don’t believe I can live this life without him. This whole entire time I’ve truly believed we were end game. I just want to end my life right here and now. He’s the only reason I’ve made it this far as it is…. I live by myself and it’s all I can do not to end it right now. Why should I keep going? What’s left?

How did I end up the way I am,1716008503.0,"sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this, but idk where else to ask, I've tried looking up this question, but haven't been able to find any answers so I was hoping at least one person here could explain this to me..  
  
Anyways to keep it short, I was such a good kid, I was like the golden child, I was well behaved, very active, extremely social, and just an amazing child overall, which is why I am confused why I am such a mess now at 20. If I was such a good child, what could've happened in my life to cause me to be so different. I can't go out of the house without fear of people looking at me, extremely inactive, can't keep any form of relationship or friendship.. well I've always had that issue starting freshman year of highschool... idk where that issue came from, probably the same place the rest of my problems originate from, but I have all sorts of awful mental issues, worst one being BPD, I hate BPD, it can go eat a fat pile of shit. I try to think back to where I changed, but I can't really think of it, nothing severe happened in my life, I didn't suffer a loss or anything, one day I was just a completely different person.. the old happy child me disappeared, and the absolute piece of shit me appeared, and has stayed since and I hate it  
  
But yea, I guess to sum everything up if I was such a golden child, what could've happened to make me just miserable, like everyday I feel awful, do things that I don't want to do, and am just so confused how everything went so wrong, I don't understand life, and probably never will, but why do these things always seem to happen to me.

Today I was diagnosed with schizophrenia ,1716007600.0,"Saying this happened today is a bit of a stretch. Apparently after telling my mother what my psychiatrist said, she told me when I was a boy my psychologist made their report and told I had a ""schizoid personality"". None of this came out until today when I asked what my mentally ill aunt had when I was small. Turned out she also had schizophrenia.

I am scared and a bit relieved that the symptoms I have been getting now make sense, but the first thing I have to do is escape my abusive Job.  All I could think of was creating a small funding so it helps me with the treatment and the amount of therapy, psychiatric sessions and medicine I'm taking. 

If you know about anybody who could help, even with a dollar, I would be eternally grateful. All my problems get worse on my job, and since I'm a contractor I don't have anything that would cover the treatment.

Apologies if this shouldn't be sent here, I'm processing a lot of information right now and I have a lot of fear.

should I go to a ward?,1716006795.0,"Hi, first post in here. 

Long story short, Ive got a handful of disabilities including autism and because of that, I’ve never really been able to maintain strong relationships. I’m in pain all over 24/7 with zero support and I’ve been suicidal since I learned what it is, but my family aren’t the most functional people either and I know most methods would destroy their entire lives so I’m not an active risk. 
But at the same time, if I could click a button and be dead I’d do it in a heartbeat. If I had the money, I would buy a boat, go out to sea and do it there so my family doesn’t need to see my body and deal with the cleanup etc. 

I feel like I need to escape to somewhere with frequent and accessible therapy/support, simple routine and meet people who have issues as well but like… I’m not at risk..? I’m kind of just wasting my life away and waiting for one of my issues to be fatal, I’m too tired to take any action. I just wish I could function and be normal.

My mental health has been horrendous my entire life. Five years ago when I hit rock bottom, I decided to make a change.

In these five years I have done anything and everything to fix my mental health. That said, I have gotten no where, and in fact, I am worse now more then I have ever been. 

I lost all my, “friends” and friends, no chick wants to talk to me and they’re scared to even look at me. Talking to my parents doesn’t help because it pisses off my dad, and it gave my mom a heart attack that nearly killed her.

Ive been working with my 2nd therapist for a year now, and honest to god, I feel worse now then before I decided to try therapy.

I’ve tried and tried and tried and tried, and it just keeps getting worse and worse.


The only option left is to go to a psych ward, but they ignore my calls. 

Idk what else to do, I told my parents 10 years again when I was 14 that I planned on killing myself when they eventually pass away. 10 years later and this still holds true.

I’ve felt insignificant, less than, and mostly like a failed shell of a person my entire life

I’ll try and sum this up as best I can. I’m fully aware that I have a lot of childhood trauma I need to overcome. 

As I child I had epilepsy which lead to constant bullying from classmates and severely limited my ability to make friends 

Meanwhile, my parents are both alcoholic narcissists. My father would get drunk and physically abuse my mother in front of us, in turn she would cheat on him. They divorced when I was 10 and both remarried to people who wanted nothing to do with myself and my siblings.

My father remarried a woman who accused me of stealing bank statements to show my mother. My father believed her over me. He had two more children, and moved 8 hours away essentially abandoning us

My mother remarried a man who treated myself and my siblings like the scum on his boot. Always muttering under his breath and being completely hostile towards us when my mother was absent. I’ve also always felt like my mother has had a favorite and it wasn’t me. 

I moved out at 17 to get away from him and struggled to live on my own. Going through a few relationships that ended in me being cheated on. 

I managed to become part of a toxic friend group but eventually met the love of my life through that. We’ve been together now some 14 years and have 2 children and one god child. She helped me so much to work through a lot of my trauma but not enough. I still to this day have feelings of inadequacy.

I’m a singer/songwriter and all the while I’ve been pouring my emotions into my music to deal with the thoughts in my head. I’ve had dreams of getting my music out to help others but every time I think I’m at a point where I can afford to get some of them recorded some life disaster happens…….

I’m 18m and genuinely am out of ideas.

I get severe panic attacks, I’m depressed, and my anxiety is crippling. I’ve switched antidepressants 3 times over the last few years. Even though I want to improve, I can barely leave the house. Panic attacks are truly awful and aren’t something I’ve been able to work through or ‘learn from’. They are torture for me and make me feel ill for days.

Bluntly, im feeling hopeless. I’ve struggled all my life, and have never felt truly happy. I come from a bad home and don’t feel close to my family. My parents are divorced and not speaking with each other. They aren’t great people.

I’ve been to the GP SO many times. I’ve been with CAMHS, Mind, phoned helplines, spoken to CMHS (I’m in the UK). I’m not being taken seriously. I was on the phone to 111 (it’s like the NHS health helpline) yesterday and they said they don’t recommend hospitalisation because I can ‘get better at home’. 

My current ‘support’ is seeing the GP once a month or so and being told that I’m on a waiting list that’s over a year, and that despite being suicidal I’m not going to get much support.

I can’t afford private healthcare. I’m not in school or work so I don’t have access to the related counselling. 

I’m tired of being stuck in this hell. I’m tired of being told that I just need to ‘give it time’ and to ‘prioritise my mental health’ when that’s ALL IM DOING. I’m sick of being told to go on a walk or visit a self-help website. I’ve DONE THIS. I’ve done this time and time again. I’m not saying these things don’t help, but I am having a mental health crisis and need professional support. 

It feels like no one is taking me seriously and the world is moving on without me. I don’t just sit and wallow by the way- I try my hardest to push myself, to work towards improving my situation, but I cannot do this by myself.

I have no savings, I was in debt till one month ago, I can’t eat solid food as it just is too expensive, and the house I currently live in won’t be available anymore soon (deadline in September/November) 

I work a lot at least 60 hours a week, so physically it’s taking a toll on my body, just want to take it easy every now and then. Mentally I just feel like I’m not making any progress whatsoever, I have no friends, just my boyfriend and I don’t want to put too much burden on him as he has his own issues.
We are also in a long distance relationship so he can’t always be here for me.

Honestly I feel so depressed with the way how I’m living right now, like I don’t want to live but don’t want to die as well? 
If you’re wondering why on Reddit? Why don’t you go speak to a therapist? Well because I literally have no more friends, like they’ve all moved on and it’s hard to make new ones when you’re only working. Also to talk to a therapist it takes about a year so what’s the point you know? 

There are days I feel better, days I feel really anxious, so anxious I can’t breathe properly and I feel anxious the entire day. 
Is anyone else experiencing anything like this? 
Is this the life we live in now? Living paycheck to paycheck not being able to eat properly? Thanks for ready, I really just needed to vent, hopefully at least one person reads this❤️",OkPie6033,,False,1cugh7o,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cugh7o/how_to_continue/

I know when it hit the fan today and I was getting screamed and sworn at by some idiot that later confessed they were having a bad day so decided to take it out on me I had a lot of people that had my back. People that went out of their way to be on my side and listen to me get upset. The few bad make the whole day worse.

My parents asked if I was suicidal,1715976148.0," For context, I have sh (though not really bad and I'm clean right now), and my mum saw the scars. She was crying and and asking me lots of questions, one of which being if I was suicidal. I said no, because obviously I don't want to worry her, but I'm not entirely sure what counts? 

 This is a really stupid question, but what is the normal amount of wanting to die? I mean, everyone has said something like 'kill me now' or 'I want to die' or 'if... I will actually kill myself'.

  At this point, my reaction to even a minor inconvenience is thinking that I want to die, and sometimes my brain just starts telling me that I should kill myself for whatever thing I did wrong last. I've thought about it a lot, and started clearing out my stuff so things would be easier for my parents to get rid of, or sort or whatever after my death even with no immediate plans. I stood on a hill above water for a while but ended up just going home (probably a good thing since in reflection it wasn't that deep and I probably would have just embarrassed myself).

I have no particular desire to live, i think I'm just sort of neutral on it at the moment, but I stay alive because I would feel guilty for upsetting my already struggling mum if I died. I doubt I could really go through with it anyway

I don't trust people anymore, I wanna love, but there's this voices or reflex that makes me subconsciously protect myself everytime I go help someone, like ""they will use you, say you are busy, say you don't know."". 

earlier I felt guilt, for saying I don't know, someone asked me ""can you go do and reset the cctv camera outside?"", I just turned it on and off and said ""I don't know how to do it, I just restarted it instead"" but at the back of mind "" I know, I can learn how to do it, I want to do it  but maybe next time it won't be just this."".

It is sad that they will just notice you when they need you, they will just be good to you if there's something they want from you, in the end there's really no one who could help you, when you need, even just someone to listen to you.

I get anxious for every little thing now, God, I don't know how to earn money, that's important in this world to survive, I can't even face new people with a calm mind, so how do I present myself? How can I present myself to anyone just to earn.

What can I offer to this world? am I really just this? will I never be able to support myself till the rest of my life? It is too much to depend on others, I felt guilt to do that too, I don't wanna be a burden to anyone, I don't wanna be seen by their eyes as that, I can't even look people around me right now, I felt so ashame to them and to myself.

I worry, they will see me as a toxic one, as a negative person, or someone too much to be with, and they will just leave me. That is why I just hide, I hide whenever I can't face them with a smile. Can't you just take me? I think I can't face tomorrow anymore, I wanna go now, I don't think I have reasons anymore to stay, they will be fine without me.

My mind is so all over the place, jumping from this one to that one, God, what should I do? I am quite not sure now, I feel like I will just make it harder for those people I love and those who love me, if I stay.

Not only am I not certain of if I can even have a normal conversation without getting paranoid, if I don’t, I don’t know what to say. If I try to listen to verbal words, I get distracted. If I try to understand, I misunderstand. If try to seek help, it often makes me feel worse or later seems entirely like it’s tricked me. If it doesn’t seem like it’s tricked me then it hasn’t helped. If it has helped, the help is brief. 

If I have learned something, it may be, regardless of what other people are like, at least don’t be bad, even if you disagree. I’ve also learned, sometimes you’ve just got to say “something!” On exceptionally rare occasions, I may lash out. If people seem to think virtually everyone is bad or even if they don’t, they criticise certain minorities or are maybe mistaken about individuals or they are totally intentionally or intentionally confusing you about whether they have morals anyway, what are you you supposed to do? Also, if I don’t want anything to do with the fight for what’s just or right or wrong, since, even when they’re fighting for what is supposed or what they perceive as right, also just causes more problems. It may be like I shouldn’t strongly stand for anyone or any group or anything. 

If I’m interested in problem solving but have problems with problem solving but also don’t want to make the mistake of being selfish or selfless or group narcissism or things like that, what’s left may be certain unusual people which I’d even want to speak to.

Im just gonna write my thoughts here about what has happened this last month

I lost a 12 year friendship and a a 2 year relationship/i mean yes it was toxic but i felt i had a goal.. We were stuck in breaking up and going back together I had to end it at some point Meanwhile in one of our break ups she was romantically interested in one of closest friends When i got back to her he never told about it After about 4 months i decided to finally break up for real and just find something more stable because i lacked it After a week i saw her naked in my friends dms I was really mentally unstable filled with rage... Couldn't sleep at all I know we broke up but it's still wrong...

After that i decided that i just wanna get married (relationships and dating is hard where i live)

I told a close friend of mine she agreed but told me to give it some time so we can settle things out After about a month she told me she wants to end everything... (Yesterday) Her reason that i was being too cold. Or I don't give her the attention that she' deserves'

She went to the hospital and i was busy at work she never told me..

she wanted me to call her while at work to check on her... She only didn't respond for two hours.. Went to her workplace (today) gave her breakfast and told her I'm sorry... Nothing worked... I want to try again after a week or 2 just giving her some space...

Now i feel really really lost.... I
 don't know that many female . Friends i

Even though I have a good group of friends from high school that I’m always in contact with I struggle to talk about myself and my problems to them.

I do have a solid group of friends at school that I’m able to ‘hang out’ with during school hours but because i’m more introverted, the fact that i’m the only friend that has a job alongside school, and the need to prioritize assignments/work, I find it hard to talk to them and be able to hang out with them. I feel horrible about it because when i see their hangouts on social media that i wasnt even thought to be invited to,  inside jokes i’m not apart of and them being able to joke around so easily strikes a chord in my heart knowing that it’s hard for me to have that connection with other people. 

I wish I had a better social life. It seems impossible with my schedule and I’m not sure what to do about it because i’m not in the position to quit my job. i’ve learned to love being alone and having my own time and take myself out for dates and concerts but sometimes I wish I had a best friend that I could talk to/hang out with everyday, i wish i was able to go out and meet new people and hang out with those i’m friends with and most importantly, i wish i wasn’t seen as the “boring” or “side” friend. my friend group consists of 2 duos and i feel like a 5th wheel floater friend.  i’ve noticed they talk behind my back about how many plans i’ve had to cancel because of my schedule, and they’ve made snarky comments on how quiet i am and how i don’t add to their conversations. they don’t seem to understand how emotionally and physically drained i am everyday and it really hurts.

I genuinely don’t know what to do and i’m so torn about it. i don’t know if i need new friends, i don’t know if i need to sacrifice something for a better social life, but i just feel so lonely and isolated sometimes and i just need some advice if anyone has been in the same shoes

ADHD/ASD and my relationship with food is starting to scare me,1716034147.0,"So I’ve started my treatment again for ADHD and recently I’ve been really stressed and dealing with a lot of relationship issues, I have a load of university work and generally more anxious than I have been for a long while

I have always had a bad relationship with food, being a girl and my mother’s daughter it’s all I’ve really thought about from a young age. 

I have autism as well and always been picky. So picky to the point I went to a 3 day camping trip with my school when I was 8 and refused to eat for three days because there was nothing I considered safe. My mum told me I ate like a starved animal when I got home. 

All my life there were certain things I would eat and if they weren’t available it was that or nothing. 

My mum also has always commented on my body, I once remember her coming face to face with my stomach when she was coming up the stairs and poking at it. I was 19. 

She would ban me from eating bread, pasta, potatoes and such before big parties. 

If I said I didn’t think I looked nice in a dress, I would look for compliments but I would only get comments on my weight. I even once tried on an old dress of mine and couldn’t get it on and an old dress of hers and when I told her, she wanted to see if she still fit in it. She did and pranced about the house happily and with pride. 

She’s also mentioned my thunder thighs, tummy, my baby fat, how she slimmed down at my age and I would too on top of other stuff multiple times. 

In my first year of uni I thought this was normal, for mother’s to do such things, until my friends said they were surprised I didn’t have an eating disorder. 

My friend since first year admitted in the second year, that she did think I had an eating disorder when we met because she never saw me eat once. In second year I did lose a lot of weight rapidly because of meds, depression and stress and this friend would knock on my door when she noticed and make me cook and watch me eat, always get me snacks and offer food. 

She also would sit with me in my room after to make sure I wouldn’t throw it up. Once when she fell asleep I tried it but didn’t like it. 

I think this is when I really started seeing the decline in my relationship with food. I even lied during CBT therapy when taking the test for EDs. 

I lost a 1.5 stone (9kg) in 1 months, no exercise, I rotted in bed and just never ate. I regained in the summer of 2023 but when I restarted uni in the September, another month and I lost even more. 

By this point my mother, the one who would make so many comments. Actually grew extremely concerned. When I lost 9kg she commented on my beautiful figure, in the September when she visited me, she couldn’t believe how much smaller I was and since 15 I had practically maintained the same weight until the year I turned 20. I went from a UK size 12-14 to 10 (I have a larger bust so this was very concerning for my mum when I went from buying dresses in L to a S, I never was a S before).

It’s been abnormal now, always up and down. But this time it’s worse. 

My whole body aches, I am anemic, my heart is always pumping fast, I’m light headed, dizzy, can’t sleep, feel sick, getting stomach cramps, sweating constantly. My stomach is flat and boobs look weird and then I looked in the mirror, for the first time in my life my ribs are protruding and I’m not sucking in. I shake at the thought of food and my meds don’t make it easier. But if I stop taking them I will fail my degree. 

My face looks the same as far as I can tell, my thighs are no smaller, my arms are still “flubby”. 
But my torso has never looked like this before and my thunder thighs are still there but I’ve never had a thigh gap at all and now I do. Then I started thinking back to how much I’ve been eating. 

Barely anything at all, I have no motivation for it. I only minimally snack in front of friends to lower concern but none have seen me eat a meal and if they have I’ve never finished it. 

I ate this morning and the whole time I was extremely uncomfortable eating a meal I normally enjoy. I can feel it in me and knowing I have to do it again is a chore. 

My friend from second year took a leave of absence and I don’t wear a lot of fitting clothing so no one has noticed or cares to. My best friend is in recovery for drug addiction and anorexia so I can’t talk to her. 

I don’t want to see a doctor but I have counselling on Tuesday and gonna tell her, she can’t diagnose me but hopefully I can get some support. It’s gone too far and if I keep it up everything I’ve worked hard for won’t come to pass. 

I’m scared to weigh myself if I’m honest. 

I’m scared. I love how I look but this is not healthy.

I feel beautiful and my mind is so against it but I don’t want to hurt anyone. 

Hopefully I crack into gear soon

Wish me luck :)

Nah not luck, wish me wilful x

Is this dissociation or something else?,1716030861.0,"Is this dissociation? If not, any ideas?

Hi there. I've been experiencing something for a very long time now and the closest I've come to understand it is when I hear about dissocation, but I'm not sure if that's what this is exactly. If it's not dissociation I'd love other suggestions or things I could look into.

So what I've noticed is that after I have a difficult or stressful day and once I have an opportunity to relax or no longer need to perform socially, I find that I feel disconnected from my body in some sense, although it's not my whole body. It's usually just my face. I can still think my own thoughts and tend to have a full, detailed dialogue going on with myself in my mind but I can't will the words out of my mouth. I can't speak or show expressions. My wife asks if I'm ok and if I'm sad and all I can manage is a quick ""I'm alright"". She says I look really sad. I have thoughts that I want to get out to tell her but I just can't speak. I cant express myself. I can type things in full detail as you can see. But I can't say any of this out loud. 

I really can't figure out what this is. I have been diagnosed with combined type ADHD if that helps, and I take medication for it. However this has occured since before I started taking medication so I don't believe it's a side effect. 

I'm in full control of my body I and I can otherwise function as normal. I'm not a danger to myself or anyone else.

Hypomanic becoming manic??,1716020554.0,"Feel like I’m actually going insane 

I thought I was feeling stable after supposedly becoming hypomanic a week ago. The pattern so far is that i feel somewhat elevated then okay then down then elevated then okay and now I’m feeling super elevated again. I don’t want it to stop though. I feel amazing. I know it *should* stop because I might be feeling what may be losing control of myself. I haven’t drank in over 4 years because it was an issue for me but I’ve bought alcohol twice in the past 3 days (didn’t drink it so it’s pretty much just a waste of money with no benefit). I was searching around trying to find my SO’s car keys since we have to share a car currently but I think they hid them from me. I wanted to go buy a delta 8 vape even though it interacts negatively with my meds and makes me feel really weird mentally. While searching I found my sister in law’s pack of cigarettes and went outside and smoked one even though I don’t smoke. I used to vape (which is different) but haven’t in over a year. It’s 3:30am on a Saturday so it’s not like I can try to see my nurse practitioner today or tomorrow and we’re on a trip until next week.

My SO is the only one in my life that is actually concerned but they said it’s because they’re the one that has to deal with the consequences/aftermath. Everyone e,we just thinks I’m in a good mood and more talkative. I even told my friend how I have been feeling and that I left my house one day with a bag packed and she thinks what I’m feeling is “relief from realizing I actually want to leave my SO” which I’ve been debating ir trying to think if that’s true or not.

I’m not really sure what to do at the moment. I guess just wait and see if it levels itself out? Is this similar to anyone else’s hypomania or when you’re on your way to becoming fully manic??? This post is pretty late but I am really looking forward to any input people give.

I’m just really confused lately, it’s been a couple weeks of shifting moods but the overall reoccurring one is elevated and it’s been getting more intense each time.

Why do I want to get drunk or high or even smoke the cigarette like I did if I know they’re not good for me and that I shouldn’t? I haven’t actually drank but I definitely would have went and bought a thc vape if I had car keys… Also have had the recurring idea to download dating apps even though I’ve been in a stable monogamous relationship for over 8 years.

I didn't grow up in the city I live in, so I missed out on making those long-term friends from school that a lot of people seem to have.

I work as a solo gig worker, which means I don't naturally make connections like you would in an office setting. It's tough.

I try to go to events to meet people, but it's hit or miss.

Sometimes it feels like people don't really value new connections because they have so many options, or maybe it's just too much effort to keep meeting up.

It's hard dropping everything to meet someone, especially when the initial excitement fades and reality sets in.

I literally told them that staying there wouldn't be good for me, but no - it'll help my depression. I spent every day thinking of how much happier I would be outside of that room. Honestly, it just made me more grateful for not being locked in a room where the door outside only opens 1 1/2 inches. Once I told them, ""What if I fail my stats class because I missed my final?"" They said they'd write a note. Yeah, as if my professor would care.

I am not social/have no interest in being social. Mental health? Or just me? ,1716016333.0,"Hello,

When I was a child, I had friends, but a lot of my friends my parents didn't like and I was forced to stop having friends. In addition to that I was often grounded to my room for weeks-months at a time for stupid things...This has led me to being a bit of a recluse as an adult.  
I was forced to go to a lot of social events and shoved into uncomfortable situations by my paretsn...and a lot of verbal/mental abuse. (Not going into details, have seen a therapist!)

Now I am an adult, and for most of my life, I have noticed that I really have no interest at all making friends/keeping in contact with people or meeting up with people. Social events just really don't interest me and I would much rather be at home.

At work I made friends with people and I really got along with them, I liked seeing them on break and chatting with them, and we even exchanged numbers and spoke about meeting up outside of work. BUT I never messaged them and however much I like these people, I just don't care to meet up with them for coffee etc. I just don't really have an interest in messaging or staying in contact...It makes me feel like a terrible person.

I used to have social anxiety and I thought that this was probably why I don't enjoy social interactions with people...but with a lot of work, I don't have that anymore. I am actually very confident now. So much so that I actually like meeting new people and talking to them etc. BUT that's as far as it really goes with me interest wise.

This is also the same with family members; I just don't have interest in meeting up with them or messaging. Sometimes I even get annoyed when I get a message from someone (family or not), and maybe I will reply a once or a couple of times and then I am just not interested anymore and just don't reply. I don't often start up conversation becasue I just don't really want to.

The ONLY person I actually stay in regular contact with and enjoy talking with is my BF. We are currently long-distance but I talk to him daily and I do travel to meet him. I will start convercation with him and can enjoy talking with him.

In the past I have had close family tell me I am not normal and tell me I am unhealthy for not being SUPER social or outgoing....I have never been that ""party animal"" they wanted me to be.

I'm not unhappy, actually I am more than happy being alone. I have a dog who is my best friend but also am into dog training; personally I could be very happy never speaking to anyone becuase I have my dog...I know that is not normal, I am an animal lover and work with animals too....

\_\_\_\_

I feel like it's not normal and I am not sure if I should be worried about that or not. I know not replying to messages and just never talking to people is an a-hole thing to do.

I can fully see how this train developed in me from my childhood, but I'm not sure if it's something I should now fight against or not.

I guess what I am trying to ask is: Is this something I should be worried about/get therapy for? Or just accept this as my personality at this point?

People would say ""ew"" as they walked past me, teacher kept talking to me about drug use ( they thought I was using drugs because of my hair, never touched alcohol or drugs) and thus no one wanted be around me. I learned to be content. I became comfortable with solitude. My life just consist of going to work and coming back, but at work I began working with this women. She and I grew close she began opening up about her struggles and the tough time she was going through. We would spend time together and I just wanted to make her feel better because she told me she been abused her entire life and the sacrifice she had to make. She ended up losing her job and she asked me to lend her money for rent or she and her kids will get kicked out. I used my saving on her because I thought I could sleep in a car but a family cannot and didn't want that to live on my conscious. This is the first person I could call a friend and she made me feel so special and made me feel as if she was in love with me and was my girlfriend. This was a drug for me I didn't care what I had to do I just wanted to save her. The most painful things for me is I will never be able to relive those moments of happiness. I got her groceries and I took her family out to eat so they would be happy and I got her a better job. When she got the job and got back on her feet she began to turn cold on me and began to just drop insulting things about me.

With my wife things are just OK, just the typical discussions but nothing escalates, we don't scream at each other.

The best way to describe how I feel is like being disconnected and tired. If something should be a moment to laugh, I'm unable to genuinely laugh, even if I really find the situation wholesome or funny.

Recently I’ve begun to feel bad about myself. I keep telling myself not to think about what other people think. And I’ve burned it into my brain. But it’s getting to me. I met a guy, I thought he was cool, we talked, but he doesn’t seem to want to talk to me I guess. I think to myself and said “he’s probably not for me”, “we won’t end up together anyways,” “it doesn’t matter.” Then why I’m I thinking it’s my fault, that there’s something wrong with me? No matter how much I say to myself “don’t worry about what people think” i cant stop. Sometimes I feel left out or lost in a group. Do they really care about me? If I was gone, would they care? I’m really focused on my grades and try to score very high, and I do. That’s what brings me happiness and that my kept me going. But suddenly this feeling of wanting validation from people has got to me. I shouldn’t care. I know. I’ve done a lot on my own my whole life, and I’ve never had a partner to find comfort in. And I’m thinking maybe there is a reason why I’ve been alone for so long. Is it me? I don’t think so, but why? I feel alone. I know I have my life ahead of me.

Buspirone made everything so worse!,1715997977.0,"I went to the therapist on 27 of April and I was talking to my doctor that I don’t want to take any SSRI as it makes everything so bad and it triggers my IBS! I asked her I have normal stressful life and when I talk myself through it I feel fine even though at some moments I feel sad. She rejected! And said I’m doing bad to myself and that have to take antidepressants. I felt so guilty thinking maybe she’s right I’m not helping myself. She gave me Buspirone to soothe the side effects from the sertraline! She told me to take 20mg of Buspirone and half pill of sertraline daily ! 

Actually I couldn’t do it! But instead as she told me to take Buspirone to calm my anxiety then I take the main SSRI! And I did 20 mg for 3 days and I got this vivid severe intuitive thoughts I was so freaking out but didn’t doubt it was actually the Buspirone. So out of fear I took half a sertraline and I felt so bad I felt like if have got hit all over my body and I was so angers with scary intuitive thoughts! I canceled many things and didn’t live normal life for like 5 days then I had voice insides me says stop -I’m not normally an angry person at all- I thought it’s the medication making me so angry. And I asked for another appointment. 

I went to the appointment and of course the doctor didn’t believe nor I was understanding what’s going on with my body !. She said I’m so impatient and I need to take things seriously! She gave me Paroxetine! I told her again ‘my life is very stressful, I’m 30 this year and I don’t have stable job and I don’t have someone in my life and I went back to my family house I feel lonely but this doesn’t need medication! Maybe talking to someone will help!’ But she convinced that I have a problem that needs to be solved by the medication! I got out crying like if the life had darken. She told me what i am just saying is another panic attitude and I need to stop! I reflected that to many decisions in life when I backed off on them I said yes maybe she’s right! I have to be okay I’m 30 !! 

I went back home! I have all hope though that day I had less effects from the medications as I stopped but I listen to that doctor and I took the medication for 3 whole days ! And I couldn’t know myself in the memoir I was soooo drowning inside ! And that night I was fighting bad intuitive thoughts that I really didn’t know what they are I thought I’m going crazy ! I suddenly slept on my bed hugging myself and then I woke up panicking I believe so much in god so I prayed and read Quran in cup of water -and I have to say this I didn’t believe in this but I did it anyway I was hopeless- and then I went to have my Buspirone with the water! I tried to drink it but it didn’t go downs I tried harder but somehow I couldn’t swallow it then it flew out of my mouth on table and I cough! Went to wash my face then I said let me try again but I thought ‘wait, usually this pill goes down without me feeling it! This is so strange’ so I googled Buspirone give me bad thoughts and I found this  [page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buspirone/comments/xxeit5/coping_with_a_major_uptick_in_intrusive_thoughts/) where people are talking about the same thing! I was happy and sad ! I thank god I thought I’m crazy ! I cried a lot for me and others who’s struggling! 

I stopped whatever she gave me ! I don’t even dare to go see it even! I prayed a lot more ! I have no one to talk about this anyway and I feel lucky I can pray it to god! And slowly I was feeling better to fight things within 2 weeks I kinda felt okay but it always goes back if I ate like : egg, tuna, green tea, ginger, banana! I don’t know why 

And then the starting of this week it all became so bad again! Like if I’m taking it all over again! Intuitive thoughts and confusion! Went to the hospital and no one dared to talk me through I feel so alone and trapped! I can’t eat food because I’m scared it will increase the serotonin! I can’t feel it ! I’m so hungry it will increase the intuitive thoughts and confusion and Agitation! And with that my anxiety goes so up fearing I might go crazy!  

I don’t know what I am supposed to do ! 
Today I thought to eat a little bit as I felt better I had bread with chips and mango!- and oh dear god I feel so bad ! So triggered!  Anyone can help please ! 

Sometimes I blame myself on how that doctor behaved! Maybe she saw me not too happy and not excited! Maybe I went to her with so much gloom that she thought I need that medicine but I hate I hate it I want my life back please please!

"When the hospital staff decide whether they should keep a patient in long-term care or release them, they ask both the patient and the patient's guardians. Which party would they listen to?",1716001472.0,"Last year while I was in a military school, I was hospitalized due to suicidal contemplation. After receiving medication and therapy for three weeks there, I was in a condition where I was no longer an immediate danger to myself. The staff asked me whether I want to return back to the military school or to stay in Kingston General Hospital to receive long-term care. I told them that I would like to return to the military school. They also asked my parents as well. My parents also agreed to have me return to the military school. I was then discharged from the hospital a few days after. Fast-forward to one year later. I am still struggling with suicidal ideation, although to a lesser extent than before. My mother told me that if I ever self-harm again, she will call the hospital and ""force"" me to stay in long-term care. She told me that she would prefer for me to end up as a vegetable in the hospital than to have any risk of me hurting myself. I think she is over exaggerating since I rarely self-harm now and I have kept my suicidal thought under control for the most part. She believes that if she had told the hospital staff last year that she wanted me to stay in long-term care in the hospital, that the staff would have listened to her over me. I want to settle this once and for all. Would they have listened to my guardian's input over mine? If not, why are they even asking for the guardian's input?

Spilling myself out,1716001978.0,"Posting this outside my normal account because why not honestly 


Ive been pretty much isolated socially for about 4 years or so (more if you don’t count the times I have been in public school around what I can best call associates), and I’ve never actually retained a friend beyond a couple of months. 

For awhile I began talking to people online. It seemed to work for a bit. At some point, it started getting too personal. As it turns out, people who don’t actually interact with others in real life don’t know how to properly handle emotional problems. This was something I couldn’t handle, so I started becoming distant. I did make other ‘friends’, but the duration of those friendships kept getting shorter and shorter. I couldn’t (and still can’t) help beating myself up for not being there for people I’ve never even met. At some point, I’ve stopped trying.

As sad as this may sound, the only other person I regularly talk to is my mom, which isn’t saying much when you live under the same roof. She’s been a lot better in more recent years, but I have some vivid childhood memories. I can count 3 separate times she’s threatened to put me out (as early as 9 years old or younger), the screaming, the berating, and even one time she actually choked me. Family drama beyond just her didn’t really help much, so contacting a majority of them hasn’t really been of interest. 

My mom has always been cynical when it comes to people’s nature, so internally it’s made the idea of actually interacting a lot more intimidating. Ironically, she gets along with people much more easily than I do. Truth be told, the concept is kind of terrifying to me.

Before I stopped regularly talking to people online, I started cutting myself. I have already had suicidal ideations (spanning a few years) and other destructive tendencies (head hitting, skin picking, a few other body focused things) among a few other developing personal problems. I’ve been in a sort of gradual decline.

"Hi everyone, i'm tired.",1715996092.0,"I'm typing this while i'm crying and sitting on bed.

The last few years have been really messed up for me, I havent shared it with anyone cause i'm scared people might see me as weak or use it against me.

Let's start with my childhood,
I grew up in a household with 2 abusive parents , 1 brother and a sister.

I've been emotionally neglected by my parents, i've been abused physically and mentally by my mom and sister. My dad abused me more mentally but still didn't do as much damage as them. However he did abuse everyone else in the household.


Fast forward to me getting older, I would get bullied and I basically raised myself since my mom was working full time and had to deal with my mentally ill sister (at this point my parents were separated cause my dad held a knife to my brothers throat in front of me 2 TIMES , I was under the age of 11 when this happened)


I got older but the situation at home did NOT change with me having a depressed mom and mentally ill sister. I would find my escape online cause I was lonely and I used to get bullied in high school. This put me in unsafe positions, at one point I had multiple stalkers (i'm sure it was my sister). My sister was always jealous of me cause I was the skinny and ""pretty"" little sister while she was the overweight insecure sister who would get picked on by everyone.

My sister strangled me in my sleep,she made fake accounts of me, pretended someone else stalked me while she was the guilty one. My sister cut herself in front of me when I was little. All in all she did damage me

It's too much to share but I slept with men to feel something cause I felt so numb, I was not in the right place. I've had multiple abusive relationships. I'm 25 now. Emotionally exhausted.

My sister tried to kill her baby and ended up in jail and a mental hospital. 

This took a toll on my life
I've thought about changing my name and moving cause at this point in my life i'm just this hurt child who is scared to be nice and soft.

My little sister (F9) is very afraid of being alone,1716004377.0,"Before I begin, I'm aware my sister is young- she's 9, and it's normal for kids her age to be scared of being alone in rooms, or monsters

But I've been really worried- because this is to an extreme with my sister

She's so scared of going to the bathroom alone because she says she sees monsters, and I ask her where the monsters are, and she says it's in her mind - she always sees monsters in her mind

Everyday she leaves the bathroom door wide open while she takes a bath, and someone needs to be watching her while she's taking a bath - she doesn't care that people can see her naked

One time I accompanied her to the bathroom and I asked her what she's afraid of, and she pointed at fingerprints on the glass of the bathroom, and said she's scared of those, because she doesn't know why it's there, like it might have been a monster - that's when it really intrigued me that she'd take note of something as small like this

It's not just in the bathroom, but she's afraid of being anywhere alone in the house. Even when   the entire family is inside the house (our house isn't that big, and it's pretty noisy) she doesn't want to be alone. 

Even when it's daytime, and everyone's present in the house, and she leaves the door wide open while she takes a bath, she still is scared and needs someone watching her

If she's forced to take a bath alone, she shouts my name as loud as she can and asks if I'm still there numerously while she's bathing just to see if I'm still there

Her only response is that she keeps seeing monsters in her mind

I worry that this is something more serious. She's so afraid of being alone, and refuses to do anything alone even if it's something urgent. She just refuses to be alone.

It feels like some force in my head makes it impossible to behave like a normal human. And for the record, I've never been an anxious person, or a depressed one, or any of that. I was just wondering if this could possibly be a mental thing?? This is so debilitating, and it irks me that I can hardly put it into words. I've been dealing with this for a couple of months, and my therapist plus anyone else I talk to is devoid of answers to what this may be. Everyone keeps acting like I'm just weird or something, and that makes me lose my mind more than it is already lost. I feel like I'm losing my mind and the excellent way I've always had with words. 

I desire to isolate myself as much as possible, and I know I'm not quite thinking clearly.  I just feel flat and strange and yet somehow stretched out of shape. Not happy, and not sad, I don't know what I am. My thinking is so disorganized, and I sound so horrid when speak. My head is spinning and buzzing (not physically ofc) and it's driving me insane. I dread the future if I have to go on without improvement or answers to why I feel like this. My potential is rapidly deteriorating, and I can't grasp why? I don't know why I'm thinking as strangely as I am. What in the world is wrong with me?  Does anyone have an idea of what this is or what would help?? I think I'm pretty desperate at this point.

(Also I apologize in advance if anything is weirdly phrased. Again, I can hardly put anything into words -- no matter how much I revise it.)",LocalCitizenHere,,False,1cuo08b,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cuo08b/please_read_to_bottom_urgent_need_urgent_need/

I can’t tell if i’m depressed or not,1716001618.0,"28m here. i can’t tell if there’s something clinically wrong with me or not, because i’m sad but it seems like a ton of people feel this way at least a little and i mostly function alright day to day. (have an alright job, a few friends, date here and there, hobbies etc.)

i first started wondering if i may have a mental health issue around 15 years ago. i’ve pretty consistently felt like i’m just more tired, slow and apathetic compared to my friends,loved ones and peers. i have trouble maintaining relationships. it’s like theres nothing inside me to give them so i withdraw or they do and i get left behind. 

i’ve never really admitted it or sought help but i frequently feel frustrated with life and wish that my existence would end or just had never started. i feel trapped alive, like now i have to do all these different things to make myself happy and upkeep a life that i never asked for. like everything i do is towards some goal i don’t even care about and if it were really my choice i would just leave. i have brothers and a mom and dad though so i can’t.

i don’t know how to talk to anyone in real life about my feelings but i know that’s what you’re supposed to do if you think you may need help. even this feels weird and embarrassing. i feel like the only way is to pay some professional stranger or just keep gritting through it internally, but what type of life is that? 

TLDR; i’ve been sad basically my whole life but does that mean i’m depressed necessarily or is this just a rational way to feel? thanks if you read all that

I am a diagnosed schizophrenic. I feel like nobody understands me.,1716000551.0,"Over the past year, I began to experience a lot of things that don’t make any sense.

My mom is trying to fight me and I don't know what to do.,1715999341.0,"TLDR: my mom is (consciously or unconsciously) making me out like I am a villain in her head and that I am constantly disrespecting her. She has a history of fighting with those close to her about this same thing and destroying those relationships, and I believe that she is doing the same to me with an even more tenuous grasp on the actual situation than in previous ones. It has become a serious drain on me and I don't know how to navigate this situation anymore.

I need help understanding what is going on in my mom's head, I can not tell anymore. I (23M) live with my mom (51F), or rather as I'd like to put it, we have lived together since the start of COVID. My mom has a long history of poor mental health, although I only really remember stuff from after I was about 16. She has SH'd at least once in her life, and has struggled with mental health issues since my sister was born 20 years ago. My family was born in South Africa and we moved to US in '03, it was really hard for her. My dad worked in the office, but my mom stayed home to take care of my sister and I when we were growing up.

Starting in about 2017, my family started to suffer with serious mental health challenges. My mom was having a really hard time herself, and my sister was in crisis all the time. My dad was not really emotionally available at that time as a result of his upbringing, so I took a lot of the brunt of emotionally taking care of my mom, which I did starting in about 2018. It took a toll on me, and I attempted SH in October of 2019 shortly after starting college. My mental health was poor for a very long time afterwards.

I moved back in during covid because I liked living with my mom more. I had a rough time for a while, having another SH attempt in 2022 after leaving college, and have had a long journey back to relative mental wellbeing. My life is starting to get back on track, and despite a couple things thats I still struggle with, I am happy with myself and where I am.

I have been the one to help my mom with her struggles since 2018-ish. She has very poor emotional and mood regulation and is prone to anger and outbursts over slights against her, perceived or real. The more troubling aspect is that she cycles through an ally-to-villain-to-ally cycle with many of the closest people around her. She has done this with my dad, who is still a villain to her because he left her. He did cheat on her, which is pretty important to the story, but she still hates him to her core to this day. She has done this with my sister, the cycle has come and gone at least 2 or 3 times now I would guess. I have tried to temper this, to console her but to offer her a differing perspective, but it has become less and less effective over time. At this point, I can't stop her anymore.

She has already started the cycle with me. There was already an incident last year and I basically had to walk her off the cliff, making major concessions to her just to be able to live at home. I was not really in a situation to live by myself and having my own dog makes it even more challenging. It has come back again this year, but now I can't stop her. She is picking fights over small things; how I do the dishes, going on <30min runs without telling her, etc. I have been trying to assert boundaries but she does not respect them. Last year it was her audibly *doing the nasty* with her partner while I was home, this year it has become making decisions for me about my life and encroaching on my autonomy. She has herself admitted that she can not really stop herself from seeing past her emotions, but her inability to take criticism means that I can't stop her because it will almost certainly make things work.

Tonight was a total shit show and she goaded me into a fight because she made major changes to my financial life, telling over text while we were both home, without any measure of consultation or discussion. When I told her later it was extremely disappointing that she did that, she retorted that I had been extremely disrespectful and uncommunicative, so it was justified. I disagreed, saying that a therapy session I had asked her to join was me trying to tell her face-to-face about what I had been struggling with our communication. Eventually, I walked away to return to what I was doing, and she muttered ""fuck you"" under her breath as I walked away. This was a childish comment and I got angry because of it, and a proper argument ensued.

What am I supposed to do here? We still have the session on Monday, but that will be more of a ""let's cool it off"" rather than ""let's fix problems"" session. What am I supposed to do in the meantime? Just let her talk shit and be disrespectful towards me? Live by her rules because if I don't she'll bottle it in until she finds a way to retaliate? While moving out is technically an option, it is not really a good one for me; I am starting school again next week and both that and my job would be significantly farther away if I had to move in with my dad.

Found my husband letters,1715998873.0,"Please tell me if I'm just overreacting, cuz this is causing me panic attacks all day.

I found some letters dated to 2010 from a woman he had a simi romantic interest in. It was way before he and I got together(2018). If I remember correctly it was his first. But it was long distance, and whenever they were together in person it was super awkward and it doesn't go anywhere not even sexual, but they're very chatty over letters and text. Even then I glazed over the letter, it wasn't very romantic either but I digress.

It difficult to explain, but I don't have a problem with history, but I have a problem with a lack of transparency. Because this issues started  when I found another woman's name tag from his place of employment on our damn fridge, conveniently placed where I wouldn't see it immediately and apparently has been there for quite a while. I heard about this woman from the stories he told but I did not realized they were friendship level enough for him to have a ""momento."" Why he has it is because she left to another state and he wanted something to remember her by.

I wouldn't have had a problem if he just fucking let me know cuz I had a history of being cheated and grew up from a broken home from it.

When I first saw it I was trying so damn hard to composed myself, but I lost it because of a different heated discussion and I just had to bring it out in the open. I'm ashamed and hated myself for it and I'm still so mad that he tried to dismissed it. It made me felt like he valued the friendship more than me.

I get the secrecy and I made it a doubt edge sword for him but dear God he cannot think that not telling me would be better.

I recalled him mentioning letters, and I asked to see it as he enjoys telling stories from his past but he seemed hesitant about it. Now that I found it, I've been holding it in cuz I know he's just going to dismissed, put a bunch of logic into it and tell me I'm overreacting. I'm so exhausted, I hate his idea of privacy. Plus it doesn't help that a bunch of non-related discussion is similar and I just can't keep doing this, I'm starting to regret so much.

It made me so mad that he tells me I need to let go of the past yet here he is reminiscenting about his!

DARK PASSENGER,1715997841.0,"Hey! I've been binge watching ""Dexter"" series in Netflix thus the title. I badly need insight/s.

TW: Dark stuff. Please scroll down if you're uncomfortable with this topic or may trigger you for some reason.

For context, I read a lot of articles about mental health and self diagnosed myself as bipolar and have anger issues. For my peace of mind, I went and have myself checked with a psychologist and psychiatrist last year and I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Consistently talking to my therapists (once a month) and taking anti-depressant (fluoxetine). 

But somehow, even if I am taking my meds, my ""dark feelings"" still won't go away. 

A little bit of history: I was SA'd as a child by a legally adult relative that went on for 2 yrs, and a neighbor (2 yrs older than me but we were both minor at the time) which went on for 5 yrs (never told my fam cause I'm scared of something that might happen to me or them).

I never knew what real love means and how it works. Thus me looking for love in the most bizzare and unhealthy relationshits - thus the PTSD. Because even tho my parents are not legally separated, they are physically and emotionally separated. Separate bedrooms, separate houses. They're emotionally absent towards us but financially responsible for our needs. 

Now here's my dilemma:

If I get in conflict with someone, anyone, my mind always think of every morbid scene I can do to that person. I always think of torturing & killing that person. And I fantasize it over and over until my brain focuses on other things.

I know it's wrong but I just can't help myself from thinking that way. I'm an alcoholic and working my way towards sobriety because I totally lose control when drunk and I'm afraid I might actually kill someone - which I almost did but thankfully I came back to my senses. I'm impulsive especially when drunk and never think of consequences until I actually did something and regret it. 

I'm a 100% lesbian (hard butch) but sometimes when I'm drunk, I find myself looking for guy to fuck (did it 3x) then regretted it and fucking sobbed the next day.

My therapist knows about me being an alocholic but doesn't know about these rage thoughts. I'm afraid that she might report me to the authorities or be held in an institution (I have panic/anxiety attacks when in enclosed spaces; with nowhere to go out to: I'm claustrophobic). I know there's so-called ""doctor-patient confidentiality"" but I think my situation is not covered.

I'm currently in my last semester of school, and I'll be starting my career as a psychiatric nurse practitioner in just a few months.

Welp... now what?,1715995619.0,"I've written at length about an experience I had a couple of months ago with a doctor's office that caused me a lot of grief. I won't go into detail here but if you check my post history it's all there.

Today, someone from the surgical facility where the procedure was performed called, and she empathized with how I was feeling, while putting up with a bad connection on the line and my own impulse to raise my voice whenever I didn't feel like I was being heard or understood.

She took everything I had in stride, and did an excellent job of explaining to me the things that nobody had before, during or after my appointment before. She listened when I told her that the tech that had worked on me was wonderful, and for some reason I felt like she might actually forward it along when I told her I wish that the tech had been informed that she made a difference for me.

I've spent nearly three full months emotionally wracked regarding this event, and unable to think about much of anything else. I have, and do still, feel sick to my stomach, my skin is crawling. Despite this, I feel like the shackles were taken off of my mind today by this woman's basic ability to empathize with what I was saying and how I was feeling.

Now, I'm still angry and hurt, but I feel like it's time to move on and I'm lost. I've pushed everyone close to me away because I've been irrationally angry and bitter... and I didn't want to hurt them as well.

I've been unable to get established with a counselor as they all want to do walk-ins and I need an appointment window as I can't take a full day off of work for this.

I still feel hurt, but I'm now realizing that there's really no good reason to... nothing about what happened was on purpose. If anything it was just a lack of empathy combined with my own lack of expression of how I was feeling at the time, and my lack of being emotive is not on the people working there just doing their jobs.

If anything, the doctor should have made sure I was physically OK (I was not) before letting me leave. Other than that I need to accept that this was SOP for the staff and they were doing a good job by any measure they were aware of.

I have very little memory of my childhood and yet I think I had a great upbringing? wtf?! ,1715995464.0,"I have struggled with this problem for a long time…I’m 39 years old and have very little
memory of my life 0-18. Of course I remember   moments here and there, some random, some significant but often I wonder if I’m actually remembering the photo evidence and not the actual memory if that makes sense? 

It has completely thrown me for a loop because I had/have wonderful parents, nothing traumatic as far as I remember but yet I can’t recall much. When I think back to that time I just know in my soul that it was comforting and I felt very loved and supported. Yet for ex, if I think about my grandparents whom I was very close to, and spent soooo much time with, I can’t even recall that many specific moments with them.

I knew they were special and I loved them but yet very little actual memories.  

What would be the reason for this? The only thing I can think of is I started having panic attacks at age 26 and from there it went down hill..I’ve been on and off antidepressants for the past 7 years. Could an event like that erase memory or perhaps is it the medication?

An older man with short white hair and beard and glasses. Don’t know him. Thought nothing of it at first. Random cars park in this street all the time. I had just gotten out of the shower so I don’t know how long he was there for. Probably not too long.

I decide to take out the trash. As I open my front door, I look at the car and notice he turned his head to look at me. I look away quickly and continue on my path to the garbage bin. As I throw the garbage bag into the bin, I hear his ignition start. As I start walking back to my front door, he’s moving forward, the performs a U-turn and stops in front of my house this time.

Now I’m looking through his windshield and notice he’s making eye contact with me as I’m walking. I’m starting to panic a little now. He might have grabbed something large or small, maybe shiny, from his passenger seat and I notice he looked at me and then back down at something about 2-3 times. (A phone, a book?) 

I go back inside (keep in mind my whole trip from the front door to the bins and back took about 30-40 seconds if that), and look out my window right away and he’s still there for maybe 10 more seconds before driving off. He might have taken a note before driving off? He made no more stops on the street as far as I saw, and just continued on to the city street. 

I feel like I’m naturally an overly cautious and anxious person. I absolutely have social anxiety. I probably have some kind of undiagnosed mental disorder. This isn’t the first time I’ve been this stressed about something but I feel like this was way too specific of an event and immediately afterwards began to feel ill and theorize explanations. My head was spinning and my knees were weak and I felt faint. 

I’m afraid someone is after me or that it’s an investigator of some sort. Spoke to a friend and my mom and they told me it’s nothing to worry about, but I can’t shake it. Do you think I have some kind of paranoid disorder or is this logical thinking?

A little personal post. But if you have been struggling with depression or any other mental illnesses. How did you realized that you needed to seek professional help? 

I feel exhausted from constantly trying not to be sad. My body feels tired and I struggle to concentrate in things. I usually write in a journal when I feel overwhelmed but it's always the same issue that I am overthinking. I do not want to live in the past. I detest seeing myself still be in the same place I was 2 or 5 years ago while everyone changes and moves on. I'm not ambitious about anything and don't have any goals. I don't wanna keep being lazy and rot in my bed every time I have time for myself. I wanna be productive but once I initiate something I just can't go through it. Discipline and consistency is hard. I understand that you must start small and built up things but even doing that is so hard. I am 19 and will be turning 20 soon. I don't wanna keep thinking that someone will come and save me from myself. That's just unrealistic. I wanna be able to snap myself out of this situation. Obviously, the reason I am this way has to do with past events that occurred in my life. But even so I can't seem to move on. And on top of that I’m like super insecure like bruh( I don't know if this is even depression since i don't want to self diagnose but i'm not sure what to even call this.)",Tojicvmslvt,,False,1cul5s3,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cul5s3/any_recommendations/

I stopped taking them. I found more people to speak too and they keep saying i’m bipolar.

I didn't achieve anything in my life - I feel worthless and stuck in life,1715991961.0,"I just feel like I missed a big chunk of my life. Like a part of a puzzle and without that, I just can't go forward. Life is just passing by while I can't do anything to change it. Sometime I feel like the odds are against me, because when I want to change things and take actions, unexpected things just prevent me from doing it…

For example, I wanted to gain professional experience by volunteering. First try, pandemic happened. Second try this year, my email never reached to the organization I was 100% sure to be chosen. I wanted to participate to a photography contest this week. It was raining the whole week and missed the deadline... I didn't see the northern light because it was cloudy all weekend (and rainy after that). I feel unlucky...

I know people keep saying to focus on good things instead of negative, but I just don't see anything good happening in my life.

I'm 30 and just worthless. Graduated in multimedia in college, but didn't go to university… Well, not true, I tried, but it wasn't for me. Didn't find a job after searching for almost 2 years. Before that I only got 2 x 6 months term position. I'm working at minimum wage, live with my parent, don't have a car, don't have friends who are inviting me to do something (I'm an introvert and I actually don't know what to do with people either) or nobody to bring me up.

On the other hand, in my family, my brother just followed the regular path of College -> University -> Dream Job. Or relative who are airline pilots at 22 yo, entrepreneur at 26 yo, etc. Last time we had a family meeting, I just didn't want to talk to people because I was ashamed of myself. People explaining everything about their exciting life while my life is just plain boring with only working a job I hate + sleeping.

It's hard to not compare yourself to others when you want to be somewhere else in life, but you aren't anywhere. It's like if I spent 30% of my life only doing 1% of what I really want. I need to do 99% in under 70 years (if I reach the age of 100).

I don't remember when is the last time I was truly happy. Probably when I was in College and was just learning new things and I did a volunteer camp abroad to dig on archaeologic site. It was fun and I met some great people. But that was about 6 years ago... Otherwise I try to travel once a year and every time I feel better. Most people like to return home after a trip, but it's the thing I hate the most. Why should it stop? Why can't I continue exploring the world? - Now back to work... I f\*cking hate my country Canada.

I didn't travel for a least a year now, because I just don't feel like 3 weeks vacations is really what I need. I think I just need to take a sabbatical and just go see the world without limit, but I just don't know what to do now. There are some lucky people who were raised in the good family and are able to do what they love for money. Others like me have loving parents, but parents who also want to control their child. I'm 30 and I feel like they consider me like a child. I know that I can just disappear one day and never talk to them again ever, but I'm not this person... I'm a bit of a people pleaser, introvert and everything make that I'm making sure that others are happy or I go against my own ideas because others think it's stupid.

Whatever, now I just feel useless. Nobody care about my skills and I'm at a point, that even if I did a bootcamp and watch tutorials online, I just doubt of myself. ""Am I really good? Will I ever find a job I like?""

My dream would be to work with animals, be able to live nearby a beach to surf and enjoy horse riding (that I already do a bit). Like that would be my peak happiness. Just live quietly and do things I like, but right now, in Canada there is no beach for surf, horse riding isn't popular and can't meet people and I failed biology two times, so can't work directly with animals. I try to work indirectly through my field of digital media, but I just can't get the experience to get a job. I currently waiting for some news about a job in Africa for wildlife conservation, but I really want to quit my job this summer and do something more meaningful for me like volunteering at an hostel in Europe, getting professional experience while meeting travelers and be in a new environment. Whatever, I don't have support for that and it's hard to say ""Let's do it!"" when everyone around you are like ""It's a waste of time, it's stupid, etc."".

I'm just hopeless. I don't see a bright future for myself.

I don’t know what’s going on,1715991590.0,"I don’t even know what I want to write so this might be a bit jumbled as I am having a crisis right now.
Ever since I turned 15 my mental state has changed drastically. Basically, It’s as if I don’t feel emotions as much as I should. Don’t get me wrong, there are things that make me happy, things that make me sad but all of it just seems so…insignificant???

I remember being at my grandma’s funeral(she died after this whole ordeal started so I know it’s not the cause). Everyone around me was devastated, my mom was crying, my brother was crushed even my dad was in tears, but me? Nothing. I just felt akward sitting there while people told me they were sorry for my loss when I, myself, wasn’t. I never even went trough one stage of those all famous “stages of grief”(I very much loved my grandmother so I should have been grieving too). On that note, when people say “I’m sorry for your loss”, do they actually mean it? Cuz I sure never have. I just do it because it’s the “polite thing to say” but I don’t actually feel sorry.
That’s the main crux of the problem really, I just feel like I have zero empathy. I mean if my friend’s family member passes away, I know that “this is terrible and they must be crushed” but that’s just the logical conclusion. I’m starting to feel like some sort of serial killer, cuz that’s what they do, right? They don’t have empathy. They don’t care for the pain they inflict upon others, they don’t feel for them.

Well, it felt kinda good to write that all out but what I’m really looking for here is for someone to tell me that they feel something similar so I know I’m not going crazy. Or, if you could provide a name for what I’m experiencing, that would be even better. Mental health is kinda stigmatized where I live not to mention my parents once told my brother to rethink his relationship with his girlfriend because she had anxiety. I tried google but the closest thing I found was alexithymia which I don’t really understand(what does it mean by “difficulty identifying emotions”??)

Existing after trauma,1715991124.0,"I, 24f, grew up trapped in a really abusive environment for the overwhelming majority of my life so far. My parents were emotionally and at one point sexually abusive. I grew up in poverty and had to move often due to my parents not paying rent. This eventually lead to us being homeless for a couple of weeks as we slept outside the house we were evicted from. To say I was depressed during this time is an understatement and my anxiety was worse.

My biological dad offer to let me and my younger sister live with him and while at first it was great the second half of that year was the worst time of my life.
He fought with his wife daily, physically most times, and was always drunk. He made explicit comments about his sex life towards me and my underage sister.
He made numerous transphobic remarks towards my sister and often commented on her genitals.
He would make food he knew we didn't like and then get mad and yell when we didn't eat it.
Once he was wasted and ate all his sushi then forgot he ate it. He got furious and told us he was going to lock up the fridge knowing I had things I bought myself in there. He also knew both my sister and I hated sushi but he said he had to punish everyone because he couldn't prove who ate. Keep in mind he ate it.
His wife was also, to be blunt, crazy.
She was convinced he was cheating and ""hacking"" the wifi and would cut it off for weeks at a time.
I couldn't contact anyone, not even my boyfriend of six years or my mom, during these blackouts.
I lived there for one year and was on the verge of ending it but my boyfriend, now fiancee, has brought me to his state to live with him.

I'm far away from my abusers but I still have so many problems.
I worry he's gonna get fed up of my constant baggage and send me back.
I'm trying to get on my feet, my parents never even got me my ID and I dropped out of middle school when I turned 16.
My fiancee is a very sweet, very loving, very patient person so I don't know why my brain keeps telling me he's gonna cheat on me or leave me.

who can I ask if I am going crazy right now? My partner who is sleeping right now? (He's a nice one, but when it comes to this he will freak out, and this might turn into a fight.), My family? they live so far away and quite have some issues they are dealing with on their own, My friends? I haven't been in contact with them for so long (though we are fine, but they are busy too.).   

Come one, think someone you can trust, someone you can ask, if its true or not... Okay just pray, just let it be God, breath ... pray ... breath ... 

That is why I am writing right now, cause I think I am going crazy. Time, Money, yes, I don't have money to afford anyones time. 

I found the answer all on my own, which is too cloudy and blurr earlier... Self- compassion.... Breath... It won't help you if you keep going at yourself.

I was about to say bad things to myself earlier, falling deeper and deeper into my own thoughts... Till I found that word.

This is temporary though, I need to save myself. I can't always be this fragile.

Social anxiety.,1715989124.0,"

I grew up in a small town in India where talking to girls was an offence and as i grew older and moved to a city where guys and gals interacted freely i was excited and happy and started talking to girls as if they were guys. It led me to trouble. People thought I was a creep so girls started ignoring me talking shit to me and got bullied by guys which led me to depression. Then switched schools a couple of times and again I faced similiar situation. So to feel that gap in my life I started talking to girls online. It went well first before but soon i also started getting blocked since I was needy and still am maybe. I started behaving rude to them online since they had much better life living in countries like us, uk etc and I started treating them like shit till I got blocked and i trauma dump this to everyone. I took therapy for almost a year and also took tms therapy which costed me like 7k rupees but it didn't make any change to my mental health. When I see some friend of mine online living better life than mine I treat them like shit and do it till I'm satisfied and till they stop talking to me since they wouldn't understand my problems. There is no solution to my problems either. People would tell me to join gym build confidence but it ain't possible since I was not also deprived of talking to girls but also had trauma with it so it makes my mind not interact with them at all. Doing it right now won't work since people who weren't deprived of all these had natural ability to pull girls. So if i start late i probably wouldn't be as good as them and my mind wouldn't let me since I have spent thousands of rupees for my mental health and it still didn't help. When I'm rlly frustrated I say shit stuff about Indian society to myself in my room act like a wild animal go naked and start crying including slapping myself a couple of times. I see no hope. I wish I could change my sexual orientation so I don't have to deal with girls ever again. Heck I can't even pull desi girls living around me let alone girls from other countries if i decide to study there.

Anxiety out of control following ozempic,1715985886.0,"Just a warning, this maybe a bit disorganized and or have poor grammar at times. 

Hello everyone, I'm at a bit of a bad place right now and I've been looking for information / support / acknowledgement that this exists from strangers. I don't really know what good it will do me, but I hope by getting myself out there it can help my mental health a bit.

Bit of a back story. I'm 36 now and I've had anxiety all my life. It started when I was 9 and I chocked on a tortilla from taco johns. From there I remember infrequent times where I was hungry I would shake uncontrollably. I didnt always have the best food options growing up but I learned to live with it. As an adult I would have panic attacks if I went to long without eating. The symptoms were essentially copy and pasted what hypoglycemia would look like. However my blood sugar during these times was fine.

I've been on lexapro for about a decade now and my anxiety was under control with the trigger listed above as the only thing I had to actively manage. With needing to eat to avoid panic attacks, you can imagine it was hard to control my weight.

Cue last september, I had a burning sensation when taking a pee. Turns out I was passing sugar in my urine. It's type 2 diabetes time! I immediately took control the best I could with dietary changes. I lost about 25 lbs in a few months on my own adding victoza about 6 weeks after my diagnosis. I had wanted ozempic as many of my friends were on it. I was also scared of metformin because of its rare interaction with alcohol. 

Late january we had a shortage of victoza here. At the same time I conveniently got a letter in the mail that my insurance would now cover ozempic. I had been stable and doing quite well. My weight had plateaued but my blood sugar was under control. Now it's time to restart the process but hopefully lose more weight! Around 2/23 I started my first dose of ozempic. 

April 10th was my first episode. officially I was diagnosed with fainting. I was sleeping in bed and I woke up and something felt off. I was overwhelmed with panic and rushed out and immediately fainted. I went to the ER and after a battery of tests nothing was found to be wrong with me. 

May 1st it happened again. This time my primary started my on buspar to help with the anxiety. I had high hopes that this was just my anxiety and this would fix it. It lasted all of 2 weeks.

May 15th was just a few days ago now. I've had some normal and some not so normal days between my last 2 dr visits but something broke for me this morning. I was looking at something and had a feeling of nostalgia and it triggered a panic attack. I was stuck in that moment and everything I did to look forwards felt hopeless. I woke my wife and tried to have her help calm me down. After talking to her I was feeling numb and felt like doing things to feel again. I wanted to hit the walls, bite myself, or anything to feel real. Thats when I decided to go in again, these thoughts were not my own. 

In the ER they have me ativan which calmed me down. I made an appointment with my primary and saw her that afternoon. We agreed to stop the buspar and the ozempic as well. We feel as if the ozempic nausea is triggering my anxiety and the buspar seems to have exasperated it rather than help. It's been 8 days since my last shot of ozempic. I'm taking hydroxyzine for the anxiety episodes. It helps but makes me sleepy. Last night I had nightmares and when I woke up i couldnt stay awake long enough to get away from them due to the sedative effect. I think I'll try and ride out the day without them. 

For now I'm trying to take it a minute at a time, an hour at a time, a day at a time. Each time I have a slight bit of nausea its sugar coated with anxiety. We are hoping that once the ozempic leaves my body ill return to how I was before and able to manage my anxiety.

I have four mental illnesses and it makes me feel behind in life,1715985607.0,"Let me start out by saying what I have in a list format.

1. Tourretes syndrome (mild no vocal tics)
2. ADHD (Combined type)
3. Depression (mildly-severe)
4. Autism (high functioning)

I feel like all of these make me feel inferior to those around me especially the ones who I label as smart, I frequently self sabotage myself and have had this pattern of gaining momentum towards something I want then just having it fall apart all around me because I wouldn't practice enough or broke the organization or consistency with whatever I was trying to do. And the weirdest part is I self sabotage on things I feel so passionate about but not really on things like my job.

I also have a narcissistic mother, she would frequently use all my siblings like she's playing chess to get what she wanted and if you disagreed you'd be as good as dead to her.

I have also this perfectionist attitude I guess you can call it seeing in black and white, but I also feel like I have a growth mindset and I hate how these two things clash so much it makes me feel like I'm dumber than rocks.

I've taken an iq test at multiple ages and I've always felt like I've lost some iq points since when I was younger. I was told in my most recent test that I had an average iq and an above average working memory. But when I was younger I was told I was smarter than what I really am, atleast compared to my most recent test I've done.

Also relating to the iq thing is the fact that I have a strange addiction to wanting to be smart or gifted or amazing at something, but never quite feel I can make it to that label in whatever I'm passionate about or if I do feel like I'm gaining momentum I sabotage myself for whatever reason. And onto of that I genuinely think I have made myself dumber overtime by a mistake I wish I never made which was taking weed only a handful of times maybe 5 or 6 times socially buy still while my brain is still in a functional state that can ruin my potential intelligence, which leads back to thinking I was right about being smarter as a kid than as I am now as a young adult.

Hi everyone,

I (F27) have been with my partner (M29) for nearly 8 years. He has battled depression his whole life, but since we got together in 2016, he's been getting support and has been on medication, which has helped somewhat.

Becoming a teacher, a job he loves, has also been beneficial, though it requires a lot of work outside the 9-5. Because of his workload,in the past few years I've taken on almost all chores, which I didn't mind as he was often very grateful. However, recently his workload has decreased, and he's been spending his free time playing video games and barely talking to me. He falls asleep often, eats poorly, buys snacks daily, barely exercises, and has gained a lot of weight. 

I ask him to do one chore a week (putting the washing away), but it never gets done, and I end up doing it myself. His depression cycles between good and bad months, but it's really bad now. He avoids our friends, saying he doesn't like them, and I'm getting nothing from our relationship. I feel so lonely as he doesn't want to talk or spend time with me.

I'm struggling to cope and need advice from others who have dealt with similar situations, or suffer themselves. How can I motivate him to get healthier and more sociable in hopes of lifting his depression? Or do I need to just wait it out for this cycle to end?

I remember since I was a child, she would touch me between the legs. A lot. She’d tickle me or pinch me there to tease me. This has probably happened hundreds of times. I don’t think it really stopped until I was 18 or 19, maybe? It wasn’t under my clothing so I don’t think it was sexual. It was just weird.

She had a weird obsession with my underwear. She would smell my used clothes in front of me a lot. Sometimes she would call me over and smell my underwear while I was wearing it. If I told her no, she would tell me that it was her job as a mother to do this and that all moms do this with their children. She said it was her favorite smell. This kept going into my teenage years.

We had this weird joke about me not wearing underwear. So sometimes she’d check. She’d touch my butt or my genital area to see if she could feel it beneath my pants. Other times she’d also just pull back my pants and just look. The last time I remember her doing this was when I was 20.

She used to walk around the house completely naked, but stopped after my dad got angry and told her it was inappropriate to do that in front of us.

When I was around 16-17, she would force me to sleep in the same bed as her while she was naked. She would hold me against her body, and her genitals would touch my skin. When I told her I didnt like doing that, she would get upset and told me that it was natural. I got scared when she did this to me, and after I told her that I was scared she would rape me she stopped. I feel a lot of guilt for saying this.

Around the same time, I came out to her as a transgender man (and still am a man today) and she didn’t react well. Sometimes she would lightly touch my chest and try to get me to appreciate my female body.

This is all I can remember at the moment. I feel sick and scared when I interact with her sometimes, and I don’t know if it’s really justified.

I like to think that I mask pretty well but, my boyfriend often tells me it’s quite obvious. I think about this a lot and begin to understand why it’s been so hard growing up autistic.

Getting older and mental health diagnoses ,1715981362.0,"Getting older [30s] and mental health diagnoses.

I'm not here to claim any special diagnoses [I feel that's harmful to people diagnosed/there are lots of posers] however, I have a few questions

I'm 30F, and I always always considered myself a ""highly empathetic"" person. The thing is, I've been wondering if I've been using that to win people over so that their perception of me is good. I was told by an ex that she thought I was a psychopath because of my charm, and I still remember feeling conflicted by this. 

Generally in conversation I don't really care about it. I think people can be fascinating to get to know but I am typically bored by them in 3 to 6 months. I find most people boring. People don't find me boring, however. I think it's because I don't care at all about social stigma and I say what I want, which can be funny to those who are scared of acting out of a society!

I do like listening to their problems and gossips but i think that's because im bored and it's interesting. I think I also like being regarded highly by others as that fuels a non existent sense of self worth.

I'm curious by your experiences here if there are similar qualities to being bipolar or psychopathic. 

I experience NO violent tendencies, yet I enjoy stealing [I've lessened it to bars of soap so I don't get arrested because I wouldn't like that consequence]. I'll do anything for dopamine. I'll get naked in a river if it feels good. I have 0 shame at all and really only regret when peoples ideal of me sours. I'm not sure if I care if I hurt them, or if I care if I hurt their idea of me being positive. 

I'm relatively social, but I feel like I compartmentalize people. I.e this person is for playing magic, this person is for rock climbing with, etc. 

I'm currently going through a possible bipolar diagnosis from adhd/anxiety. I never sleep. I can exercise for hours on end. I can bake a cake at 2am every day.

I don't really know what I'm writing about but I have never really had a best friend. I have a partner and I really enjoy her but I think that's the only person on earth I love? There are times she talks about things And I'm bored and have to pretend, but I think that's normal. She's probably bored by things I say, I think when you live with someone for years thats how it works.  I genuinely don't care about my family. Most friends don't really know me. Life feels like a revolving door and I don't get the point. 

I will say I love having dogs, I'm not sure if that's a sign of empathy, but I find them cute and love to please them.

I guess what I'm asking for is that my whole life I thought I was this nice and good person, but after reflecting, I feel like I'm self serving and can charm anyone, and I don't feel like im.living a real life. Perhaps this is long term mania or a life of denial, but I'm wondering if there's something deeper here

i had a bad weed experience back in january that i feel like triggered my anxiety (along with severe health anxiety) in a way that feels like i COULD recover but my mind keeps replaying what happened that night. i even tried to drink a little bit in april with a few friends and ended up having another panic attack because i felt so of control of my body and yet again replayed what happened in my head that night. i’m in college and i feel like i have so much life ahead of me but my anxiety is holding me back…

my anxiety wasn’t even as bad after greening out until i saw that my symptoms on google and on here aligned with seizures and potentially psychosis and i’ve kinda been scared ever since. not to mention the stories of people with hppd or people with dpdr from weed that never recovered made me think that i would never be the same.

Hallucinations or imaginative?,1715980304.0,"I have had history with delusions and homicidal thoughts/urges in the past, but I'm not getting into that. Just mentioning it incase it links.

Anyway, I have been seeing the same person/entity or being for the last several months and has started to creep me out and distract me, especially in school. It isn't like a full on hallucination, but I easily and realisticly see the same face in almost everything I look at. Examples are in normal pictures of nature or something, walls, clouds, or just in shadows. It's so strange because each time I see the shadow cowboy in different places, they all look the same and its really cool; it feels as if he's following me or observing my life. I also see other faces in things, looking at me, but the cowboy is the main one.

Enough with my yapping, I'm just curious whether this is me just having a creative mind or some kind of visual hallucination. Take in mind I've never had full on auditory ones but have had a lot of extreme delusions: religion demons, spies, my mission from God to unalive bad people (still currently have), and many more. I do also see coloured lights flashing a lot and that kind of stuff

Anyway there's my rant and if you actually know what you're talking about, please may you give me advice? I really appreciate the patience and I don't want more people saying I have schizophrenia as they're not a psychologist and schizophrenia is much worse, I wouldn't be functioning if I had it.

Adjustment Disorder - help!,1715977911.0,"Hello all.

I was in a car accident in 2021 in which I broke my neck and back.

I'm too expensive and lacking in recent experience).

The first psychiatrist I saw said I had mild depression and anxiety as a result of the crash. My solicitors contested this and I saw a second psychiatrist in April. His assessment is far more thorough and he has diagnosed PTSD (delayed onset) alongside Adjustment Disorder.

How have you overcome the barriers presented in your love life because of poor mental health?,1715977142.0,"I’m worried that I’ll never get a boyfriend because of my mental health struggles. 1. It’s extremely draining for myself and the people close to me to deal with the every day stuff relating to my anxiety and depression. 2. I feel like certain issues I have with impulse control, mood swings, inattentiveness, etc. are particularly off-putting. Even if I were to attract someone physically, I feel like they just wouldn’t be able to handle certain quirks (or faults) of mine. 3. I don’t get insanely jealous and ‘crazy’ in the way you might hear about in controlling ex-gf horror stories, but I can be very obsessive (not fun or cute at all) and my mood becomes dependent on the state of my relationship with whoever I’ve attached to. I get extremely insecure and feel unworthy. It’s not an issue of trust—so I’m not one to demand location access or do random phone checks, nothing like that—but a lack of confidence in myself. I’ve developed eating problems in the past just because I felt I wasn’t thin enough for the guy I liked.

how a seemingly good strategy toward social acceptance backfired pretty horridly,1715972502.0,"(if you just want to read the question it's near the end of this yapping)

I (18F) made several assumptions about persons or groups of people throughout my life. I often sense when someone’s being a dick and I’m often right, I think. Matter fact I may or may not have diagnosed myself with assholism in the past. 

But that's not the point. I live in eastern europe which is like the, piss voting, anti abortive, gayparadebrickthrowing side a little, least where i live. Now, kinda different thing: to be completely honest I can't imagine a woman having sex with a man, I mean, I can a little but it's, it's lacking to say the least, I can't imagine being attracted to a man and a woman having sex, this seems kinda odd to me, not even exaggerating, like totally unironically. Connect the dots yourself i don't know, actually I don't think there are any dots to be connected, I literally wrote it out loud. 
My point is, throughout my life, by observing my environment, I lowkey made a mental list of things to avoid doing to not be bullied. I’m not crazy, this is actually one of the sanest and most protective measures I’ve done in my life. This list consisted of things like: don't be lgbt, don't be loud, don't dress cute, because if you're fat you'll be a punching bag, don't look as if you care about your looks because if you do and still look like a pig then you’ll be a punching bag, don't say random and weird shit to people because they will tell other people and you’ll be a punching bag and so on. 

I thought that was lowkey smart strategy and I ended up living my high school as an npc for so fucking real. I dressed in dark clothes, never bought cute things for myself, dressed in second hand shops and I told people it was more environmentally friendly than buying clothes in fast fashion chain shops, but that was just part of the reasoning. I didn't talk if I wasn't spoken too, If I had a problem with studying I never told anyone, I would raise my hand only if I felt burning in my heart because I needed to express a thought so badly, I never engaged in discussions with classmates I didn't feel comfortable speaking with (i only felt semi comfortable with four (4) of them), barely made eye contact with anyone, zoned out on most lessons (my logic: If I look uninterested and get bad grades nobody will laugh, it'd be worse if I tried very hard and still failed). This was my hs experience. Literally denial and repression all the way through, to the point I started hearing screams in my head whenever I felt tired, I think it was a way of exercising a voice for my brain, because I talked very little through the day.

I actually might have lost my personality for real… How do I get my personality back no borax no glue?? (ps. it's really scary to break the npc persona because it's real comfortable + i don't want to get hurt)

Im 24 and have no close friends or a significant other. The loneliness really gets to me sometimes. ,1715967688.0,"So im a 24 year old guy and have never managed to make long term meaningful friendships with anyone my entire life. I have had a few friends here and there but they always had closer friends and the friendships felt short term and always kinda faded for one reason or another. Some of them it seemed like we were becoming closer so it always hurt a lot when they suddenly left my life. 

I am still in community college because i changed my major a bunch of times and have finally decided what i wanted to study. It isnt really social here, people just want to go to class and get out so making friends hasnt really happened.

 I work part time at a grocery store 25-30 hours a week and this is where I get pretty much all of my socialization. Theres some people around my age who are also part timers in a similar life spot as me. The problem is i work in the seafood department at the back of the store and i cant leave my department to just go around and talk to people like other departments can. I have had a huge crush on a girl at work and we actually did an art class together outside of work which was cool but it feels like I cant get anywhere with her because i just dont have the time to talk to her at work. (I posted the full situation on another sub if your interested in reading) I have gotten a few invitations from people in the store and have went to some of them but a friendship never really develops since they were group oriented(birthday parties for example). Someone recently asked for my number, actually was a girl but vibes have been strictly platonic between us but ive been hesitant to text her since i have grown a bit of mistrust in people.

The crazy thing is I dont think i fit the image of a loner, i put effort into my appearance and hygiene, im not overweight, i can hold conversations and make people laugh, and people have said i have a good personality. I try to be the best version of myself and am getting outside of the house doing things and going to places. I try not to be boring and have been making a more conscious effort to invest more time into hobbies and fun things to do. People at work seem to atleast somewhat like me, but i feel like people rarely initiate any contact with me and for the most part im seen as just an acquaintance. 

I live with my mom and sister(I have other family but they live in other parts and i dont really talk to them) but they dont really do anything with their lives, no hobbies or passions so my relationship with them isnt fulfilling to me. (I still love them ofcourse). 

Since I have turned 23 I have been feeling really down about my social and dating life. I feel like despite my efforts of trying to reach people, i cant get past that acquaintance stage with anyone. I spend like 90% of my time alone. I wish i had some close friends i could talk to and hangout outside of work and a stable romantic relationship but I have no idea how to get there. It would be nice to have someone who is more than just an acquaintance. It’s starting to feel more and more like a far away dream as time passes. I downloaded meetup but all the events are just old people. Any advice?

it has gone downhill since then whenever theres arguments they bring up my attempt and how i should’ve just died from it. my sister made it a joke and brings it up whenever she can about how disgusting and pathetic im for attempting and even worse how i failed. she says these things front of my mum and sometimes my mum even agrees and says it back when shes mad. 

she now doesn’t trust me around her cat she thinks i might attempt again near her cat and leave harmful things behind that can harm her cat (i had od’d and left a pill behind according to her) i apologised over and over but she doesn’t care. she screams and cries if i go near our room (we used to share room) i sleep on the sofa now its worse than it was before i attempted. i just want to get away. its so embarrassing “surviving” a failed attempt especially since ive been depressed forever i shouldve thought it out better.

i’m being such a coward now to attempt again, my sister told me that the paramedics had a hard time carrying me down  because how fat i am (i have an ed and i struggle with my weight she knows this) she said i struggled with them and when she went to the hospital she saw little kids waiting while they were wasting their resources on me. i just feel so disgusted at myself. i cant cry front of them because it sets them off even more. i cant get away at all. i have stopped taking my meds because my sister especially and my mum will bring up about my od and just mock how i take medication. my sister freaks out about medication. i feel horrible perhaps i gave her trauma cause of it. even my younger sister is starting to act like her it hurts so much because we used to be so close. everything hurts so much i dont know what to do i just want to die.

It's not okay to not be okay.,1715962037.0,"People always says ""it's okay to not be okay"" but its total bullshit. You have to have a hard but *visible* struggles for people to acknowledge it. What I mean is that mental illness or issues behind closed doors are not to give a fuck about. 

I have to hear this shit almost everyday going to school, mostly from teachers. That I'm doing bad because I'm lazy, that others have their situation way worse but they still do well. I mean, they dont say it directly to me but I'm in the class yk. Besides that's a shit thing to say to anyone regardless.

Back then, I was the one being the smart kid teachers were comparing others to, but I still didnt like it. I dont like being percieved as this hard working, flawless student who is better than the rest of the peasants. 

Ngl, I would prefer to be the peasant rn if the teachers could just shut up or give out actually good advice rather than saying how dumb we are. And as I say, they dont care if you are struggling, especially if it's related to your mind. And the most important thing is that you *have* to get good grades for them to care.

If you have problems and you overcome those and become successful, you're a role model, a good citizen. But if you dont overcome those then you're lazy, a failure, not trying hard enough, you wont ever do anything useful for society. 

The only reasons mental health is being more addressed these days is

1. It's for profit. 
2. Get people to work and live in this shitty, unlivable world.
3. Do the bare minimum and be regarded as a saint for caring *so* much about the well being of people.

These are the only reasons I can think of is because it just seems people dont actually care. I have to constantly make up excuses, or simply lie to get out of some tiresome work.

suicidal thoughts ,1715961176.0,"I haven't scored good in my boards and i have accepted the fact that ya maybe i didn't study well, although i had tried my best under the circumstances i was in for last two years, but I did study the way i thought i won't break down or when i thought that i am stable. 

My score kept decorating because of the environment i was (no actually i am ) living in and truthfully i had NOONE to talk about my problems and even if there were I couldn't because i thought i would be called an ""attention seeker"", I was loosing interest in the subject but kept going thinking that its just ending soon and I'll be leaving my house eventually so that kept me motivated for a long time. 

I have never cried about it and because of how worst my mental health had become I usually had these thoughts to suicide and self harm, I did harm my self like banging my head on wall, scratching my hands and legs until they bleed or punching on the tiles of my bathroom. I never went and did anything which could leave me mark on my body cause i had hoped that maybe I'll survive and be better (although it never did) I still had hopes. 

During one of my paper,I tried very hard to keep my self calm but still I got one of the worst panic attacks ever in the past 2 years (there were a load of reasons).
I ruined that paper of mine and then the tension made me hell nervous while preparing me for other exams and subsequently it got fucked. 

I knew that I would fail in my exam and now i used to cry nights thinking how will i face everyone and finally thought to quit but then i always had the thought of my younger brother  and couldn't build up the courage, so i decided to spend as much time as i could with him just so he could have memories of his sister after she dies. And not just know me as a coward who died because she failed so i wrote everything i faced for past 2 years for him to know on his laptop ,when he used to sleep, in a hidden folder.

My marks came, and by god's grace I passed, i was on cloud nine and cried really hard thinking if i wouldn't have passed what would i have done to myself. But obviously marks wasn't up to the mark so my parents were upset and embarrassed to tell my relatives my marks, although they never talked to me about my marks but i could hear them getting awkward when my relatives used to ask them my marks and how shameful they use to feel.

Due to my marks there are no as such good college which would take me but the one which is taking me is way too costlier and i belong to a middle class family, although my parents were going to take loan anyways for any college, i couldn't get this guilt out of my chest that i am such a big disappointment to them. 

I could see through the eyes and voice of my parents of how much they didn't expect this from me. I wanted to work hard in my college life, enjoy my life there but maybe I won't be able to after all these realisation i have got.

How do I know how serious suicidal thoughts are?,1715958907.0,"I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was like 12. A lot of it is mostly just 'I don't deserve to live' kind of stuff, but I've also had pretty vivid dreams of people telling me I should kms and being happy when I attempted and didn't survive.

I have attempted twice, but I'd try neither methods again since they were so slow and (obviously) didn't work. So I don't think these thoughts are anything to worry about too much.

However, a lot of the time when I think about committing suicide, I think about doing it with a gun. It'd be extremely hard for me to get one here (UK), but if I did get my hands on one- which is possible- I'd definitely shoot myself with it. That's not even a maybe. I definitely would.

I want to get into hunting, but that would probably be dangerous for me because like I said, I'd shoot myself. Maybe not right away, but I eventually would. It's quick, and that's what I want. I want to just leave this world as quick as possible, and not have to deal with all this anymore, and for everyone else to stop having to put up with me.

But how serious is this? I mean, it's unlikely I'll get a gun anytime soon, and all other methods are out of the window.

Why Are Some People With Anger Issues Also Soft-Hearted And Sensitive? ,1715959880.0,"I have a parent who has always been extremely sensitive to other people’s pain. That would make total sense if she wasn't also the most verbally and emotionally abusive person I know, who uses intense anger like a switch in order to get what she wants, leaving the person on the other end feeling humiliated, fearful, and degraded, while she moves on with her day like it’s nothing. If you stand up for yourself even a little bit, she acts indignant and hurt, as if you had attacked her and she's now fearful of *you*, even though no one would dare challenge her like that.


The fact that people with anger issues are sensitive makes sense to me, but this particular sensitivity seems contradictory, if not hypocritical. I don't want to be unfair, though. If shes is so sensitive to feelings and people’s pain, why does she behave the way she does? Do people with anger issues process these situations differently?

Can anyone give advice on childhood trauma?,1715959853.0,"
Before I explain I just want to say that I was in primary school when this happened. I would have been anywhere from 8-11 years old. I hit puberty young (when I got my period I thought I was dying) and I had no idea about sex at all. My sisters and I had been through a disgusting amount of trauma prior to this happening and I’ve struggled with SEVERE ocd and anxiety for as long as I can remember. My older sister is 18 months older than me and my younger sister is 2 years younger. I’m not sure if any of this information is relevant but I thought it might be helpful to whoever may be able to help. 

I was watching what I thought was an age appropriate film at home with my sisters. In the film, a couple were rolling around on a bed kissing each other. They were fully clothed, but we were curious because we had never seen anything like it before.
We played a game similar to “Mums and Dads” where my older sister and I would choose who was going to be the boy and who was going to be the girl and act out what we saw on the TV. It started out as kissing. I can remember my sister touching me inappropriately and getting me to do it back to her, but that only happened once. The kissing turned into acting out having sex with each other. We had our clothes on most of the time, and I can’t remember it happening on a regular basis. I think it just happened randomly every now and again. It felt good at the time, and we had seen adults do it so we just assumed that it was a normal thing to do. I only recently told my family about it because I used to feel disgusted every time I thought about it. I know this happened between my older sister and my younger sister too but that’s not my story to tell. I didn’t understand anything about sex properly until I was about thirteen, so I wouldn’t have realised at 8–11 years old that what was happening was wrong.
I’ve been through an unbelievable amount of trauma which I think contributes to what happened. It was just sexual curiosity which was taken too far but I’m not sure what to do about what happened. My sister apologised but it wasn’t anybody’s fault. I want to get on with her but it’s hard too. I looked up to her as a role model and thought I was doing the right thing but I obviously wasn’t.

He’s mentioned previously that he used to she shadow people at night in his bedroom or in mirrors, but I guess I never took it seriously since it sounded like he was just talking about when he was younger and I was thinking “well kids see things in the dark all the time, that’s a bit worrying but it was probably just nightmares or something”, but recently we were out with a friend and again he brought it up but mentioning it’s been happening more recently, which is concerning but I didn’t say anything. Then yesterday he came over to my house and asked if my cat was thinner than before, I was a bit confused said no and asked why, and he said something along the lines of “sometimes I just worry that my pets are replaced by like identical” I told him that thought was very worrying and he just said it was anxiety that he didn’t actually believe they were replaced. But I realized this has been a thing he’s down in the past, checking pets for birthmarks, even checking me for my birthmarks to make sure I wasn’t replaced, I realize as I write this it sounds stupid but I genuinely just thought these were weird jokes or something but now I’m realizing they might not be. He talked about how he just worried they were replaced by his parents or the government, but that he doesn’t actually believe they are replaced so it’s just anxiety. I think the reason I’m only just now worrying about these things though is that a month or two ago I read The Collected Schizophrenias by Esme Weiksner Wang so I guess it’s been on my mind and what he’s describing reminds me of the stories in that book. But im also not sure, what if im just overthinking things because I read this book and his thoughts are just normal? Im just worried about his mental health and don’t know how to get him to see this is a worrying issue that he might want to look into I guess? He’s had mental health issues in the past, he has depression, anxiety, OCD, and adhd as diagnosed by his psychiatrist and therapist. Im just worried because he says he tells me things he never told his therapist (he no longer goes) or psychiatrist and so if the seeing people or believing people would be replaced was something he didn’t tell them then what if he has a deeper issue that would help if it’s treated? I’m just worried about him, if he says he knows they aren’t replaced then could it just be normal anxiety and not something else?

Anyone knows whats happening?,1715955743.0,"I went down from 20mg escitaloprame to 5mg over a long time. Was on 10mg for years, worked very good for me, no downsides. 

1 month ago I reduced to 5mg. All good until monday. There was a funeral and since then I am slightly depressed and I am having panic attacks in the evenings. 

Is this because I went down to 5mg Escitaloprame, or it is just a normal trauma response because of the funeral? We weren't too close so its not a lot of sadness and grief involved, but the funeral itself and the thought of death hit me like a train. 

Or it is both, the reducing of the dose of escitaloprame AND the funeral / trauma response. 

Or do you think it could be that 5mg is enough for me, since it was for last 4 weeks, and what I am going through is more or less „normal“ emotional processing? 

My plan was to stay at 5mg or even reduce it to 0 because for the last 8 months I thought I dont need it anymore since I have changed a lot.

He has previously gone to therapy has a psychologist and for a time was at a mental health hospital for self harm and got diagnosed with anxiety, depression, adhd, and ocd, but I’m starting to worry there might be more, especially because he says he never fully opened up to his therapist and tells me these thoughts he never told his therapist.

I told him that these thoughts were worrying but he said “it’s just anxiety I know they aren’t actually replaced it’s just a worrying thought”, and that he’s never thought they were replaced but worried they might be replaced by like his parents or the government. To me this sounds very worrying and like some of the things described in the book I read, and like I’m worried if things get worse and if he should get help? I’m realizeing that might be a fucked up thing to think, I’m just worried for him and don’t want to see things get worse for him. Is he right that it might just be anxiety, because he said he doesn’t actually believe they are replaced that it’s just a worry?

Constant worry about my pets' health,1715950318.0,"Hello all,

A bit of background. A couple of years ago I had a super horrible experience with losing a dog to parvo/distemper. It was a week of psychological torture that drained me mentally, emotionally, spiritually, financially.

I suppose the trauma stuck. For my more recent pets, several months ago, I would constantly feed them snacks to make sure they're eating because I'm always worried that if they don't eat, that means something is wrong with them. Kept doing that until one day, one of them didn't have appetite and I panicked.

Fast forward, nothing serious happened, thankfully. However, now I always avoid when my pets are being fed (I'm not the one who feeds them) because I always fear that they wont have a desire to eat. I constantly check if their stomachs are full and I am worried at even looking at them because I fear their stomachs won't look full.

I'm just going to overshare cause a therapist  is too much money lmao(and I'm not going to stress my dad)

It's most likely a mental illness or stress, but I'm genuinely so angry all the time. I hate myself and others(but it's mainly people), I can tolerate but I cannot love my grandmother even though she took care of me for almost all my childhood because my mother was a fucking(and probably still is) a druggie that literally neglected me for her dead druggie friend; I like my father but only for the resources he provides(I think. I can't explain it).

I'm always so snappy with people, especially my dad's ex-girlfriend(""stepmom"") since she can't seem to find any self-worth for herself so she asks about my father(they were in an abusive relationship. My dad's ex-girlfriend is the victim) in order to ""see if he's dating some other bitch/girl"" so she can ""move on"" and this has been going on for a year and it's annoying as hell.

I've told her to stop so many times, most leading towards arguments because I'm mean about it(but I've made it clear so many times that I do not want to answer her questions, and she can't seem to understand that): but then she somehow convinces me to keep on answering her questions about ""Where he's at"", ""Did he go to work"", ""Did he leave"", etc and I just came to resent her.

I see her as pathetic woman and I know I shouldn't because she's an abuse victim, but I cannot empathize with her. I never did when we used to live together and she sees us as ""family"". I do not see her as family, but I still see her and don't want to cut her off because she has shit on my dad that could get him arrested(or fined, etc). I know I'm wasting her time with false love, but I don't want my reputation to seem like I'm also apart of the toxicity in my family even though I know I am because what good person would choose bad people over good?

She's emotional because she does have depression, but she's even more emotional because she's bipolar and it's annoying as hell. She complains to me 24/7, that's all she does when she has her own kid to take care of. 

I know I shouldn't be blaming the victim, I'm a piece of shit for saying all of this because it's not her fault she's like this; but I can't stand her. She places a bad taste in my mouth everytime I see or text her even if she's a very sweet person. 
I know I should hate my dad, but for some reason I don't. My father side of the family are toxic to people outside of the family(relationship wise) and I should hate them, but just because they're nice to me: I don't. It's stupid really.

And my school friends?? I fucking hate them also. I can tolerate them, but I cannot stand them at the same time. I'm snapping towards them when they tease me 24/7 then give them the cold shoulder but I still sit with them because I'm just going to ghost them after I graduate highschool(and I like where I sit. They're funny when they're not being dicks) and I don't want to see like a loser even though I already seem like one right now.

I'm always angry 24/7, I used to just feel numb(not in a emo way chilll lol) but now I just have this lingering angry feeling in my chest that I want to go away cause it's starting to make me suicidal.
I know I should die, I'm not a good person on the inside but I'm a pussy so(plus a minor so I literally cannot kill myself with a gun like I want to☠️)

Along with the word recall problems, I've been dealing with a lot of stress lately, including increased responsibilities at home, work pressure, my wife's health issues, I've even noticed myself zoning out while driving.

Please help me support my girlfriend's mental health,1715858890.0,"First time poster, please give me any advice you can as I really don't know what to do.

I have been with my girlfriend for 6 years and I love her to bits. The problem is that her mental health issues are becoming more severe and more frequent. She suffers with anxiety and ADHD (undiagnosed but has all the classic symptoms), and it is getting to the point where it is really affecting her personal and professional life. At work she really struggles with criticism, and quite often is convinced that people do not like her, and are treating her badly because they don't like her. She has worked at 5 different companies since I have known her, at each she has had a problem with her manager, or the wider management team. Often she spends a lot of time analysing their motives and actions, convinced that flaws in their character (arrogance, misogyny, poor communication, general bad management etc) are the root cause of her being unhappy at work. Two of her last three job changes have been directly to get away from her manager. She also really struggles with the kind of office environment BS that most people face (others not doing what they should, people claiming credit, office politics etc), taking this things far too personally in my opinion.

This all leads not only to her feeling down and anxious, but also chronically tired and lethargic, brain fog and difficulty communicating. I have tried to be as supportive as I can, listening, trying to understand, offering love and support and advice where I can. However it all seems to be getting worse, and I don't know what to do. Every work day is an ordeal for her. I regularly message her through the day to see how she is doing, and talk to her about it every evening. It's always negative, it's always a bad day, someone has always treated her badly. I sympathise, empathise let her know how much I love her and that I'll do anything to help, but I don't think that anything I do is actually helping. 

Counseling didn't really help her, although I have suggested trying again. Doctors just prescribe anti-depressants, which just seem to numb her without any real benefits.

I am quite different from her, which I worry is preventing me helping her, or even perhaps making her worse. I'm generally confident, not too bothered whether people like me in a work setting and the kind of person that just gets on with it. This can make it hard to relate to her problems at times, as she sometimes reaches conclusions which make little sense to me. For example if someone doesn't complete something I need from them, I would think ""they are a poor employee"", whereas she would think ""they deliberately didn't do this because they don't like me or want me to look bad"". I do try to be very sensitive in these situations, but it can be difficult. I don't say this to her, but at times it feels she's creating her own problems. 

Obviously all this impacts our relationship, but I'm not going to go into that. I know if I can help her and make her happy(er) then I will also be happy. 

If anyone has any advice please share. I don't know what more to do and am scared I'm making her worse. Thanks",Equivalent_Visit_447,,False,1ctanxu,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ctanxu/please_help_me_support_my_girlfriends_mental/
"My father died a year ago, and I never shed a tear. Help. ",1715863701.0,"I created this reddit account to let this off my chest and I want to know if I'm okay.

I was born and raised for the first 6 years of my life with my parents, but me and my brothers moved to another country and my dad said that he will catch up to us and travel soon to live with us ""soon""

Soon turned into 19 years... He never came to us, we kept on video-calling him, he kept sending us money (to me and my brothers and mother) my parents aren't separated, still married, but and I quote: ""I have a business here, I cannot just leave everything and come to you"" 

He didn't have a secret life or anything we know him, we are Muslim and so was he, we don't do such stuff, he didn't cheat on my mom and he was working up to his eyeballs. 

I loved him and we all loved him, my mother didn't love him as much because he preferred business over his family where he stayed in one country and we stayed in another... 

He died due to heart related problems, doctors told him to do something and he did other things so it's like he wanted to die and he did, it was his own choice to ignore what the doctors advised him to do..

After he died I felt sad and heartbroken, but I did not shed a single tear, the only thing I was worried about is: who will send us money? I'm a student and I don't have a job...

A year later my family dog died, he was 15 years old and we grew up together... The messed up part is... I cried for 7 days, I would be in the shower, bed, standing, sitting.. I'd just punch the wall or my bed and just cry in anger because I couldn't do anything and I loved my dog, he was like my little brother...

I tried to show emotions, I tried to mourn him I tried and overthinking made me go nuts I don't know what is wrong with me... Why did the death of my pet best friend made me ooze up tears and the death of my father didn't hit me like it did with my pet?
Am I sick? I was sad yes, but didn't I feel as devastated or depressed when I saw my dad's dead body on a video call, and whenever I thought of him..

How can I stop ruminating? ,1715869229.0,"Today I found out I got 19.5/20 on my math quiz. It's not that bad, it's not bad at all actually because our teacher rounds the score so I got a full mark. The 0.5 mistake I made does not affect my grade at all but somehow i'm still stuck with my ruminating thoughts. The fact that I made a mistake doesn't leave my mind and I need a heavy distraction for me to stop thinking about it (watching an interesting movie/ youtube video), scrolling through social media doesn't keep my mind off it, I end up thinking about it again. It's extremely tiring, my teacher announced everyones scores and I couldn't help but feel a mix of embarrassment and regret.

I just want to go on top of a hill and scream my heart out, my chest constantly feels heavy and it feels very derogatory. I am a perfectionist and iv'e realised not every aspect in life is perfect, except for again, academia.

I'm worried I have an ED but nothing I research is right about me,1715878841.0,"It started like 7 months ago. I just lost my whole appetite. Im never hungry and when I am hungry I just can't bring myself to chew and swallow food anymore, and being hungry just feels like a bad stomachs ache. People in my life are starting to worry about me and I really don't want them too because it's not like it's so terribly bad. This whole time I've been able to get back to regular eating habits for a week at a time but by the end of the week I just can't stomach a single meal.

Reddit should not allow certain subreddits to exist and here is why,1715889159.0,"I think Reddit should engage in a lot more moderation. There are tons of actually harmful subreddits with toxic concent. Just imagine a 15yo going through puberty to then stumble across /nihilism (btw this subreddit deserves to be deleted imo, it is harmful and people literally tell people to do something to themselves). 

I am convinced that 99.9% of people who identify with pessimism, nihilism or even pessimistic nihilism are mentally ill. Don't roll your eyes, here me out I beg you. 

You are not smarter than all people around you. Everyone around you is not coping with illusions. There is lots of meaning in this life and you can create meaning for yourself and others. It might actually be YOU whos dealing with illuions. 

Nihilism is flawed, it likes to declare it knows what is the ultimate truth - but it doesn't.  
A person with an ill brain, which is chemically imbalanced, that can only experience the negative, certainly is not in the position to decide whats true about human existence and the universe. 
You should also not follow the ideas of a mentally ill person, especially since severe major depression exists.

Happiness and meaning are no illusions, they do exist. Theres lots of it! It is a given fact, meaning can be subjective or even objective. Existence is complex, it cannot be reduced to rational points of views. Emotions are what makes humans special, relationships, love, compassion and empathy cannot be reduced to „illuions“. 

What matters is your perspective. As long as there is no other intelligent race, we must assume or perspective is the best way to go. But like I said, a healthy brain won't focus entirely on the negatives. 

Like Schopenhauer claimed, there only is suffering or the absence of suffering. This is so wrong, I don't even know where to start. 

Then there is … lets just call it cosmic anxiety. The sun will likely die in a fee billion years, the universe will continue to expand, etc. 
This is mostly the number 1 argument for nihilism - here and now do not matter because one day we die and in billions of years our sun might die. 
At this point, it should be clear why this does not come from a mentally healthy state of mind. 
But again, they are so sure that this its true I must say I think thats impressive. It is quite absurd. Our understanding of the universe is arguably at the beginning. Few decades ago we knew way less. Just 100 years ago we got general relativity. A little more than 100 years ago, the first plane was constructed, now we have Eurofighter jets. 

For me it astonishing that people are able to act like we know it at, I guess there is arrogance in depression. 

By the way: for something to be meaningful, it has not to be throught something divine and it can be temporary. These people think if something isn't „forever“, whatever that might be, it is not worth having. 

(Theres also tons of edgelords in these subreddits but lets just ignore them for now).

The problem, at its core, is the following:

People can't understand that their thoughts might be wrong, might be harmful. Yes, your thoughts most likely aren‘t true when you're suffering from mental illness. Thats why therapy and meds are extremly important. I‘m not gonna mention the topic of suicide, what they say in these subreddits is just disgusting and I truely despise it. 

To allow these subreddits to exist is morally wrong - it might push people into a harmful and wrong (yes, it is wrong and I hope more people are able to give into it) philosophy 

Not really a fan at all but Jordan Peterson also has made many great points against nihilism.

!! I labeled this with the suicide-content warning, although I‘m not referring to the subject directly. But it is a major part of nihilism and pessimism, thats why it needs to be labled like that.

"Languishing, an ignored problem?",1715910492.0,"When I read the article, my first thought was that there are probably many who are diagnosed as depressed when they are actually not. And how many with poor mental health are assumed to have a mental illness, which is not the same. There are those who really are depressed and have an illness, which of course is something that should be taken seriously, but it is also also a problem if a problem is not addressed properly:

>""Grace Wade: What is languishing?

>Corey Keyes: Languishing is the absence of well-being. It is when people feel they have nothing positive going on in their lives. No meaning. No mattering. No warm, trusting relationships. No happiness or joy. Yet it doesn’t necessarily mean negative emotions like sadness or fear. People who are languishing almost feel nothing. They describe it as being numb or dead inside. I call languishing the neglected middle child of mental health, since it falls between mental illness and mental well-being.

>How is languishing different to depression?

>Only one symptom overlaps between depression and languishing, and that is a loss of interest in life. The remaining signs of depression are all about sadness or malfunctioning on a daily basis: you sleep too much or too little, eat too much or too little and you might have suicidal thoughts. Depression is defined by negative symptoms, whereas languishing is characterised by the absence of positive ones.

>Some people’s descriptions of depression may fit languishing because it is possible to be depressed and languishing at the same time. That isn’t to say they are the same thing.

>How can someone be languishing and depressed at the same time?

>My research has shown that mental wellness actually exists on two dimensions: mental illness and mental health. People can have no mental illness and poor mental health – in other words, they are languishing yet don’t have a mental health condition. Or they can have a mental illness and high mental health.""

The article was written as a response to the covid-19 lockdowns, when people were physically isolated. But many live in an invisible prison on a daily basis due to a situation in life, which is often related to baggage from the past. Which is why it is important not to confuse if with depression.

I go to a pretty competitive but small highschool with a grade total of above 75 kids that come from all over the region. it’s an academically focused school so everyone is really the smartest from their respective regions. so naturally, clubs, extracurriculars and even sucking up to teacher for recs is smt that students in our school do. i am on council this year for a club in our school, one that’s known to be one of the biggest in our pretty small school encompassing nearly everybody in our school. i don’t want to go too much into or i’m going to start crying all over again but king story short, my then best friend and I had a falling out and it’s not been the same. it was over something so trivial now that i think abt it but ig then it really wasn’t. it was an opportunity to go to states for the club i was in and essentially we both tried and i got it and she believed the circumstances were in my favor however, i just was presented with an opportunity that i took. and before u get back at me, when i tell u literally ANYONE in my position even she said she was wud have taken the opportunity if she was in my place but she just quickly distanced herself. i was devested and ig then i really realized how close i was to her. she was the close connection to me and since my school was small, we were divided into groups of 25 that’s we wud have all our classes with and in my class that only “clique” u cud say i was a part of was with my then best friend. it’s crazy to think that i was happy at one point. this all happened i wanna say 4 months ago but it’s rlly taken a toll on me. ig the most disheartening thing was that i have nobody anymore and everyone had their friend groups and when i tell u it’s too late to join another grp per se it just doesn’t work out. like today in gym we had to make groups of 4 and evry dog got into a group except me and i srsly wanted to cry and i did end up joining a group but all i was thinking is that this sucks and like everyone was staring at me without a group and i was literally on the verge of tears. not to mention that my academics life also has dropped significantly i went from being an A+/A student to now b and c grades I was have passed out if it was a few months before. i’ve lost all motavation and i can’t track to anyone and i know this isn’t like end of the world like but i just realized i have no one anymore. today after gym i had to work on a project with my then best friend and she invited me to watch a show with her, a show we watched when we were friends and they had realized a new season just today actually and while watching it with her i realized how much i missed her and i know it can’t be the same anymore but i just don’t like life anymore and i don’t know how to keep going. i know i will but how i’m not sure how.

(20M) My mother has told me in the past that my deadbeat father messed up my life. Do I deserve to die at a young age? ,1715926730.0,"I'll try to sum up everything here, but I'm leaning towards ""yes"", than anything. This could also be a sign of depression, but I don't want to use that word since I don't consider myself as being that. 


Anyways, here we go: 


**1**. My father (42M) currently owes anywhere between $25k - $30k in back child support, and it accumulated after him and my mother (47F) separated when I was a toddler. 


**2**. He was not active at all in my upbringing, and he is selfish. In August of last year, he whined to me about being depressed too much, and that he was seeing a therapist to better himself. Then the **next** month, he tried to pressure my mother to take him off of paying child support, even after he still owes money. 


**3**. My mother holds resentment towards him, and also me for the whole situation. In October 2022, she got drunk at my uncle's birthday dinner, and told him and his fiancé, whom she just met at that dinner, about an argument me and her had four months prior that involved me not liking her manipulative, and a liar of a best friend who was staying with us at the time. Right in front of me! I had to get up from the table, and go down to the basement to basically cry and let out my emotions. 


**4**. The last five years has really shown me a lot about myself, and my situation. When I was a teenager, I had really horrible attitudes towards my mother (which she says I got from my ""father"", and she had to bring in her best friend who I mentioned earlier to straighten me out, and make me tougher. They called it ""boot camp"". It was a rough process, and I could see a bit of a difference, mainly with the attitudes stopping. But overall, I still feel like a weak coward lol. And I am a coward, since I had attitudes towards my mother, who worked her ass off homeschooling me throughout the entirety of elementary school, and worked night-shift jobs. I'm a piece of shit. 


**5**. My mother *only* married my father because she was pregnant with me. After what will be 21 years later in December this year, him and her are still married. She's sent him divorce papers to sign before, but he wouldn't sign them. I don't know what the process is to get a divorce, but I always that both parties had to consent to get it. 




With all of that being said, I think I do deserve to die at a young age, but I'm just making this post to see if I'm the only one who feels this way. I mean, in all honesty I **did** mess up my mother's life, as another person online told me lol.


I don't have any friends, or any outlet in real life, and I don't think I deserve any. I do deserve to die, and that's it. 


I do think I deserve to die at the age I am right now too. I don't deserve to live at all. I'm not a good person. I've been a piece of shit ever since I was conceived, messing up people's lives.

Having family, friends, a support system to help you through the hard times, yet sleep in a bed which is ice cold, cuddling into your pillow like you're sleeping on the chest of an imaginary lover. You dreams are either haunting threats of dying alone or taunting memories of partners come and gone. The loneliness is an elephant baring down on your chest, heart racing and breath caught in your lungs. All you want to do is lay in bed and cry to songs and ballads of heartbreak and tragedy. But your friends care, right? And your mother loves you more than life. That's all that matters, all that's supposed to matter. Desiring a lover when your mind is already so fragile is selfish. That's what you keep telling yourself. You're just working on yourself, you're fixing yourself up so your future partner has the best version of you that you can offer. If you desire children, you wonder whether, if push comes to shove, you could take care of a child on your own.

Dealing with abandonment issues.,1715929544.0,"I’m going through a difficult time. I (42F) just met my bio dad four years ago, and we have a fairly good, if not super close, relationship. We have so much in common, and we have always understood each other quite intuitively. I think he doesn’t communicate with his wife about our conversations, though. Understandable, since we are still getting to know each other, and his wife seems jealous because she says I am his “new plaything”.

I am so desperate to spend time with him and so when I made plans with him, I was devastated when he cancelled due to his wife making other plans. I don’t think he even told his wife I wanted to meet up. We live 8 hours away from each other, so it’s not like I can just run over and see him any time I want. This wasn’t a surprise visit. I told him about it and asked if he’d like to get together a month ago. Confirmed plans last week. Only to have the carpet pulled out from beneath my feet. 

Why didn’t he say something when we were making our plans? I am so afraid of rejection I kept saying ‘if you’re ok with hanging out let’s get together.’ He never said no, but now there’s other plans—made by his wife. She is making him be there. 

So my dad couldn’t tell me no I can’t make it, but he couldn’t tell his wife no, I need to see my daughter. Aside from this incident and another similar occurrence, we have a good relationship, and I’m lucky to have him in my life. I’m just so upset he didn’t prioritize me.

My sisters mental illnesses is making me sick,1715930247.0,"My sister has always been very needy growing up. My parents really sheltered her and removed every obstacle form in front of her. In high shcool she began isolating herself and cutting off any friendship she had. There were a lot of red flags that her mental health wasn’t great as we were growing up but my parents ignored them- honestly there were a lot of things that my parents ignored until her mental health got so bad that they physically couldn’t ignore it (she would stay frozen on our dining chair and not move for hours). I spent a lot of time blaming them but I now see there’s no point in pointing blame. 

She was diagnosed with OCD and got medication for it- she spent a few years at home dealing with the OCD and then Covid hit and she didn’t leave the house for 3 years- literally. She has self diagnosed herself with a lot of things (BPD, borderline personality disorder etc) but honestly I feel like every healthy person would struggle with their mental health if they never left their room and had no purpose in life. She’s turned really bitter and blames my parents for where she is in life and her mental health (I can see where she’s coming from in come areas but at this point there’s no point in blaming people- she needs to work on fixing her life) she’s 27 and has threatened suicide more than once. At this point none of us know what to do. I find myself thinking about the situation with her almost every day- whenever I have a free moment that’s where my mind wonders. I wonder how she will fare in the world in 10 or 20 years when it’s no acceptable for my parents to do everything for her. My parents are getting old and I see the toll this has taken on them - the last thing I want to do is tell them how much this has been affecting me because I know they don’t have the mental capacity for it. I worry that she’s going to hurt or k*ll herself one day and there’s nothing I can do- it’s like watching someone slowly die in front of your eyes. No one knows what to do and I feel so helpless. I’m 25 and not thinking about kids yet but sometimes I wonder if I would ever want kids because I see how miserable my parents are now and they gave their lives up to raise us as best as they could.

My dad died April 14th 2024,1715930638.0,"My dad passed away April 14th 2024. He wasn’t always the greatest man or even the most truthful. It feels like my entire family hated him before he died except me and my mom. After fighting cancer for 6 months, he got an infection and died. It wasn’t the cancer that took him out, it was the infection caused by the hospital. We didn’t have enough money to pay for a funeral so we got a cremation. I feel like when he did die, everyone cared for about two weeks. They were all compassionate and caring. But when those two weeks were over, it went right back to normal. Everyone started treating me how they used to before and everyone forgot about it. School just piled work up and didn’t care. I asked the councilor and he told me it’s easy work just do it. But I mentally cannot, I don’t even care if I get held back or anything. I just want to be in the hospital room again playing Xbox together for eternity. Or in a hotel room watching grown up’s 2 laughing our asses off. But that’s impossible so whatever. I was supposed to visit him before he died, The night he died. But I decided to take a nap and so did he. My last text to him was “Dad don't be mad but can I come another day I can't stop sleeping I'm so tired” he didn’t even get to read it because they rushed him into the ICU at around 3 AM. My uncle rushed over to him and told us his last moments he said he loved us and held his hand before blood shot up his breathing tube and he died. My mom woke up and had the text from my uncle. She came upstairs to tell us and my sister didn’t care but I just sat there processing it, thinking, reflecting. I gave my mom a hug and didn’t think about it. I was on TikTok later that day and saw something about a girl in college calling her dad to tell him she loves him. I thought in that moment, I’ll never be able to call my dad and tell him I love him ever again. I went outside to see my mom and she was talking to my sister through her bedroom window. I stood there waiting trying not to cry. Then they were done and my mom hugged me. And just like that it all came out. I couldn’t stop crying for an hour straight. I’m not a crier at all. She offered to bring me somewhere to get out of my house to soak it all up so we went somewhere else. I came back with a somewhat good memory of that day. But the next week was grueling. My sister only really cared for the week she got to say home from school. Sure that was nice but I didn’t heal after. I didn’t tell anyone at school to make sure no one made fun of it because I know how people are. But now, nobody even cares. My mom and me were up late one night crying together about him. And I keep getting stuff that reminds me of him, jackets, shirts, beanies, shoes and other stuff. I don’t even want the money, I’d feel guilty using it, I might donate it or use it for college. But honestly who cares what I do with it. No one really seems to care. 

Everyone’s saying I should be depressed which I think in a way I am. But I’m not gonna start acting different. I can’t say sucide hasn’t crossed my mind but I’m not gonna do it. I can’t leave my mom alone on this planet. I really do hope heaven exists. In conclusion though, he’s gone, I can’t do anything about it, people are moving on and I’m stuck.

Feelings of depersonalization AFTER quitting weed?,1715937631.0,"TW: mentions of substance abuse and suicidal thoughts.

Hey everyone,

I was a heavy user of marijuana for a little more than three years. I began using it every single day almost immediately after trying it for the first time when I was 19. I also have struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation since I was 15 years old (I just turned 23).

Recently, I decided to kick the weed habit entirely. I’ve taken a few breaks before, but this is my first time trying to cut it out for good. It’s been five days.

I’m not sure if this is the right word, but I feel like I’m depersonalizing. I experienced that sometimes while high, but never while sober. Tonight I was lying in bed and suddenly began feeling disconnected from memories from before I began smoking, and also from the period when I was smoking.

I feel like I’ve changed so much as a person in the last three years and now I can barely recognize myself. Like I spent these years on another planet and now I’ve come back to something totally different. I’ve dropped out of school, lost contact with so many friends, gotten more distant from my family, and all I can think of is that the person I thought I was would never have done these things. Even the new hobbies/interests I picked up during my addiction (which I DO enjoy) suddenly feel strange to me. The jobs, relationships, living situations, etc that I was in while addicted almost feel like they never happened. I feel so much shame and disconnect and confusion, and I’m afraid that I’ve lost myself.

Is this a common experience when quitting? Does it get better? What can I do? I don’t know where to start with rebuilding myself.",christisanders1,,False,1cu0wm3,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cu0wm3/feelings_of_depersonalization_after_quitting_weed/

How to work on social skills?,1715935438.0,"23M

I’m awkward a lot of the time. I really try to be more social and connect with friends as well as strangers but it’s just so dry and awkward. I spend already a lot of my time around people since it’s required for my work and studies so I get a lot of social “practice” and I have been improving a lot, but still I struggle. 

Last night I went clubbing with a bunch of friends which I usually don’t do. It was fun at first, having the usual conversations and having a bit of fun, but when it came to dancing to music that isn’t my taste I was just there trying to act like I was having fun while all my friends were actually having fun. At one point I lost my ability to have the fun conversations I usually have, which was not because of the alcohol but just because I started to feel alone and isolated even though I was around people. 

I tend connect quite easily at first, but then some hours into the night I feel like I lose that connection. Sometimes I solve this by ending the night early while the rest of the group enjoys the rest of the long night. 

Clubbing music is really really bad though in my opinion, even while drunk. I’m more into raves but there’s not always a rave happening around here, only occasionally. I guess this could explain my struggle too. 

I might be on the spectrum which could explain some things, but I haven’t done any tests. Do you think it’s important to do a test?

I need help asking for help. ,1715934304.0,"I am 16 and in school. I also work 20-25 hours a week. I have severe ADHD and struggle with depression and anxiety. I'm falling behind in school, losing friends, and having trouble sleeping. I have medication for my ADHD so I feel like I have no reason to be struggling with turning in my assignments on time and completing simple tasks. I go to a private high school, so I am surrounded by people who are constantly overachieving. At my school it's the standard to succeed and anything below an A is seen as a failure (at least by my peers). My struggle to turn in my assignments has led to bullying from my classmates because it has caused me to do poorly in some of my classes. The bullying has caused me heightened feelings of depression and anxiety. Next week is finals week and I feel like I'm drowning in all the work I need to do to prepare, and still have time to work enough hours at my job to support myself. I need to ask someone for help because I feel unstable and scared. My parents ""don't believe in mental health"" and tell me to suck it up and wait for the real world. My teachers tell me to turn in my work on time because it's ""not that hard to just do your work"". I have no idea what to do and am scared that I'll fail my classes and have to retake them next year. I've been breaking down in tears every night in my room and it's exhausting.

Here's a poem I've written to describe my struggles with mental health,1715933511.0,"Wake up with the feeling. 
What does all this mean?
How has life become this way
Surely it's a dream?

Questioning existence
A dark and lonely place
A tormenting reality
Which everyday I face

Why cant i stop thinking?
Now I'm torn apart
I wish that I could rewind time
And make this never start

How can someone feel this?
Why will this not leave?
Now my mind is taken
There's nothing left to grieve

Every day I'm hurting
My sanity's the cost
It hurts my body deep within 
The life that I have lost 

It feels like a prison cell
It feels like certain death
You pray that when you next lie down
You'll take your final breath

Its my life, my right to choose
You'd take this path if in my shoes
Youd take the choice to end the pain
And never feel this fire again

I wish that i could let you in
To show you all the pain within
I wish that you could feel this way
To feel how i feel, every day

A question now, where i belong
If all goes quiet just know I'm gone
In the morning when i wake 
I pray the lord my soul to take

Overwhelmed by a petty family conflict,1715932542.0,"My parents and older brother are going on a trip, leaving me alone with my younger sister, and we fight a lot. My dad already threatened me earlier that he's gonna kill me if he hears one single thing from us during their trip. 

Yesterday, I decided to go into my sister's room just to be a little silly, make her laugh and stuff, and she instantly screamed at top of her lungs for me to get out, which provoked my dad to scream at me for it, not wanting to listen to my side of the story at all. I tried to explain I wasn't trying to annoy her, but he cut me off, threatening me not to do a single thing to her during the trip or I'm dead, and knowing him, he's gonna lecture me again tomorrow about it as if he didn't twice already. He's not going to hold back. He's gonna come at me without restraint. He always faces small, petty crap with everything he's got and then some. He blows everything out of proportion, and it's mentally draining. 

Both my parents keep insisting I'm always equally at fault, despite how many times I tell them I don't try to provoke her, and my sister barely gets lectured for her behavior to begin with. I told my mom the whole situation is affecting me mentally and emotionally and she didn't say a single word in response. 

I don't know if I'm overreacting because of past unrelated trauma, but I just wanna cry. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I don't want to be here anymore. I tried numbing my emotions completely, but that failed miserably. I don't know what to do. It feels like no one in my life cares at all.

i went through about 2 years of constant abuse due to an “angry man” in the house. he would do alcoholic and drug induced benders where i was trapped in a room with him. one bedroom house, i slept on the couch he would refuse to go into the bedroom and sleep and instead would torment me and make it so i couldn’t sleep. either it would be yelling song lyrics, loud vomiting, breaking dishes, screaming at me, lighting the stove on fire— he was an adult toddler. you get it.


two years of this. 3-4 times a week he’d go in benders that would last for 10–20 hours after his either 8 or 16 hour shifts. god knows how he did it. anyway as previously stated, he would NOT leave the room i slept in, making me unable to sleep. 



i just learned about the concept of sleep debt. how the FUCK would i calculate how much sleep debt im in? does that even matter? ive been perpetually exhausted since i was like 19, maybe even since i was 16. i lack ALL of my energy, mental and physical. physically im doing a tiny bit better since i moved out.

how do i rest better? how do i RELAX? how do i have me time by the way? how do i PROPERLY RELAX, and also how do i make up for YEARS of inability to sleep? 


god im so stressed. please someone with actual advice on how to relax help me. nothing helps anymore, i just wake up exhausted mentally and unable to sleep more without making myself sick physically.

My anger problem and my sister's mental illness,1715931499.0,"I have an older sister who has thought OCD and major depression. This was triggered after our dad died 14 years ago. She is on medication and gets on and off therapy. She has no friends and me and my mom are the only people in her life that hangs out with her. She has been through a lot of fucked up situations in her life and I am not going to go into details regarding them with respect to her privacy, but just know that these situations are enough to give her trauma and make her mental illnesses worse. 

My mother and I try our best to support our sister. We try to do anything that would make her happy, listen to her problems, and just be there for her whenever she needs us. My sister behaves extremely bad with my mother whenever my sister gets really angry, for example, she gets physical with my mother sometimes and verbally abuses her and blames her for everything that went wrong with my sister's life. She genuinely believes our mom is the reason why she has ocd, depression and went through a lot of traumatic experiences. My mom is extremely patient when my sister is being like this with her and tolerates everything that my sister does to my mom.

Another issue is that, I have an anger problem. I never went to the doctor to get tested because it took me a long time to accept this about myself. But i am not able to control my anger. When I get really angry, I feel like i have to do something or say something to the person who made me angry even if I am aware that it will make the situation worse. So, everytime my sister is physically or verbally hurting my mom, I get involved. I swear at my sister or if she's being physical with my mom, i try to hit my sister. My mom always tells me to not get involved when my sister is being like this, but when I see her hurting my mom, I can't stop myself from getting involved. And I can't even lock myseld up in a room when something like this happens cuz i worry what if my sister hurts my mom too much, what if my mom gets hurt rlly badly. 

Everytime i swear at my sister, after a while, i regret everything i'd done. Because i know she's just angry at my mom and she feels deeply wronged when she gets angry and just like me, she feels like doing something. I know when i get involved i am just making the situation worse for my mom because my sister becomes more aggressive with my mom when i get involved. I don't know what to do when this happens. It makes me even angrier at my sister when i see that she does not regret the things she does to our mom. I keep thinking my mom's gonna have to live her whole life like this until she dies.

If I try to fight back then I am the bad guy, I am the problem.

It is the darkness inside of me, the monster.

But it's OCD, right? That's what all the specialists say, but it just sounds like all my trauma? And that would mean that ""the dark"" is dissociation.

I deleted this post originally, it was a bit of a pain to get most of the text back; couldn't get all of it though.

But im so tired of keeping this inside of me, and I don't want to talk about it because if it's OCD then I'm not supposed because it makes it worse. I'm having a lot of fun if you can't tell.

Or is it tactile defensiveness? Is it autism? Is it tourettes syndrome? Hm? I don't fucking know. Unless psilocybin can cure fucking neurological disorders I don't see how it can by either of those three. But apparently I was born with them.

I'm so worried about what other people will think, say or how they will respond to this.

I'm not that great at it—I know the basics, understand the moves, and have fairly good tactics. I go to chess.com to play rapid games against random people. Winning or losing doesn't usually matter to me. However, I always lose when I play against my boyfriend. It bothers me a lot. I understand why: I make careless moves and sometimes blunder. But losing these games to my boyfriend hurts significantly. It makes me feel dumb. I've never been so shitty towards myself as I am during a chess game against him. I can't help but call myself dumb and stupid for making those moves. He doesn't gloat about his wins either. He praises the moves I make and advises me on what I could've done better, but I still can't help feeling upset with myself. My boyfriend is the smartest man I know. He's better than me at coding, calculus, and just about everything that requires significant brain power. I admire him immensely for all his accomplishments. Yet, I can't shake the feeling that he's dating someone stupid. I know he doesn't see me that way, but I do, and I can't get rid of that thought. He's unaware of these feelings. I came here to ask if these feelings are normal. I want to work on myself because having mental breakdowns, crying every single day, over feeling like a failure over something as trivial as a fun chess game is taking a significant toll on me. Even crying over my grades when I compare mine to his is a problem. It’s probably me being insecure about myself. I just don’t understand why it hurts so much to the point where I cry for hours.

Anyway it occurred to me that this is the only time I’ve been outside of state that doesn’t border Ohio since I graduated high school ten years ago. It’s been ten years and this trip is the only substantial thing I’ve done with my life in that time. It been ten years and I’m still as scared and lost as I was when I first graduated. In fact. I’m in an even worse position since the cost of living has become so much worse. I’m still financially dependent on my parents, despite working full time I still rely on them more than I want too, and I have no great path towards financial independence, and I’m all too aware my parents won’t be around forever and then I’ll be completely alone and probably homeless, at which point I really don’t think I’ll have the motivation to hold on, in other words if the next ten years is like this, I’m just gonna call it right there and end it all, I don’t want to but I’m worried that financially I’ll be forced into it. Ten years and I still have a nothing job that I could have worked in High School, still have never been in a real relationship, and really have just spent a decade trying get my mental health under control and really have only managed to put a band-aid over it while not making life any less overwhelming. I guess it’s a little better, in that I’m largely depressed over things outside of my control overwhelming me instead of hating myself, but still.

Not sure what I can even do to improve things, it’ll be nice to get settled in somewhere I intend to stay for a while, it’ll make investing in relationships more doable, though I’m not really sure how to start dating, as far as I know nobody has ever been interested in dating me and apps have been a fruitless effort.

Career wise I’m equally lost as pursuing education never actually translated into a job, and now it’s kinda too late to go back to school, at least full time. So idk, I’m completely lost and scared to death.

Where to get autism/borderline diagnosis?,1715887882.0,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.  
  
I live in Germany. I have been diagnosed with a moderate major depressive disorder for 3 years now and likely additionally have some of the following: ADHD, social anxiety, OCD, insomnia...  
  
But mainly,  I almost definitely struggle with autism, BPD, or both. I have read some studies and a literature review. Unfortunately, there is little research on the differences and potentially comorbidity, if it even exists.  
  
I have had different licensed professionals express, with relatively strong confidence, that I have one and not the other - both ways.  
  
I am now searching for an institution or professional that, while diagnoses are obviously separate, considers the alternative option and, tho likely not officially, can provide more details on whether my diagnosis is mainly based on shared, or separate symptoms.  
  
I haven't found any institution nor professional that both considers the two illnesses and is officially recognized. Does anyone know where or how I could find that?

My mental health is being ruined day by day and I want to kms,1715883719.0,"I '16F' am in senior year of highschool. I've been depressed for years and was finally diagnosed with depression anxiety and insomnia a month ago. I just want to go somewhere without anyone knowing

 My relationship with the people in school is terrible I'm not sure where to start but I'll keep it short. For starters this began during my middle school (2019), the boys mostly flirt or have a crush on me because they think I'm pretty/beautiful but I've always been insecure and all those guys are bad toxic rumour creating people. I do well in my studies and come in the top 3 ranks and I'm not sure but the girls seem to be my friend but always end up holding a grudge against me due to this I hated everybody from school and became completely silent during lockdown(2020-2021) when school reopened(2022) as normal I was extremely anxious would always be scared to read in front of the class etc and during sophomore year(2023-2024) I had no one to talk to even a word I couldn't focus nor concentrate even during exams as day goes on I'm afraid of everything. 

My relationship at home is not good either. me, my mom, my brother, my step dad and my grandpa live in a 3 bedroom house so the space is pretty cramped and I don't have any freedom. I dont like my step dad as he's been toxic during our childhood but nows he's changed a lot but still I don't think I could forgive him. My brother(18M) is always absent, never at home never helps around the house or even takes me to shops for grocery or stationery. My granpa is the egoistic kind you would see who thinks they're right in everything. I pity my mom who has to put up with all this. All three of these males don't help with chores and so only me and my mom have to do them. My mom is the breadwinner of the house and my dad does not work domue to health reasons. In this summer break I've left house like 10 times and I'm going insane. I have no friends to go out or talk to otmr play with I'm very much all alone. 

My brain cannot deal with this even thought its been like this for years.I don't like to eat I don't want to eat I don't love the stuffs I used to nor do I do my creative crafts anymore . I'm lost.

my life amounts to nothing and I have no support system,1715881854.0,"I have no highschool diploma, I have no friends, my older brother abuses and intimidates me daily as he has done all my life and my family protects him and I am supposed to let everything slide. The situation I am in and with my mental health I will never be able to amount to anything. I will never have a normal relationship with anyone because I'm so extremely scared of people my heart starts to race when someone tries to talk to me or if I'm in a situation someone might talk to me even to say hello but I so desperately want a connection with someone but my entire body just stops me from doing so. Sometimes I start to feel light headed when I'm surrounded by a lot of people I'll start to dissasociate I'll start to shake and sweat etc. so it's just extremely hard for me. I didn't finish highschool because I got bullied a lot and then eventually my friends started bullying me and I tried to talk to teachers and my parents about it and yet the school decided to do nothing about it and I eventually had to redo my grade and I can't remember exactly how it happened it's all a blur now but I dropped out with my parents support after that I went through multiple therapy programs even ones where you stay at the therapy place (Im not sure what they're called in english it's not my first language) and it's now been 6 almost 7 years since I dropped out but nothing worked. I've gone nowhere. I've tried to study again back in 2022 but after almost finishing my year my mental health became detrimental again and I got panic attacks again so I quit again and now I feel like such a big failure my whole family thinks I'm a failure which I am. Everything I tried to do I failed at. I used to love art but got told by my family that it won't make any money so to stop wasting my time on it. They told me that when I was around 10 years old. I often think about all of the times they corrected my behaviour and how now I have an extreme fear of making mistakes. I used to always believe in karma and that all of the bad stuff that happened to me throughout my childhood and teenage years would eventually balance out in my adulthood and that good things would come my way but I don't think they will. I feel like I was meant to die young and to be that kid who commited suicide that made the news and the example of why you should cherish life. I wish people cared but they don't and they haven't all my life. I wish I had someone that genuienely cared about me and someone who wanted the best for me. I don't think that person exists. I feel like it's only going to go more downhill from here and that the only escape I have is death. I want to die but not experience the pain that comes with it so I just keep on living. If I could press a button and kill myself without any pain I would've pressed it a long time ago. It's like I'm in limbo. Anyway, I just felt the need to shout this out into the world because I need to sort out my thoughts and this helped a little. Throwaway account btw.

I have doubts God is real but I REALLY need Him.,1715881822.0,"I have nightmares, intrusive thoughts, OCD, panic attacks, I’m on four different medications, I really do need more mental professional help, but if there is a God I desperately need Him. I hear music constantly and thoughts/voices telling me to kill people sometimes, disturbing and evil terrifying stuff.

I am 28 years old, and I don’t know if I’ve been going into psychosis, but I have been feeling especially evil attacking me for the last 7 months, absolute Hell specifically the first month.

I hate my dreams, even when they’re not necessarily nightmares, they’re vivid and ridiculous.

I just had one that I don’t know why it made my scream, I literally just opened my mouth and screaming came out in the dream, and then I woke up screaming as loud as I possibly could for real. And then I felt like I had not screamed loud enough and an odd number of times, so I had to do it again as really loud as I could and longer.

I need a higher power, beyond myself, that’s for sure.

I don’t want to end up in a mental institution, and I don’t want to go to Hell.

My mental health is obviously more unpredictable unstable and serious than I take it to be. Some of these dreams that make me scream aren’t even actually scary or terrifying.

I literally just saw my work schedule being a strange odd time, and now was about to call to clarify it, but and I opened my mouth and screaming came out by itself, against my will. Then I screamed for real, waking up.

Fortunately my mouth doesn’t scream on its own just from opening it, but I still have feelings and episodes.

I feel so detached from reality sometimes.

I’m afraid of facing my family after I wake up screaming. They’re worried and concerned, not mad, but it makes me feel worse, I’m embarrassed and ashamed.

I’m so tired, stressed, hate my life, struggle with too much, and my own mind is like Hell, and a prison, inside of me so I can’t escape it.

I’m ashamed but life is demanding more than I feel capable of functioning.

I just bag groceries and push shopping carts mostly as a job. I’m ashamed that that’s the best and most I seem to be able to do at my age too.

I’m exhausted, but terrified I will have more nightmares and wake up screaming again, it’s pure psychological Hell. I rather be dead than deal with this. If God is real, I think I’m going to Hell though, I am definitely a sinner, who deserves punishment, which I guess is eternal damnation according to the Bible, even though that seems cruel, unfair, and unjust.

For the longest time I wasn’t simply an unbeliever, but pretty much ANTI-GOD. I thought He made me just to watch me suffer, so I cursed Him and defied Him. Why would He forgive me? I figured that’s why all this was/is happening.

I don’t know if the beings I see are actually demonic spirits or my subconscious or what, but I have brain tingling and needles stabbing me in the brain sometimes too, it feels like that, and confusion and loss of balance. Psychiatrist just gave me more pills (for nightmares, helped a lot but I guess nothing is 100% forever) and said an MRI would be too expensive for me.

I can’t even physically rest as I need, and mentally definitely not.

I’m aware of too many little things and details, and they’re ruining my life even more.

I gave into the OCD more too, bleep it!

I want to die, but I don’t think I’m going to Heaven. I’m afraid I’ll suffer even more, and eternally.

Honestly I’m afraid even with God this won’t completely go away for good, whether it’s because God uses these things to test people, or just can’t or won’t stop everything? I don’t know, but my mind is definitely particularly abnormal.

I’m afraid I’m going to ultimately end up being told that this is all my fault and that it’s all “in my control” and I need to just stop even though I can’t. Look at how police deal with people having mental health (or spiritual?)crisis.

People don’t believe these things, and think it’s all an act or that you can just stop, even in a mental hospital. You just get demanded to stop and tackled and charged more. And if you end up in court you’ll be accused for everything that it’s all your fault as if it was all in your control. As if anyone would CHOOSE to act this way.

I feel other personalities sometimes, I feel evil, terrified, and like I’m not me. When I was 13 I woke up and got up and felt scared and then started BARKING and screaming and swinging my arms around and everything was blurry, and it stopped after I called out to God and begged for Him to make it stop. I should take that more as evidence of God’s existence, but I still have doubts and lack of faith.

I can’t always tell what’s real or not, especially with such convincing dreams, I can’t remember if something was a dream or real, and reality just feels, different sometimes. 7 months ago when this particular severity suddenly started, the first month was excruciating derealization and depersonalization, and terror and paranoia……

I feel like this will escalate to a point where I completely go insane and cannot control my actions in real life.

Should I Admit Myself to Hospital Again?,1715891754.0,"It’s been just over a year since I’ve gotten out of the hospital for psychiatric care and I had been going amazing, a couple hiccups but otherwise it’s been good.

Mental exhaustion and depression from life,1715895167.0,"Hi everyone, I've never really written about personal things publicly on the internet before, but I really don't know where else to turn. I'm feeling incredibly lost in my life right now. I've been confused for a while, I don't have many friends, and the ones I do have, I don't feel like I really have anymore. I'm 21 years old, from Slovakia, and I'm studying at university. I always wanted to go to university, I was looking forward to it, but I've realized it's not what I imagined. I'm not enjoying it at all; classes are boring, I don't want to be there, I'm not interested in what I'm learning. Honestly, I want to leave, but I can't because of my parents; they don't even want to hear about it. I had a boyfriend, it was complicated, and we broke up because I cheated on him. I was talking to another guy, which he didn't allow. (This topic is really complicated to explain, so I'll just say that what I did was really awful, and I shouldn't have done it. Also, I want to mention that I wasn't completely satisfied with our relationship, and I had been considering breaking up. He found out himself, and we broke up, even though I feel bad about it, but the breakup didn't affect me much - I was more upset that he was sad and suffering. - We were together for almost 5 years, but it wasn't the same from my side, and it really affected him). But that's not the main reason I'm writing. What surprised me more was the reaction of our mutual friends. He decided to message them on Discord, saying he was leaving the server because I cheated on him. I was fine with that, but they started asking and messaging me to confirm if it was true. Of course, I didn't want to deal with it, as I believe private matters should remain private. Then I got banned, and when I contacted a friend who owned the server, I was told I got banned because they didn't want to deal with or hear about the breakup stuff. I understand that and immediately assured him that I didn't even plan to do anything like that. Then he said we couldn't talk anymore - without a proper reason why. When I continued messaging him, I found out he banned me from our private conversations too, so I asked another friend to just pass on a message. He didn't respond, so I think he banned me too. And almost everyone left our common Instagram group. I replied to another message, asking what's going on, and when I asked him why he behaved like the others, I got the response, and I quote: ""If I acted like them, you would've banned me a long time ago xD."" At that moment, I realized I don't have any friends anymore; everyone turned their backs on me because of something that doesn't really concern them. It saddens me deeply because just a few weeks ago, I told them I love them and that I finally feel like I have friends. But apparently, they weren't really friends. I don't know if they were just with me because of my ex, or if it's because of what happened between us. But I didn't expect it to end like this between us. Sorry, it's so long. I don't know what to do now. I'm the kind of person who's afraid of being alone, not just in relationships but also with friends. I've never had friends, and I don't think I'll have any now. It's very hard for me to meet new people. I'm alone, and I feel like everything I touch, I ruin. I'm not successful in life, in any aspect. I feel like just giving up and not being here anymore, but I'm afraid to do it.I really don't know what to do; friends meant a lot to me. I feel very down, and I can't imagine going through the whole summer alone. Whether physically or online, without friends. I feel like I can't handle it, and I'll go crazy. I'm extremely scared of that. And when I realize that no matter how exams at university turn out, I'll have to go back there again in September, it's terrible. On the other hand, when I think about doing something else instead (which won't happen because of my parents), it's also terrible. I don't even know what I need in life to truly feel inner happiness. I always mess everything up. I'm super depressed about it. But if someone has read this far, I'd appreciate any feedback or maybe a message if someone could advise me or talk to me if they're going through something similar and feeling devastated. Thank you.

"Mom showing signs of delusions, not sure how to approach her. ",1715906998.0,"My mother is 55 and just got out of a bad relationship with her ex of 2 years. Ex was a meth user and I don’t know if she ever used with him but according to my sister she did exhibit signs of being high off meth once in January. We believe that this may have caused something in her brain to cause her behavior now. 

She spends a lot of her time watching YouTube tarot videos and believes them and also ties them to any event that has happened in her life. She goes to “brujas” or witches in Mexico to see what they tell her and she truly believes these things. She says that my grandma (her mother) feeds her witchcraft in her food and that 2 of my cousins are messing around with her ex with no proof of this. Mom told sister that she follows cars cause she KNOWS her ex is in the cars that she follows because he “phone tells her” but she opens her maps and I’m not sure if she thinks her own current location on the map is him. My brother told her other wise but refuses to believe it. This caused the cops to show up at her house asking why she was following someone in the car. Mom said she was looking for “x person” and cop said “x person is not in that car, the name of the person in that car is not that”. Cop left and mom told my brother that she knows it was him in the car and she dismissed the cop. She asked my brother just recently if I’ve given him a lightbulb recently because she thinks I’m doing witchcraft. When my brother asked her why she was saying that she said “that’s what he’s saying (referring to the tarot video on tv)” my brother told her to turn that crap off and it was all nonsense and she said “you don’t understand”. My brother says that my mom mentioned to him “everyone treats me like I’m crazy”. 

There is a lot of other things that I can go on about that she’s been exhibiting in just these past 4 months that I have not seen for myself but that my sister and brother tell me. I have not visited my mom is 3 months because I’ve been very busy, I’ve also haven’t had any communication with her. 

My mother has believed in tarot reading and witches but it’s never been anything like this where it’s causing her problems and obviously feeding into her delusions. She is also doing risky behavior where I’m afraid she’ll get herself hurt or someone else.

"I am not ok, anyone have their own stories? Or relate to mine?",1715837995.0," I've been recently diagnosed with Quiet bpd, and tbh it makes sense. There was always a sense of instability in the air growing up. As well as both physical and emotional abuse. I'm now 19, I'm supposed to be moving on with my life, getting a job, building a career, building a life etc. I just want to go into this saying I'm not trying to make excuses for myself.

I haven't been able to feel the world in front of me in years. I haven't felt awake or a live in such a long time. Everything has felt foggy for so long. Sometimes I can enjoy myself, but those moments are short-lived. The endless pain always comes back. To be honest the slightest disturbances in my life right now can make me feel like shutting down and make me just feel like not existing anymore would be better than this. To be honest I've felt somewhat suicidal for a long time, so it's not like I'm going to follow through, especially since I see some big changes in my life ahead. I guess I just wanted some perspective on this platform. Is it pathetic of me to feel like I don't have a goal yet? Like a career choice etc. To be honest, the main thing I want in life is just to be able to feel the world again, to feel like I'm a part of it.

"Struggling with mental health, finishing school, and wanting to live",1715833758.0,"Hello everyone,

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Ended up being a very long post. This is my first personal reddit post. I’ll give you the background about myself and then a snapshot of what I am struggling with now. I’m hoping that someone may be able to give insights as to what might be helpful.

I am a female, just turned 26 today. I have struggled with mental health for the better part  of my life- low mood, depression, high social anxiety. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and social anxiety disorder in my very early 20s. Ive been working with my therapist who is also a clinical psychologist and I have also been recently diagnosed with autism. For the most part this had been extremely validating as I do believe the root of my social anxiety is having a hard time with social syntax, cues, understanding interactions, etc. I come from an ethnic background that is highly “traditional”, grew up with strict Christian parents. I while I do identify with Christianity, I have also been struggling with my sexuality so you can probably imagine why that is difficult. I struggle with this because I have no negative thoughts about the queer whatsoever community, however, the fact that I am highly resistant and distressed by the thought of me being not straight makes me feel as though I am a bad person/ have poor insight to an internal bias maybe. Along with being autistic, growing up as the only non-White person in my school, and feeling as though I never fit in, I feel this way about going to church and now my faith is something I struggle with because of the sexuality issue.

Now, I’ve always been described as ‘Type A- again, I think this may actually be the preference for routine and being rigidness in the way I perform as an autistic person. Heres the funny part- I am a registered nurse who works in psychiatry and currently in school for my Masters in nursing so you would think I have the answers to these problems loll. But I have always struggled with insight into why I myself struggle. Also, I think I like working in mental health because human patterns of behaviour don’t come naturally to me. Anyways, my other current distressing problem is that after 2 years of extremely hard work, with no breaks, working almost full-time hours at times, Im almost done this Masters degree but I’m getting so so burnt out that I don’t think I can do it. I only have 9 weeks left of a clinical placement. Just to top it off, my clinical preceptor is making my life a living hell- not providing thorough orientation, made me present at clinical rounds without preparation me, had me complete assessments and update the psychiatry team. I made a fool of myself because truly I wasn’t expecting to do this on day 1. She is wanting me to do more than my school is even suggesting- taking on the full clinical nurse specialist case load by week 7. She told me I needed to work on time management, mind you this is halfway through day 2 of her showing me how to do nothing. With the social anxiety, I have a hard time sticking up for myself and in general, its really frustrating when, as a student, I verbalize a need for support and it’s ignored. I also have a project that I am to be working on for the placement (policy implementation or education related) and she is wanting me to do an inservice presentation for several of the units. With how much Ive been struggling, limited time (9 weeks left), and extreme social anxiety, I just cant find myself to do that. I spoke with my school and I briefly talked about options I have. I feel ridiculous taking a 1 year leave (my next opportunity to finish clinical would be spring 2025) when I have a little over 2 months left but I’m crying everyday, having meltdowns, very overwhelmed, and with everything going feeling suicidal. I feel very embarrassed to tell everyone, especially family and friends who prematurely celebrated, that I won’t be graduating. 

Had anyone else had a similar experience with their mental health or schooling? Any thoughts or suggestions on how to handle this? I just need some relief so badly but I want to finish school. Any contributions would be much appreciated, thank you so much.",iobi98,,False,1ct4p8h,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ct4p8h/struggling_with_mental_health_finishing_school/
My over/critical thinking is driving me into an intense depression. ,1715834543.0,"I dont really know what to write here, or even why i'm writing here.  
just maybe for conversation with people that could possibly be able to level with me, and actually read/listen to what im saying instead of calling me crazy.   
im a severe alcoholic, and have been clean for almost two years from alcohol.  
life has seemingly went extremely downhill for me, and not because my environment, or any losses, or anything like that. But purely because my enjoyment of life has hit absolute rock bottom.  
which is confusing to me because i am extremely passionate about so many things. (which i believe is the main cause for my depression, my passion, which i will explain.)  
I've become a real recluse, a nobody, and a willing but also unwilling outcast.

i have my babies, which i love dearly.  
i have my girlfriend of 10+ years who i love dearly.  
I believe i have always been like this, but i have hit the gas pedal recently on my views of the world.  
there are so many tiny little details that build up a situation like this, as im sure many of you here will understand.  
i've always been depressed since a child/teenager, over thinking every single tiny little detail. when i was younger as a child it was things like: why do they look at me that way? why do they seem to carry conversation better than me? why do they get along and have a friendship like i've never had? ect.  
but as ive gotten older (almost 30) my causes of depression have matured and strengthened themselves. 

i have extreme views on religion, i honestly have never meant to insult or offend anyone, but it is all fake.  
i dont believe religion is fake, i know its fake.   
with my understanding of the world, and the logic that i use, i would like to say that i have a dead accurate bullshit radar.  
(please do not let me offend you, i am just truly explaining what is happening with me and my thought process.)  
all i have to say is that i know dead people are worm food or ash. nothing more. science tells us that, and science is the only ""belief"" that strives to find the actual truth, therefore being the only logical ""belief"". 

Everyone around me tells me im crazy and outcast me, i can truly never have a friend for the rest of my life, my views wont allow it, and i wish this wasnt the case. (not just because religious beliefs, but because of MANY more personality traits i think are repulsive to people.)

my young kids tell me things like ""theres a man in the sky"" and ""people float to the sky when they die""  
and ""we all go to heaven."" and ""adam and eve"" ect.  
they are being told these things by people and family when they visit.  
I tell my children the truth and that none of it is true, and they have gotten very sad, and even cried just from me telling them the truth, and choosing to believe others. (people that i consider to be actually crazy)  
  
telling them the bible says things like Noah was 900 years old and a drunk when he built the ark, and i tell them that science tells us thats impossible, but they tell me that they want to believe it. and then they go and visit family again and tell them all the ""horrible"" stuff ive been teaching them, when really... ive just been teaching them about reality.

This causes people to look down on me, and make me feel like shit that im ""brainwashing my kids"" when im not brainwashing anyone of anything. The religious stuff they are being taught by others is actual brainwash.  
like burning in hell if you dont worship something there is absolutely no proof of even existing.  
i am their father, and i consider that brainwash. but even my children are approaching me differently because of it. (we've always had really great relationships, and still do, i love my babies.)

all of this causes me to feel like everyone around me is brainless robots pulling the strings of my life. i almost feel like Arnold in the movie Total Recall. like everyone is purposely trying to push me off an edge, like they are all hive mind executing a plan to destroy my peace.  
I am so passionate about this because, in my view, my positions on this stuff are rock solid and backed by facts and science, not just the religious stuff im speaking about, pretty much everything.  
i feel like EVERYONE around me goes through life so mindlessly using words without meaning, having false beliefs. for example my girlfriend claims to be christian when she doesnt believe in probably 75% of writings in the bible. i tell her then she isnt a christian, and if christianity was real, that she would go to hell anyway because she not a complete believer. and she says that she can believe whatever she wants (which she can)  
but i tell her, i beg her, to at least use logic behind her beliefs instead of just believing things that literally make no sense if you used half a brain cell, believing just because its the popular/normal thing to say, without actually using any logic to find a solid belief to lean on. 

it is completely breaking me down, me being so passionate about critical thinking, its costed me alot of relationships, and caused alot of hard days, making me feel completely alone wondering if there's anyone out there that is actually real. (i have literally questioned if I, or they, were even real)  
Everyone seems so fake, fake personalities, fake friendships, and fake beliefs.

Not only on the topic of religion, but me and my girlfriend disagree on literally almost every single thing, and im a piece of shit for my view, but shes not for hers? they're not for theirs? is it only me? they make it seem like i am wrong about everything. it further pushes me to cut off all relationships. and i tell you its a very sad thing to be in love with someone that you hate. i dont activley hate anyone, but my views and passion about things cause me to hate, not anything in specific, but just hate in general.  
i have loads of hate. and it really destroys my energy, my drive, my ambitions, and i let it control me. 

the religious stuff is just recent stuff thats really driving me nuts. its not at all the reason for my mental health problems. i have huge amounts of self hate, and over analyze every single thing in my life, my past, my decisions, my fuck ups, and i put them on a projector and blast them all to the fore front of my mind daily, and i cant stop it. i dont think theres a pill that could fix this, no therapist, no friend, no preacher, no god... nothing could fix this, my brain works well for critical thinking and reasoning, but i think too well causing me to just over analyze everything and drive myself absolutely nuts, in turn causing a host of emotions that i cant control, extreme anger, sadness, and absolutely no forgiveness for me, or anyone else.

nobody really knows the things im struggling with, and talking to someone, im so passonate about everything, i guess i seem too wild to conversate with.  
some times i wonder if im the only one around me that has actual thoughts. everyone is so at peace and happy, and i really think there is nothing but air in their heads, and at the same time im extremely jealous.  
i would NEVER commit suicide, but the thought of it has probably crossed my mind over a million times since around the age 10.  
and that leads me back to over analyzing the reasons my thought process became this way, and i just cant pin point it. i have had spurts of mindlessness and happiness, but they never last long.  


Like i said, i dont even know why im here, but i am so close to relapsing, and going and buying some alcohol. its the only time i feel happy. i can remember the last time i was truly happy in the moment, and it was when i was drinking.  
but at the same time the drinking drastically causes my mental health to decline, but at least i have some sort of relief sometimes. as of right now, there is no relief.   
nothing gets me out of this rut. i exercise everyday, and have for years. im in good shape, im strong, i consider myself a decent looking human being, and i dont really value any of it at all. I just dont care.  
im constantly just trying to find something to get my mind to stop over thinking, but its impossible.

Unless i go and buy some alcohol. and if i do that, it WILL relieve me. but it will also be a downhill ride lower than ive ever been, because im probably at my lowest currently, and one sip of alcohol and whatever there is left of me that im holding together will surely fall apart.

theres a million more pages i could write but i should probably stop, because im currently thinking about not clicking ""post"". so im just gonna finish here, and to any eyes that read this, thanks for the time, i cannot actually talk to anyone about any of this without being considered an absolute lunatic.

TW: mention of suicide attempt,1715871778.0,"I feel useless and helpless at times because of my life decisions and the fact that I believe I basically ruined my own life.

I dropped out of high school after struggling with it for long due to my mental health. In the time I was studying, I have attempted suicide three times and I ended up at a psychiatric hospital twice (I swear, psychiatric hospitals are some vile places).

I figured that since I was failing school bad already, it would be best to leave the school and prioritize my health, hoping things would get better. Now I am struggling to find a job of any kind, and the jobs I've had have been very taxing both for the body and mind. I've also not been able to keep a job for longer than three months (I either get fired or leave because of the horrible conditions. I regret leaving high school and the worst thing is, I can't bring myself to start studying again.

Mainly because the period of time I was in high school was the worst I've ever felt, and I am scared that if I do return to school, I will feel like that again. Right now, I don't know what to do in my life. I am just hoping a miracle happens, and I somehow land a decent job that I'll be able to stay at long term. 

I know that I should at least go to a psychologist, I am just scared. Most of the psychologists or psychiatrist I went to did not take me seriously.

ive been diagnosed with a plethora of disorders and i dont believe them except maybe bpd. ive been diagnosed with bpd, bipolar, schizoaffective, mdd, gad, and adhd. my problem is that even though i do hallucinate and i have had a lot of delusions in the past, i think its not schizoaffective. the voices in my head have their own personalities and influence my behavior and decisions and help me navigate life. and when i get stressed or uncomfortable they comfort me and take care of me but sometimes they scare me too. and sometimes i feel like im completely different like sometimes i feel like different ages and i feel different abt everything. when this first started, almost 10 years ago, i hallucinated and saw this lady who claimed to be my mother and shes been the main one in my head taking care of me and ""handling"" certain situations for me.

my actual mom thinks i have cptsd which i dont know a lot abt but i do get flashbacks all the time and i guess i dissociate a lot. i especially dissociate more than ever these days and i dont know how to deal with it. especially when im hanging out with someone and i start acting younger and like i cant control it. especially when im being intimate with my partner i cant help but dissociate and i guess i feel younger and i dont even know how to tell him so i dont really plan on telling him. like ive told him how sometimes i dissociate and sometimes i dont feel like myself or in control of my actions and thoughts and how i have voices in my head but i havent told him that when we're intimate i either feel a lot older or a lot younger.

my therapist keeps bringing up the idea that i may be faking for attention but she says thats because i said i dont think there's anything wrong with me but i said that because one of the voices in my head doesnt think theres anything wrong with me. my psychiatrist keeps trying to give me medications but im scared of meds now because one of them gave me a tumor and some of them made me pass out and another one made me gain like 20+ lbs and im tired of taking pills. and now hes gaslighting me into believing i havent taken abilify but i have and i didnt feel any better. at least i dont think i did. i quit all my medication like 2-3+ months ago i think(just abruptly stopped) and i think i feel relatively the same except more stressed but thats because im in college now and im exhausted.

I need to vent a bit,1715911625.0,"for context: I literally just got off a call with an insurance company asking me about things I had no idea about. My dad had discussed changing my car insurance but never told me he was changing it at a specific time when I was working from home. The insurance company was asking me questions which were obviously based on answers that my dad provided online. Answers which I had no idea about. This was fucking pissing me off that dad had done all this behind my back and I went into a call with 0 context, information and no time to mentally prepare. My parents must think I’m joking or exaggerating when I say that I hate phone calls but this actually gave me anxiety. When I had a go at my dad he said “it’s just confirming your information” which isn’t true. They were asking me to make a decision on if I would accept the quote and all the other extras chucked in there which I had no idea about. 

All I was doing was relaying information from my dad who was mouthing answers and writing some down on paper. Surely there’s a fucking option for him to talk on my behalf because I felt so useless. I wasn’t in the right head space for this call and now I’m expected to answer questions that my dad had already answered online (supposedly). My undiagnosed ADHD was going mental as I can only focus on one thing at a time. I was finding it so hard to focus on my dad’s mouthing, writing and on the phone call all at once. My parents hate it when I self-diagnose things and try to laugh it all off “oh you don’t have that”. They are supportive of mental health since I do some community work with it but when it actually comes right down to it, they don’t fully understand it and what my triggers are. They don’t understand the day to day things that happen and they seem to think it’s just depression and suicide. It just made me feel really uncomfortable but of course they don’t understand that because they went through so much worse and turned out totally fine 🙄 they put it down to me being so dramatic but anyone who knows me knows that I am the least dramatic person of all time.

It’s slightly muted out the constant anxiety, but sometimes there’s occasions where I still get a bit depressed or anxious, my boyfriend notices and asks me “what’s wrong?” I tell him I’m feeling a bit anxious and he obviously seems very irritated at the fact that I’m feeling anxious, because I have severe health anxiety and I tell him I’m afraid to get this, get that blah, blah etc, which yes I understand can be very overwhelming for someone to take all at once to understand, but he told me once “well you might as well die then.” Or “it’s not that hard to focus on calming down” Which obviously hurt me a lot, but to shed light my boyfriend is a very good guy, it’s frustrating because he belittles my feelings when he knows I have more of a struggle of dealing with it, but at the same time I don’t want to seem like i’m using him as a therapist..am I overreacting over this?

I feel like im losing control and nothing is real,1715917839.0,"In the past 4 or 5 years my mental health has gone to crap and it's just getting worse and worse. I go through waves of short highs and really long lows and a lot of the time I don't feel real, it's always something in the back of my mind. I could be doing my favorite thing ever and then I start to slowly lose it and within a couple minutes it becomes a major problem and I usually can't continue on with my day, even if I try. Sometimes it can last days or even weeks. It makes me feel like I'm not in control. I often find myself trying to figure out what's real and what's fake.

In order to cope with this I've kinda built my own world in my head. I've taken shows and movies I've watched and they become characters in my world. I've created my own character, like the exact person I want to be but a little different to match whatever world I'm in (I have multiple) but the problem isn't that, it's that I act it all out. It looks like I'm just walking around or doing daily tasks and talking to myself (sometimes the talking is all in my head to not bother others around me) but to me I'm talking to these characters but then I'm also acting out their personalities and their body language (each character is very in depth at this point) and I often get lost in it and forget what I'm doing or forget where I am. I get so lost in this fake world I've created that everything else gets tuned out. I can't really do anything without pretending these characters are there, talking to me and just interacting with the other characters.

I'm not very good at communicating with other people so it's been hard for me to bring it up to my partner but we've talked about it a little and he's been there to help me when I start to lose it but I'm usually alone (long distance) and I'm always too scared to talk to him. I feel like a burden when I do.

Unfortunately, therapy isn't an option at the moment. Insurance won't cover it and I don't have the money for it. Talking to my family also isn't an option, I try to keep my contact with them as minimal as possible due to their beliefs on mental health.

Honestly, I just want to know if this is something that could potentially become a problem. I've replaced my old very unhealthy coping mechanisms with this but I feel like it's making it worse.

I know something is wrong and I feel like people don't listen,1715907278.0,"I have a few grips so I'm going to cut to the chase, and I'm not self-diagnosing I just want to talk about this; I feel like I have BPD. I say this as it's what makes the most sense. I've always felt unreasonably irritable, I do SH often especially when I feel overwhelmed with my negative emotions. When I find someone, I really like hanging with, friends or partners, I will freak out if I FEEL like they're pulling away. Like, leaving voicemails of my crying, sending message after message, saying I can't go on without them in my life etc etc. I don't have stable relationships with friends or family. And I can have extreme mood swings. To me, that sounds like BPD, right? But when I brought it up to my therapist, when I had one, she just said I have relationship depression and with better relationships I will be fine. I will admit I didn't tell her about the SH but when I would bring up the rage, she would just say I was burnt out. I feel like what she told me isn't right. If that was all that's wrong, why aren't I getting better? I tried to make and keep friends. I work out. I journal. I meditate. I do the breath exercises. But it doesn't help. Why doesn't it help? Maybe something is just wrong with me and there is no explanation to it, no cause. My old therapist even said I'm resistant to therapy so maybe I'm just this way and there's no fixing it just managing it. She isn't the only one that doesn't listen either. I've had people offer help, for non-mental stuff, and just never help. Like I'll ask a teacher to help me, and they'll say for sure and then never do it. I'll ask a friend if I can vent, and they'll say yes and then not respond to me. Why does this keep happening? Genuinely, what is wrong with me?

How do I understand the reality of mental health?,1715912647.0,"I have a hard time with accepting “mental health” as legitimate medical reasoning due to my background. For context: I had no one to rely on since I was 14/15 and if I “didn’t feel like it” or was feeling “crushed” it was either figure it out or homelessness, no food, etc… as a result of this prolonged environment I have become desensitized to other’s plights because in my mind no matter how bad “if they actually wanted to they would.” Emotions don’t fix problems but doing something tangible about it might. 

I understand people suffer, but how can I gain back some of my empathy that I’ve lost or see mental health as legitimate and be more mindful and not out of instinct think “suck it up” or “get over it.” I’m not interested in validating feelings but I’m interested in making someone productive again when there are serious risks on the line. I am aware stress leave is not a joke but I recall thinking “I wish I had all that free paid time off work for some issue that has no physical barrier.”

Coping with OCD Predictions and Fear,1715910684.0,"How can someone approach this in a logical manner? Essentially, I've been grappling with an obsession tied to a specific fear for quite some time. I make numerous predictions daily, roughly 3-4 times a day, for about 1-2 years. Most of these predictions never come to fruition, although some have. However, there's one incident that I've been struggling to rationalize and need advice on.

Here's the situation: About one year ago, I was at the park and believed I had touched bird droppings, which triggered a panic attack. Subsequently, my mind made a prediction or bet that if I were to encounter a dead bird, it would confirm a certain fear (""x"") to be true. The next morning, I discovered a dead bird on my patio, and I panicked. Despite it happening over a year ago, I'm still grappling with this event due to my OCD.

Here's the logic I've used against this thought: Firstly, I live on the first floor, surrounded by trees and bushes teeming with wildlife, including numerous birds. Secondly, my roommate initially informed me that they had seen the bird days before and dismissed it as a pinecone, which provided me with some relief as it meant the bird existed there before my bet. However, because I recently got triggered again, I revisited this coincidence in my mind, particularly because it exacerbates my magical thinking. I reached out to my roommate again after a year, and they informed me that the bird had been there 2-3 nights before my prediction because they remember smoking weed on the balcony at night and spotting it.

Despite this reasoning, I'm still struggling with this event, primarily due to the timing of it all. What steps can I take to combat this? Because the fear (""x"") is something I cannot accept as true, as it would render life meaningless.",Afraid_Data_6912,,False,1cttv00,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cttv00/coping_with_ocd_predictions_and_fear/

managing anger? ,1715908245.0,"
I grew up with parents who slammed doors/objects, cabinets and dishes, stomped on the floor, screamed, and were overall aggresive when angry.  Long story short, they didn’t having good coping skills for their anger and it passed down to me.  I’ve tried my best in the recent years to learn better coping techniques for anger like writing down my anger, taking deep breaths and getting away from whatever made me angry, yelling into a pillow, etc.  

But I’m struggling.  I feel the urge to be more aggressive with inanimate objects, like doors, when I get angry.  I don’t do it often at all, I’ve done it maybe once or twice in the last year but I end up feeling so guilty.  I tell myself it’s fine to do when no one’s around, but I did it once when someone in my house made me angry and I regretted it so much.  It’s so hard to feel better when I try other coping techniques.  It feels like I have to be aggressive for it to be truly cathartic, and I’ve been holding in SO much anger in the last year because I’ve been mistreated horribly by so many people.

"Lonely and depressed, it's my fault ",1715907096.0,"It's my fault, I needed to do better but took long to learn. Pity post 

Well, I've always struggled socially, probably due to my messed up family and the anxiety that was instilled in me. The constant moving in my childhood, being dirt poor didn't help. 

Started as a new student in grade 9 ( last grade in that school) after moving Junior high schools, so everyone knew eachother for 2+ years before I camee.

They were nice to me initially, but my anxiety got the best of me, I kept to myself. I ended up being friends with 2 other fuck ups and we just skipped school and did stupid shit. There was another new kid when I started, and he was able to fit in and have a big group of friends. 

Pretty much same fucking story in university, except I got invites to multiple things and just didnt follow up, now I realize it was a sincere invite and people WANT YOU to ask to be involved in shit. I also barley spent time socializing in groups and just got left out. 

Same thing happens at my recent job, except I had health issues and kept to myself ( declined invites to shit to deal with it)  with about 8+ other people of similar age. I tried to reverse it, but by that point I was an outsider and pushed too hard to the point they would lie about their plans not to invite me. Their not bad people,I'm just ""not right"".  Someone else started a year after me, and their involved in so many group chat and activities. 

I fucked up, grown ass adult in my 30's, maybe 2 or 3 friends in this world that I see once in a while. Could of had 20 or 30..... Fuck does this hurt, the kind of hurt that just sticks with you, reminded of it daily.....

And I don't think I'm going to get another shot in my 40's. I got no one to blame but myself, same small missteps and you go from having a great life with many people in it, to a lonely sad life.

Am I a bad person for this addiction? How can I get help and turn away from it,1715905433.0,I’ve realized over time I had taken an interest to gore. Unfortunately what started this was an online friend when I was 12 sending me a video from live leak. At the time it terrified me and made me sick to the stomach but around 13/14 I became more and more intrigued by it. I would go on shock sites that were still up. The main one I would look at is goregrish.com and it got to a point I was told by family I was on a “federal watchlist” not sure if that was true or not but who knows. Then it got to a point when I was just bored I would watch it for fun. Maybe about 3/4 months ago my therapist put restrictions on my phone to block out any violent/adult websites but still I will come on here and look at medical gore and nsfl. At this point I do not feel affected by it (unless it is a child or animal) it doesn’t disturb me or scare me anymore. I am currently 16 and this has been going on for a while now and I don’t know how to stop it. I would love advice or suggestions for help or just asking in general if this is terrible of me. Edit: thank you all for your concern it means a lot. I am in home/in school therapy and also doing a 18 week horse therapy program.

I’m just curious about these things I’ve experienced a while and still don’t understand ,1715904963.0,"Hi, Im Makayla and I’m a 16 y/o and I’ve been trying to figure out why I do these things. So first off when I’m usually stressed, upset, depressed etc. I tend to act very energetic at immature and that’s become all of the time now. Usually people think I’m “annoying” or tell me to be quiet and that hurts when they say it. Personally I think a cause may be childhood trauma and not having a motherly bond and feeling unwanted and not payed attention to. I honestly wish I didn’t act like this but it’s just naturally how I am. The main reason I don’t like it is because others responses wind up hurting me more. Okay one more thing I’ve been a bit worried about is the fact that I usually don’t cry about serious situations much anymore or I’m not great at comforting people anymore. This has been going on the past 6 months I would say and I honestly don’t know why. A lot of times sadness will feel like emptiness.

How to manage emotions about something out of my control,1715900495.0,"I rent a condo in an HOA development.

Though I have no agency in common areas of the development, especially as a tenant here, I wanted to hire an arborist to assess it. I'm a PNW tree enthusiast and I just... care about the tree.

Long story short, I'm pretty sure the HOA has decided to cut it down. They had a landscaper of questionable qualification take a look at it, not an arborist. They further justify the act to help the grass grow, which makes little sense given the orientation of the landscape, but I won't go into it.

Everyone is telling me to let it go and to save my energy to fight another battle. I'm trying to come to terms with it. I care about something I have no control over (stoics would be slapping me in the face).

traumatic experience (idk if i’m being overdramatic),1715900342.0,"not involving me being sa’d or anything of the kind, i’ve never spoken about this outside of small close circles and never had the chance to open up to a therapist about it. i want to know if this even counts as traumatic or if i’m just being wildly dramatic. 

HUGE TW for talk of fictional incest, sa and necrophilia.

it’s a weird case of being exposed to something i definitely shouldn’t have seen or read as a child. i ended up reading a fanfiction (i know lol) of two characters who are brothers, so incest off the bat, and it devolved into beheading, sa, and necrophilia. i was 10. possibly younger but i can’t remember, honestly i didn’t know much of what was happening apart from it made me feel violently ill. i wanted to skip school because i felt guilty, i had read it on my school laptop and got so paranoid about it that they’d find out. i faked vomiting to get out of school. deleted my history. lied to my parents about it. despite this i remember having ‘roleplays’ with myself about it, they weren’t indicative of me i know that - but it still disturbs me. 
it genuinely i think changed my perspective on sex and fucked with me for years. it still does. i don’t know if this is a stupid thing to get so worked up over especially considering people actually go through so much, but it scarred me at least somewhat. it ended up with me going down that edgy pipeline of gore extreme horror and whatnot. mostly to try and desensitise myself. i still consider myself too emotional.

i don’t really know what else to say. does anybody else have similar experiences? has it messed with them? even if fictional, as a child it was something that i really shouldn’t have ever read. internet trauma is something downplayed and i can’t help thinking that it’s just stupid.",nonsensethrowaway_,,False,1ctqgf0,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ctqgf0/traumatic_experience_idk_if_im_being_overdramatic/

No way out (M15),1715899773.0,"I’m in a situation and I don’t know what to do anymore. When I was 10 my family went on a trip to London, when we were there my dad massaged me until it was full blown SA. I didn’t know what to do so I didn’t do anything, I didn’t enjoy it and at that time I didn’t know what sex was. He continued to regularly “play” with me on a daily basis. He did this until I was about 12 and then abruptly stopped. I was so confused. For some reason my brain thought it was a normal occurrence for children to go through that and it just wasn’t talked about. As time went on I slowly started naturally learning about sex and then I realized. It’s not normal. I had been taken advantage of. I told my mom and she went home and said she scolded him. She said he was so scared that he was vomiting and crying. Life just kind of continued and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I felt so bad and sick every day. Fast forward to now (15 year old now) and i fully understand sex and what he did to me. I’ve had multiple evidences appear that make me wonder if my siblings (m14, m7, and f5) are victims too. These evidences include, my 7 year old brother (he was about 5 at the time) did the typical little kid thing of running out of the bathroom nude. Obviously I closed my eyes, my dog ran over to him and I heard what sounded like “suck it” from my little brother before he ran back into the bathroom . I could have very well just have mistaken it but it’s very concerning. And the other evidence is that my father keeps randomly going into my siblings rooms at night and insisting on giving them a shower. I decided to check if he had changed his ways by “asking him about some bumps that had appeared on my parts” (there really was at the time) and he assured me it’s normal. After a day or 2 hr asks if he could “check the bumps again” and as expected he SA’d me again. I also got him to massage my back to see what he’d do but I noticed he was touching himself while doing so. Since I’ve confirmed that he hasn’t changed I stay up almost every night to make sure he doesn’t enter my siblings rooms. I can’t get him arrested because he’s our income and my depresssed mother wouldn’t be able to feed us. If I tell my mom about the evidence she would mostly likely end her life.

"Was told today that I may have Schizoaffective Disorder, I need advice please",1715897368.0,"I (23 F) have been diagnosed with Bipolar, ADHD, and social anxiety for a few years now, starting Sophomore year of college. I never really agreed with the Bipolar diagnosis. I didn't feel like what I had was mania, though I did relate to a cyclical type of depression and periods of higher mood and motivation, not as much with the super fast talking or no sleep. I do get really bad irritability (just in general, but it gets unmanageable when I'm depressed). I'm also very prone to isolation, impulsivity, and rumination, and have avoidant tendencies. Since the start of the year, I've had 3 social outings that lasted a few hours each. I work remotely,and rarely leave my house.  
  
For context, I was always very motivated in school and went to a really good university for an engineering degree. I recently graduated and I'm now a Software Engineer. As soon as I started college, the ADHD symptoms and other mental health struggles started taking a toll on my grades, which was really debilitating. At 19, I got on Adderall for ADHD, and was smoking weed heavily, and for a period I was abusing my adderall, which I now greatly regret. At the height of this, I had a bad case of persecutory delusions that were scary as hell. Typical ""CIA is after me"". I got off adderall for about a year, and it was so hard to feel motivated to do anything, and studying was very difficult. I was still having suspicious thinking, but I was smoking weed a lot less and not taking any stimulants, and it didn't reach a full-blown delusional state.  
  
I finally started with a new psychiatrist, and today we had our second visit. I explained that I'm scared to go on an antipsychotic because they can cause cognitive issues and in my career, I can't afford that. He concluded that what I have sounds more like a thought disorder, along with a mood disorder -- He said it possibly could be schizoaffective disorder. He said since Adderall helps a lot, we could switch to Ritalin which has a lower chance of psychosis, and add on Vraylar. He said Vraylar is good for my concern with a lack of motivation, and fear of cognitive decline with other antipsychotics.  
  
I'm scared because this thought disorder thing feels spot on. My whole life, my intellect is the only thing I feel has gotten me through life. And now I have this thing that is basically characterized by ""illogical thinking"". And it's true. In those heightened delusional states, I can feel my mind connecting dots that have no business being connected. And it's getting worse. And Adderall, the thing that feels helpful, may have exacerbated this. I'm only 23, I'm only just starting my Software Engineering career, and the thoughts that ""I'm getting dumber"" since I was 19 are proving to be true. I'm honestly terrified. I feel unable to function without Adderall, but I'm also scared that I'll just become more psychotic if I keep taking it. What do I do... I've been considering going back and getting my master's in Computer Science because I want to work in AI, but I would feel incapable doing it without Adderall. And now I feel like either way, this ""thought disorder"" thing will worsen and I won't be able to do any job that requires logical thinking because my brain is just broken. I broke my brain. And I'm only 23. I've always been an intellectually curious person, I feel so hopeless right now like what is the point of living this way?",berry_strawman,,False,1ctpdbm,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ctpdbm/was_told_today_that_i_may_have_schizoaffective/
Why can’t I get my words out?,1715897235.0,"This is so frustrating for me. In relationships I will know exactly what i want to say but its like theres a mental barrier stopping me from saying it. Its like anxiety. Even if I know something is safe to say, I cant get the words out. I usually resort to typing it in a message instead which feels so immature. Partners get frustrated at me and beg me to speak and I cant. The more time that goes along without me saying something the harder it gets to say. 

The earliest memory I have of this is asking my parents to go to friends houses. Any time I’d be invited somewhere or want to ask them something Id text my mum instead. My mum I can talk to her about anything and I’m very open with her and trust her.

Im not feeling good.,1715896682.0,"I feel so much anger to some people that are close to me and it all comes from something that started off so inocently. I injured myself on a workout one time,it was January 17. It was my knees... I was doing a lunge and whole my knee was in the position where its closer to the ground,i pulled my body upwards way too fast and i felt sharp pain in my right knee,i didnt think too much of it at the time becouse i thought it would go away in a day or so. After that, i proceeded to do the same set with the samr number of reps but with my other leg,where i somehow managed to injure my left knee without even without pulling upwards so hard. Months later, i visited the hospital many times,i tried bunch of different medications and most of them dont work. I went to electro-therapy which barelly helps and i cant walk without the knee support on my both knees. I would say my right knee is pretty fucked up,bunch of play in it i would say,while on the other hand my left knee is still fucked but not as much. The problem is that i cant ride my bike which was one of my main hobbies,it allowed me to control my anger and it kept me sane. I rode at all times of the year including winter,i rode in all kinds of weather too. After 4 years of this i stopped becouse i was injured. Its driving me insane... as stupid as it sounds,whenever i was angry i could take out the anger on the bike without harming anybody and i would feel better. I also workout which doesnt hit the same becouse i cant hit legs which was one of my favorite things to do. The doctors cant tell me when i can ride again becouse i still dont havr a diagnosis. I will get an MRI done on the 30th of this month,till then i gotta get 40 quid for the pills (i am struggling finnancially) and i gotta get more of the gel that they prescribed me,which helps with the pain.

The day got away from me,1715894712.0,"For context, I have anxiety, ADD, & have been dealing w/ a health issue (which I’m leaving undisclosed) for the past 2 1/2 months, so naturally, my health anxiety has been through the roof.

I woke up & got ready for my day as usual w/ no distractions, but then my anxiety took over. The weather has been AWFUL all week where I live so of course that helped set the mood. I’m also on summer break & had the day off from work while my parents & siblings were at either work or school, so I was home alone all day. From 8-9:45am I was either pacing the house unable to control my breathing, or sitting & staring at the wall crying my eyes out. I picked myself back up & made breakfast while I watched TV.

By this point it’s quarter to 11 & I planned to finish a season for a show, but my nonexistent attention span got the best of me & I doom scrolled on my phone for almost an hour. I end up getting to my show but later pause it so I can work out. By this point it’s 1pm. Halfway through my workout I take a breather, but a quick thought ends up distracting me & I then pace around my room for 15 minutes in a tearful frenzy for no reason. Again. I regain composure, finish my workout, & shower. It’s now 2:30.

I go downstairs to make a late lunch where I was going to use the oven. I smelled burning from the oven & in a complete panic over possibly setting off the smoke detector, I shut the oven off, open all of the windows & doors, & have a full blown panic attack.

I called my Mom completely defeated. Nobody was home & I felt so isolated. It was so cloudy & gloomy outside that all of the rooms were dim, even w/ all of the lights on. In the blink of an eye the whole day got away from me & I felt so useless as if I haven’t done anything all day, even though I really tried to be proactive. The setting & mood for both my house & the outdoors felt like a blank void where time didn’t matter. It was as if I was stuck in limbo for the entirety of the day. I felt so pathetic having a breakdown over the phone w/ my Mom even though I’m almost 20. She consoled me & gave me a very gentle pep talk, which fortunately assured me.

I ate my lunch & drank some tea while I threw on a show I enjoy. I reminded myself that it’s not too late to turn my day around. By 3:15 I left the house for the first time all day, went thrift shopping, & grabbed some boba. I’m now home & it’s 5pm. I’ve just been lounging on my bed for the last hour or so. My hair is a frizzy mess from the weather, I’m dressed in grey sweats, I’m broken out all over my face bc I’m due for my time of the month soon, & my eyes are red & puffy from crying all day.

I’m gonna dress cute later & head out w/ my family to see my sibling perform in a school concert. I’m gonna finish that season of my show, & get ready for work tomorrow. I had a very off day, but everyone will have them sometimes. The day went too fast for my mind to handle, but at least it didn’t drag. The weather here should clear up by Sunday or Monday. I need to learn to let go of bad days & not let my obsession w/ structured routines get the best of me. Every day is going to look different, & it’s certainly not good to be busy every day of the week to the point of being overworked.

I can’t guarantee myself that tomorrow will be better, but there is always tomorrow. My health issue will eventually go away. I’ll be happy again. I have family & friends to reach out to if I’m having a hard time. My life is filled w/ blessings. My mind is always drawn to the brightest side of life. Happiness & joy are meant to fill every part of me. I’m healthy. I’m loved. Bad feelings are only temporary. I’m safe. I’ve done this before so I can do it again. I’m capable. I take things one step at a time. I inhale peace & exhale worry. I choose to feel good.

I've ranged it anywhere from ADHD, autism, or BPD, I really have absolutely no clue. My image of self is very blurry and I really have no clue how I am perceived by others.

How can help me and help my mentally ill GF,1715893208.0,"Tldr: my gf of years has really terrible mental health and its driving me into oblivion. How can i help her while saving myself?


My (32m) gf (35f) have dated for 8 years. I authentically love her. Theres so much beauty in her character and a depth i havnt found with anyone else in my life. 

The last few years of our relationship have been plagued by her mental health. Its been everything. 

Manic episodes (months long) depressive episodes (months long), infidelity, hypocondria,  rage and paralyzing anxiety. 

She is getting every treatment available. 

Meanwhile i built a life for her to join (financial independence, a home, a place away from her traumas) 

Ive pretty much given her every second of time i have free and emotional energy i have. 

A few months ago i caught her, for a third time, flirting with a guy (50+) who was actively trying to destroy our already weak relationship.  I confronted her and told her it was time for us to move on. This thrust her into a huge depressive state (stopped working, stopped eating) 

Our intimacy is non existent.  She doesnt even hug me, and only recently started getting physically close to me again while we sit on the couch or the bed. 

I told her i would stay in her life but need some emotional space. I have truly tried to be the best man i can be in her life. Im definitey not perfect by any metric. 

Ive also shut down since then.  Ive stopped pretty much functioning and to put it lightly become a zombie.  

Ive stopped being ready at work, ive stopped excercising, eating healthy and become incredibly heathanistic.  

I feel like if i can help her i can help myself and vice versa.

I was battling a felony case (first time), coming home from living abroad, dealing with heartbreak from my ex still, broke, living in a shed off grid, unemployed and then had a major death in the family. Somehow she didn't care. She stayed with me and loved on me. I continued to sleep with another girl during the first few weeks we were dating. I passed an STD to her. When I came clean and told her the truth she was devastated and never got over it. More than a year later she holds it over my head daily. I don't know why she didn't just dump me.

Things got better, I beat the court case, got a job and some money saved, bought a house for us, Still she could not let it go that I was seeing another woman when we met.

Help with overcoming academic anxiety / terror,1715885255.0,"I'll keep the description brief. I suffer from generalised anxiety disorder, depression, and early signs of psychosis. 

I have always been an extremely high achiever my whole life and took great pride in my work and enjoyed doing my work, especially in mathematics, physics, and computer science.

Around a year ago I started to get hit by extreme hestitation and doubt whenever I would try a problem, or listen to something in a lecture (I'm at university right now). It eventually grew into full-blown terror so now whenever I look at something that even slightly requires any kind of logical thinking I get hit by a surge of anxiety and terror and become unable to process anything. In fact it has gotten so severe that my brain instinctively avoids thinking too hard about anything by shutting off whenever I'm approached with any kind of logical problem, which is very frustrating because it makes me function like an idiot in day-to-day life (I get confused from things like doing my laundry, or putting on clothes, or even tying my shoelaces, when these are things that have NEVER caused me any difficulty my whole life).

I was wondering if anyone has suffered from something similar and if so what were the main things that helped you recover. The way I see it is that I need to re-train my brain to not be afraid of these things, but it's extremely difficult and I don't know what the best way is to do this.

Why can't I take criticism? ,1715884258.0,"'ve been struggling lately, both at my job and with learning to drive. In regard to both, I am not doing well and am having to get a lot of coaching. I'm relatively new at both, despite being mid-30s. I lived in a big city most of my life and had an older sister who died in a car accident, so I put learning to drive off for a while just in case anyone was curious on why I am learning so late in life.

Regardless, my issue is that I spiral when I get instructed or criticized, even when it is constructive. I intellectually know that I'm learning and shouldn't be hard on myself or feel slighted, but I can't seem to help it. If I am not getting something or if I am making mistakes I get really depressed and anxious and just want to quit. For lack of better term, I become a bit of a wimp about it.

I have MDD and have discussed this with my therapist and we've spoken about how things worth doing are challenging and finding ways to be ok with discomfort, but it drives me nuts when I get like this. I just had a not-so-great performance review at work, so I am in a really bad headspace right now. I want to quit my job right now even though my wife is being very encouraging. In fact, for some reason when someone is encouraging, I actually want to quit more...it's so dumb. I know right now I am catastrophizing, but what is this? Low self-esteem? Defiance disorder?

My Nan just died,1715881245.0,"I feel like I need to talk about this.

My Nan just died. I wasn’t there because they’re in England and we’re in Canada. 
I have a feeling my mum is going to go over there when the funeral happens (at least I hope she does because she’s her mum.) 

I’m trying not to get emotional about it but I can’t help it. 
To imagine all the memories I’ve had with my Nan to them come to the conclusion that she is no longer here any more, it feels empty. 
I can imagine her in that hospital bed, until she takes that last breath and then she’s no longer there any more. Just empty.

My Nan and grandad came over every summer for a week or two and we would go out and do things even if we’ve already done them before last summer. 
I remember during one of there visits, my Nan started having problems with her leg, it would swell and she would have trouble walking.
Just went downhill from there.

And my mum couldn’t do anything to help because she’s all the way in another country. So I can’t imagine having to keep hearing that certain people involved in the medical field were being assholes, she wasn’t getting right care, she kept falling over, she kept getting worse. And my mum felt like shit not being able to do anything but listen to my grandfather struggle. 

I don’t know. I don’t know how I’m going to help mum if I’m emotional myself. 

I know this could sound shitty in a way but I am slightly, ever most slightly relieved that she is gone because that’s it. All the pain and suffering is over and it doesn’t string along family for thinking that she’s going to bounce back because that’s what doctors kept trying to do. 
Whether or not they were being honest, I don’t know. But she wasn’t ever good, wasn’t ever taken seriously from what I was told when she first started having issues just given a drug to see if it would fix it and when it didn’t just put her on another. Until she was taking over 50 tablets a day (maybe even more) and just a few weeks ago the professionals thought to themselves “huh this seems kind of strange, were going to look and see if these medications are effecting one another?”
WHEN SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

Seems so easy to be angry.
But anger never lasts and she’s gone now and I won’t have any new memories of her and I curse myself for not having a fantastic memory so that I can remember her more clearly. 
Just no new memories to have. But she’s gone, she’s resting, all that pain isn’t going to bother her. Maybe if she’s a ghost (something my mum believes) maybe she’ll visit us.

I think I’m scared of confrontation as well, my neighbour died months ago, my mum’s, coworkers husband died months ago and my great grandmother (mum’s side) passed away too.
Seems like death is all around us at the moment.
I’m not so scared of confronting death but confronting the people it affects. I don’t know the right thing to say, maybe nothing at all but I don’t want to come off that I’m ignoring it because that’s hurtful. 
Maybe I’ll never find the answer for it.  Maybe that’s the point.

I keep doing these little actions that I can control, but don't want to.

 I also do other small actions (that might just be habits) like cracking my neck, blinking in a certain manner, or twitching my lower eye socket on purpose in a certain rhythm. 

When the room is silent completely, I just have this urge to make a noise (which sucks during exams). If I don't, I feel distressed. It's really upsetting my daily life.

I've searched it up, it might be OCD, and the only way to stop it might just be medication and/or therapy, neither of which are available at the moment. Is there anything I can do to stop it?

My best friends have abandoned me during one of the hardest points in my life ,1715877816.0,"I thought I’d share over here, perhaps at least one person will be able to relate? It’s been an incredibly hard few months for me. I am newly diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. And have had major depression disorder and anxiety since a very young age. I just got out of rehab for a weed addiction a few weeks ago (very successfully - I am not on any substances anymore and don’t plan on it again). Since being out, I’ve found it incredibly hard to adjust back into my home environment. Everything was so safe and I was so protected in the clinic. They even decreased my meds because I was doing so well. 

Fast forward to coming out and back into my home environment and I’ve never been in a worse place in my life. On top of this, two weeks ago, I found out my friend took his life. When I found this out, I tried to call my one friend, but she ignored my phone call because she was too busy smoking, knowing that I needed the support because I was alone, and one of my conditions were for my friends to please not smoke in front of me. So she didn’t pick up and chose to smoke with my other friend instead of them asking if I maybe wanted to come over for some company to grieve with them. Then, I had asked my very best friend if she would be around for company and support after my friend’s memorial. She said no, it’s too much for her. I will admit that I started lashing out on both of them after those two occasions, which I’m not proud of, but because my friend had just died and no one wanted to be around. At some point I pulled back. 

They haven’t spoken to me for two weeks, and don’t plan to. My best friend said “she just wants her old friend back”. Which makes me feel hurt because I’m still here. I am her friend. The same friend I’ve been for years. I’m just not the perfect version of myself that she wants me to be right now. I can’t have people in my life conditionally based on my circumstances. I would do anything for my friends. Especially if they were at their lowest points. I am in such a bad state that my mom is on watch for me in case she has to take me to the hospital to be under observation if I am a danger to myself. And my friends? No where to be seen. Not only have I lost my friend who took his life, but now I’ve lost two of my best friends after the fact as well. And I am alone in my grief. I just feel completely helpless. I’ve had to delete social media because they’re posting petty things to their stories. I’m finding it hard to accept that these friendships may have run their course. Because they’ve been in my life for years. But I just think it’s such a nasty thing to do, especially considering my best friend is a psychology major, who was so supportive of my diagnosis and one of the only people I opened up to about it. And is in her mid 30s, so it’s not like I can even chalk it up to an age thing. Which is such shocking and juvenile behaviour for someone in her position. I am beyond hurt.

(Only mention of SA! No description!)
I’ll start by saying, yes, this is about sex, but not exclusively. Lemme clarify that sub drop can be used to describe the emotional drop a submissive has after a BDSM scene, but it can also refer to the emotional drop any party experiences after sex. 

With that cleared up, emotional drops also happen outside of sex. Like, feeling really depressed after a social event or trip. I’ve had emotional swings towards unpleasant feelings after big highs my whole life, it’s a part of having mood swings. My previous therapists have reassured me that, as long as they’re not too bad, they’re perfectly normal to experience and don’t indicate instability.

Lately I have been struggling a lot with emotional drops/mood swings after sex. Usually the whole day after I just feel kind of. Funky. Unpleasant. I am always in a safe environment with a partner I trust and who listens to me, I always focus on aftercare, and I usually feel pretty good for about an hour or so afterwards. Sometimes the drop comes on right after sex, but more often not until several hours after. During these drops I feel upset, very irritable and insecure about myself. I’ll feel out of body or I’ll have mean thoughts about my body, and even myself as a person. I struggle to communicate and feel mad or resentful towards my partner. I’m a high needs person in the day following sex, and I’m trying to work on what parts of support for me is on me and what is on them. They are generally very supportive and caring. Very helpful in general, and my upset towards them is about things they Didn’t do (and I didn’t ask for) or small things that wouldn’t normally upset me. 

Additionally, I’ve been having emotional drops badly after non sexual activities. Like working out or going to work (going to work makes more sense as it’s a frustrating environment.) None if my friends understand being overcome by great dread, unhappiness and self loathing after a good workout. I often drive home and cry for 30 mins of my drive. I was not upset at my workout or immediately after. 

I’m in the process of searching for a therapist covered by my insurance, but this will likely continue to be a long process. I have unaddressed CSA trauma, which I assume is causing my feelings after sex. But, why does my downwards slope of emotions last so long? Why do I have such bad mood swings after anything that makes me feel really happy?? Is managing this just a matter of “getting in a routine” to keep my depression/emotions at bay?

These issues and traits make it very difficult to make and maintain friendships or relationships. They are quite off-putting to others and reasonably so, I don't think other people should need to put up with things like that. In order to avoid hurting others, I think it is better to not try to initiate contact or relationships with others.

This leaves me in a situation where the only thing left for me to do is to accept that I am not built for healthy / moral friendships or relationships, where the other person would not get significantly hurt. It is a difficult thing to accept, as a part of me wants to hold on to hope that one day, things will change, one day, someone will be patient, but I don't think those are reasonable or logical thoughts to have. It's not fair to impose that on someone else.

Has anyone else accepted a similar thing, and if so, how? Being hopeful is immensely painful, and I would like to get rid of it.",Ok_Indication_8959,,False,1ctgc1m,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ctgc1m/advice_for_acceptance/
Why did she act this way? Was i in the wrong?,1715875187.0,"In a short story, basically im about to graduate highschool. And its one of my last days on the bus.

But As We ride the bus together on the last day of the bus. She was sitting behind me but wanted to tell her friend something but hesitated because she whispered “but”. But still proceeded to sit directly parallel from me. So For 15 minutes straight I had to listen to her talk about how she was on ft with a guy basically having phone sex. How she did new things with him. How she didn’t expect it to go that far. How she loved it and she wanted to go crazy for him. While she was bouncing up and down in the seat and making sex movements.

Raised by a grandiose narcissist mother like the classic obvious type, knows everything about everything, cheater, shopping addiction, grandiose ideas and so on. Married young, now add 20 plus ish years onto that and we arrive closer to present day. Spouse had a psychotic break last year at which time it becomes clear as day that she is q covert narc.

Sometimes I actually think I have it all under control. What I'm actually realizing (from getting super frustrated with my own lack of mental health healing) is that I'm just constantly walking on egg shells altering my own true self in the hopes of keeping it all together. 

I guess what I'm asking is this, is it possible to heal myself in an environment where the other adult in this relationship is severely mentally maladjusted? It's hard because thru my own mental health work I've heard over and over and come to intimately learn that other people's mental health isn't my responsibility and that I am only responsible for me so it gets confusing to me.

Should I go to a professional to see if I have ADHD? ,1715802151.0,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit but I'm willing to take my chances:   
  
So, for the past 2 years I've been wondering if I maybe have ADHD. I resonate with a lot of experiences that people that do have ADHD describe, but I ofc don't want to self diagnose. 

So, for most of my life (probably until I was like 13) I never paid attention to a thing in school. All I could do was go to school and get lost in my thoughts/day dream. In hindsight, Idk if back then it was just bc I thought school was useless, or if it was my inability to pay attention.  But anyway, that wasn't really a big deal.  
  
 Fast forward to 10th grade when my studies actually mattered, I realized that I kept getting distracted and my efficiency was so low. I could be sitting there for 10 whole hours and only read through 10 pages the entire day (and I'm not even exaggerating). A lot of times, I could THINK about doing something. Even if I really really want to do it, I just CAN'T do it. And before I know it the entire day has passed. It stresses me out that I'm not doing it but I'm still unable to do it and I feel like in the past few months I've insanely become addicted to mindlessly scrolling through the internet ( esp instagram ) Like that's literally the only thing I'm able to do. Literally, my entire school year was me having to do something -> being unable to do it -> the entire day is over and i haven't done anything. 

The thing is, this is mostly for things I don't want to do - so is it just that I have trouble motivating myself? Like, it's not as extreme for things I don't have negative feelings associated with. I still am not as efficient as a person should be but it isn't as bad. I feel like this is affecting all aspects of my life - just bc I'm focused on a few things that im unable to do, i engage in mindless scrolling etc and because of that I can't even enjoy things that I actually want to do.

Also, I've always been horrible at time management. Ever since I was a child. I can't do anything until the last minute and im probably late to every single thing. I'm literally EXACTLY on time or late. Like, I've been taking the bus to school since 4th grade and I""m in 12th now and despite my parents getting pissed at me for it, I literally can't get to the bus until the last minute (or until i'm like 2 mins late). I don't understand how this hasn't changed in 8 years. 

Another thing is that my parents would probably describe me as a very forgetful person. That's basically been my identity in their eyes for all my life. Like forgetful/always day dreaming, etc 

Also, I would say that I'm pretty unhappy in my life. Idk if that's a symptom or something or just a result of me being frustrated with being unable to function like a normal human being idk 

OHOHOH I almost missed this out - I also resonate with a lot of ADHD SAT test takers. So, the SAT english module requires us to read dense texts and answer questions regarding them and I initially just couldn't CONCENTRATE on those passages yk. I just couldn't register it in my head and stuff. It's been a while since i took the test so it's hard for me to describe my experience but ik at the time I took it I felt like something was wrong. I ended up doing well on it tho ( got a 770) but I was literally the only test taker in 100+ who had to use a paper to jot down points to properly focus on the passages

My sister has depression ,1715801540.0,"I literally just opened an account because I need some advices. First things first, English is my second language so expect mistakes here and there or even nonsense. I’ll try to explain myself later.

I literally have no idea how to help my sister and there are times that I feel I need the relationship to end for my own happiness. Am I too selfish??? We don’t have our parents so we only have each other.

She has been in a relationship over 15 years, living together but not married. Since I met my husband she has made comments like I want to marry one day but not with him, I love him to death but I don’t want him to be the father of my children. We have discussed MILLIONS times that she should end that relationship because it’s definitely not what she needs. Time passed and nothing changed. She cheated on him a few years ago, and never told him, felt like crap about it but he never knew. She has cheated on him AGAIN, she has depression from a long time ago and she claims that she found what she needed in that guy but ended it. I have been listening to her since the end of last summer about how much she wants to end the relationship but she doesn’t know how. When I try to talk to her I supposedly become this person telling her what to do, with cero empathy and I have no idea of life and cero idea what she is going through. She has decided multiple times no to tell me anything else because of my lack of advice and then two days passed and she always come back to tell me the same crap. If I stay on the phone listening to her, it’s a problem that I stay quiet, if I try to give her advices, I shouldn’t have to tell her what to do and I have cero respect for her feelings. I have tried to talk to her and said I’m confused, I don’t really know how to approach. She calls me almost everyday to talk about the same thing and how much she has cried that day. She reminds me every time that she has depression. Oh I forgot, she’s in therapy since before Christmas. She said she has gotten better but I don’t see any changes. 

I have been listening for about 7 years that she doesn’t want to be in that relationship but she doesn’t want to hurt him. Then she cries because she loves him and wants a future with him, she just wishes that he could give her what she needs. But people don’t change, and it’s definitely not getting better and 7 years is a long time to know what you want and do nothing about it. In December she was gonna leave him, in March she was gonna say that she cheated and tried to fix it. In April she didn’t know how to break up. Yesterday she wanted to be with him and tell him about the infidelity again. Today she called him and said we should break up. She called me and said but I love him too much what am I doing?
Too much inconsistency for me.

After this long time talking about the same thing, it’s starting to affect my own mental health. Every phone call is one hour of negativity and I can’t take it anymore. I have found myself feeling mad, with anxiety, crying, screaming and frustrated every time I talk to her. My day gets completely ruined and I wish I could find the balance and dont let affect me. But I can’t, after so many times and a long time, I can’t anymore. I see that she is calling me and I know everything that’s coming after. 
I have tried to tell her that she is in this toxic routine and she needs to get out. I have said that they are hurting each other more than they are loving each other. I have said all the truths I know. And when I do, I’m a horrible person that has cero idea how to deal with mental health. I have said hey, I can’t help you, I’ll be here always but I don’t have the experience or knowledge to help you. She agrees and then she comes back wanting advices. 
I don’t want any more of this. A lot of things are going bad on her life also besides this. I wanted to tell her that I need a break from her for my own mental health but I feel I’m the only thing left that she has. How am I gonna do that? 

I don’t know what else to do or how to approach. I feel I have tried everything. My husband keeps telling me how happier I am when my sister and I have fought and haven’t talked in months in the past. One part of me wants to say, leave me alone but another one is scared that she gets even worse because I’m leaving her.

How can you help a person with depression that doesn’t want the help and their actions are not helping?

Car accident? ,1715873667.0,"Any advice after a car crash please anyone been through this? 

I was rear ended going while I was going around 65mph luckily I managed to walk away and so did the driver but it's caused me to feel really bad. The driver is being prosecuted for dangerous driving by the police, he was arrested at the scene. Witnesses who rung the police said they thought he was going up to 140mph so it was quite bad. I went to first physio today and my cars been wrote off. I later found out from the police officer dealing with it that the driver said to them he actually purposely wanted to crash but wanted to hit the barrier not me I don't know how true it is. I've been rear ended before as a passenger and had no problems so I'm finding it all stressful this time. What made it worse was because the driver just stayed in his car (probably in shock) in the overtaking lane and it was quite busy with cars going past beeping at him so I couldn't even cross to get over to check and couldn't see anything as his airbags had gone off so I rung the emergency services in thinking he/any passengers may be seriously injured or worse. Then after I had no updates because he was just taken away and arrested then I saw in an article he had been taken to hospital (only a few days later the police told me this was just a precaution). My insurance company passed it over to a 3rd party which meant I didn't need to pay my excess upfront who were awful and asking the most ridiculous questions like how many seconds I was in the lane before being hit, I was constantly being asked the same questions, to go over and over it and even a week later hadn't even contacted the drivers insurance company (who accepted liability straight away once they had so a lot of the questions were unnecessary). Thankfully I decided to change and pay my excess and its been 'easy' to deal with them since.  

Also I wasn't given a courtsey car (because 3rd party actually thought fault could be disputed without even speaking to his insurance) so I've not been driving since and the thought is making me sick, even as a passenger I'm not good when before I had no problems. I'm sweating like mad and freaking out if cars are getting too close it's making me really on edge. I've actually put a deposit down on a car today and someone else is driving it back for me but I don't know how I'm going to ever drive again.

Around a week after I mentioned to my GP I wasn't in a good place (after her actually asking how I was feeling) but she just brushed it off and moved on to my physical injuries. It's almost a month on and I still don't feel any better but I'm not sure what to do. It doesn't help I'm extremely nervous of medical stuff, I've not been to the GP in over 5 years so my experience going has made me feel even worse. I've just had started physio for physical injuries but to be honest compared to how I'm feeling mentally its way worse.

Can prolonged panic attacks cause chest muscle strain?,1715873575.0,"I’m having a rough time and getting panic attacks pretty much every day, especially at night. It’s hard to sleep and it’s quite fitful.

Today and two days ago I’ve woken up with pain and tension in the centre of my chest. When I press on the small spot it feels tender like a bruise. I can take a deep breath and no pain, breathing is completely fine. It only hurts when I move certain ways, like lifting myself from sitting - which is why I feel like it’s muscular. 

It hurts the worst in the morning and then gets better. I didn’t have it yesterday, which is interesting because I didn’t have panic yesterday until going to bed last night, and that pattern holds true for when I had it two days ago.

I know chest pain shouldn’t be taken lightly, but it really doesn’t feel like anything serious, I’ve googled what the concerning symptoms are so I know what to look for. But I still have anxiety about the whole thing, which probably isn’t helping.

They’ve turned a blind eye to how the house is dirty and unsafe for me and my cat and the only time they have ever truly paid attention they’ve yelled at me and blamed me for it which I can admit that I haven’t been doing much lately but I feel so under pressure and the entire house is just to much it’s depressing for me and most days I seriously feel like I can’t do it anymore and I have tried bringing it up with my parents but they’ve brushed it off saying I’m just going through stuff or how I’m sensitive or dramatic which is apart of the main thing I’m trying to ask I don’t know if this is truly neglect but my parents have truly never helped with cleaning and have never helped me with schoolwork for years I’ve been struggling to do it on my own and they have helped me when I was distraught and struggling

my mom overall hasn’t paid barely any attention to my mental health and the only times she has she’s made fun of me and refuses to take me seriously and she genuinely treats me more like something lesser than her because I’m a kid and treats me like an employee instead of her child It’s been years since she has said that she loved me or accepted the affection I’ve tried to give her she’ll just get angry at me for it 

My stepdad is disabled and really can’t do much to help unlike my mom which I fully understand but he’s still been difficult He’s constantly switching his mood and often picks fights with me when I’m trying to help him clean his room or do whatever he wants I can’t deny him help or take time for myself because he ends up going to my mom complaining and I’m forced to help him sometimes we do talk and slightly connect but he’s older and is hard to deal with I try to reason with him but he usually ends up screaming at me as well and made fun of my just like my mom 

They both are easily offended and quick to get angry at me and I truly just hate both of them for the years that they haven’t helped me or used me basically as a maid and not sending me to a school or helping me with the little bit of schoolwork I do have

My Boyfriend’s Abusive Mom is Starting to Affect Me Too,1715799643.0,"I’m not really sure where to start or why exactly I’m posting this. I’m not necessarily asking for any answers however comments and inputs are greatly appreciated. I need to know I’m not just dramatic. So to start, me (15F) have been with my boyfriend (16m) for almost 6 months. We can refer to him as D. In the beginning of the relationship it was always me staying at his house because my mom is a bit strict. At first it was really good. His mom (40F) was super sweet to me and would compliment me on my hair or piercings or whatever. This is important later. She also went out of her way to tell him how pretty I am. We can call her R. For some backstory, R is bipolar and unmedicated, as well as a recovering addict. She has 4 kids, 19m, 16m, 15m, 10m. They have been taken by CPS and put into multiple foster homes for most of their childhood. She is not a fit mother and does not provide for her children. 
So, over time she started deciding that I need to stop eating at her house, because she claims she spends more money on food for me than she did for her 19y/o before he moved out. I know this is not true because I’m 5’1 85lbs and I eat once a day. I struggle a lot with body image and her telling me I eat sooo much made this so bad. Next, she discovered a hole in her shower. One of her kids explained how it’s from his shower chair, but she didn’t wanna hear that. She started screaming at me to get out because according to her, me and D broke the shower while having sex in it. This is not true. So then she decided I’m not allowed to shower and D can only shower every few days. Then she turns nice again and compliments come back. Then one day she comes home and the dishes aren’t done and she freaks the fuck out. Screaming at me and D to get out and to move out and just screaming for like an hour. We left and came to my house. She started texting him to come home and he told her, “you told me to leave” and she claims she didn’t say that. So we sent her a video of her saying that and her response was “You’re abusive” then blocked D. She is a professional piercer, and a few weeks later she was nice enough to come over and pierce my tongue for free. (She steals all of the equipment after everyone leaves the shop she works at.) She told me a story of ONE time she messed up a piercing, then does that same thing to me. I think it was intentional. And now here’s where shit gets real 

She’s been texting My boyfriend D telling her she loves and misses him but he hasn’t responded. Then he texted her asking her to delete pictures of his ex off her social medias. She flips out and says it’s weird and toxic, and she blocks him so he can’t see it. Then she texts me, telling me I’m toxic because her son won’t talk to her unless it’s something like this, and I’m ugly and her son can do better than me. I’ve always been nice to her. Remember when I said she called me pretty? Yeah, she’s manipulative. The dirty cunt says whatever you want to here so you validate her back. She only tells D she loves him because she wants to hear it back and gets mad when she doesn’t. She’s disgusting. I don’t feel bad talking about his mom this way she’s a piece of shit who abandoned her family for drugs. Gross. I can provide screenshots of some of this. 

oh not to mention 1. She does OF with other men (she’s had a bf for about a year but they do porn with other people) 2. She posts naked pics on the insta she follows her kids on 3.

Finding A Supportive Work Enviornment,1715788982.0,"Have you ever worked on a team at work where you felt they supported your mental health journey? Or everyone was in the same boat, figuring things out together?

I’m currently job searching and aside from the other steps I’m taking to deal with decades old trauma (therapy, research into support groups, self-care, targeted therapies), I thought that maybe seeking a supportive environment at work where I can find myself would be helpful. I want there to be steady work, but not a high-pressure situation, like I’ve been doing— product design for startups.

I want managers who are role models of good behavior, and teachers of their craft (but not school marmey). Perhaps the atmosphere can be laid back, flexible schedule, where I can dip in/out of assignments as I work through stuff. Perhaps this is a temporary need, and a way of repairing myself. I’m not sure. 

The job market for my field right now is bleak, so I don’t know what to expect. So that is another reason why I’m wanting stability, normalcy, and time to recover. So far in my career, I’ve repeated the relationships I had in childhood. Which has meant, I’ve always been going through it, alone. It would be great to have people who could guide me in my career. 

I would really like to hear how others have balanced healing with work, for those who have done it, and what they seeked out to give them the healing they needed. ",thehobbyhorse,,False,1csofjp,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1csofjp/finding_a_supportive_work_enviornment/
How do you respond to someone saying I’m suicidal?,1715788610.0,"I said I’m feeling suicidal and depressed to a friend…. Her response was what else is new? 

I’m suicidal a lot…..but this morning, the thought I’m all alone in my depression  went through my head….. not expecting a crisis reaction but what else is new seems invalidating….. makes me wonder if I should just completely hide it behind a smile even with people I have no filters with even if they don’t want me to hide it…… being fake takes less energy than dealing with emotions after being invalidated……

It’s one thing to not tell someone you’re suicidal…. I don’t expect others to just figure it out…….. so getting no support is the only option in this scenario….

Drawing Helps,1715871885.0,"If you are 😰 stressing out, just draw something on a paper, it helps at least just for that moment, but it may help you to stay calmer level!!! 

Lately I have been dealing with something very bad in my life, relationship vise. And it has put me through a lot of crap mentally! I won’t get into details, that’s not what this post is about. The crap I’m going through made me realize a lot, about people especially close to me, about myself, and the whole world in general! One small thing I realized about myself that drawing ✍️ stupid weird stuff helps me relax and come down! No I’m not an artist and I’m not good at drawing, and no I’m not unique, I know that it’s a science fact. But I never thought of it before. Really, when you stressed out 😰 just grab whatever piece of a paper you have, a pencil, pen or marker or whatever. And just start scribbling, whatever it’s, don’t matter, don’t think about it, just let your hand do its thing, let the vibrations in your soul and body caused by the stress dictate what your shaking hand will draw on a piece of paper 📄. 
This morning when I came to work, I found a sticky note 📝 with kind of a spiderweb looking drawing on it (too bad I can’t attach it here). Honestly I don’t even remember doing it,  well I do remember scribbling on a paper, but I didn’t realize what I drew until I saw this morning. 
but last night closer to the end of shift, I was on a phone with a subject person, and conversation wasn’t very pleasant. At the end of convo person said that surprisingly I handled myself very well unlike usually when similar convos happen. And I guess it’s because the whole time I was drawing ✍️ on a sticky note, it’s pretty much filled with ink, but has a pretty nice geometric/spiderweb type pattern to it.  

Next time you are stressed 😫 out, JUST ✍️ DRAW! Hopefully it will help you!!!

Why does Coffee improve my mood so much?,1715870230.0,"For some reason, my mind appears to have a negativity lens or and general low mood especially when I'm tired. I've managed to observe this mood as separate from me, so I am intellectually unbothered by it. However, it feels like there is always resistance, and for a few minutes at a time, my mind's mood can sometimes bring my thoughts down with it before I mentally check it. So while moods come and go, I'd still rather not have this down feeling.

One interesting thing is that this filter is removed when I drink coffee, and I feel at ease. A lot of people I know don't seem to view coffee like this, so I'm wondering if there is some underlying mental condition I have that could be a reason for this. 

Like for others, coffee still builds a tolerance for me, and unfortunately, drinking for too many days straight leads to a worse condition than the default condition. Therefore, I use it as needed.

 facial pain and throat inflammation. ,1715865745.0,"Hello, I would like to describe my current health issue to you, including my hypotheses about what might be causing it. I would like to hear your opinions on what it might be and how I should proceed. Keep in mind that I am already undergoing medical consultations and will have more, but so far, I have not reached a conclusion, so I would like as many opinions as possible.



If you need more information, feel free to ask.



For about two years, I have been experiencing facial pain and throat inflammation. I have never had these issues before. They started occurring after I had COVID-19, and I'm not sure if this is coincidental or a consequence of the virus. Initially, these pains were infrequent and mild, but in the past few months, they have become much more frequent and intense, significantly affecting my productivity, energy, and concentration. The pain is mostly noticeable upon waking, but sometimes it persists throughout the day. When the pain is less intense, it almost completely disappears after breakfast or lunch. However, when it is more severe, it doesn't go away at all, forcing me to rest in bed. Sometimes, even taking Tylenol does not relieve the pain.



The facial pain is located under my cheekbones, along my jaw, behind my eyes, and when it's very intense, at the center of my head just above my nose. The pain is continuous on both sides of my face and does not worsen with touch.



As for my throat, it feels like there's a constant lump at the lower part, as if it were scratched. It hurts continuously, not just when I swallow.



These pains occur year-round, regardless of the season.



Regarding medical checks and existing conditions, here are the details:

- I’ve had an eye exam, and there has been no deterioration beyond my existing myopia and astigmatism.

- I’ve been checked and do not have sinusitis.

- X-rays have shown no issues with my cervical spine.

- I likely clench my teeth at night and should be using a mouthguard.

- I need to have my wisdom teeth removed (I’ve only had one extracted so far) because they have not fully emerged and are pushing against the other teeth.

- I am allergic to dust mites.

- I have L4-S1 discopathy.

- Blood tests for thyroid issues showed no problems.

- I am currently on a treatment of Nicetile 500mg (L-acetylcarnitine HCl) under the assumption it might address nerve inflammation post-COVID, but there have been no changes after 15 days.



These issues also cause poor sleep quality. Despite sleeping for 7-8 hours, I wake up feeling tired and as if I need more rest, even if I did not exert myself physically or mentally the previous day.



From the beginning of May onwards, I experienced two weeks where every day I had a sore throat, headaches, and excessive tiredness, despite having taken antihistamines and cortisone spray for more than 20 days in April. I had a flu in early May and felt very ill; all symptoms (sore throat, cold, headache) were amplified and kept me in bed for several days, as if I had COVID. Even after the flu passed, I continued to experience throat lumps and headaches, along with excessive tiredness that rest did not alleviate.



I maintain a fairly balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity. I am physically at a normal weight.



My hypotheses:

- Depression/anxiety

- Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia, or hypersomnia

- Chronic fatigue syndrome

- Long COVID

- Symptoms of a dust mite allergy

- Dental malocclusion and teeth grinding at night

Please help me support my girlfriend's mental health,1715859748.0,"First time poster, please give me any advice you can as I really don't know what to do.

I have been with my girlfriend for 6 years and I love her to bits. The problem is that her mental health issues are becoming more severe and more frequent. She suffers with anxiety and ADHD (undiagnosed but has all the classic symptoms), and it is getting to the point where it is really affecting her personal and professional life. At work she really struggles with criticism, and quite often is convinced that people do not like her, and are treating her badly because they don't like her. She has worked at 5 different companies since I have known her, at each she has had a problem with her manager, or the wider management team. Often she spends a lot of time analysing their motives and actions, convinced that flaws in their character (arrogance, misogyny, poor communication, general bad management etc) are the root cause of her being unhappy at work. Two of her last three job changes have been directly to get away from her manager. She also really struggles with the kind of office environment BS that most people face (others not doing what they should, people claiming credit, office politics etc), taking this things far too personally in my opinion.

This all leads not only to her feeling down and anxious, but also chronically tired and lethargic, brain fog and difficulty communicating. I have tried to be as supportive as I can, listening, trying to understand, offering love and support and advice where I can. However it all seems to be getting worse, and I don't know what to do. Every work day is an ordeal for her. I regularly message her through the day to see how she is doing, and talk to her about it every evening. It's always negative, it's always a bad day, someone has always treated her badly. I sympathise, empathise let her know how much I love her and that I'll do anything to help, but I don't think that anything I do is actually helping.

Counseling didn't really help her, although I have suggested trying again. Doctors just prescribe anti-depressants, which just seem to numb her without any real benefits.

I am quite different from her, which I worry is preventing me helping her, or even perhaps making her worse. I'm generally confident, not too bothered whether people like me in a work setting and the kind of person that just gets on with it. This can make it hard to relate to her problems at times, as she sometimes reaches conclusions which make little sense to me. For example if someone doesn't complete something I need from them, I would think ""they are a poor employee"", whereas she would think ""they deliberately didn't do this because they don't like me or want me to look bad"". I do try to be very sensitive in these situations, but it can be difficult. I don't say this to her, but at times it feels she's creating her own problems.

Obviously all this impacts our relationship, but I'm not going to go into that. I know if I can help her and make her happy(er) then I will also be happy.

What are the best ways to deal with mental health online? ,1715862483.0,"Hi friends, I've been dealing with serious anxiety and depression for over 3 years. My first panic attack was rough and not sure I've ever got over it. I still get anxiety attacks which sucks. My anxiety steams from relationship, finances, doubt in my future. 

I personally have found 1 on 1 therapy to be OK. While its nice to talk to someone, it just feels its a paid session to vent while and wait to do it again next week. Not to mention, it all adds up. 

What are some social apps/site you've found useful online thats FREE. I believe its all about the community, support of peers kinda going through the same things that can help each other.

I am in the process of trying to work on my own idea to focus on this and helping others in the same boat. Reddit is cool but doesn't feel as intimate or personal  - but prob the best option.

Should I tell my dad about my MH issues?,1715861672.0,"I (23m) should preface this by saying that my dad's not a bad person, but he has very old-fashioned (shitty) views when it comes to mental health and talking about emotions and feelings.

A few years ago, after a traumatic incident, I developed anxiety or depression (or rather, the low-lying, easy to ignore anxiety and depression I always had got much, much worse). Growing up with the idea that men should bottle up their emotions and never be vulnerable, I kept it to myself for far too long. I eventually told my mum, my brother and a few close friends, and got professional help, but I've still never been able to tell my dad. As a kid, he would roll his eyes or sigh when people spoke about their feelings, and had a big stigma about people with depression, and I internalised this for so long (until the point where I HAD to confront my depression and get help).

So, he and I are going abroad over the summer, just the two of us, with him as my carer as I'm disabled, and I feel I need to/should share some aspects of my MH with him. I know I probably don't owe him anything, but can't shake the feeling that he should probably be aware of some of it beforehand.

Feeling nostalgic or melancholy whenever I do not feel depressed?,1715860871.0,"This is a weird one I think but I've recently noticed how I sometimes ""miss"" my depressive episodes. Whenever I have them I feel horrible and I want out of it because it's just this horrible numb feeling following me everywhere I go. 

Yet for example right now, I miss it. In a way I felt comfortable just being in my bed or on my computer for the whole day. Listening to some music and not being able to manage my time. When I felt really bad I'd stay up until who knows how long, just having something on in the background to occupy my mind and I remembef falling asleep on my desk regularly because I just didn't have the energy to get up and move. 

And so I wonder why I now feel nostalgic for that. It is such a terrible time whenever I actually have an episode so I don't know why I would feel this way.

First session and I’m a bit disappointed,1715859485.0,"Hi, so to add some insight. I had been experiencing some chronical health issues for a period of time until I got somewhat “healed” to a normal level. I have to add I have been undiagnosed as my doctors could find nothing on my tests (haven’t done many I have to admit)

Yet, when I went to my psychologist, that I happened to meet today, for less than an hour. She declared that my illness was anxiety. Amounted 8 years of painful illness every day to that, and I felt very devastated.

It’s not the first time someone has jumped to that conclusion without even knowing me, it’s the easy answer. And I can more or less understand, mental illnesses are tough, but it felt crushing because it isn’t. And there is yet another person that won’t bother even check before spitting that.

She also was very prideful and cocky and addressed how studious and updated she was, while advising me “that if I liked psicology I could study it, if I was capable of doing so” (as if I were capable mentally, as if many people were stupid enough and incapable enough not to. I know because she made sure to make the point clear 😭. Man rereading all my psychologist is an ass.)

I am willing to give it another session. But this honestly didn’t help me much. I tried to address it nicely yet she seemed insistent on knowing it better than I did :/. She also briefly complained about others about” them demanding instead of being thankful, as I was”

This is the gist of the session. I am disappointed and concerned. Have in mind these psychologists are state workers so they get paid nonetheless of what they do. I think I’ll just be one malpractice more in a sea of overwork and carelessness. It didn’t appear too professional.

Middle school memory,1715858323.0,"So, in the last couple of months I've been in a safe enough space to begin healing from some of my past trauma and building my self esteem and self-love as a neurodivergent person. Honestly, it's been some of the most peaceful months of my life, but there have been, as I expected, moments when some events from my past and my childhood would resurface. I just remembered something that happened when I was around 12, so I wanted to share, because even though it's something that hurt me, there's a voice in my head that's telling me it's not that big a deal. So I'm hoping to get some outside perspective.

So basically, my class was preparing some sort of play. A few of us were chosen to act in a skit. However we weren't given a script, we were told to improvise. I cannot improvise at all, I've never been able to. I also always have bad social anxiety. Regardless, we all had to do it. When it was my turn to say something during the first rehearsal, I froze and just stood there awkwardly. It happened every time we rehearsed. And when it happened the teacher would turn it into a learning experience for others. While I stood there on the edge of tears, other kids would discuss my behaviour and why this would happen. Eventually, the teacher saw that I couldn't participate in the skit, so she gave me a different role - to help backstage. I was the only person who did this. My teacher had a rule where everyone had to participate, so I guess she had to find me something to do. While everyone was performing on stage and showing off their talents, I was delegated to carrying chairs. I ended up not showing up to the play at all. Figured they wouldn't miss me.

I don't know how it's affected me honestly. I didn't even remember it until just now, but the moment I did, the whole memory really started hurting. Everyone acted like it wasn't a big deal back then, so I believed it too, but now I can't help but feel like I was treated unfairly. Instead of giving me a chance or helping me find a way to participate, I was put on a spotlight in my scariest moment to be scrutinized by others and then cast aside.

Would it be wise to take leave of absence?,1715855721.0,"I’ve been trying to get on the right medication for my anxiety and depression. 

I took 20mg of my lexapro over a month ago for 2 days straight after not taking it for a while (over 6 months) and it gave me the worst persistent anxiety I’ve ever had. Like 24/7 panic attacks. 

Went to the doctor to sort it out. They prescribed me Zoloft and hydroxyzine. I took the Zoloft for a week and developed breathing issues (shortness of breath) which made my anxiety worse, ruined the vacation I was on with my family. I took hydroxyzine at night but I didn’t feel right at all. I stopped taking both after a week of being prescribed. 

Within the last month my mental health has been suffering more than ever. Every day has been getting worse to a point where if it persists I will get desperate if you catch my drift. 

My boss knows how bad I am, and I’m not the same at all. I am not well. But they are picking me apart, putting me down. Took away my promotion. The pressure is getting too much. I cry every day at work. The mask is slipping and customers see it and have been less than forgiving. I am truly miserable. I don’t know how I’ll get better. 

I have a doctors appointment today so I can explain my situation with the Zoloft and hydroxyzine. I wanted to bring up taking a leave of absence so I can just focus on getting better, I just don’t know if I can afford it. It’s either that or a mental hospital. 

The only thing stopping me is burdening my job and family. I have not talked about this with my partner bc I’m scared they will not agree with taking leave of absence, especially if it’s unpaid. I don’t know what to do but I cannot heal like this. The work place is very toxic and high pressure. I want to start looking for another job but I need to be well.

Why do I forget who I am sometimes?,1715855104.0,"I don't mean this materially. It's the subjective of who I am. Let me explain the conflicting experiences I had today. I'm a guy, and I have been getting into goth. I did some trad makeup and wore it to my retail job. I didn't do a great job and the thickness of my wings made it look like drag makeup, which I felt uncomfortable with. I got a lot of stares and at my worst at about 8 pm right before I got off, I started crossing the threshold into suicidal thoughts. Not ruminating on them, but I did have them. I also put myself out there a bit to a few of my female coworkers, and they ended up completely rejecting me after being initially accepting, ignoring me after we exchanged numbers, ignoring me in person, just fucking sucky. It made me start to feel disgusted with myself, like I'm a big dangerous disgusting man and they would never want to associate with me, and that I'm going to be just like my boring sad male coworkers who are much older than me because I'm a man and childhood is over now. 

It made me feel so bad that I started a conversation with a newer young male coworker who looks like the guys who bullied me in high school. He was actually really nice and talking to another human felt like I got filled with warmth again. But before that I had truly believed that that's who I was and was acting accordingly. Like not talking to female coworkers my age or even looking at them because I am a disgusting creep who is harassing them. I do not always feel this way about myself, but no matter how many times I come back from it, nothing stops me from going back into it and believing it. When I got home, I still felt incredibly guilty and regretful of dyeing my hair black/wearing makeup. The second thing that started pulling me out of it was scrolling instagram reels and seeing pink famingoes and rocky horror edits, which my mom showed me. At the time she did I was happy and it started making me feel really loved and excited seeing that world again, like I was remembering that I'm not a disgusting person. 

Then her boyfriend woke up and started rolling his suitcase out. It gave me a flashback to when I was younger and we would travel a lot, back before my parents split up. There were a lot of late nights coming home and the sound of suitcase wheels as we unloaded. It was such a good feeling and for a moment I felt it. And I had such a clear sense of who I am. I still do, although it's fleeting, but that's why I'm writing this. I felt so safe and relieved coming home. 

I never feel that way anymore. I never feel sure of myself anymore to the point that I genuinely, fully don't know who I am. Not feeling sad. Genuinely, I forget. I become convinced that I am harming or burdening those around me, especially women my age who I find attractive. It is not self pity. It is a genuine belief. I genuinely believe they feel that way about me even if they've never said it and I've never done anything. To me in those moments it is just the vibe of how I'm being that's enough to warrant it, like how girls sometimes gang up on creepy guys and tear them down with a passion because they're trying to regain power as a unit. If I glance at someone it's staring and I'm ogling them so I don't dare to look at them because I know if I do their friends will be staring daggers at me and ready to launch a verbal tirade to tear me down. I believe it so completely that I feel a sense of urgency to take action somehow to ""fix"" myself or my behavior. Why do I experience this? Is it disassociation? Psychosis? Paranoia? Why does nothing I do fix it? I am aware of the existence of CPTSD and BPD, but this feels like something else because I have a very complete and secure sense of self, it's just that I forget it and become something else for a minute.

My wellswishers feel sad for me as I have no dating life. I also have no willingness to find a partner or any optimism towards getting married. I cringe at the thought of developing feelings again for anybody like how could I be so stupid to have done so in the past. I feel ashamed and embarrassed when people ask me about my dating life not because I don’t have any but because i put myself in some stupid situations in the past. 

I am not depressed. I’m just 🤷🏻‍♀️ I don’t care about any of this shit. My friends/family are really stressed thinking about my further and mental well being and old age. If I have to marry I’m pretty much ok with marrying anyone like what they say is an arranged marriage where you are just married off and there’s no interaction involved none of those show your feelings and choose a person BS.  Because then it’ll be done with. 😅

"I have violent non-sexual fantasies, is there something wrong with me?",1715848943.0,"I've (21F) always been an angry person, but lately I've started to realize some of the ways I think is not normal. 

Whenever I get angry at someone, I wanna hurt them. I wanna punch, kick and hit them until they are limp and bloody. I wanna make them feel pain. Whenever I get angry, I can only calm down if I have a vivid and very detailed daydream about beating the subject of my anger half to death. I imagine the blood, the screams, the pain and it calms me down. 


But I don't have these thoughts to ANYONE who makes me mad. My sister makes me mad but I never thought about her this way. I only want to hurt the bad people. Narsistic, egotistical, unempathetic, lying, evil people who hurt others. 

What scares me the most is, I don't think this is wrong. I can recognize that it's not NORMAL but I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting the hurt people who hurt others on purpose.

Can relationships with a mildly paranoid relative ever get better?,1715846789.0,"Has anyone had dealings with relatives with mild paranoia (or maybe its borderline personality, but just a general extreme distrust) where they somehow managed to get to a reasonably good relationship and/or the the person got any better? Or is it all just hopeless?

I've experienced this extreme level of distrust when I tried to help her. She turns on everyone she is close to eventually and did turn on me finally. As she gets elderly it gets worse. If you try to resolve an issue it turns into prosecutorial combat with hellish, long conversations raking over the coals, and both parties feeling worse at the end. She's tried therapy , but unfortunately didn't get a good one, and she gave up on that rather than trying to find a better fit.

But here's the thing. Over the years, she had several experiences when people really did truly try to harm her or others and she had to fight very hard to escape from it. So she is probably somewhat traumatised. Of course, if you were to say to her that she is over-reacting or being paranoid... well, lets just say that would be kryptonite.

It's got to the point where I just have to keep my distance to protect myself. It's all a bit sad.

Do your parents affect your mental health?,1715846083.0,"24, recently had to move back in with my parents after a fallout with roommates and my own mental health issues. I am grateful of course that my parents have let me move back in and have always said the offer is there if I need it. 

My issue I'm finding though, is now after being back for approx. 5months, I'm finding I don't want to be home or around them as often as they are both hoarders (mum moreso than dad but still), they have their own health issues and I do take that into consideration but they aren't trying to actively help themselves or the house. They are aware of the state of the house and just point the finger at each other. I have helped tidy and clean a number of the rooms to help but they are already gradually building stuff back up. 

I have spoken to my mum about seeing a professional to help her with the house but also the idea of counselling to support her in changing her habits and she is not against the idea, but weeks, hell months go by and nothing happens. 

I am diagnosed with depression so I do understand the struggle, I really do. My mum is also going through her own issues with this, and I have tried doing my part to support her but it is hard when I have my own mental health to take care of as well. 

I don't even know where I'm going with this post now. 

Basically, I guess. How do you know where to draw the line? I want to support my mum and dad, it can't be my responsibility solely, but it feels as though if I'm not the one sorting the house out, then no one will, and I feel like I cant just continue to mention it or try to have the same conversation over and over again.

Therapy isn’t working. Talking to my therapist about my problems just makes me feel slightly better in the short term, but it’s had no long term benefits even after two years.

I have less than $20k in the bank, and the cost of living in my area and the surrounding areas is something I’ll never be able to afford.
I have no friends. I’ve had opportunities to make friends, but I just cant hang onto friendships so I don’t bother trying anymore. I haven’t had a true long term friendship since I was 13.

I’m terrified of relationships with both men and women too. Any kind of relationship. Friendship, romantic, physical. 
I don’t trust anyone enough to get truely close to them. I just have a hand full of people I work with that I trust enough to have a casual conversation with during lunch break and that’s it.

I don’t want to do anything, and it’s not because I can’t be bothered putting in any effort, I HAVE put effort in and it’s gotten me nowhere. Nothing has changed. All my lifelong traumas are still haunting every aspect of my life as if I’m still currently living them.

We are unable to pinpoint the reason why the moods intensified  but he’s regularly on a verge of either anger outbursts, depressive mood , crying or all of it. Most of the time there is no particular trigger  - his mood spins out of control during an evening at home whilst watching a movie, other times it’s whilst playing a video game, sometimes it’s just whilst outside on a walk. Once an episode starts, it lasts around 5-6 hours and is usually in the late evening, costing us both night’s sleep and is then followed by guilt, shame and self hatred the next day for him.

Every day is a battle against the weight of expectations. I juggle full-time work and college, pushing myself to the limits. The morning routine is a facade; I wake up at 8 but lie there, wrestling with thoughts until 9. The shower is a mask I wear to face the world.

I'm a man.

My worth is measured by what I can provide, not by my emotions. Tears are forbidden; they're the mark of weakness. Venting is a luxury I can't afford; I'm expected to swallow my pain, to grin and bear it because others have it worse.

I dared to open up, seeking solace in someone who claimed to care. Instead, my vulnerability was met with silence, with a coldness that cut deep. In that moment, I was reduced, deemed lesser for showing what I thought was strength—my honesty.

Society's definition of strength is suffocating. Emotions are a battlefield, where showing vulnerability is equated with failure. I carry the weight of unspoken words, the burden of unshed tears, all while maintaining a facade of stoicism.

The longing for understanding, for empathy, echoes in the silence of unspoken conversations. I yearn for a space where I can unravel the complexities within me without fear of judgment. But the walls of expectation seem insurmountable, trapping me in a cycle of silent suffering.

How to authentically laugh?

Let something save your life.

Closing my eyes feels like leaving a crowded room,

until memories sting like text alerts, flinching.

How the hours hurry when I am finally left alone to —

sigh.

The hours skate by,

each hour hurries,

that stomach-smack of almost falling

again and again.

There are a million ways to trip on this loop.

Outside, the threat of a warm morning

spreads across my window.

It's true I begged for summer, but now I stumble towards it,

second-guessing the sun with cold feet.

The heat always feels like this—

parkgoers' giddy shrieks from below,

the overheard kind of fun,

like wishing something was canceled.

My 27th birthday looms like a warning.

Still such cold feet.

All blessings disguised,

DIY panic attack.

24 y/o with mobility disability battling failure and depression ,1715831018.0,"I’m 24 and love with a permanent disability called Cerebral Palsy which affects the muscles in my body and I have a hard time with my mobility. 

I studied Graphic Design and graduated from college 4 years ago. I was lucky as I got a job straight out of college and loved it but as my health conditions got worse due to a collapsed ankle and other issues, I was laid off for medical reasons. 

Through that layoff I became so depressed and closed off from everything and everyone I loved and it cost me my relationship at the time. I also stopped taking of myself and let myself get worse through it all. 

Last spring after searching for a job for 6 months I lucked out and got another graphic  design job only to be let go about a month ago due to lack of work and am now stuck waiting on unemployment and have been living off the remnants of my tax return. It’s caused me to go back into a depression as I haven’t been to find new work due to the limited roles I can do with my disability and am barely surviving / making ends meet. I haven’t heard back from any applications I’ve sent in. 

I’ve also made many attempts at my own business over the years but none it of was successful. 

I feel as though everything I’ve ever done has been a complete and utter failure and I’m to the point where I don’t see what my future holds or what’s in store for me anymore. I’m so tired of pretending everything is okay when it hasn’t been for the last 3.5 years for me. 

I used to be so outgoing and passionate about everything I did. I used to be the life of the party, always cheering people up. I’m just not happy anymore and I don’t know if I ever will be again. 

I have 15-ish days left to find a new job if my unemployment doesn’t come through or I have to move as I can no longer afford to cover rent and bills. And can’t afford the moving costs.

"I’m throwing my life away. I’m aware of this, I know what to do and still i can’t change.",1715830534.0,"I’m posting this on main because I don’t care anymore and I hope this gets a bit more traction. I started college this year and ever since I moved out my life has been falling apart. I mean, it’s been declining for years but now it’s going down faster than ever. I mean I made a bunch of friends, started going out and having more fun and became a more outgoing person which is good, other than that it’s been a disaster. I failed pretty much all my classes, I stopped caring about my health, I’ve been skipping meals left and right and eating like shit, I sleep 10-13 hours a day, i can’t get out of bed to do anything and I just avoid every responsibility 24/7. Problem is that my parents are dumping thousands of dollars on me in hopes that I can be successful, I’ve got good friends to guide me and help me make good decisions, I’m in a prestigious college, shit, people would kill for the resources I have and I’m here throwing them away. A million people caring for me and acting in my best interest and I’m single handedly shitting on their collective efforts. Most of the time if my family or friends check in and ask me if I’ve studied and been eating and sleeping right I just lie to them out of shame. I know exactly how to proceed and I got everything I need to have a good life, it would be easy for me, really, but I just don’t want to. And this is obviously an irrational desire, I want to make my parents proud and my friends and myself happy but I don’t feel in control of myself. And people will say “ah you just gotta take control and do this and this”, i don’t want to. No matter what I do, in order to get better I’m gonna have to do things that suck to my brain, but I’m too stubborn to follow through. The drive I think I had to go through bad times to achieve good things is gone. But it’s not even totally gone, I can still do it for others, I just can’t do it for myself. I can only do it performatively, I don’t know if this makes sense. If someone is there to feel bad for me and think highly of me I can do it, if it’s a personal achievement that only I recognize I don’t bother. I always want to focus on others to forget about myself, which is why I practice selfless acts in a selfish way. It’s always about me but I use others as stepping stones. The self sabotaging thing also stems from this, I always act like everything’s in control because i want people to think I’m reliable and upstanding, because I need them to think highly of me. The worst part is that this is only for people who I consider strangers or authority figures in my life. And “strangers could be people that I know, just that I’m not very emotionally connected with. The people who I consider my friends I treat like shit. I discount all of my frustrations on them in the form of not caring for their feelings or wellbeing in the slightest. This is because I know that they’re not gonna stop being my friends, if things do get shaky I’ll “remember” how to be their best friends and things get patched after some drinks and a good time. Why I manipulate my family and friends and play with their feelings is beyond me. After these big introspections I always get to the same conclusion, which is that I don’t know what the fuck is the answer but this time I wrote it down in hopes that a stranger might make something out of it. So yeah, venting to the internet feels pretty good. Thanks.

Asking for Advice from anyone who has dealt with diabetes and mental health ,1715829194.0,"This incident happened a few days ago.

I have a younger brother who is type 1 diabetic for the last 15 years.  He was diagnosed early in adulthood. Since then he has constantly struggled to keep his levels in check.  He does well for a few years at a time but has emergency incidents every few years where he is on the verge of a diabetic coma or has had a severe car accident because he passed out on the road.  His most recent incident (the other day) was compounded by depression due to a series of extremely stressful events he’s been having in life.  This most recent incident (his blood sugar was at 305) had him feeling suicidal and hearing violent voices that made him feel like he was going crazy. He’s always been a quiet and mild manner person so this was extremely off from who he is. In that moment he was telling us he was cursed and the voices wanted him to die and he was telling us goodbye. Because we were afraid for his well being and had never seen this behavior before we contacted the suicidal hotline and they recommended a 5150 hold. This then led him to a psychiatric hospital for a few days.  Sorry this story is soo long winded.  The doctor diagnosed him with depression, bi polar, and schizophrenia. They said he was in mania. He was prescribed and now taking antipsychotic meds and anxiety meds for the past few days. The doctor mentioned that he could have been battling the underlying mental conditions and when his diabetes got out of control it brought forth a condition he already had for years. We had known that he would talk to himself from time to time (most of his adulthood) but never thought anything of it. We would wonder why he would be talking to himself but say he was thinking about his day out loud. 

He’s been home from the hospital after a few days and now he is saying he’s better, no longer hearing voices, and it was all related to the depression and not acknowledging being diagnosed with schizophrenia even though he’s taking this new medicine. Not having much experience with mental disorders  how do we proceed from here?  I am nervous for my family as he’s in the home and find it concerning that someone who went through such a traumatic experience is saying he’s fine. Is this common or is significant issue waiting to happen if this is all bubbling below the surface? Also being on antipsychotic meds is there some difference we should expect?

Express self or relieve stress,1715828165.0,"I feel stressed and depressed and I think it stems from resentment for my wife. Fo the past 13 years she has suffered from anxiety and ocd with obsessive thoughts about “things from the past” that she wont elaborate on. She has finally started to see a therapist and is on new medication. This year has been especially hard as she has become more aggressive , blammed me for agitating her and causing her to be suicidal. She has even threatened to kill herself in front of me and held sharp objects to her wrist. 

For the last 13 years I have been the financial provider (which I dont mind) but I do this because she was really mean and hateful to me when she was stressed from work. I do the majority of the chores, all the cooking and I am expected to bring her food to bed for every meal. She is not physically handicapped but insists it is something I need to do to show love to her. When I ask her to help out a little by serving her own food she threatens to get a job (which she knows causes her to be mean) , tells me to stop cooking for her and becomes really angry an agressive then it turns into a mental roller coaster where I am again the reason for her suicidal ideations. 

I dont mind taking care of her but I feel more like a servant. I work long hours. Serve her. And our sexual relationship is non-existent as in the past 15 years we have maybe had sexual relations 10 times.

"I want to die so badly, but not kill myself.",1715827224.0,"This is my first time posting on reddit, I don’t know why I’m posting this, I don’t know if people care, and I’m scared this will somehow be linked with my reddit account and people I know will know that I have said this.

I am a 17M and I go to a fairly-prestigious private school and take sports where I have to get up at 4:45 am, practice until 7:30, then school from 8:00 to 4:00, then practice again until 6:30 pm, and blah blah blah. 

The point is, for the entirety of my teen life all I have known is work, work, and work. I once said to my parents (I have a complicated relationship with them) that they may work from 9 to 5, but I work from 5 to 9 (which is really 11). 

Life has been hell for the last few years, I have lost all my friends due to speaking out against a sexual assaulter, I have lost all my prestige and skill in my sport due to physiological conditions causing unfathomable levels of pain, and my parents are mentally unstable and take advantage me and make my life a living hell every day.

This, combined with the shitstorm on the horizon that is worrying over college, getting a job, owning a home, and I think I somewhat speak for the rest of my generation when I say this, trying to f survive, I have had nobody and I guess I could say this really turned me on to God, and meditation, and other stuff to try and make swallowing the pill of my existence barely manageable day by day.

When I was 15 I was lucky enough to experience love, and I’m not going to blabber on about the details since you guys probably don’t care. What seemed to be a once in a lifetime experience, especially, from the way I see it, for anyone in my generation, I have looked everywhere to try and have someone who could love me like that, that I so wanted, especially in my time of need.

But I never found it again. Something about women in this generation is deeply repulsing. I don’t know how to explain it, but just all the pornography and sexual stuff on the internet, the fact that women my age post bikini pictures of themselves and constantly hooking up “to the highest bidder” (whoever is richest, has the nicest stuff, whatever) and are doing this for months on months on end sickens me somewhere to the core. My crush the first day I stepped foot in high school, who behaved in such a way that was so polite and refined, has hooked up with her 6th dude now (who is in college) to go to prom with.

In every trial I have gone through in my life, never had the conditions been as dire as the one I am going through now. I do not have friends; I purposefully hide in back corners of libraries and lunchrooms to avoid being ganged up on, and my parents are beyond incompetent. These would be manageable for any teenager, but given the circumstances of the world and the future for us, it isn’t like there is anything concrete or positive that awaits us somewhere out there.

Anyways, the meaning behind the title is that every night, when I am alone and scared over the work of the next day, or what may happen, or whatever, I have developed the unhealthy habit of imagining some blank-faced figure loving me; someone holding me, telling me everything is okay; caressing me in her arms and saying that she will be there for me, that she justifies my existence on this planet.

And then reality hits, in my bed, when nothing is real and it’s all an imagination, and it hurts even more than before. This is a spiral, and it gets so bad that in my dreams “she” comes to me, and when the alarm wakes life’s pain is multiplied by so many degrees. Even the agony my physiological conditions gives me during practice (btw, I still HAVE to practice in agony for colleges, and the job prospects, getting a house, starting a family, and whatever in this chaotic collapsing nation), with its searing and paralyzing pain, is nothing like this.

Anyways, I guess after throwing a hissy fit and vomiting all this text for you to read, I do now have some questions. Do I sacrifice my self dignity and future for someone to possibly take advantage of me, and receiving affection in return? Or do I keep going down this path of misery which I have no idea how much longer I can bear?

Hi,

This is my first time really discussing getting mental health help/talking about what is happening in my life. I am using a throwaway because I don't want to get doxxed.

I am a 20 year old going into my junior year of college in the fall. On paper, I feel like I shouldn't have any reason to have trouble with my mental health. I was raised in a good family, although my parents divorced when I was young, I am in a fraternity, I have friends, I have a long term girlfriend, and I don't ever really have to worry about money thanks to my family.

I have noticed a downturn in my mental health for the past couple of years. In the past I dealt with feeling bad (attributed to my first heartbreak) but never got professional help before. Recently I have been feeling an aching sadness in my chest and stomach that seems to appear out of nowhere. I try to be emotionally intelligent and never hold back my emotions with my friends and family, so I feel like my sadnesses never really have the opportunity to build up and burst. Though in recent times I will get hit with waves of sadness out of nowhere. I feel worthless, I feel like I'm nothing, I feel like I don't deserve to be alive. I know that I shouldn't feel these things and that I AM worth something. I feel like I love myself and I shouldn't change anything about me.

Despite my efforts at trying to keep a positive mindset it always feels like I come back to the same feelings of low self-esteem and self-pity. I cannot keep myself from tearing up in the car and I don't understand what is wrong with my own mind. 95% of the time I feel perfect and on top of the world, I'm blessed to live a fortunate life full of love and good relationships. 5% of the time it feels like the world is crashing down on me and I can't do anything. The feelings aren't extremely severe, but I always have motions of feeling like a nobody and I should hate myself. I hate that I'm a people pleaser, I hate that I can't confront people when I should, I just spiral into a series of negative thoughts and recently this has started to affect other aspects of my life.

Today I started feeling a wave of sadness again and I couldn't even kick it when I went out to dinner with my mom and brother. I just don't understand what is wrong with me. When I feel okay again it seems laughable that I even had those issues. I insist that everything is okay in my life and that everyone goes through ups and downs. I don't know what to do anymore. The sadness hits in waves and seems to be random when it comes in periods. I will go months being okay and then spiral down into bad mental health. I feel like my condition isn't serious enough to warrant a diagnosis of anxiety or depression or anything, but I just feel like shit sometimes.

My brain tries to rationalize it by saying that everyone gets sad, but when I get down and have those feelings of low self-worth I cannot seem to get rid of the nagging voice in my head saying I need help. I haven't talked to my parents about this and I have never been to therapy before. I have talked to my girlfriend a little about it but I don't want to burden her. I am completely lost. I want to emphasize again that 95% of the time when I feel no sadness it literally is laughable that I was ever sad in the first place. I don't understand what is happening. Where do I go from here? I am so scared to talk to my parents about going to therapy. I don't even know how to bring it up. I have been very stoic all of my life and am trying to show my emotions more, but my parents have no idea I've been going through this for the past few years.

Over the past two years, I would say I have had probably had 3 1-2 week spirals of ""going through the motions."" Is this normal? I am lost. When I get down all I know is I feel bad, sometimes it gets to the point where I feel like I don't even deserve to exist, although I know that's not true. Would anybody be able to point me in the direction of what I should do, should I keep going on without getting professional help? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Even now I feel silly for making this post. I don't know why my problems seem so little when I start feeling better. Sorry for the ranting/ramble. I appreciate you all for reading if you make it this far.

I've just realized what my problem is...,1715826087.0,"I've been pretty content with my life overall for a long time, but I've never been just happy, and I think I finally realized why. I don't think I have a personality. I feel like I just copy what everyone else around me likes, or what a lot of people seem to like in general, and just accept that I like those things without actually enjoying them. Most of the time, I'm fine with the things I do, but I want to be more than fine. I want to enjoy things. I used to think I liked playing video games, but those got pretty boring after a while, and playing them now just feels like I'm looking for something engaging to kill time, instead of playing because I enjoy them. I used to think I liked anime, but I've convinced myself it's a bad idea to get into it, just because I know it would waste so much of my life away if I were to (and I know I would) ever get addicted to it. I used to think I liked playing soccer, but other than being mildly more fun than the other things I've described, it's the same story.

Im thinking maybe I need to do a dopamine detox to get back into enjoying life, but how can I do that when I don't even know what to take a detox from. Life seems boring. I still have responsibilities like studying. and preparing for college, but doing something out of necessity without having any positive or negative feelings about it seems bleak as well.

I'm not particularly depressed, but I'm not happy either. I just kind of exist and life on every day. What can I do to fix this?

Cant take it anymore,1715825804.0,"Last night I had a dream where I was in a school, and I saw a girl crying, so i went up to her and gave her a hug and began to comfort her. Next thing i knew, I was in a hospital room sitting on the edge of the bed, the same girl who I guess was my nurse walked up. Long story short parts of her body were invisible (chest, legs, etc) and she said something like ""sorry you cant see those"" and I remember replying with ""I dont care about those, all I want it you"" then I remember being in a strange place with many people my age, and this same girl. I kept asking her to give me and chance, then I began to sing a song to try and impress her, some other guy copied me, so I began to sing a different song (its beginning to look a lot like christmad) but then quickly switch to the song I dont wanna set the world of fire. Then I received a text in which she said she'd said she felt the same about me. I remember holding her and she felt so real, I dont know how to describe the feeling it gave me. I didnt even think about sex or anything like that, I just felt loved. Truly loved, I felt companionship. I woke up clutching my pillow like I usually do and it hit me that it was a dream. The whole day I waiting for the night to come so I can return to my dream, if that even happened. I hardly get dreams like this, if I do its usually a ""luustful"" dream that I try to forgot. I just want to stay in that dream forever... I'm not even 16 and I'm going thru a midlife crisis. It's not even funny the shit I go through.

Sleeping problems,1715825561.0,"Hi all! First off, I don't really know how to explain this properly and It could just be nothing to worry about but for years I've been hearing voices in my head as I'm trying to fall asleep or extremely loud bangs like a bloody bomb has just gone off, enough to make me jump a mile!. They are really sudden and so unexpected. 

The voices can be male and female, usually it's a female voice though and can range from my name being said or someone trying to say something to me, sometimes I can understand what this ""thing"" is trying to say but never remember by the next morning. 

You might say to write it down or why haven't I and tbh it's because I've been having them for so many years I'm really not bothered 'persay' in the voices and what they got to say, so I never feel the need. Tbh in a strange way I find it quite cool but kinda scary at the same time. 

I know about that ""half awake / half asleep hallucinations "" but why does it happen so random-frequently and the really strange thing is...

Why doesn't it happen NOW that I use noise cancelling earplugs?. 

I found this out a few years back because funnily enough...🙄...me girlfriend snores like a sodding trooper! So the only way to sleep properly is alone and with the earplugs in and ever since I've not had a loud...BANG!!! So suddenly and...well... the only shame is the voices, really.  because I don't hear them either anymore. 

It's rather strange I know but when you've had something like this since being a kid and you've always been curious to what it is,.. is it all in my head?, am I loosing the absolute plot?, or is it something from somewhere else? 🤔. 

'Probably the plot one though! 🤣🤣'

I'll leave this one upto you's.

Dealing with INTENSE suicidal ideation.,1715825344.0,I have nobody to talk to right now. My emotions and thoughts are so intense that I'm in tears. I don't know what to do.

Why do resort to hitting myself as a coping mechanism,1715824648.0,"
I am sorry for the post being so all over the place. I had another episode of hitting myself and so I am very upset :/

Whenever I get upset or emotionally unstable (which is often the case) I hit my head or slap myself extremely violently until either my hand or body is bruised. I didn't use to be this bad but I almost wonder if I have hormonal imbalance issues or if I really am mentally extremely ill and I would have to talk to a professional to solve this. 

Is there anyone who was able to get out of self harming tendencies without therapy or drug intervention?

I have been struggling with emotional instability for the past 7 months or so. I have always been an ""over thinker"" and rather emotionally sensitive but the past few months have been especially challenging for me and it has gotten significantly worse in the past two months.

Long story short, although my self esteem has always been very low, recent relationship + family + job issues all kind of blowing up at the same time pushed me to a worse place. 

But the thing is I'm not trying to put the blame on certain bad events that happened in my life—I think I have almost gotten used to negative thinking that regardless of how catastrophic some event is, I know I would choose to do make bad decisions (such as self harm, getting angry at closed ones, etc) because often times I feel like my life is already so fucked up and feel trapped because I am seemingly unable to improve a lot of the things that *I* messed up and just want to stop living life entirely. And then I feel irresponsible and pathetic for not being able to change myself and change my life towards a good direction.

I tried to at first do simple things that actually don't involve reflection of abstract, almost daunting existential questions (such as what is my purpose in life, my goal, what kind of person I am) because frankly I have spent the past seven months being so miserable for who I am. And somehow those grand questions made me feel even more hopeless.

So it started with working out. Eating healthier. Doing music (I very much enjoy playing my instrument) and all those things.

But still, this issue of me having explosive blowups/meltdowns/self harm tendencies are yet to be resolved.

 I almost wonder if I am narcissistic because I can find reasons to hate myself in essentially everything/everyone I see in life and it's almost like I'm hyperfixating on ""how fucked up I am"" more than anything else.

 For example, if my boyfriend is struggling emotionally/mentally with something, and I sense that I cannot make him feel better, instead of just understanding that ""yeah he must really be having a hard time and doesn't really have capacity at the moment to necessarily discuss these with me. I will just provide him support and company"" or something like that, I just drag out all negative events/emotions that happened both within and outside the relationship to feel anger because:

1. I am a worthless girlfriend because I can't make my boyfriend feel better but I make him feel worse
2. I can't even do one thing correctly my life is completely fucked up

So yeah if there was a flow chart to my thought process, all the arrows would just end up at ""my life is fucked up and I'm worthless"" 

Which I think may be narcissistic qualities. I just don't really have a good picture on what kind of reflections could help...

It's essentially ruining my life and also my relationships. My family is abroad and I cannot rely on them nor do I feel relaxed when visiting them. I don't really have friends and my relationship is also at jeopardy  since I have been so emotionally unstable.

TLDR; I have anger issues, I hit myself to release self hate but continues to put me at a deeper hole. I want to live life",99jlj,,False,1ct1ycw,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ct1ycw/why_do_resort_to_hitting_myself_as_a_coping/

So I've just turned 17, Shit felt really slow and enjoyable maybe because I didn't know much of the work back then ever since I was a kid till 2017.  
In 2017, maybe because I got a little more serious in life and started worrying more about my career and also started wasting around 6 hours of my life on the PC playing roblox or watching youtube like every other guy in my class. Maybe that contributed, Or maybe the constant stress that I had about my future like what collage would I go to and shit and the constant stress from the bullies or people that I overfixated on back then COMBINED with the thousands of hours that I wasted on the screen in between 2017 to 2019 made me escape and just make the phase unenjoyable and not so memorable.

And then the infamous 2020 era from 2020 till 2022 left a really shit impact on me, I started indulging in all of the bad habits that you could think of other than substances. Wasting probably around 10+ Hours of my day on the screen consistently between the time period which is probably the main culprit that has caused me to think that time flied past. I got so so used to that phase of mine that I still feel like was just yesterday

I’m stuck in one place while everyone is moving on ,1715813176.0,"Hello. I’m 18m (and autistic).

For the last few years, I’ve tried being as independent as I possibly can. I had a bad upbringing from a broken family and was abused by my stepfamily (who are gone now after my stepdad cheated on my mum when I was 11).

I absolutely hate relying on people, because I was taught from a young age that my anxiety was a burden and it made me unlikeable.

I’m so angry because of how difficult it is to GET help though. I have bad panic attacks, bad anxiety, and depression. I want to be proactive and get better, and I’m willing to put that work in, but the most I’ve been able to get is antidepressants that haven’t helped. I spoke to a doctor today who felt bad for me because he was convinced I needed urgent help but couldn’t really do anything aside from trying to refer me to people (with waiting lists longer than a year).

I feel so angry because I want to be successful. I want to be able to leave the house, get a job. I want to indulge myself in education and get better qualifications. It seems though no matter how hard I try, no matter how hard I push myself again and again, I just cannot do it? I feel like a coward because of this. I’ve been trying to take the bus and leave the house, but I am so scared.

I’m not mentally well enough to get a job, but I’m not actually getting any mental support? It’s such an awful place to be stuck in. Im not waiting for someone to save me, but I’m also aware that I do need professional help. I can’t sit in the car for 10 minutes, or be out of the house for long. 

My friends are all going to university and celebrating together right now (I’m not in school), and I hate that I feel jealous. I’m happy for them, but it feels like they are celebrating everything I can’t do. They are going on vacations and spending time with their families, while I am at home trying to find remote work and failing. I feel so ashamed of myself.

I feel myself spiraling in my body image issues and i'm not sure what to do,1715810822.0,"I'm 19F and am back home for the summer after studying at university for first year. I've always struggled with depression and anxiety and have been diagnosed with both since I was a young teenager. I've only been able to seek treatment for it earlier this year since I moved out of my family home and first year of uni was super stressful. 

One of the biggest stressors in my life in general has always been my body image. As a young kid I was super active and was always really skinny, however around when I hit puberty, my depression began and I withdrew from the world including all the activities I did before. This led to some weight gain in my middle school years though I was always teetering the line between ""healthy"" and ""overweight."" I never faced any judgement or remarks from my peers and I had great friends throughout middle school and high school that significantly made my life much better. 

The worst treatment I got came from my family members. I come from a background where the vast majority of people are really thin and my family members are no different. As a teenager, my extended family would constantly call me names and would talk amongst themselves about how my parents were terrible people for letting me get so ""fat."" This led to my parents repeating these behaviours towards me as well and I recall one time where my mother cried to me because everyone in my extended family thought she was a bad parent and that I made her look like a fool. This behaviour by them was on a daily basis and I even lived with some extended family members so I could never really get out of that environment. I always knew that this treatment was hurtful and wrong, but my family lived in the same area as one another so it was difficult for me to get away. 

I never had a diagnosed ED and I honestly don't think any behaviours I've done are significant enough to even fit the diagnostic criteria (i've tagged this post as such just to be safe but i'm **not** looking for a diagnosis here lol) , however I have always been in cycles where I would eat lots of food to ""spite"" the people calling me names and then restrict my food intake due to guilt. This carried on all the way until I entered university where I was able to finally seek treatment for my other disorders and managed to get a healthier relationship with food.

Being back home, though, sort of sends me back into the same mindset as I was back in middle/high school. My parents have gotten nicer, yes, but they still feel the need to make unnecessary comments about my body even though I've lost a significant amount of weight since they last saw me. I've started going to the gym about 5x a week and have also found myself tracking my calories so I don't eat as much and I also have refused to see any friends back in my hometown as I don't want them to look at me at the moment. Additionally, when I told my mom I started going to the gym, I felt such an immense amount of shame that I don't think I've ever felt before. 

I'm not really sure what's going on, but I don't think this is a very healthy spiral I'm going down on.

I need guidance with college,1716401199.0,"
I finished my first year at college earlier this month and this is the most I’ve ever felt like my life is on auto-pilot. I feel like I have absolutely no control in my life anymore. I wake up, and become a slave to my computer screen for 8+ hours a day doing work for school and for my job. I stay up late every night, when I really just want to go to bed. I used to go to the gym every day, I haven’t gone in months now. I don’t know why, I used to love going to the gym but now the sheer thought of it makes me sick. I have no friends. I have always had difficulty in social scenarios, I hate fraternity dudes so fucking much i refuse to base my social life around people like that, and I have no clue how I am supposed to “find my people” because nobody interacts with me. You might tell me to interact with others, but I simply can’t. Nobody talks to classmates in my lectures, nobody is forming friendships around me, I just can’t do it. I opted out of on campus housing next semester because I can’t stand it. I’m moving into an apartment, but I’m dreading the thought of actually going back in August. This last year has been the saddest year of my life, thinking about doing it three times over again makes me almost want to just end it before I have to see that through. I can’t drop out of college because I have so much anxiety about the future that I feel like I need to at least have a degree to work off of. 

Another thing that is constantly eating away at me is the fact that my family is falling off. I was the youngest kid, now that I’m moved out my family is basically all independent now. There is no more “family time”. We don’t spend time together anymore and this eats away at me, knowing that my time with my parents and my brother is pretty much completely over now. No more family vacations, no more going fishing with dad, no more fighting with my brother, it’s just frightening to think about.

I just feel so lost in my own life. I don’t know what to do anymore I don’t know how to feel like I’m in control again, I don’t know how to make friends in college, I don’t know how to regain my motivation to be alive. Every day that I wake up in college I feel like I am being forced to be alive against my best interest.",Old_Turtle75,,False,1cy6xry,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cy6xry/i_need_guidance_with_college/

The girl (18 F) I (18 M) am in love with abandoned me after being manipulated by my former best friend. How do I move on? ,1716399805.0,"I (18 M) moved to a new city in October 2022 to study film and felt excited about starting fresh. However, I soon became isolated due to my social anxiety. For the first semester, I was completely alone and didn't realize how much it was affecting me. In the second semester, I met Jacob (18 M), Ellie (18 F), and Hannah (18 F) through a group project. We quickly became close friends, spending almost all our time together. We were talking every day and it was the first time anyone shared my (I admit) weird and niece interests that also didn't hated it when I was around. It sounds sad but I wasn't used to not being hated everywhere I went.

Things got complicated when I thought Ellie might be flirting with me. Jacob revealed that he and Ellie were in an open relationship and admitted he once had a crush on me. I then developed feelings for Hannah, who told me she liked me back but was also in love with Jacob for months and nobady knew. I never asked a commitment I promise. I only told her how I felt and asked her on a date. She told my she liked my back, that she wanted to go on the date and processed to kiss me. We She ended it the next day when she decided she couldn't pursue a relationship due to her anxiety and feelings for Jacob.

During the summer, we all went to Hannah's summerhouse. I confessed my feelings to her again, but she told me she lied to me and only enjoyed the flirting and didn't feel anything deeper. This rejection, coupled with the group's distancing, worsened my mental health. I tried giving them space, hoping they would reach out, but they didn't.

When we finally had a confrontation, Jacob accused me of behavior that disrupted the group dynamics, and Ellie and Hannah supported his claims. I felt betrayed and manipulated, realizing later that Jacob had turned the group against me. After trying to reconcile and being ignored, I decided to return to my hometown to escape the situation.

Months have passed, and I remain depressed, unable to move past the loss of my friends. I discovered Jacob continued to speak negatively about me, solidifying my isolation. Despite seeking therapy and support from other friends, I struggle with constant reminders of my past friendships and the betrayal I experienced.

Returning to the city for school, I'm torn between resuming my studies and trying to reconnect with my former friends, especially Hannah. I know I'll likely see them soon, and I'm filled with anxiety and a desperate need for advice on how to find happiness and move forward from this painful chapter in my life.

What should I do?

TL,DR: The girl I'm in love with stopped talking to me along with my 2 best friends. I can't move on and I'm supposed to face them again in school after not seeing them for months. They all lied to me and nothing seem to help.

How do I love someone who suffers from mental illness? ,1716399713.0,"How do I love someone who suffers from mental illness?

For context: I am 18 and male

I met a girl (18) through school (she was at that time in my class and still in my class) back in september last year. She was friendly and kind and we talked during class breaks about anything really. 

Then one month later we went on a city trip with a couple other friends from our class. Everything was fine and we laughed and talked a lot. While we were in the city though she said that she felt emotionally drained because it was mentally challenging for her to go to so many places at once (we went to cafés, book/clothing stores etc.). On the train ride back I jokingly said that I have a crush on her as we were asking each other about being captivated by someone and finding them beautiful etc. She was sitting next to me. We all laughed except her. She said that she didn't hear what I said and didn't get why we were laughing. However, I think she lied to avoid the akward situation of having to sit with someone who just confessed his undying admiration and love for your intelligence, kindness and inner beauty, for the rest of the train ride. The thing is, I also said that I cannot have a romantic relationship with someone that I love. And I asked wether she is bisexual and she said no, so I knew that she was lesbian because her demeanor felt like that.  Everything went fine after that again, we said goodbye to each other and the day came to an end. 

The next day I texted her: what are you doing this weeknd?

And she replied: can you chill a little bit with the texting I find it a little bit unpleasant and annoying

I answered: I'm abnormally sorry. I didn't know you felt like that. Then I'd better not write to you again. Sorry a thousand times. 

I had sent her the Idol soundtrack the morning of the previous day and the Dostoyewski wikipedia entry as we had talked about the show and Dosto. I also said very early in the beginning (september) to her that she looks like Lily Rose Depp and she said that I wasn't the first to point that out. 

Now I think the reason she switched so suddenly was because she most likely thought that the whole lily rose depp/the idol thing was an attempt at flirting with her. But didn't she get that I am not romantically interested in her? I literally said I cannot have sex with someone whom I love. And I admitted to having fallen for her in a admiring/platonic non sexual way. 

After a couple of weeks she wanted to talk to me and accused me of staring at her. Now to be honest I often got lost in thoughts and was day dreaming and looked into her direction during such episodes. I apologised and said that I'll do my best to not look at her again. The next months I avoided her like a plague. I looked everywhere except into her eyes when I had to pass her in class. I switched rooms during breaks. I didn't speak to her. I did that in order for her to feel comfortable. 

In the past few months I started observing a shift in her behaviour towards me. She started being more gentle and kind. She once said 'thank you' when I let her go first in class. She held the door for me thrice and greeted me a couple times.

I was told that she had been in a psychatric clinic before. She herself said that she drank a lot of alcohol during the pandemic. And I have seen her several times already smoking cigarettes in the school yard. Some of my friends speculated that she had gone to parties in the past where she consumed harder drugs (such as LSD but I don't know any details or if this is true at all but I can imagine it easily) which caused her to become mentally unstable/unwell. I also know that she had an eating disorder and was extremly thin when she was younger. 

I have had a great life, with good friends, in a great city and country and everything was fine before I met her. Since our fallout, the love and pity I have for her has been plaguing me and I cannot find rest because of that. 

I love her, I want to be her friend, I want her to be my friend and want us to have a friendship. 

What do I do now? Should I just aproach her and tell her the truth? That the whole lily rose depp/the idol thing wasn't meant to be taken in a flirty way. That I cannot be in a romantic relationship with someone that I love and that I know that she isn't straight? I think that would the best thing to do because it would give her a more objective perspective regarding me and she would have the freedom of choice to decide wether she wants to be friends with me or not. 

What do you think about this? What should I do?

Concerns with a new psychiatrist and Adderall prescription,1716396408.0,"Hello. I've been going throug some mental health issues, such as anxiety, social anxiety, ADD, chronic fatigue and an episode of depression. I've been through different medication trials such as Lexapro, Zoloft, Effexor, Propranolol, Buspirone, Wellbutrin and Adderall. All SSRI's were giving me terrible side effects such as numbness, ED, zombie-like feeling, drowsiness even at the lowest doses. Anxiety medications were making me very sleepy. Wellbutrin was the only thing that helped but was giving me muscle cramps and did not work well for all symptoms. Adderall seemed to be the miracle drug which took most of the symptoms away and allowed me to manage my work and family life with ease. Only issue is that it is not consistent, one day I feel it works and other time I don't feel any change, I've noticed that some generic manufacturers pills work better than others. I had to change my insurance which my provider is out of network with so I found a new doctor.

I had issues with getting an appointment for months, but finally had the visit a few days ago. To start with, it was a virtual visit and 5 people attended it (MD, PA, Scribe, Nurse and some other employee), which made me feel pretty uncomfortable. The doctor was more concentrated about explaining their rules than the talk, she said that I need to have 7 visits to evaluate all issues until I am considered an established patient. She offered Adderall Extended Release, despite me telling her that I've tried it and it was not working as good as the IR version and that I often skip a dose or take it once daily rather than two. She said that I need to take it every day and that the reason for it being inconsistent is that I don't take it daily. She also said that Adderall does not build dependency and does not require increasing the dose. I was normally on 15mg IR but she prescribed 20mg ER. Moreover, when I went into the pharmacy to pick it up, they said that doctor cancelled the prescription. I called the office and was told that in order to get the prescription, I need to sign some controlled substance form and take a urine test. This is the first time I have been asked for this. She also ordered a genetic test saying that she needs to see why am I so sensitive to SSRI's.
Also, she wanted me to take Prozac for anxiety and ADD, saying that it would not have the same side effects as other SSRI's than I've tried. She stated that Prozac is stimulating and works best for anxiety. I repeated a few times that I do not want SSRI's and that I did not have depression episode for a 2 years. She also offered Wellbutrin along with Adderall but I refused taking that many drugs. During the appointment the doctor repeated a few times that they have a holistic approach so why would they want to have me on multiple medications if I already found one which works fine.

1. Is it normal for multiple people attending a visit?  
2. Is the lower dose of ER, instead of normally used higher dose IR Adderall a good approach?  
3. Is Prozac really that different from other SSRI's and should I still give it a try, even if I do not have depression?  
4. Is it normal for the doctor cancelling a prescription and asking for a urine test, if I was on Adderall already for over a year?  
5. Shouldn't the test be done before my visit and prescribing the medication? 

I don't have an issie with taking the test, but there are a lot of other concerns that I am having with this office. Would you recommend looking for another provider?

My friend seems to not know that she has mental health issues. I'm not sure if I'm being a good friend by not telling her. ,1716392071.0,"My (28F) friend (33F) and I have been friends for appr. 5 year. We've met through business. I took a chance and hired her company when she just started the company. We have started to get closer 3 years ago, hanging out more, going out for dinners/parties, or just long phone calls chatting or venting.

When I realised she might be struggling with mental health issues: For the last year there were maybe 5 times I called her if I could pick up something I left in her car or bring her something she forgot at my house, or we've met up at her place to drive to an event together. She always panicked when I asked her if it was okay if I drove over and conveniently she always said that her daughter was just about to go outside so the daughter would get the item/or I'll give her the item while on the phone with my friend. I didn't care about staying in the car because I get that some people need to prepare to receive visitors. 

  
A couple of months ago we plannend a small (4 people) get together with friends which would take place at one of our places. Before I could even offer, my friend offered to host this little party. I asked if she was sure with the last year in mind and she was positive. I thought maybe this was enough time in advance/or that she sorted everything that she wanted out and felt comfortable now. 

Past Sunday we had the get together and I was the first one to arrive. She opend the door excited, I greeted her with a hug and I gave her the flowers and pie I brought. She walked away to her kitchen and I closed the door behind me and there it all started. I closed the door behind me and my hands were all sticky, it felt like honey. I didn't say anything about it and just continued the conversation. I took a couple of steps to remove my shoes ( a cultural thing) but the floor was sticky. When I made my way further into the hall way to tell her that something has spilled I realised the whole floor was sticky, even in the living room. Didn't say anything and just kept my shoes on. She graciosly told me I could take a seat in the living room but the whole couch was (there is no better word to describe it:) dirty. Okay, I have to say that I'm a person that have a fear of germs since I was little but will tough it out when I feel that I'm being rude or too high maintenance. 

Back to the story: I just thought to myself I can just clean my clothing so.. let's ignore it. She had made food she was setting up on a table in the kitchen and when our other friends arrived one of them helped her move the table from the kitchen to the living room infront of the couch. The whole table was smudged with different foods that couldn't come from what we were eating because of the colors. She then brought us wine in a wet glass and apollogized for it being wet because she just washed them. And again smudges of grease. When I wanted to asked if I could dry it first another friend already said it's fine (while having the same smudges). Her sigh of relief made me not say anything. Eventhough the first couple of sips disgusted me after a couple of sips I started to get tipsy (I'm not a big drinker) and ignored the stuff scattered everywhere and the couch and everything. I stayed for a almost 2 hours and said thanks for her hospitality and said I needed to leave a bit early. The other girls did the same and we left. I never wanted to go there again and understood her bringing stuff outside. This also triggered my cleaning at home and I went crazy deep cleaning because I couldn't help to feel dirty. 

  
2 days later I asked if it would be a good time to come get the bag the pie was in, because I threw my debet card and some receipts in the bag when I was buying it (my hands were full at that time) and forgot to take it with me when I left. I thought it would be the same as before me staying in the car and someone bringing it. She invited me in, I politely said it was okay but didn't want to say no after the third time she said come in... 

I followed her to the master she got in bed and under her covers, while continuing the story she started at the front door. So didn't remove my shoes again, because yeah it was still the same. She was walking bare foot and underneath her feet was black before she got into bed. She said, come get in, to you know, have a cozy little girl talk in bed. At this point my heart just broke because I really did not want to get in the bed because I noticed all types of crumbs everywhere, I can't even decribe it. Personally I don't eat in my bed often maybe twice a year or so, and the moment I would feel 1 crumb I'm violently patting the bed to get it out lol. So this for me just looked like hell. I sat on the edge of the bed listening to the story in where she even raised her voice at me because I didn't agree with something she said ( I guess she was passionate about making me understand her pov in that matter). Between us, in that story she was the problem and she just let emotions take over. 

After 20 minutes I tried to wrap it up to leave, she wasn't done venting so I let her finish. After 5 minutes I grabbed my bag and debet card and stood up she still went on, this is when she raised her voice and I just remember thinking ""Love, you really need help"", but couldn't say it while she was in that state because I felt that would be our first fight because I don't respond well to yelling. 

  
It's been a week I want to help her so that she can get out of her depression or whatever this is??? But at the same time I'm just so shocked and disgusted and feel like I need a break from her, which doesn't sound like being a real friend. I don't like gossiping so I didn't speak to the other two friends about any of this, but my mind is blown that they acted like everything was normal and didn't say anything because those two are the most vocal ones! I'm the only one that's more reserved. I would want someone to tell me if there is something wrong when they come over, because I get that you can develope a blind spot for things when you are used to them. But because of her behaviour this past year I'm guessing she already was feeling ashamed and don't want her to feel ashamed again. I'm really torn....

i appreciate my friends dearly but nowadays i just feel uncomfortable around them? i prefer my alone time a lot more these days, isolated from pretty much everyone. i have no problem spending time with my family or relatives at all, so why is it that i’m almost tired of hanging out with my friends?

Please send your suggestions ,1716387554.0,"ISo long story short, Back in December I tried weed for the first time and got a panic attack due to heart beat in ears . Then I somehow thought my heart went through lot of pressure and it may need some rest and hesitated to do some reps due to palpitations. I used to stop exercising whenever I used to feel my heart was pounding ( it happens during exercise right ? ) . Then I got a panic attack all of sudden like my heart started beating fast all of sudden in January and I thought something was wrong and I'm about to die . But no shortness of breath or nothing. Then my dumb ass curiosity brain jumped in and started googling symptoms and it said anxiety and I freaked out after hearing the word anxiety. Like I never thought I will have it and also when I googled Anxiety treatment and it said no cure to anxiety.  So then my thought process was always about anxiety and I developed fear towards mental health illnesses, cardio phobia, depression.

Physical symptoms include: 
Visual noise 
Heart palpitations 
Numb hands ( sometimes the numbness go away) 
Extremely tight scalp and neck
Chest pressure, chest pain 
Internal shaking 
Brain surge ( recently) 



My sleep went to several cycles from waking up at 3 AM and unable to sleep to waking up at 3AM but able to sleep again to having great sleep but vivid dreams .

Feb was okayish , March was horrible, April was a complete brainfog , May is somewhat okay. Good thing is I have my appetite back but irratibility and anger issues are persistent. 

I spent my whole graduation degree broke as fk. I used to hear songs on a cheap earphones  taped with plaster to the wire cuts , having little money, but I was never sad about it because I always knew my potential and my skill and I cracked a job ( currently internship) and got into it. The first month was great then this happened. 

I was really so exhausted of everything happening . Recently I'm aware of evey thought going in my mind and I can sense random words popping as a voice ( not in a schizophrenia level hallucination) but more like a internal monologue and it intensifies when I'm about to sleep after long day and during work . I don't know what to do now . Right now I'm unable to pay for psychiatrist or therapist as I'm doing internship right now and I'm bearly saving anything. 

Everything is happening during my prime time is bothering me a lot . I tried everything to eliminate stress nothing worked and stopped trying and did my routine and stress never stopped. I'm writing all this with chest pain and random muscles twitches .

Is fear of death intuition? Can intuition predict death?,1716384845.0,"

Death anxiety 

I have been experiencing intense death anxiety, which is really scaring me. I am particularly afraid of the upcoming summer holiday and have a persistent fear that I will die on August 22. Whenever I hear about someone passing away, I feel an overwhelming sense that I am going to die, and I constantly imagine scenes of my grave and everyone mourning. These thoughts dominate my mind, and I can't seem to escape them.

I've also developed a fear of the number 11, often interpreting it as a sign that I am going to die. For example, if I see the number 11, I immediately think it means I will die. I am terrified that I might be manifesting my own death or that I somehow have an intuition about it. I don't want to think these thoughts, but they control me. I try to ignore them, but it's incredibly difficult. Sometimes, I feel good and think about how irrational my fears are, but then the anxiety returns, and I start overthinking again.

I keep thinking that everything I do is my last. For example, I worry that this will be the last time I see a film or study a subject. These thoughts are overwhelming and make it hard to enjoy anything. Additionally, I often feel physical sensations like my heart falling into my stomach or a sensation in my right chest as if there's water and something floating inside it.

Whenever I get sick, I tell myself that these are symptoms of death and I'll die .Sometimes I feel tingling sensations in my chest that I fear are signs!

Whenever I remember the past and when I was happy I feel sad and get scared that I'll never be happy like how I was ,because I'll be suffering from death anxiety forever. When people tell me that my thoughts aren't real, I don't get convinced I feel my thoughts, feelings and brain are stronger than me . I want to get convinced but something is stronger than me and like it's telling me ""That's all in vain, U won't get convinced and you'll die"" I'm scared that I'm manifesting my death by talking about it. I don't want to hear and listen all of that! 

I hate the summer season because of the death anxiety. I like winter, but I'm keep telling myself that the winter has gone and it was my last winter and I'll die in summer or when I packed away the winter clothes and took out the summer ones, I felt something said that ""I won't wear them again and I'll die in summer clothes."". I'm tired and scared of that I want to feel relaxed when thinking about these stuff!
 
Whenever I watch a movie, I tell myself that if a particular character dies, it means I'll die too. It feels like something else is saying this, not me, because I try to stop thinking it, but I can't. I want a solution other than seeing a therapist. I want to solve this problem by myself. (As I was writing this, I saw the number 11 on the clock, which made me even more anxious. Why does this happen when I am talking about death?)

I am really scared of dying during the summer holiday, especially on August 22. What if this fear is real? How can I know? What if I have the ability or grace to know my death in advance? When I searched for the meaning of 11 or 111, it said to trust my inner voice and intuition and that I am on the right path. Does that mean my thoughts about death are real?! People tell me not to search, but even if I don't, the idea and the meaning are saved in my mind.

Also, when I am in a car, I tell myself that if I see a car with the number 11, it means I'll die, and when I see it, I feel terrified. The same happens with the number 22 because I'm scared to die on August 22. I am scared that this is intuition.

Moreover, when I hear certain words like ""future,"" ""next year,"" ""2025,"" ""summer,"" ""July,"" ""August,"" ""September,"" ""University,"" etc., I feel suddenly scared and feel something in my stomach, like my brain is waiting to hear these words just to scare me. It's as if these words trigger my anxiety even more. I need some ways to help me other than seeing a therapist.

Based on what you’ve read, do you think my thoughts are a result of anxiety, or are they driven by intuition? Additionally, can intuition actually predict death? I need answers for all of my questions!

The girl (18 F) I (18 M) am in love with abandoned me after being manipulated by my former best friend. How do I move on? ,1716398921.0,"I (18 M) moved to a new city in October 2022 to study film and felt excited about starting fresh. However, I soon became isolated due to my social anxiety. For the first semester, I was completely alone and didn't realize how much it was affecting me. In the second semester, I met Jacob (18 M), Ellie (18 F), and Hannah (18 F) through a group project. We quickly became close friends, spending almost all our time together. We were talking every day and it was the first time anyone shared my (I admit) weird and niece interests that also didn't hated it when I was around. It sounds sad but I wasn't used to not being hated everywhere I went.

Things got complicated when I thought Ellie might be flirting with me. Jacob revealed that he and Ellie were in an open relationship and admitted he once had a crush on me. I then developed feelings for Hannah, who told me she liked me back but was also in love with Jacob for months and nobady knew. I never asked a commitment I promise. I only told her how I felt and asked her on a date. She told my she liked my back, that she wanted to go on the date and processed to kiss me. We She ended it the next day when she decided she couldn't pursue a relationship due to her anxiety and feelings for Jacob.

During the summer, we all went to Hannah's summerhouse. I confessed my feelings to her again, but she told me she lied to me and only enjoyed the flirting and didn't feel anything deeper. This rejection, coupled with the group's distancing, worsened my mental health. I tried giving them space, hoping they would reach out, but they didn't.

When we finally had a confrontation, Jacob accused me of behavior that disrupted the group dynamics, and Ellie and Hannah supported his claims. I felt betrayed and manipulated, realizing later that Jacob had turned the group against me. After trying to reconcile and being ignored, I decided to return to my hometown to escape the situation.

Months have passed, and I remain depressed, unable to move past the loss of my friends. I discovered Jacob continued to speak negatively about me, solidifying my isolation. Despite seeking therapy and support from other friends, I struggle with constant reminders of my past friendships and the betrayal I experienced.

Returning to the city for school, I'm torn between resuming my studies and trying to reconnect with my former friends, especially Hannah. I know I'll likely see them soon, and I'm filled with anxiety and a desperate need for advice on how to find happiness and move forward from this painful chapter in my life.

What should I do?

TL,DR: The girl I'm in love with stopped talking to me along with my 2 best friends. I can't move on and I'm supposed to face them again in school after not seeing them for months. They all lied to me and nothing seem to help.

Schizophrenia - Worried for my sister & inexplicable healing,1716398740.0,"Hello all,

My sister who was a brilliant student until last year is developing a condition that appears to be schizophrenia.  
She smoked weed during Covid lockdown to combat loneliness and that's when i felt a slight shift in her cognitive functions.

This shift is obvious today even though she quit smoking.

1 : She laughs out loud for no reason  
2 : She talks to herself  
3 : She always leaves the room when those things come to her to avoid judgment  
4 : She's bitter now, while she was full of love and life before

I asked her if she's aware of those ""paradoxal laughs"" and she told me ""yes"", and that it's due to solitude.

II :  
She has a strabismus since kid and had to wear glasses her whole life, the strabismus is gone and she doesn't need glasses anymore which is something i can't explain expect if considering a spiritual awakening that came too early (this is a whole other topic and i know i can't discuss those things on Reddit).

When i saw her last week, i didn't recognize her in the eyes, it was like an other person..

**Does schizophrenia change the look you have deep in your eyes?**  
And to those who experience schizophrenia, **how would you like to be helped by a dear one?**

Let's keep this thread healthy, i want no negativity or toxic internet behavior here, the world has enough.

In what lenght are sadistic thoughts normal?,1716398010.0,"Im 18-year-old male, studying at upper secondary/senior high. 

I've started to realize that some fantasies I've had since I've hit the puberty may not be completely normal.

I've never tought this before, but I have machiavellist and mildly sadistic fantasies, which include control over other people, humiliation, and kind of 'posessing' or 'owning' another person, or being spectator for situation where a person gets humiliated in serious way in somewhat involuntary matter. The fantasies are also quite selective on what kind of people are the subject in them. The pleasure I get from them is mostly sexual in it's nature.

I feel bad for having these fantasies, and fantazizing about stuff like that, and I know that doing that kind of things in real life would be very wrong, and lead to severe legal consequenses for me aswell.

Was I a germophobe???,1716396996.0,"While packing my room to move countries, I found a box of Purell products, portable soap, shampoo, body wash, hand sanitizer, Kenalog ointments, and iodine bottles. These items reminded me of a difficult period in my life that I usually try to avoid thinking about. However, I believe it's necessary to confront it as I prepare for a career that once would have overwhelmed me.

When I was 9, I developed a few ""germophobe"" habits after a significant change in my life. I felt compelled to wash my hands and shower whenever I touched something I deemed ""dirty."" This included not just physical objects but also TV shows, movies, music, foods, drinks, and even people. I could only listen to classical music with piano and avoided colourful shows because they made me feel itchy and overwhelmed.

I initially thought I had OCD like my father, but I’m not sure anymore.

During this time, I used iodine and hand sanitizer excessively. After eating or drinking anything other than water, I brushed my teeth obsessively, which damaged them, leading me to eat less, usually only having dinner. By 11, my hair and skin were so dry that I needed medical treatment and therapy. I hated therapy, and Triamcinolone Acetonide felt ""dirty,"" so I didn’t use it properly until my skin started bleeding at 13.

My room had strict cleanliness rules, a specific organisation system, and I cleaned it nightly with numerous products—I'm surprised I never made mustard gas.



Everything changed when I started attending school at 14. My room became cluttered with clothes and trash, I rarely showered unless forced, and my hair became dirty and unkempt. But my skin improved! I got into super stimulating shows and music and began self-harming to cope with the overwhelming social pressures.

Now, at 16, almost 17, I’ve found a better balance. I still struggle with eating during tough times, occasionally going without food for days until a friend notices. Then I’d only eat school lunch and immediately brush my teeth.  But I have always been able to pick myself back up.

I don’t think I have a severe problem anymore, but I recognize that I still struggle with these urges. Considering my future career, I thought it might be good to hear other people's thoughts and experiences.

I think I was verbally and emotionally abused as a kid and I think that childhood abused is why I am the way I am a massive recluse,1716395295.0,"Hello, I'm new to reddit so let me know if I'm doing anything wrong or what, but I am 23m and I think I was verbally and emotionally/mentally abused, and I wanted to see what other people think.

Pretty much for most of my life until I was maybe 19 I think, my memory is kind of fuzzy, I was definitely verbally abused I think, my dad would yell at me and lecture me for half an hour all the time on almost every little thing, sometimes I would go weeks or a month without being yelled at but then an event would come up and I might not of done somthing the way my father liked and so my dad would just yell at me for half an hour. Example, I would be getting ready for a lacrosse game in high school we are playing against a team on the other side of the state so it's a long drive away and I'll forget to pack an extra pair of socks or the socks are not the kind my father thinks I should be wearing for the game, my dad would and did yell at me on multiple occasions for 15 mins to half an hour and during his yelling he would go over what he was yelling at me for then go into detail on every little part of what he was yelling at me for, then reiterate the entire thing multiple times to the point I felt numb throughout my entire body it was emotionally and kind of physically draining and he would do thing all the time, another example would be I was filling out a form for the military, I had to write down all of my past jobs in descending order recent to oldest, outloud to help jog my memory I did not write it down in this order, I just went over all the jobs I've had in the past, and my dad started arguing with me about the order I was saying my jobs in, even though I was not writing it down in that order he started getting more agitated and yelling at me over the fact I that I was going over the jobs outloud in the wrong order it was easier if I recalled them from oldest to newest and during the next half hour he berated me yelled pretty much at the top of his lungs got within inches of my face while yelling I swear he did the hit fake out thing that some people do to try to make people flinch but at that point I was numb inside and out as well as mentally switched off, so I don't really definitively know if that part is remembered correctly. I'm sorry for all the run on sentences. My grammar is really bad, but that those are just a few examples.

Now in my adult life I've pretty much completely cut off my father, and I have 0 friends, I recently moved back in with some family because of how crazy rent is, and I've been addicted to weed for a little over a year I don't go out I don't even try to socialize I'm awkward, I over analyze every little thing, I'm in my head 24/7 to the point that when I do have conversations with others sometimes I'll realize I was not listening to the conversation halfway through , I have a very hard time remembering people's names unless I see then all the time, I show signs of having really strong adhd I pretty much have all the signs honestly, I'm extremely reserved and it feels like normally I don't really have strong emotions, like it feels like everything is only on the surface, like I'm not truly feeling these emotions, and I've been drowning in severe loneliness and it's self inflicted, I've cut myself off from many friends and family because it's too much effort to reply and meet others expectations, pretty much since I started smoking weed and getting addicted to it I've had very little contact with family, and since I work as a security guard that was until recently nightshift besides the person I'm reliving and the person reliving me for my shift I did not talk to another person for months probably close to 5 or 6 months of almost 0 contact with others, and I think it's cause I know I should not be smoking I did not want family and friends to see how far I've fallen.

Consistent Nightmares,1716393191.0,"Hey all, on March 14th, 2024, I (16F) attempted via an OD. I spent 3 days in the emergency and another week and a half in a youth mental ward. This ward followed a strict schedule and had rules like no sharing personal info, no phones, things like that - and understandably so, it was a place to recover and not worry about outside issues. However, during my stay I was diagnosed with dysthymia, or chronic depression. Because of this, my prescription of sertraline was swapped to 20 mg of Prozac nightly. 25 mg of Quetiapine was also added due to the lack of sleep I’d get in the ward and something I continue to rely on since being home. 

Important context I’d like to add is that I never used to have issues with sleeping. I’d fall asleep and stay asleep fine, it only happened at the ward (which I expected) but after being home I have to rely on music and that sleeping pill to have a decent sleep. But since my admission to the ward, I’ve had extremely vivid and realistic nightmares almost every night, even now. Nightmares was something I’d get the odd time before, but they were always about paranormal monsters and what not, I guess the “normal” kind. These recent ones have been all extremely gruesome tragedies involving family and friends and even just non important characters. I also don’t wake up in a cold sweat shaking or anything, I just remember them when I wake up and kinda think, “oh, that was a little brutal, I wonder why I had that.”

The point is - could this be a side effect of my medication or is it just another part of me that changed after my attempt? Is it my brain like subconsciously processing my near death or is it just nothing at all? This is something I also plan on bringing up with my doctor and therapist the next time I see them, just asking here to see if anybody relates or any outside opinions.

How should I decide if psychiatric help is the best decision? (M25),1716391355.0,"Here's my backstory:

I never had problems learning any sort of topic growing up. Before I started attending elementary school my dad told me I could name any American sports teams if you just gave me the type of sport and city. I breezed through elementary school and had no problems making friends, however 5th grade was when my life started to take a turn. My mother had passed at the time, however I'm not sure if it was significant.

I remember when going through middle and high school, simple issues would aggravate me and I became less social. I always thought about scenarios in my head instead of actually going through with it (such as if I were to talk to this person, how would the interaction go, etc.) Any mathematic related classes were incredibly difficult. I felt less motivated to study and when I would get home, I would sink myself into video games. I still managed to not fail a grade and get my high school diploma.

In regards to high school specifically, I took three Spanish classes (language was a necessity to graduate) and despite passing the first two and failing the third (only needed 2 to pass), I still can't even hold a simple conversation in Spanish to this day.

After high school, for a few years I attended community College, and after failing so many classes one of my friends I met through one of the classes provided me with a job opportunity at a fast food place. This was when I decided to stop attending classes and start working to get experience.

I would say this was the most eye opening experience for me. I was taught how to basically do everything from the front to the back. My friend from my class who referred me was considered one of the best employees in the area and would even run errands for the managers. I guess they had high hopes for me, because I would constantly cycle from handling food orders to cleaning in the back. I thought the work was hard but at the end of the day I felt I had been doing a decent job and could keep up with everything. I thought I never really got on anyone else's nerves and was friends with a few of the managers. That's when I heard from one of my friends about some gossip from the general manager and one of her closer managers (none that I was friends with) that I was consistently the slowest worker in the entire staff and how they thought I had mental issues. During days where I worked with the general manager, she would just tell me I needed to be faster when working with food but never say to my face the stuff I heard. It was disheartening to hear this because I felt like I was working my ass off every day. (This would become a trend with the next few jobs I worked after, which is why I'm making this post now.)
Eventually I put in my two weeks notice and requested some days off, but the manager still put me on the shift so I decided to quit on the spot.

The next job I worked at was a local family run cafe so I thought I would fare better, little did I know it would be much worse. The first day I was put on cleaning dishes and instantly told at the end of the day that I was not working fast enough. I worked for a little bit over a year and I still got berated for not working fast enough. I would constantly be in pain as the scrubs would numb my hands and cut into them. Even when I put my mind towards getting better at cleaning dishes quicker, the management would always take dishes out of the dryer and show me that they were not cleaned properly, such as oil still sticking to utensils. Eventually it would either go back and forth, some days I am not fast enough, and some days I try to rush everything and there would still be unclean dishes; I never had a day where I could accomplish both. That was the first time I thought I felt there was something wrong with me. I started to doubt myself and wonder why I couldn't work fast and properly? Eventually I was let go and lived off unemployment benefits for a while.

Eventually, I was hired for a job to just manage a small store, I just had to handle transactions, occasionally restocking drinks, and occasionally sweeping the floor. Because of the nature of the job, there were times where the job was monotonous with nothing happening and I just watched TV for a majority of the day. I'd hear from other employees about how lazy I was from the management who could watch the security cameras from their phone, but I felt there was only so many times I could do the same three things. 

Fast forward to now, I've been working an office job for a little under two years and I can work at a pace that's comfortable to me. My coworkers tell me from time to time that I have weird tendencies and the way I approach things is not normal, which is something that doesn't really bother me. I usually have to explain my reasoning as to the way I do things, but they still don't understand. At the end of the day, they're still the nicest coworkers I've worked with. The manager is a mom and she tends to give us a lot of advice. She's more upfront about things I do and my flaws but not in a way to discourage me. One thing she does say is that I tend to not take things seriously and advice I'm given tends to go in one ear and out. I've begun to notice that now, that despite the advice I'm given, I tend to do things in a way that is more comfortable to me. I feel as though when I take in information, I need to apply it at the time I receive it or I won't be able to remember, as I tend to get caught up in other things. Lately the idea of this has started to stress me out.

Mental illness or something physically wrong after falling and getting hurt?,1716389434.0," For context im in my early twenties now. Back and 2019 i was on vacation riding an electric scooter and decided it would be fun to do some tricks on it. I ended up falling and hitting my shin very hard. I am fairly certain i did not hit my head since i didnt have any bumps and someone i was riding with did not see me hit it. At this point my shin is really banged up so we decided to ride back to where we were staying. On the ride back on the bumpy road, i almost black out multiple times and have to sit down. This  only occured when my legs were locked sending the bumps directly through my body. To avoid this i bent my legs and the blackouts went away.

For the rest of the trip i was in a slight state of dp/dr. Once we returned home, i would continue to have episodes of dp/dr. Sometimes they would last a couple days and other times it would last months. In 2022 I eventually began to experience mood swings, dullness, and feeling dark. After a few weeks of this i went to a doctor and they started me on some antidepressants. 

My “depression” symptoms have gotten better, only having occasional and very minor mood swings, but i still feel kind of off and not normal. Sometimes i feel like i have the very slightest bit of spinning and dizziness. I also sometimes feel like my head is not sitting on my shoulders correctly. Like it should be turned ever so slightly to the left or right but i can never get it to a state of comfort. I do not have any physical discomfort from this, it feels like only a mental thing.

Please let me know if you have any ideas on what this could be. Could it be something physically wrong or is it mostly likely from the trauma. Thanks!

I (23M) have come to the conclusion that this is it for me. I've come to an impasse in which i feel i'm trspoed in the nothingness of now, amd only can think of is the mistakes of the past.

I've tried therapy, but it's done nothing to me more than a quick relief as i'm able to vocalize my thoughts, but i admit that since i'm unable to hear what i want to hear, it ends up in deaf ears.

Is not that i don't want to change or feel better, is just that i refuse to Settle for the life I have, when I know there are better options out there which are out of my reach, or that now, at my age, i feel i can't enjoy the same way that i would've in previous times if i was younger and wiser.

I would've wished to attend a better looking high school, tty and make friends, have another lifestyle in a country where i could feel safe and wouldn't have to walk thw street with eyes behind my back. A place where i could feel free.

I would've wished to have a more stable family, a nice mother and father, maybe a brother or sister i could rely on; i would've wished to learn to tske better decisions when i was young so my hardships would be Non-existent; i wish i was more masculine, less weak, less of a wuzz, be better for my family and myself, someone you could look up to; i wish i was wiser and smarter, i wish i was more attractive, i wish i was taller, i wish i could see me as more valuable as a human; i wish i had friends, people close to me, people i could call my brothers, people i could rely on... i wish i could've experienced more of life than what i'm doing now

I would've wished to just... Have a different better life.
This resentment have escalated to a point i deliberately started attacking someone online, making insulting racial slurs to the person, just because of the idea of them having the life i want, and even scarier than that, is the fact i don't regret any of that stuff: i deeply feel it in my heart and wish for that to hapoen to that person, just because of the same thing: living the lifestyle i wish i had. I hate and fear this oart of myself, but i can't outrun it

Because of this I was having trouble with deciding whether I should post this here or on a dating advice page. Ultimately, I know that the advice I would be given would be so find help so I'm starting here just as a mean of getting my words out of my head until my next therapy appointment. 

Anyway, I'll give a bit of an explanation on things just for context. I now realize that I had been treating her badly here and there and looking back they were for no actual good reason. Getting upset about things that don't matter, being annoyed about things that I should have been happy about. I'm hindsight, I hate how I was acting.

This break up has shown me that I am in a pattern of ejecting from relationships and making up reasons why they should end whenever they get too serious, and I'm so fucking sad about it right now because me and her were so great together. We were going to get married. 

What spurred me to make this post was a tiktok that popped up on my fyp yesterday. It spoke to me directly. I had no idea what I was doing is apparently a very known thing.

Whether this is true or not, I'm not sure. I'm going to show it to my therapist and talk to him about it whenever I'm able. 

I guess I don't have a purpose to this post. I'm just so fucking sad that I ruined what could have been an amazing thing. I want to change and I need to figure out how.

Cannot deal with my guilt and fear,1716379307.0,"I've been talking with someone new recently, and our conversations have turned to sexting. Not all the time, but it's becoming a regular occurrence now. It feels nice in the moment, and I like making him feel good. However, we've met a few times casually, after which we started sexting. 

Now, he's going to come see me in a few days and take me out for a ride. Obviously, he wants to hook up, but I've never had any experience. I've never been in a relationship. I always imagined my first time to be with someone I really liked, even loved. Now, I'm getting FOMO, and he's good-looking, smart, and nice to talk too. Completely my type, except that I don't like him that much yet, it's too soon, and he doesn't seem like he wants a serious relationship from me.

I really don't want to have sex with him, but now it feels like I have to. I do think he'll accept it if I tell him I don't want to, but I feel like it's my fault for getting him excited. Now, I feel disgusting after sexting, and I've started to slap myself. Hard. I just slap myself and cry, and repeat until I get tired or it becomes too painful. I used to cut myself a few years ago, but I'm scared of the burning pain and the blood now, so slapping is much easier for me. 

In a few more days, I'm going to lose my virginity to him. I feel scared, disgusted and disappointed at myself. It's not his fault, I should be honest with him, but I can't bring myself to do it. Maybe because I think I'll offend him and lose contact, or he might actually become violent. The only things I feel like I can do right now is punish myself, and go satisfy him, no matter how I feel about it. I don't think I'll be the same anymore.

ofc, all of this makes it kind of difficult to do things like look in the mirror, talk to people,  really have a body at all. i'm pretty sure im some kind of trans, but thinking about that involves some kind of transition goal, which involves thinking about how you want to look.

i don’t know what’s wrong with me,1716377604.0,"all my life, all i wanted to have is what other people have and be like other people are. why did the other kids have more friends? why did i only have fake friends? i never wished for anything else, but every time i had the chance to change something, i blew it and i still do, even though i am almost 19. 
i got into my dream college, it was totally unexpected and i was incredibly proud of myself and looking forward to it and now i dread going there and i am stressed everyday about a 12 page essay that i have to turn in in a month, but i can’t bring myself to start writing it. i know that if i would start writing, i’d be less stressed, but i can’t physically and mentally bring myself to do it. i just don’t understand why. i want to be good in college, i want to be someone special, but then why do i ruin it for myself every time? when i started college two months ago, i hoped so much that i would make friends, who i would hang out with beyond college and there are so many cool people there that i WOULD HAVE gotten along with, but out of nowhere, in the first few days- they all became friends and i have no one except short conversations with the same girl about school topics. 

i don’t know what’s wrong with me, i want to change so badly, i used to think that i loved myself, but there are just so many things wrong with me. it makes me realize that all that time i loved myself and thought what i was doing is good for me was just me denying the obvious fact that i am a loser and that i hate myself so much that i apparently don’t even want good things happening to me. 

i am so sick of everything. i can’t even really bring myself to hang out with my old friends (i only have two). they’re great and i always have a good time hanging out with them, but the whole process drains me so much. like going to the mall and stuff. being where a lot of people are and just having to engage in social situations DRAINS me. 
on one hand i wish that i would hang out with them more, but then when it’s time to do so, i just want to stay in bed. 
every time there are partys in college, i want to go, but then i don’t because it overwhelms me.

i want so many things to happen for me. i want to do a semester abroad next year, that’s my biggest wish, but i know that I CANT. i won’t be able to handle it, i can’t even order my own food at the restaurant, i can’t even hold basic conversations. i go completely mute in certain situations, when i want to say so many things, but my body stops me. i can’t live abroad by myself. i can’t even get out of bed most days, i won’t be able to take care of my own household and i need days or weeks preparation to do simple tasks, because i lack motivation. 

i can’t do this any longer. i’m not gonna kill myself, but i just don’t know what to do. this is no life. i am sad for myself that i can’t be the person who i want to be and i don’t even know why.

can somebody tell me what’s wrong with me because i need change. i can’t do this any longer. ",reneethedinosaur,,False,1cxy0k8,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cxy0k8/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/
"I am 20 and none of my doctors care about me, dont know what to do to get help, not sure if i want help",1716373299.0,"I ve been suicidal since 12, made my first serius attempt at 14. been shamed for being depressed by my family and told that noone should know about it. Got addicted to alcohol, nicotine and pills. Never meant to live above the age of 18. at 17 got high and drunk to the point that i got ambulance and fire rescue and cops called. woke up at hospital and got admitted to psychiatrict after.  last year i ve been in psychward

now iam trying to get better, got sober but i am still not doing good mentally, in fact for the last months i ve been getting worse.

my father left after i publicly stated my mental health  and issued court date to get rid of me (paying for me and denying my existence)rest of my family acts like they dont know me, crossing road when they see me or taking pictures of me and claiming that i am doing something illegal, they really care what others think about them and are ready to backstab anyone to better their reputation.

my mother is denying that i have issues and acting like everything is ok, i try to talk to her but she dismisses me. she tells my doctors that i am making stuff up, going as much as calling them in my name and letting them known and giving papers i didn't consent to be given. getting me appointments to get blood samples because its a virus not a mental thing. she tried to read bible verses when i asked to talk to her about my problem and when asked she just started screaming it louder, ended up putting bible stuff in my room even tho i told her i need medical help. she often screams at me to kill myself and that her life is my fault. and then goes back to normal like nothing happened. but never apologises

my teachers yell at me when i get sick from medication that i got prescribe and make me fail test that dont exist (none of other students got a grade for it) even tho i was in hospital because i was vomiting blood.

  
now to my doctors 

my psychiatrist ...  he wont let me see other doctors because ""you arent depressed  enough  to be sure"" and then i spiral to suicidal thoughts and ""i wont let you see that doctor because you need medical help"" then i spent weeks in psychward only to receive none treatment and be  told "" he is to give medications and not to listen to my mental health problems"". i wasnt allowed to leave and got  food i am allergic only to be yelled by staff that i am making stuff up and to EAT IT and refusing to give me other food. 

my psychologist want to talk to me, but only when i am doing good mentally and to call before to cancel when i am breaking down. she dont understand stuff i tell her and doesnt help me when i need it. when i tell her this is the issue and a fell uncomfortable she tells me not to care. that is all she told me. i wanna kill myself because teachers are abusive towards me and feel like this is going to happen in future in my job and it did happen, my previous boss abused me sexually and ...then.... she tells me... not to care about others and sorry that i went thou that but that is life.

none of my doctors take me seriously and act like i am a joke, been begging them for help for 5 years but noone hears me and just bounce me from one doctor to another when they get bored of me.

i am really thinking about it, got everything planed out just waiting for people to drop their guard.

haven been to school in 3 weeks and i cant leave my apartment, been sleeping all days and nights and hurting myself, not eating and slowly cutting of people starting to get paranoid and abusing sleeping pills. I think this year is it. no purpose. no hope. and none care. i am only a burden to people. just posting this into endless echo, i am not excepting help nor that anyone will read this. all my life i wanted to be seen for who i am , learned the hard way this world isnt for everyone and just wishing to never be born isnt enough.

only thing keeping me alive is that i dont want to leave my dog with my mother.

How do you deal with thought that make you feel like a bad person?,1716368456.0,"**I COULD ONLY ADD ONE FLAIR BUT PLEASE NOTE THAT  I WILL MENTION SUICIDE AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS IN THIS POST**  
--  
  
Hello everyone - I'm new to the sub and on an alt account, so apologies if I break any rules. Mods, feel free to correct me or delete my post.

--

I probably just need to vent, but here goes.   
As the title says, I need advice on how to deal with thoughts instead of letting them rot in my brain.

To preface, and to give context, I'm a trans man, in my 40s, I've been diagnosed with anxiety, cyclothymia, and ADHD. I have trauma related to childhood psychological abuse and I also suspect I have BPD but I have impostor syndrome and I don't want to waste my psychiatrist's time. Yes, I'm in therapy, I have a psychiatrist, and I'm medicated.

I'm European and I recently moved to a different country to live with  my GF. She is also trans, probably has bipolar, anxiety, depression, a TEXTBOOK case of ADHD (think ""stereotypical PSA symptoms""), and severe childhood trauma related to physical and psychological abuse and the suicide of a close family member. She also has a psychiatrist, a therapist, and is medicated.

We were in a LDR, and I moved here to be with her because she was extremely suicidal and a danger to herself, and I couldn't deal with the stress of knowing that it would take me 9 hours on a train to get to her if something happened. I wanted to help her, keep her alive in any way I could. I spent the last 6 months on edge, whipping out my phone every time she texted me, getting panicky at every ""I want to die"", feeling my stomach sink every time I got home in the evening and the lights were off, receiving alarmed texts from her friends, sometimes walking with her to her work so she wouldn't jump on the train tracks. 

She has a new psych and a new cocktail of meds, and she is been doing considerably better lately. I'm finally relaxing a little, but I'm constantly on alert for any signs that it's getting bad again.

The point of the post is that I have EXTREME RSD. It's honestly debilitating at times. All it takes is for someone I even slightly care about to give me a curt answer or be distracted when I'm talking to them, and I will immediately spiral really badly. I'm also an emotional amplifier, so if someone in the vicinity is depressed, or angry, I'll pick up their mood like a tuning fork.

As you can imagine, given the cocktail of mental illnesses in the household, this is at times problematic. My GF is the kind of person who wants to be left alone when upset, and obviously it triggers my RDS big time, so I get upset, snap at her, she snaps at me and we end up giving each other the cold shoulder (that is one of my triggers). 

When this happens, I tend to go places in my mind, and sometimes I just can't get those thoughts out of my head. I don't have intrusive thoughts in the proper sense of the word, (not in these particular cases, that's an entirely different can of worms), I just get extremely petty, in a way that makes me feel like a literal piece of sh-t. I don't voice any of these thoughts because I'm an adult and not a kindergartener, but they stay there and rot.

Latest example: Yesterday we both had a stressful day. We both needed to go to our GP, we had some furniture delivered at home, work and stuff. Nothing major, but the fuses were short. After dinner, she started playing a game and hyperfocused on it, and when I asked her if she wanted to do something together she said yes and then kept playing. I would talk to her and I would get a ""huh?"" with a 30 seconds lag. That obviously got me into RSD big time. I made a snarky remark - something like ""stop making that sound \[as a response when I talk to you\], you know I don't like it even if it's the only word you direct at me in the span of hours"" - and she hit me with ""I think a friend of mine committed suicide. I have been dissociating for a while."" 

Obviously, I felt like crap for being self-absorbed, and offered help, comfort or anything she needed. But she just kept playing. I asked her if she wanted a hug or something, and she said no. More RSD for me. Well I kept everything to myself, went to brush my teeth and tried to sleep, while she completely ignored my presence (did I mention I have severe RSD?).

Now, this is what makes me feel like a horrible person. Please keep in mind: none of these thoughts has been voiced, because I'm an adult and because this kind of thing is part of the abuse I received as a child and I don't want to inflict it on someone else.

Her being depressed and having hopeless thoughts makes me panic because I don't want to go back to how things were two months ago, and that adds to my nerves and short fuse.

My first thought was ""well maybe I should attempt suicide too, so perhaps I would get some attention."". Second: ""She keeps saying she has no friends but apparently that's not true"". Third: ""I got days off from work to spend time together (my job makes me severely suicidal and is giving me physical symptoms) and now they're wasted"". Fourth ""GF was doing so well lately and now everything is ruined"". And so on and so forth. This is not the first time I have this kind of shitty, passive-aggressive thoughts, and not voicing them in any way makes them rot, and it becomes as cycle of endless shittiness. 

I have a bunch of other examples, this is only the most recent. Sometimes it's just stupid stuff i get hung up on more than would be reasonable, sometimes it's bigger stuff like this. But it keeps happening.

So, my question is: how to deal with this kind of thoughts? They feel like they're not mine, they just pop up uninvited and sit there festering, and I can't stop dwelling on them. How to get them out so they don't poison me or my relationships or the people I love? 

I know I come across as an entitled brat in this post, believe me, I know and that's exactly how I feel. I know I'm making it all about myself and that I'm an asshole, and that I'm not in the right here. I just want suggestions on how to get this poison out of my system, or at least cope with it.

(Yes I talk about this with my therapist, but it's not like I can call her every time it happens or I'd pay her kids' college fund).

How can I deal with recurrent trauma?,1716368209.0,"I grew up in a family with financial struggles. As I was very gifted it was never a problem to pass school tests and please everyone but I never developed a my capacity for being responsible and consistent. 
Then, when I was still studying mechatronics and had an apprenticeship/internship at a startup right when the COVID-19 pandemic started. They trusted me but I really let them down.
During that time and after I failed many, I failed myself, I've tried to come back and fix my life but it always falls back to a chaotic state.
I have a certain passion for piano performance but then stuff happens and I'm left without my tools and I go through forgetting all that I learned or relearned for months or years.
I struggle with depression and insomnia too, and I've been on and off antidepressants, but my life always ends up spiraling down and I'm left feeling as a waste of economical resources, since I can't sustain myself. And with the piano situation and losing everything I love it feels like I die every year or sometimes even more times a year.
Besides the core of my family, who never understood how I felt or what I liked and just loved me, I don't have any close relations and it's exhausting to live through every new day.
I'd really like to get to a time where I have enough money not to live, and maybe getting rid of my chemical imbalances forever and never to experience those deaths again. I often fantasize after all these heavy years with just dying and part of me wants a solution and I acknowledge it's a tough challenge after everything not to be a magnet for disaster.

Would appreciate a little advice,1716366647.0,"I've always been an anxious person - as long as I can remember my baseline response to most things has been anxiety and overthinking. Over the last 6 months - 1 year however I think my mental health has taken a turn towards depression. Whenever I do something which I don't like I absolutely crumble internally. An example of this was a couple of months ago when I failed my first attempt at a driving practical test. I ended up cutting myself, lying in bed the entire day unable to think about anything other than harming myself and how I would kill myself, when I am fully aware that in reality failing your drivers test is a completely normal thing which if anything, the majority of people do. I just couldn't see it that way at the time, I felt like a complete and utter failure. 

I don't feel like that all the time. For most of the time (maybe as high as 80%) I feel if anything, really good. Just sometimes when I'm feeling low - it's REALLY low. I constantly think about how I'd kill myself - I remember a few weeks ago literally searching up the height of my local bridge and figuring out if it would be enough to kill me. I don't, however, think I would actually go through with it. The thought of leaving my family and friends with that burden is pretty unbearable. I'm also scared of the idea of death - pretty ironic I guess. 

I have already been to counselling for around 9 months when I was 18. It was useful and I understood the ideas he was giving me (CBT therapy) but overall I don't think it helped a huge amount. He said what I do he would label as 'catastrophising'. Taking small things in my life and mentally blowing them way out of proportion so they hang over me like some kind of cloud - unable to think about anything else.

Some extra context - I'm a male, 21, started university two years ago (one year left) and I've been on 50mg of sertraline daily for around \~2 months now. I think the reason I've posted is just to rant a little - I have told literally nobody aside from the GP who prescribed me the medication about anything more extreme than ""I have anxiety"". Friends have seen the cuts I made on myself but I just brushed it off as something I got whilst drunk on a night out. 

I'd just like a little advice from somebody who has had a similar experience rather than somebody who is just talking at me about techniques I'm too self-critical to believe would work.

Bad breakup,1716364049.0,"There is a lot to this story that I'm not sure I want to post online as it is not related to me and my mental health, but has affected the decision that does relate to my mental health. Anyway here we go.

Me (m24) and my now ex girlfriend (23) broke up Sunday after being together for almost 4 years. We have 2 kids together (6 & 2) while the oldest is not biologically mine I still claim her as my own and she calls me dad (I let her choose never made it an issue as I come from a split home and never called my step dad ""dad"" and step mom ""mom""). 

After a weekend of being by herself for a pool tournament my ex comes home and tells me she wants to separate as her mental state does not allow her to live up to her expectations and she feels like that's unfair to me. She wants to solver mental problems on her own (in a sense of being in control I'm assuming) to proce she can deal with her past.

Here's where my mental state comes into play. Not having spotted any signs this was coming and being her support for the last 4/5 years and wanting to help with her issues, I feel blindsided and incredibly upset. I've tried to ask her to change her mind and see if we can work it out together in making her feel in control. She does not want to hear it, eventho you can tell by the way she acts she's incredibly unsure this is the right move. 

I do want to respect her whish in her being able to overcome her stuff. However, I was ready to propose to her and now having to figure out parenting, living space and transportation has got me incredibly stressed and anxious and sad.

I want to hold on to this sliver of hope that when she does find peace in her head..we can give it another shot. It's the only thing keeping me alive besides the kids. It's probably misguided but that's where my head is, wanting to go back, fix it, pretend this never happened. My panic attacks have returned as well, the last one I've had prior to these has been 2018, now I'm on attack number 8 in less than 3 days.

He also mailed me a paper with red text scribbling slut over and over on it. Im honestly just really scared for my safety and Im scared I’m going to do something to myself that cant be undone. Ive already had a lot of suicidal thoughts bc of my nsfw pics/vids being posted online and I’ve started cutting myself a lot. I always fantasise about ending it all bc at least id be left alone then.

36 years old stuck with unknown mental issues,1716360310.0,"**It's a long story but please don't skip.**  
I am 36 years old male and lived my 34 years in a south Asian country. I probably have autism or social skill disorder which has never been diagnosed as mental health doesn't get that much importance back home. When I was a teenager I was bullied and abused a lot by my parents. Especially my mother would always say horrible things to me such as ugly, how a girl wouldn't even talk to me, beast. Now, I was a person with low emotional intelligence who couldn't overcome the abuse with logic and I refused to accept what they were saying. Honestly, I am ugly but not some deformed ugly just below average. I started to create a bubble thinking I was handsome and would avoid anything that would break my delusion. I avoided confronting my parents fearing they would call me ugly again, avoided arguing with people in case they commented on my look, and avoided talking to a girl let alone trying to flirt because a girl once refused to have a conversation with me. I didn't make eye contact with women fearing their reaction would break my delusion. Gradually, I started to create two forms of myself, one is handsome and another one is ugly. Any positive reaction from a person or woman makes me feel handsome and would brighten my day and I feel like a model or something. Any denial or disgusted look would immediately make me feel ugly, I get depressed, not want to live anymore. This has been going on and off for my whole life, I would try everything to be in the handsome state. It's a constant loop, you feel handsome and then feel hideous. in the last few years, I saw many YouTube (God bless the creator) videos about accepting one's look, and philosophy and finally, I started to realize I have mental issues and there are many things beyond look. But Oh my dear God, I still can't break completely free of the loop. No matter how much I reason with my mind, how much I watch motivational videos I can't control it. I want to accept and be happy with however I look but I can't. Although, the severity is lesser but its still there making me feel devastated. I still don't know what this horrible illness is called but I live in a North American country now and I would be glad to seek help to break out of this mental hell. Believe me, death is less painful than this jigsaw shit I am going through.",imran_imu,,False,1cxtvr8,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cxtvr8/36_years_old_stuck_with_unknown_mental_issues/

20M. I have no ambitions in life and I feel completely worthless.,1716356863.0,"Since I became an early teen (about 13 yrs old) I started leading a destructive way of life, mainly because at that time, I delved deep into the internet, as I had no real friends and hanging out with mom became boring.  While school was helping me socialise and keep my brain capabilities on the level, I never had real friends there. I had pals with whom I communicated quite a lot, but oddly enough, I never hanged out with them outside of school. I don't know if it could be classified as being an outcast. As years went on, some moved out, some went to different schools. Then, we graduated, and I lost them all. I also was spoiled rotten by mom, as she was doing everything for me, even most of my homework, and I never got used to actually working or doing anything for myself. My crowning achievement was being the best at English in my Russian school. All that combined with constant destructive habits, such as gaming, sitting at home, eating junk food, and overall enormous amounts of procrastination, and you could say that all I did in my teen years was to destroy myself. I still do. Now, I am a 20 years old male. I have no internal will to better myself, nor to do something besides sit on my behind all day. I have absolute zero social skills, extreme social anxiety (I'd probably be afraid to ask someone on the street for the time), and I have literally no one to talk to besides my mom. I do study at the university, but I am so appalled by the idea of work, that I miss most of the lessons. I'll probably get kicked out this year. For everything I listed above, I hate myself. Extremely. I understand it's my own fault. I have a lot more possibilities than others. But I don't use them. I do realize this is no right way to live, and I want to change. But I can't make myself, no matter what. I don't know why I'm writing this, I guess I'm venting for the most part, but I also want to hear people's outlook on my situation. I realize I'm a complete coward, incel, and many other shameful things. I have yet to encounter a person as miserable as myself, but at least I realize that. Not that it helped me.

Ruminating on a hurt and angry event,1716353954.0,"I could not stop myself from recalling an event from more than half a year ago.

I was drawn into a mouth fight by a guy (Alex) over a dinner with ex-colleagues of 2 women and 3 men.

Alex and I had a history of him constantly treating me like dirt among friends or when we are 1 to 1. I decided to start standing up for myself and be nasty back at him and I guess he was picking that up hence during this particular dinner, he was constantly putting me in a spot and probing me about private details about my new house that I dont feel comfortable sharing and I had already said I refused to share.

I got angry and questioned him back the exact same way about his newly bought house and he immediately played victim saying that I exposed something that no one at the table knew. He was reframing that this was my fault.

Next, he triggered me even further and threatened to expose something else of me, leaving things half-said. But I did him one better and reveal it myself and continue to expose that he had been sleeping with a woman over that the table.

That pissed off the woman and started questioning my opinion of woman like her, trying me make me look like a fool. Prior to this, the woman was still trying to keep things under control by trying to speak up for me and keep Alex's disrespectful behavior in control. Once the truth was out, she switched side.

Needless to say, I stopped hanging out with them but they still continue on and made it seemed like I am the bad guy like they were oblivious to Alex's trashy side because they weren't treated badly by him.

I feel unjust and was manipulated into a fight with Alex. I feel that the bystanders are extremely dumb to see it. I blame myself for not well-prepared and not having enough wits to fight with Alex. I also blamed myself for hanging out with people that treat me bad. I feel useless and angry.

I have been really passive my whole life for how I choose my friends. I recognized the red flags earlier on but continue to hang out with them. I dont consciously choose/remove friends despite recognizing those red flags. This is something I need to improve on in the future.

But I feel miserable and frustrated whenever I recall this event. This event really affects my mood everytime. I hope to step out of this cycle and hope someone who understand what I am going through can help me.

I feel nothing. I am nothing. ,1716341838.0,"
Over the course of around a year, I've slowly stopped being interested in things and caring about them. When I first noticed it, I misplaced 20 bucks, which was a lot to me at the time. I found out I lost it, and looked around for a bit before giving up and deciding I didn't care. It's simple, but that's what opened my eyes and revealed the way I am for the first time. 

I stopped caring about school. I had a consistent 4.0 for years, and received an award for being among the highest performers in the school last year. This year, I'm lucky to get an A in my classes, however, I maintain B's. To me, I've been doing good in school my whole life, and am now starting to put in less effort because school doesn't matter to me anymore and I don't care how many awards I get or how many teachers say I'm an amazing student. 

I stopped caring about my friends. Recently, my largest friend group heard from a girl I used to talk to that I had said some stuff about them. I even went back to look through the messages, and found that I was talking about some other guys we were never really cool with. I didn't even try to explain to them. They asked me what's up and why I had said that. I just agreed and haven't spoken to them ever since.  It was all a misunderstanding, and I could've explained it all and decided not to because it doesn't matter to me and I couldn't care less. 

I realized I'm powerless in many ways, which is why I decided to stop caring about some stuff. For example, my girlfriend's friends told her some stuff about me, which was all just exaggerated and untrue. I explained to my girlfriend because I care about us, and thankfully she believed me and we're still going strong. I am eternally thankful for that, but the problems with her friends persisted. One day, they did their usual routine of telling her some stuff, and she actually got worried and was disappointed in me. Once again I had to explain to her that they're just stupid. What's worse is that she didn't even communicate with me, she was just distant for about a day before I decided to finally tell her. I already knew, I have sort of a spy in their friend group. She's the only one that likes me so she tells me stuff. I decided to give her some time to tell me herself, and she didn't. I realized the problems with her friends will continue to persist until the main one was out of the picture. I had the idea to give her candies laced with something to harm her, but once again, I realized I didn't care and stopped. I. Dont. Care. I don't even mention her friends to my girlfriend anymore, even though I know they're still trying to get between us.

The biggest thing I don't care about is my own life. It makes no difference to me whether I live or die. I have nothing going for me in my life because I feel no passion towards anything, so why should I continue to live? Every day I think about suicide and cry on my bed while listening to old emoviolence/midwest emo. I genuinely just want to die. I don't want to live in a world where nothing matters to me. 


All my empathy is gone. I don't care. I feel nothing for anyone and anyone. It's all meaningless to me. The only thing keeping me from suicide is that I don't have any methods easily available to me. No, I can't just climb a giant building. No, I don't own a shotgun. No, I have nothing to hang myself from. No, I don't wanna bash my head into a corner or anything. I want to be gone. I have no emotion. There is nothing left for me. ",KickAssFan8,,False,1cxomrp,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cxomrp/i_feel_nothing_i_am_nothing/

"I may be able to do it with a broken heart, but I am not able to do it with a broken brain.",1716340116.0,"This post will be lengthy. I am getting towards the end of my resources, family and friends are there and helpful, but can’t cure or fix me. I will appreciate any and everyone who reads and has any kind of advice. 

  
I am recently divorced. And the tale is almost too painful to tell, but I think my brain just desperately wants to find something to hold on to. 

  
We were married for 7 years. We did get married quick, but it seemed right. I was living in another country at the time, and as soon as we got married, we moved to the US where he is from. We moved in with his parents, and we still live with them to this day. My husband told me all the time how I am ticking all the boxes, and I am his dream woman, and I am exactly what he wants. Well, that didn’t last long. As soon as we got married, our sex life deteriorated. I gained a lot of weight (at time of him dropping the divorce bomb I had doubled my weight), and due to his disability, it was more and more challenging to have intimacy. I also never felt like he was super into me, even when I was skinnier. Although he claimed he was, it could’ve also been low self-esteem on my part. 

  
In the beginning of the relationship, I was “ahead”, meaning I started working at a college, getting my AA, planned on going to medical school. Once I had my AA, I switched jobs to get some more experience for medical school. Unfortunately, I had a few mental health struggles, which we tried to control, I was first diagnosed with anxiety/depression, then OCD. I was put on medication, and it got a little better. However, after a few years I kind of stagnated, failed a lot of classes, kept gaining more and more weight, wasted money on tuition. Then my husband was offered a job in another city 2.5 hours away. I was against him taking the job, but he felt like he couldn’t turn down the salary. So he went, and I stayed behind with his parents to finish my BS degree at the university that I was enrolled in. We planned on me being there during the weekend because I was supposed to go to my classes during the week. Well, I didn’t. I was insecure because I was so heavy, and my OCD made things very difficult. He was very hurt by that, feeling like I abandoned him and that I always put me first. I had quit my job at the time as well so I can focus on my classes, then our dog got very sick, my in laws lost their house, my in laws and I moved in with my husband. Then my husband’s salary was greatly reduced (50 % less) because apparently, he wasn’t performing very well. I wasn’t there at this job, so I don’t know what happened, but he does have a history of not giving things 100 %. Then we all moved back to our original city and my husband took an even lower paying job. He tried to pay for all 4 of us (him and I and my in-laws) so that was a lot of pressure to take on for one person. I think eventually he cracked under the pressure.   
Fast forward to November 2023, me dropping yet another class because I wasn’t doing well. That night I also had a bad fight with his dad, which ended in a shouting match. My husband sat me down and said he doesn’t want us to get a divorce, but he kind of fell out of love, but he wants us to work on things.   
2 days later he comes home from work and says he thinks it’s time to get a divorce, he has been checked out for a while, he’s tapped out and feels like things just can’t get any better. He agreed to counseling because “he owes me that”.   
Well, that counseling turned out terrible, as the counselor during the first session compared our marriage to a dead dog. This was the confirmation he needed that we should call it. One day!! Later, he had papers ready to sign for an uncontested divorce. He was still saying I am his best friend, and it hurts him to hurt me, and he wants to keep me safe.  I had asked him to give me some time and he became a little firmer, saying he wants this done. I said okay, but then it came to making the appointment 1 day later I backed down and said no I am not ready to sign this yet. Mind you, it had been less than one week from the time he dropped the divorce bomb to him wanting me to sign papers.   
At this point, he flipped a switch. He became angry (not unusual, his emotions come out in anger), very very angry. He said things like he wishes he would have never married me, I need to leave, it was like he was abducted by an alien. I would have never expected him to say any of this. I, of course, had taken ALL the blame at the time. Telling him how sorry I am, that I’ll change, to give me another chance etc. Now I realize that it was both of us. He criticized and criticized me all the time, and I feel like he always held me to a higher standard than himself. He stopped appreciating me and stopped spending time with me. I think he just fell out of love. And then he felt so guilty about divorcing me he just turned all that guilt and pain to anger. I had a wonderful woman from a marriage counseling company speak to me and she had explained that this is normal, he has to vilify me in order to go through with this process.   
So, the divorce was processed, from January to May I was really trying to work on myself, but still hoping for a reconciliation. Especially since he had said a few months ago that “If we’re meant to be, then he won’t fight it in the future if it happens naturally between us, he won’t go out of his way to stop it”.   
Well, the divorce finalized a few weeks ago. A few facts on that: I did not ask him for alimony, all our belongings went to him, I did not take his cars, our furniture (no, instead I am sleeping on a cheap mattress ☹ ), however, in his mind it’s all his anyway since he worked for it (though the first 4 years of the marriage I was working as well, when he was jumping from job to job and sometimes even taking on businesses that didn’t pay anything but he’d hoped would pay off eventually)

  
 On Friday when I came home, I saw a car in our driveway that I didn’t recognize. The car was driven by a woman, and in the passenger seat was my husband. They drove off, and I just crumbled. A part of my brain just said, no way, even if he is dating someone this fast, he wouldn’t bring this person home for me to see, there’s no way. He would not hurt me like that. Well, turns out that’s exactly what he did. 

Yesterday, while I was at work, he brought this girl into our home, into his bedroom, that used to be our bedroom, into his bed, that used to be ours. She left before I came home from work. I talked to him and asked what I could expect in the future with him dating. He became defensive right away, saying “Well what did you expect, we’re divorced”. There was not an ounce of compassion in him, instead there seemed to be anger. Almost like a “Well, that’s what you get now”. I was a sobbing mess, asking for some compassion, that my heart is broken, and I can’t take anymore pain and that I couldn’t handle him bringing her here. He said that since I will be living here for a couple years (I don’t have anywhere to go, no other family besides his parents which are a huge support system. I am paying him rent to stay here), that means eventually he will bring people home. I was just, shocked. I told him that we both contributed to this, and I am not the bad guy and he kind of smirked at me. He doesn’t take any responsibility; he says the thing he should have done differently was putting himself first more.  
The thought of him with another woman is killing me slowly. I am in so much pain I cannot take it anymore. Throughout this, I was also diagnosed with BPD. I always thought suicide would come as something that happens quick, but these past few months I have been finding myself in a space where I started to slowly grieve the life I could have, because I am seriously considering ending it. The suicide attempt rate for BPD is somewhere around 70-80 %. There is no cure. I don’t know how I can live through a situation like this with BDP. At this point, death seems like a kind alternative. It happened so gradual to actually consider ending it. But I start to feel relief when I think about it. I have thought about what goes into my letters that I would leave for the people who love me. The only thing that breaks my heart is that I love my dog so much and he wouldn’t understand. But this feeling is slowly fading away as well, as I think he’d be okay after a while. Everyone else would be fine, but most importantly, this pain would end.

I can’t feel anything??,1716338751.0,"I don’t even know what I want to write so this might be a bit jumbled as I am having a crisis right now.
Ever since I turned 15 my mental state has changed drastically. Basically, It’s as if I don’t feel emotions as much as I should. Don’t get me wrong, there are things that make me happy, things that make me sad but all of it just seems so…insignificant??? This has been ongoing for about 2 years now.

I remember being at my grandma’s funeral(she died after this whole ordeal started so I know it’s not the cause). Everyone around me was devastated, my mom was crying, my brother was crushed even my dad was in tears, but me? Nothing. I just felt akward sitting there while people told me they were sorry for my loss when I, myself, wasn’t. I never even went trough one stage of those all famous “stages of grief”(I very much loved my grandmother so I should have been grieving too). On that note, when people say “I’m sorry for your loss”, do they actually mean it? Cuz I sure never have. I just do it because it’s the “polite thing to say” but I don’t actually feel sorry.
That’s the main crux of the problem really, I just feel like I have zero empathy. I mean if my friend’s family member passes away, I know that “this is terrible and they must be crushed” but that’s just the logical conclusion. I’m starting to feel like some sort of serial killer, cuz that’s what they do, right? They don’t have empathy. They don’t care for the pain they inflict upon others, they don’t feel for them.

The worst part of it all is, since you can’t just be an emotionless husk, you have to just lie to people. I’ve basically been lying to my parents and friends which is an asshole thing to do but I can’t do anything about it.

I don’t remember when was the last time I’ve cried. I’ve never had a crush on anyone (which I am fine with but it might be connected) and at this point I’m starting to question if I’ve ever loved or cared about anyone or anything. I mean, I’m doing ok and I would honestly be ok with living life like this but I know it’s wrong and because I do I have this sense of guilt always hanging above my head.

Well, it felt kinda good to write that all out but what I’m really looking for here is for someone to tell me that they feel something similar so I know I’m not going crazy. Or, if you could provide a name for what I’m experiencing, that would be even better. Mental health is kinda stigmatized where I live not to mention my parents once told my brother to rethink his relationship with his girlfriend because she had anxiety. I tried google but the closest thing I found was alexithymia which I don’t really understand(what does it mean by “difficulty identifying emotions”??)

Sociopath or just apathetic?,1716335174.0,"I’m 28 been single for a coupl of years and I realize I can’t emotionally attach to anyone. Sexually, It’s a no problem but as much as I really want to fall in love and have feelings for my partners I just can’t! 

I had a tough time growing up. I was born in South America and my parents got separated when I was 2. My mom immigrated to US while my dad stayed. Dad was a bit too extreme with the ass whooping and was hard to predict since he was high & low and drugs. 

I remember being beat to the point where I would start enjoying the pain and I would laugh and tell my dad that he couldn’t hurt me. I knew that physically I had no chance but mentally I could fuck with him. 

I ran away from him and I reached out to my mom whom I hadn’t seen for 12 yrs (since I was 2 till I was 14). 

Even though I knew I must love her because she was my mom. I never felt the connection. As much as I hate to admit it she feels like a stranger. Someone I really care about because she cared about me, I love her not of familiarity but she sacrificed a lot to take care of me. 

I was extremely introverted and depressed until start of my 20’s. I smoked weed daily, worked out 2+ hours a day, took lot of drugs, overate, gambled everything and whored around. I constantly seeked pleasure but never felt satisfied.

Btw after I abounded my dad I never spoke to him ever again. He was a piece of sh*t and I don’t want to do anything with him at all. This doesn’t bother me at all. And the fact that I wouldn’t be sad at his funeral, kind of bothers me. 

Here is the weird thing; I am pleaser and feel way more happy to see other people’s joy and I usually only cry if I see someone else’s grief/sorrow. I don’t feel sad about myself and I have to ability to celebrate things. I always have to fake it!!! 

I have had only one meaningful relationship in my life. I was together with my ex for 8 yrs. I won’t be lying if I say that She thought me to love and feel emotions. 

Me and her, broke up and ever since I would literally forget the names of the girls the moment they leave.

A shell of a man ,1716335104.0,"It’s the only way I can possibly describe what it’s like for me to be a man. Some days I’m present, grateful, joyful, and spiritually connected. Others days I’m just not even there. Like I’m viewing my life through a peephole somewhere deep inside myself but I’m not in control I’m just going through the motions. On those days the thoughts just don’t stop racing. It’s anything and everything, quite literally. But primarily I think about my family, the world, the larger universe, and ultimately God. I imagine this is what a schizophrenic must be going through because sometimes the thoughts don’t feel like my own. Social media doesn’t help but in the absence of it the silence of my own thoughts going over and over makes me anxious. It also doesn’t help that I work a very boring job in an office for 8 hours but actually working maybe 2. Feels like solitary, no communication, just nothing. There are days where I just want to get up leave without a word and never come back but I don’t even know where I would go. I don’t mind working, I actually enjoy working, doesn’t really matter to me what I do. Just the mundane of getting off that elevator to turn on a computer and look at a screen under fluorescent lights and refill my water cup a dozen times just to get up makes me anxious. Then there the bathroom breaks where I catch a glimpse of myself but I’m not there I can see my body and face and my eyes but I’m a shell of a man. I feel like a loser because I have no purpose. Also part of my anxiety is the feeling like I’m alone and then the rotting pit in my stomach that I’m gonna die alone and then there nothing left and none of this was real.

Pls help pls read,1716330235.0,"I have absolutely no idea what to do. I have nobody to rely on. I don't know what to do. I am 19f. My life is a complete shit show. I was bullied not only emotionally but physically throughout my childhood, primarily due to being neurodivergent, though I didn't know that at the time, just thought I was ""weird"" and nobody liked me despite being a kind kid. I was obsesssed with early childhood education, reading books by Maria Montessori and writing teaching philosophy statements at the age of 8. I was paralyzed for about a year at the age of 11 and suffered severe medical trauma in the hospital as well. I felt my autonomy was stripped away from me and various professionals there, looking back, were abusive and negligent. There in the hospital I remember wanting to die for the first time. When I got out, the bullying just got worse because now I had the whole being-in-a-wheelchair-thing going against me too. I ended up doing stupid shit to impress my peers and try to make friends, which just meant that I was constantly getting into trouble as a younger teen, which didn't help my mental health. I tried to kill myself at 13. My mom slapped me in the face while I was bleeding from my wrists and told me I was going to ruin her reputation and that I couldn't go to the hospital. I really needed stitches, I still have very visible scars from that day. She sewed holes in some long sleeved shirts for me to put my thumbs through to hide my arms at school and told me not to tell anyone. Things were never the same between me and my parents. I began at 14 seeking validation from adult men online. It was stupid and reckless, but it helped in the moment. I was kidnapped a week before I was supposed to start high school by a 33 year old man. He drove me to a different state 500 miles away, raped me, and tried to strangle me to death before police came. They treated me like a suspect and handcuffed me and made me sit in a cold car for 3 hours in the middle of the night. There was an amber alert sent out all over. I was put in a psych ward for about a week and then began 9th grade at a new school as ""the girl from the amber alert"" to everyone around me. Everyone was talking about it and asking for specifics and making jokes about what happened to me. It also made me a target for older boys who thought it was evidence that I was easy to manipulate. One of them ended up being the reason I had to leave school a month later. I did online school with my now emotionally abusive parents for several months before starting at a new school. But then, covid shut everything down again, and it was all taken away from me. My mental health was terrible and my parents opted for an unhelpful tough love approach. I became very hypersexual due to my trauma, which ended in me being assaulted more times than one. My parents blamed me and began to resent me, their words not mine. I entered a long term relationship at 16 with a boy I truly loved, we will call him K. K got me pregnant and I wanted to keep it, but my parents forced me to get an abortion with illegal drugs. It was traumatizing and I spiraled. A mentor figure who was a family friend betrayed me horribly. K got me pregnant again. I was on birth control, though everyone believes it was intentional, it was not. My parents said I could either get an abortion or leave home, so I moved out at 17. I got my shit together. For a while, things were good. I got an associates degree incredibly quickly and began a successful career in early childhood education as I had always dreamed. I worked my way up to a lead teacher at 18 and loved it. K and I were so happy. He proposed. The kind of true love most people never get to experience. Most of my peers drifted away during my pregnancy. I didn't care, I had K, my unborn baby, and my job. Then, while in labor, I found out K was cheating on me the entire time. I forgave him and we tried again, though I was postpartum and heartbroken. I stayed home with my newborn son while he worked, or so I thought. Really, he got fired or never went to every job I thought he had. He would drive there and turn his data off so his location was set there all day. He would stage pictures and talk about work. Really he was cheating, doing drugs, and playing video games while I was at home with our baby. His anger issues got worse and he'd get violent but not to the extent that I couldn't justify it to myself. His whole family knew. The cycle of him being caught and apologizing profusely and then doing it again went on for a while before he said that he needed to get out of his house where his cheater DV father was impeding his progress in getting better. I love him. It made sense, his dad was clearly where the behavior stemmed from. I left my housing program to get him out and we all 3 lived in hotels for a few months. I had to sell my body to afford a place for us to live. I was working full time as a lead teacher it just wasn't enough. He still couldn't keep a job but he wasn't lying or cheating. I got us a nice apartment all on my own. Things were good for a while. His anger issues would flair up at times but not as bad, and no lying or infidelity. We had so many heart to hearts. We got married. I did great at my job. He started doordashing for income. Things were going well. Then 6 months into our marriage, about 9 months after we moved out/7 months after we got our apartment, he sprung on me that he wanted a divorce. That was about 7 months ago now. We have been living together and I have been hoping to rebuild. In his vows, he swore so sincerely and in such great heartfelt detail to do better and be better and stand by me. And then he just through it all away. He has been so mean lately. Sometimes things are okay and it's like everything is the same. But he thinks I don't clean enough even though I try and he says I don't support him emotionally even though I really feel like I do. I also pay for everything, I even bought him an 800 dollar PC a couple months ago. I got really sick a month ago. Like vomiting 10+ times a day. I thought I had a stomach bug and didn't have money to go to the doctor over something so trivial that would clear up on its own. I made too much for medicaid but still not a lot. After only 4 days of being gone and feeling like shit, my work fired me. After another week or so of feeling sick and getting so weak I thought I was dying, I went to the hospital. They said all the vomiting had made me very dehydrated and I was lacking in a lot of vitamins. They gave me medicine and an IV. Turns out I'm pregnant and have HG. I'm pretty far along. At first K was supportive but now he acts like I'm trying to ""trap"" him with a baby, which doesn't even make sense. We were having unprotected sex and the only birth control was that I am breastfeeding, which he knew, so it isn't that crazy of an outcome. He has been so cruel and angry, saying terrible things. He threatens to leave when he gets mad so I beg him to stay because he knows I'd be all alone and I love him a lot. He has said some terribly cruel things and it's like every tiny thing I do wrong makes me the villain. Yesterday he blew up on me and it was scary and terrible. Today, I found out the few friends I thought I had hate me. One of them sent me the most cruel message I have ever received completely unprompted. I have no family support, no friends, my husband hates me, and everyone I've ever cared about except my son (who is different because he's too young to understand and he loves everyone and he is also a responsibility) wants nothing to do with me unless they are using me. I am so suicidal. I know a lot of people are suicidal but I am genuinely at a point where I am close to doing something I can't take back. But I can't because of my kids, both the 1 year old and the unborn one. And as much as I know I should be grateful for that, it feels so unfair. I've been having to do things I don't want to for money again. I have another great teaching job lined up but I don't start for at least a month. I feel like I should go to a hospital but I live in a state with a very high child removal rate even in cases of just mental health. I am a great mom, even though my husband and ex friends do not seem to agree. I can't risk having my fitness as a parent called into question over an unrelated mental health issue, especially since K's family and lots of people in my life would love the chance to lie about me to cps, and since I'm not employed right now, it doesn't look great. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone. I'm so so hurt. It feels like everything is falling apart. Not that long ago, I was a lead teacher, a wife, I felt like a respected and respectable person. Now I just feel like my train wreck of a life full of trauma has taunted me with this perfect picket fence life that I worked so hard for just to rip it away from me and leave me a useless unemployed incubator that everyone hates and is only holding on for her kids sake. The only people who talk to me or ""care"" just want to fuck me. Even the people interested in a relationship with me and seem like ""good Christian men"" are still driven by lust even if they disguise it to themselves. I have never felt so hopeless.

How do I stay confident when having a really bad self image?,1716326612.0,"(F15) 
I play for an u15s football team. I’m a goalkeeper.
I trailed for this team in September and got in. I was very lucky.
I often think I only got in because the season was coming closer and they didn’t have a goalie. I thought it was a matter of circumstance.

I’ve always have an extremely poor self image, mainly from years of bullying and emotional neglect from my parents. 

I had a particularly low time from January to the end of feb. Which resulted in a doctors trip and very serious responses from my parents. Being diagnosed with anxiety and depression. And eventually having to tell my parents about my attempted overdose.

This affected my football greatly and meant I missed training and different social events. I ended up explained to the coach why I was gone so much, he understood and supported me a lot. He ended up leaving one week, after I’d missed training 4 weeks in a row.

I have a new coach now and he ain’t at all aware of the issues I have. 
I’ve sustained 2 injuries in the past couple months since the old coach left, and these have affected my confidence a lot. Making me scared because the injuries hurt a lot. None the less i refused to take time off .


My problem now is that we have a second keeper trailing as a back up.
I’ve lost my confidence again.
And I feel shitty and sad all the time. Even outside of football.
She’s taller than me and I can tell the team already like her.

"I just want my father to be proud of me (there are some really extreme things talked about in here so please dont enter if you cant read about suicide plans, selfharm and/or family problems) ",1716319776.0,"I just want to make him proud. 

I've been fighting with my family for 2 months now, i tell them shit, they tell me shit and in the end i always hear the same thing. 

I've lost my feelings since 8 fucking months, i forgot what emotoins feel like, i forgot what love, happiness, sadness, grief, joy, jalousy, ignorance, greed feels like and i cant replicate them, they were compeletly and fully wiped from my memory. 

The only things i feel are pain and emptyness, infinite pain and emptiness, my hearth hurts constantly and i want to cry, but cant im always onxthe verge of tears but cant cry, my eyes arent able to form even the slightest of a tear. 

Im not eating nor sleeping until i hear the words ""im proud of you"" from the person who i call father, i will learn and tudy all day and night, i dont care anymore. I want to hear it from him and i dont care how, i would go to hell (even though i dont believe in hell, but thats another subject fuck that for now) i will do it, i dont care ehat he eants i eill fucking do it. 

I will also continue to cut my arms open, i dont care what you say, its the only thing which still belongs to me since i lost all things that make me human. I wont stop, i cant stop, i dont care. 

I planned on kiling myself 3 times by now, i was either stopped or talked out of it, first one was with a knife in my bed, i stared at my wrist 2 hours was ready to cut the vein in the lenght since you cant atich that up, stopped myself from doing so, secomd time was with a fucking bridge, i stood there until someone talked me out of it, the third and newest attempt was with 4 000 mg of some kinf of acidid from pills, and yes i fucking know that its a slim chance to die from but i didnt care, the effects would be from an overdose, vomiting, kidney and liver failure, internal rupture and bleeding, cramps, permanent brain damage and potential paralization from the waist down. I didnt xare, before i could swallow even one my brother stopped me and toom them away. In the same fucking day my father came into my room, yelled yt how much of an selfish asshole i am and threw the pills at me i wanted to use as if he wanted to tell me ""just kill yourself already"". Today i skipped school and was yelled at again and were taken away my pc, which i fucking need for school but i guess thats fine with me im not mad about the pc, not mad about it at all. 

The only desire i have is to make my fatber proud and happy, once, in my life, even if its the last thing i do, i dont care how long it will be but i will make him proud regardless what i have to do.

"My lack of empathy scares me, and I want to know how to get better.",1716314388.0,"I’m constantly on the prowl to search for meaning. I want to know why I’m like this, because that’s something my brother asks me all the time. I’m a bad person. I lack any guilt, empathy, or sympathy. I have to manually express these, but it’s usually toward my friends or people I’m acquainted with.

I was a bad kid when I was younger. I do carry a lot of guilt for my past actions. Some which I have forgotten. I used to call my brother a ‘special snowflake’ and that ruined his self-confidence. Some things scare me. I love animals, but when I was stressed at twelve years old I ab*sed a pet puppy. I spoke about it with my therapist. At the time, we had just gotten rid of my other pet because she peed on the floor too much and the arrival of a new one crushed me. I had to take care of two dogs by myself because my mom was always at work.  It hurts to think about it. I never hit her, but I’d chase her to make her scared of me and I’d push her in her own pee puddle… Thankfully, the little baby was sent to a new home within less than a year.

I did the same thing three years later when I was fifteen, but definitely not as extreme. This was when my parents got divorced and I was angry with how much attention my mom and brother gave to the new puppy because they didn’t care about the other one we had.

I don’t care about anything, even myself. I don’t know how to take care of myself. I mock people in subtle ways. I’d get annoyed with how frequently my dad’s new wife says “mhm” so I’d always reply with, “yeah!” I don’t know how to be a ‘normal’ person. I’m a slow learner. I have no motivation. I feel like an outsider.

I think I just have a lot of pent-up anger.
Every day in high school I’d stress my brother out because I’d take too long getting ready. I’d always say, “hold on!” and “I’m coming!” This would result in a car ride to school where he’d yell about how much he hated me and how I’m a shitty person. I always have this poker face on.

My dad and brother yell at me all the time. I have no input so I just let them yell. Sometimes I pay attention, while other times I zone out due to how long their speeches are.

My brother sometimes has mental breakdowns while yelling at me, and he has attacked me a few times during them. He’d charge at me or yank my hair or bang me with his fists. I know when he’s about to do it, because he always halts his words and tightens his lips.

Today, I angered my brother again over something minimal, but I’ve made him mad so many times that I can understand why. The catalyst was that he called me a bitch so I returned the insult, and he charged to my front door. He went into a breakdown that caused him to scream in a shrill voice that hurt my ears.. He pointed out how I’m a shitty person who ruined his childhood and his high school career. He said I’m the reason why he’s not going to college. He said I’m a selfish, worthless cunt. I started to close the door because I was afraid he’d hurt me, but he pried the door open by putting himself between the doorway. He was offended that I’d think he’d hurt me.

I managed to close the door and lock it. He banged on the door demanding for me to open it, which caused a crack in my door. When I opened the door again, I saw the damage. The screams came back again.

He told me again how I’m a shitty, selfish, self-righteous cunt. He brought up all the people I was a bitch to, such as him, my dad, my dad’s wife, my manager, even my mom, adding that even though he doesn’t like her I’m still a bitch to her.

What I hate the most about these lectures my dad and brother give me are the questions that put me on the spot. “Why are you like this?” Usually they move on and keep talking, but sometimes they’ll demand for an answer.

“Answer me!” I have no idea how to respond to that. I wish I knew why I am the way I am. “I don’t know,” or “I’m a shitty, self-centered piece of shit” are my usual answers.

I took a break and stepped outside for about five minutes, and then came back inside while my brother was still upset. He told me there’s no one more he hates than me, that he doesn’t consider me a sister. He’s going to move away and cut off contact with me forever.

That’s basically the jist of it. After about ten minutes he came to my door and said that even though he hates me more than anything, I don’t need to kill myself or do drugs and alcohol or cut myself because at the end of the day, I’m still a human being.

I don’t feel anything. I don’t feel bad about that even though he was screaming and crying in the other room. Last year he had a meltdown that resulted in me getting attacked. He charged after me and pushed me to the ground, causing my knees to get skinned. He was at his worst here. He pulled his shirt off and sat down on the deck on his knees with a sharp knife propped near his chest. He threatened to stab himself and begged me to leave him alone.

I don’t know how I’m supposed to react in these situations. I think I should have more compassion. Usually, I tell him I’ll call our dad or 911 especially when he hints at self-harm. I know I should feel something, at least feel sad, but I DON’T. I’m going to forget it and the next few days everything will going to go back to normal. Everything will be pushed under the rug and my brother and I will watch a show together or crack jokes.

It just scares me why I’m like this. I’m diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, and likely have autism but people don’t act the way I do. My mom has called everyone a narcissist, including me so I began to question myself more. I wonder if I’m a sociopath and I know they always say that sociopaths don’t care about that but I really don’t care. I don’t stress over my personality 24/7, it just hits me when I’m feeling down in the dumps. I just have no empathy for my actions. I’ve abandoned friends, and I isolate myself all the time. Everything is like a chore to me and I’m the laziest person to mankind. I know I need to keep working. I want to get better.


I’m just stupid. This weekend, I kept on worrying about myself. I wondered if someone as fucked up and stupid as me could ever amount to anything. What I did as an older kid and young teenager terrifies me. All I do is hurt people. I use people intentionally or unintentionally for my own benefit. Also, I do think of myself a lot. I used to have a dumb superiority complex when I was younger. My upbeat and goofy personality around my friends is only temporary, maybe it’s a facade.

I don’t know why I’m posting this here. I know you just have to move on. I’m just feeling scared. I’m not looking for an excuse for my actions. I just want to know what could drive me to commit them, and how I don’t feel anything. I want to see if I could get a diagnosis for antisocial personality disorder because I fit a lot of the symptoms. I want to get better because I’m heading toward a very bleak future if I don’t.

Again, I’m not looking for excuses. I just want to learn to take accountability for my own actions and to stop being such a bad person. I’m eighteen. I want to teach myself to be better. I’d like to get some advice about this or get redirected to some sources. Any book recommendations? What do I search for when I need help? Does anyone have any recovery stories from being a bad person?

is my memory bad because of dissociative amnesia due to trauma or am i just dumb?,1716314890.0,"**TW// ONLINE HARASSMENT, HARASSMENT, GROOMING, BULLYING, AND ATTEMPTED UNALIVE.**

***this will be a long backstory and explanation to my question. if you read everything I thank you so so much and I appreciate you with my whole heart.***

so towards the end of 7th grade (13 years old), I started having a crush on a boy after he protected me from another boy and we became best friends in the last few months of the school year. i confessed to him during the summer leading into 8th grade (14 years old) and it took him a week for him to ask me out after that.  we started dating and the first red flag was he wanted to keep our relationship a secret. i caved and told my best friend at the time and an acquaintance and the acquaintance told all the girls in the grade, and in turn, the boys told the guy I was dating. he was a little upset but then the next day in school, he was rlly happy. and the reason was he became ""popular"" for dating in 8th grade, while I was getting made fun of for dating him.  
3 weeks to a month after dating, he started asking for inappropriate photos and videos of me. i was told to never do that growing up so I stood my ground and refused to send photos and videos of myself. he begged and begged and made me feel like a horrible person for not doing what he wanted. he claimed he loved me and he would never hurt me, so I decided to send him photos and videos if in turn he never took screenshots. he agreed and the very first photo I sent he saved it to his phone (this was on snapchat and snapchat tells you when a person screenshots a photo sent).  
i cried so hard because he betrayed my trust and I also betrayed my parents' trust. i felt so dirty and like such a disappointment for doing what he was telling me to do. after three months of enduring all of this, I decided to break up with him around Christmas break. during our Christmas break (2 weeks long) he sent all the videos and photos of myself to a group chat where all the boys in the grade were in. then him and the boys sent the photos to the girls in my grade.  
the break ended and I went back to school and everybody was giving me looks. i didn't know why until a week later and my best friend broke the news. he exposed me to the whole grade. it didn't hit me until I was taking a shower and I got so lightheaded I had to hold on to the curtain and sit myself down and I just started bawling. after I came back to school, I guess people knew that I knew now and they openly started bullying me. i got called slut, whore, and people would try and assault me in the hallways. i had my ass slapped and my hair pulled by the boys for months. *~~i tried committing suicide twice by hanging and drowning~~* but stopped mid-way  each time because i wanted to be alive for my little sister. i thought about how this can happen to her and i wanted to stop it at all costs. one day in class, a boy was talking about me and I heard him say ""oh you should ask \*my name\* to do it, she'll do anything for money or for free"", I turned around, walked towards him and slapped the shit out of him. luckily the teacher wasn't in class at the time but everybody got mad AT ME for standing up for myself. after that, the harassment slowed down but I was still getting dirty look and slight name-calling by kids in my grade, grades below me, and THEIR OWN PARENTS.  
grown adults started calling me names. not only that they started a petition to get me kicked out of school. luckily for me, i ended up getting the boy expelled form the school. i never pressed charges and i regret that to this day. something happened between me and my bf that got us in trouble and I was then sent to the office and essentially got forced to tell my parents what had been happening for a whole year.   
i am now turning 19 years old and 5 years later, i am still hurting and traumatized by all of this.

**~~-------~~**

so now that you know the backstory, ever since then my memory has been absolutely horrible. i cant even remember what i did the day before. i cant remember my childhood either. nothing seriously traumatic happened to me as a kid (only two very severe events but i got over those). everytime my dad asks me about my past and asks me if i remember all the things i did with him and with my mom, i always have a very hard time remembering. i give myself migranes when i try to remember my past EVEN IF the memories were very happy. when they ask me these types of questions and i reply with ""no i don't remember"" they get really sad or disappointed and i feel really bad for my parents because they were really poor back then and they worked so hard to give me happy memories and to be able to provide me a happy lifestyle but i just cannot remember. not only that, after the 8th grade event i was diagnosed with bpd 2, major depressive disorder (mdd), and anxiety. these mental illnesses may play a part in my horrendous memory.

anyway from what you have read, what can you take away from this? is my memory because of trauma or am i just slow now? if you have any questions please ask me and ill happily answer!! if you made it this far, thank you.",Little_Shirt_3413,,False,1cxeg8b,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cxeg8b/is_my_memory_bad_because_of_dissociative_amnesia/

I don’t know what to think of my family.,1716369092.0,"For reference, my mother passed away Oct. 2023, she was the only parent I’ve ever had and over the months I’ve come to the realization that my family is not who I thought they were. I have 4 aunts and 3 uncles in my immediate family and that’s it. I am the oldest cousin of all my cousins and they are not even old enough to even be considered in this. (And because they haven’t done anything)

I’m not sure if this is some sort of grief issue that has contributed to this or something, but I’ve had to pay more attention to my aunts/uncles since then, and so I think I am able to see who they truly are since I’m older. To say the least I think they are unbearable. I used to wonder where a lot of my trauma triggers came from and I think it’s them.

So for starters, I’ve had to move in with my grandmother because of what happened and she is being helped by her children. (my family) So I’ve had to talk to them more about necessities and whatnot. I don’t have a job yet and I’ve just turned 18 this year, so I rely on them for many things like transportation, and appointments. I have 1 aunt that I talk to the most which has led me to this state. She is probably the root of a lot of things I have issues with today. She has gaslighted me, shamed me, and disregarded me as a whole to say the least because I can’t even begin to get into how. I used to think these were normal things for “tough love”. Sadly I am started to realize this is utterly damaging to me mentally. She reminds me so many times that her and her siblings have to pay for everything of the house and I understand completely. I don’t let myself forget about that ever, because I never want to be inconsiderate of that at all. I can’t even help with the house because of her. I’d been able to get a job at any time, if it weren’t for her insisting I don’t get an ID and head straight for my license instead. I haven’t driven my whole life, nor do I know anything about a car. I’ve grown up mostly not having a car and someone always driving me around. She expected me to pass that test within a week and I told her that I don’t think I’d be able to do it and that I just wanted to get my ID just incase it takes a while. (This was while all in the DMV building) She quite literally in 30 seconds just left out the door telling me to just wait.

Fast forward about a month: I haven’t done the test because of other things happening during that month and for the fact that I am still grieving the loss of my mother. (Saying this because I had a hard time getting out of bed and had no motivation for anything productive) She invites me to go door dashing with her and as we’re about to leave my neighborhoods entrance gate she complains about me not having a job and I remind her of the situation before. She denied she said any of that and complained yet again of me not having a job.

She seems to project a lot of herself onto me and cannot seem to realize that I am a real human being that struggles too. Job or not. Every time I try talking to her about those struggles that she has notably said many times that I can be safe to talk about them with her, she seems to think I am being dramatic and I don’t have anything to struggle about. She also has a thing where she thinks I’m lying and a lot even though everything and everyone is saying no. I don’t know why she wants me to be what she thinks I am but I am finding very hard to go on in life because of this woman. She is the most fit person to help me with my situation but she’s making it very hard. She is the type of person that makes me think things like “I don’t have much to lose soo” and it’s getting very uncomfortable and hard.

I mentioned my family in the title because the others aren’t much different either. So much so I can’t even tell who is worse. This is kind of a ramble and I just wanted to get other people’s perspectives on the situation because I feel so invalidated on how I feel about it. I feel like I’m really dramatic and I am just too sensitive for this world. I’ve never felt like such an outcast and I plan on never talking to them again after I am on my own because these are the types of people you wouldn’t want around your children. How she treats me is not much different of how she treated me as a child. Sounds crazy now that I think about it. :/",uglyluvv,,False,1cxvvj4,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cxvvj4/i_dont_know_what_to_think_of_my_family/

At the very end of the night was just the two of us (myself and the friends sister) and these two women just randomly came up to us and started verbally abusing her, calling her stupid, fat, ugly, etc, just horrible things (which made her cry afterwards). Which I defended her and told them to go away which led them to turn onto me and honestly hit a few nerves. I did call them names back and the night ended sourly/bad mood. There was no physical altercation or anything, just words.
Since then I've been thinking about it over and over if I should have done anything differently which I obviously I can’t  control now that's its in the past. It is affecting my work a bit.

But my main question is, how do I stop thinking about the past, more importantly, the bad/embarrassing/negative/silly things that have happened years ago that pop up in my mind. It is affecting my work and social life and think it was made affects on the confidence talking to woman.

These thoughts aren't any sort of abuse or anything illegal but stuff like how things ended with an ex, silly things Ive said on a night out after a few drinks, etc",Living_Cellist_2872,,False,1cxvcxu,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cxvcxu/how_to_stop_thinking_about_the_past/

Am I suffering from anxiety? Or something else?,1716365008.0,"Hi, I'm here to have someone else's opinion since I'm not comfortable talking about this with my friends and family. Also I've posted this on another subreddit already, I hope I'm not spamming but I really want to hear more of your opinions.
I really want to know what kind of problems I'm having - I'll meet a doctor in a few days, but I doubt I'll be sent to a psychologist.

My guess is that I'm suffering from anxiety, but I'd like to know how bad it is or if I'm suffering from something more specific, I'm really bad with these sort of things and checking on the internet hasn't helped much.

Getting to the point: in the last 2 years my 'symptoms' worsened gradually, so much that these last 6 months have been a hell.

Worse symptoms I have are a constant 'impending doom' feeling, where for every single thing happening around me I already imagine a catastrophic ending (usually a very bad incident, possibly death). 
For example: I need to take the car and drive 15 minutes =I already imagine something bad happening. I'm driving and I see a car coming into my opposite direction =  I already imagine a scene where they will  randomly hit me. 
Each time one of my parent leaves for work, I immediately think about some incident happening. And so on.

Then, lately I developed a new worse symptom (if I can call it like this - apologies English is not my first language) where my brain would just focus on a very bad and irrational event, like 'ah yes, this person who never showed to be aggressive or something will kill me in my sleep', this caused me not to sleep for entire nights, for months. 
Then I got a few weeks when I was finally back to normal, yet now my brain found another fear that keeps me on the razor line every day. I'm barely sleeping, if I do is out of exhaustion. 

I know I should switch off my phone before going to bed, but the reality is that I can't physically do it. 
If I'm left 5 minutes without anything to do, my brain will automatically think about this current fixation and my worries and anxiety will just explode. I use socials as a way to distract myself and It technically works, it's just that I fall asleep out of exhaustion - which leads me to very little hours of sleep during the week.

Lately I'm also waking up in the middle of the night (around 2-3am), my worries come back and I just don't sleep unless I fall asleep with my phone on my hands. I'm writing this after a whole night spent without sleeping.

I found out that the only way to avoid these bad thoughts are by distracting myself, for the most part. 

I noticed I also developed a severe fear of heights - which is something I never had before 2 years ago. And I mean severe, as I could barely jump on a few rocks on the beach.

Technically speaking, these fears do not stop me from my daily activities, I still force myself to drive, take the train etc, but they do cause me to be less focused, less willing to do stuff like studying etc. and of course I'm always tired. 

I checked online a bit, about anxiety and it says the person should like sweat and trembles when having strong anxiety attacks, but I'm quite the opposite, I just switch off. 
I had people telling me ""I wish I was as calm as you in this situation"" while I was feeling like losing consciousness in a moment because of my worries. 

I think that's it, this covers some of the worse symptoms I'm having. 
Really sorry for the long post.

I got quite annoyed by this and my mum shouted at me saying “he is allowed Half an hour in the morning to destress” I said “I know my brother It’s just this is his usual routine so I don’t see the issue” she responded with “stop being bitchy” and so and so then my brother starts and then it ended with me saying “well I’ve not said he can’t have half an hour have i?” And “right I’m just gonna leave this cause I do not have the patience for this”. I just don’t get it me and my older brother bond over the fact that our mum didn’t take no for an answer, would scream at us til we left the house and basically had no form of, niceness when it came to messy rooms, having a “bad look” on our face or storming out of a room or having a tone.

Triggered by something I didn’t even know affected me ,1716364336.0,"I’m 19 and my sister is 21. My sister, for as long as I can remember, has struggled with anxiety. When she was 6, she swallowed an ice cube whole and this caused her to be afraid to eat. Luckily, she went to a therapist and recovered fairly quickly. We now know that this was a an eating disorder called ARFID. This was something I barely remember and I didn’t really think it affected me until now. The good news is that she’s doing a lot better mental health wise. Me, not so much. 

Whenever someone else brings up eating disorders, I have a very psychical reaction. I feel lightheaded, dizzy, weak, nauseous, it’s hard to hear, it’s hard to process what’s going on around me, I feel like I’m closing in on myself, I feel like I’m shrinking, I physically close in on myself. I remember since I like the show Pretty Little Liars, I was reading an interview before school with Lucy Hale and she happened to talk about her experience with an eating disorder, and my mom and I were very confused why I was laying down on the couch unresponsive when I was supposed to be getting in the car on the way to school. 

The same thing happened when I watched the Taylor Swift documentary Miss Americana in that one scene; I have to skip the scene now. I had to skip chapters of Jenette McCurdy’s memoir.

But today I had group therapy at college and they were all talking about their past experience with eating disorders. The same thing happened to me again, only this time I threw up. Luckily, a therapist (hence it being group therapy) was there and after a few minutes I felt better and I explained to her what happened. She said it sounded like I was dissociating, a common trigger response.

My sister’s experience is the only thing I can think of as to why this would be happening to me, but I’m not sure.

"I'm unsure what is happening, if its good or bad?",1716364110.0,"""Lost interest with a lot of things I pursued in the past, And things I try to spark an interest in now.""

Could be a funny mood or something? I am told I hae a schizo type mood disorder, as well as Autism that they don't necessarily necognise, but other helpers can.

I have music therapy but I just don't like it. Everything about music pretty much I hate now. Is this some thing that all ""musicians"" go through? I'm not even that good. But I believe I can percieve a lot of negatives and see reasons why music and other things aren't for me. It's like that Engineers joke something like ""Give an engineer a idea and they will find at least 10 ways why it wouldn't work"" now although I've speculated on becoming an engineer before....i just dont see it. Ive invested a lot of money in music, but I just don't think I have ""it"". 

I used to be heavily creative, I HAD a talent in drawing but people got sick of me drawing on the walls yeh :P but yeah I've put drawing well behind me and the latest one has been writing. My supports say I'm really good at conveying meaning and intent, or just like, ""I like the way you worded that!""

For more than ten years I've been in and out of hospital, mostly at the end of year, but with meds I'v estretched it out to 3-4 years until the next hospital stay.

Other than that I'v been on a cycle of hospital stays and I'd hope to put it behind me a slavage whatever life I can muster.

It's been since last year since my hospitalization and I got out JAN-FEB. 

I've been dealing with voices a lot, but the last two weeks that have gone pretty much, a little bit of voices here and there, but not like before, where it was constant and led to to the hospital. Now instead of voices, i get intense boredom. Nothing seems worth doing so i just go on reddit, play video games, do a rubiks, and go to sleep at night to ASMR. Things are going good it seems but I feel a slight sense of false security because I have health supports in place but they aren't working too well. So soon I am stopping some of them because they just dont realy help (or so it seems, I hope im not doing anything too rash by stopping some of them)

Just by writing this I am helping myself, I think writing would be something I should keep at. And that goes for languages with linguistics and etymology and all that stuff I've been interested in for years but really don't know how to pursue it.

My body just pains itself going through a day, Im in my 30's. I have like a bag of anxiety or stress just as a load onto msyelf. I usually go for walks in the morning (when its not too cold) and then have a shower and fresh clothes, I'm also doing a food diary for my dietician that I'm doing very well at (so she says, I must agree :P) But yeah the feeling is that I feel weightless, but the contact point between my body and the outer world seems fuzzy, like itchy on my arms and head and face. I got a twisted foot the other day, but surpirsingly was able to walk in the morning. I get sudden attacks, I have a case of vertigo im dealing with and i feel it is slowly dissappating going though the weeks.

I want to know that I will find myself again, in a better light than I have over many years of doubt. I need some intersts to get lost in, more than a video game or movie that has its own agenda. Something I can work for and towards, for, well, myself.

For as long as I can remember i’ve always talked to myself. I feel like I have a lot to say and no one to say it too so I make up conversations in my head and speak on them out loud or sometimes in my head.

Just things that interest me. I tend to get hyperfixated on things that other teens and kids my age don’t care about and I use myself as an outlet. I’m not even a very talkative person I just think i’m extremely opinionated and have a lot of crazy thoughts that run through my head that I want to talk about, just not to a real person. Real people would not care at all lol. For context, I’m 15 and have been told by many doctors that I have severe OCD and a bad case of maladaptive daydreaming lol. I assume that this is connected to this, but I wonder if I should bring this up to my psychiatrist. It’s just that I do this for hours a day sometimes. It happens every day but times vary depending on how busy I am and whatnot. But yeah I’ve done this for years.

Over-Apologizing

I’ve gotten this test mainly to find out who my biological father is. I have a very high feeling he doesn’t even know I exist.

I’ve asked about him a few times throughout the years, all I have gotten is an “I don’t know” from her. When I do find out who my biological father is, I am choosing not to tell my mother. I am just completely unsure of how she would react. Maybe one day I will tell her, but as of now, no. 

I am mainly here to figure out how to approach a situation like this, how I would go about finally contacting my biological father. I’m not sure what sort of reaction I will get from him. Will he be happy? Will he be distant? Will he be resentful? Will he have guilt? Will he accept me into his life? Is he even alive? There are many, many more questions I have, far too many to list.

I’m not really looking for answers. I don’t really know what I’m looking for in all honesty. Guidance would help maybe. Knowing someone has been in a similar situation and gotten through it. That it all actually worked out. 

I just know this has been affecting me as a person, I can just tell I’m not as good of a person I used to be. I feel more distant. I feel  isolated. I feel guilt. I feel my levels of effort for myself and others has plummeted. I have always had a lot of patience with really anything, but even now I feel as if it’s running thin. I feel so untrusting of others anymore as well. 

There are a lot of parts to this that I’m missing. I am not sure I can actually put them into words that don’t make me sound crazy, because I sure feel like I am going crazy sometimes.

Getting brain scans for mental illnesses,1716354933.0,"Has anyone ever done a brain scan to understand their issues further? If so, has it helped you?

Hi all! So, I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for the past 10 years. I've been to a therapist, taken SSRIs (Which made it worse), and done intensive 10-day meditation recently which did help bring down the anxiety. But yet, I still feel lost, and depressed and at times think about killing myself. 

I feel that something could be wrong with my physiology which is why I've scheduled a visit to the neurologist to investigate further.

Started with constant anxiety while on vacation,1716354096.0,"So, I'm in vacation which should be amazing right?! Well, it's now started to go downhill. Sunday I went for a very long hike and since then I've had lower body muscle aches, primarily left calf. Well, I've had rhabdomyolysis in the past and it reminds me of that but I have no other symptoms. It's like a dull ache and full feeling since Sunday so it's not normal muscle aches. Of course I didn't get travel insurance and I'm in an incredibly expensive country for health care. I've slowly been becoming more and more anxious and now it's constant. Wake up, immediately upset stomachs, trembling, chest burning, feel like I have to puke. This reminds me of when I had a mental breakdown and it took 3 weeks for anything to work to finally get me out of fight of flight. I'm on medication (effexor and buspirone) but I changed my schedule around to fit the hours I'm in this country. I also started my period a week early so it's been a whirlwind. 

I have no idea what to do to get this feeling to go away and it's making everything worse and I just want to go home but now I'm terrified to fly. I'm here with my partner and he tries to help but just doesn't understand my health anxiety and general anxiety and both are sky rocketing.

Difference between intrusive thoughts/thought insertion or other?,1716351676.0,"Request for information/opinions on what these specific thoughts can be labelled as.

Hi, I've been stressed recently so my thoughts have been different, and while I want to learn more about them, I'm not actually sure which kind of thought they are categorised as. I would be grateful for any information on what these could be. (I would just ask my psychiatrist, but he retired, and I'm still trying to get a new one).

Occasionally, in day-to-day life, I experience quick intrusive thoughts like ""Don't like that incense!"" or ""don't turn left here!"" This isn't a translation of a feeling, these quotes are my own thought narrations, but are thoughts that I did not intend to think. Usually I just ignore them, unless I'm having a particularly anxious day and don't want to deal with the added emotional effort of managing the anxiety of what will happen if I do this thing.

But, recently, those types of thoughts have been longer. Eg. Earlier I had the thought ""We shouldn't eat those peas, they're bad, we can't eat those. Something bad will happen. You need to find another vegetable to eat."" and when I tried to ignore it, I thought ""DON'T EAT THE PEAS."" and it sounded so adamant that I was like damn, ok, guess I'm not eating peas with this hummus. These thoughts are different than the previous ones because they are much longer, and able to argue back/reply. If I had to translate it into physical terms, the first set (intrusive thoughts) are like a burp. Sudden, but you know what happened. Whereas the longer thoughts are like when you are distracted while walking and accidentally walk into a chair you could have sworn wasn't that close to you. Its like ""wait, how did THAT happen? it was like the chair jumped out at me, wtf.""

Evidence for it being intrusive thought: It is unwanted and uncomfortable, and my own thought narration.  
Evidence against it being intrusive thoughts: most definitions of intrusive thoughts specify it as images, urges, or 'what if' scenarios, not as an internal verbal dialogue.

Evidence for it being thought insertion: These don't feel like my own thoughts, really. I know they are, because obviously they have to be mine, but it doesn't feel like I am making the thoughts. Also, according to  one neurological theory mentioned on wikipedia, ""misattributed inner speech, during the generation of inner speech, speech production areas fail to inhibit the speech perception area and this leads to a misattribution of one's thoughts to an external source."" So, it could be these are my own thoughts, and my brain is going ""woopsy! we aren't gonna recognise that as our own production.""  
Evidence against: Thought insertion is a delusion characterised by how the person fully believes the thoughts are being put into their head. But I know these thoughts are from my own brain.

Evidence for being a system or having DID: the thoughts don't feel like my own.   
Evidence against: I have no memory loss (well, like, I have a shit memory, but the normal kind, not the 'what was I doing for 5 hours' kind), Others have not noted any changes in my personality, and I did once """"split"""" before, years ago, and it did not feel like this at all. This doesn't feel like there is another person in me, or that I have become two people.

So, does anyone have any ideas or resources (I have access to academic articles) on what these thoughts count as? I'd like to know so that I can better understand myself and how to cope with them. I apologise for this being so long, I'm more of a tumblr user than a reddit user, so I'm not exactly known for my brevity.",Stargazer_quartz,,False,1cxrnh4,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cxrnh4/difference_between_intrusive_thoughtsthought/

Drug test could be detrimental for me.,1716351355.0,"I received a job offer for an amazing job after getting wrongfully terminated from the one I had for 4 years (long story but I am going through the whistleblower protection process while seeking new employment). This was a week after I began college courses and returned to school for the first time in ten years.

The only issue is that the job is contingent on passing a drug test. I have been using D9 >.03% gummies for awhile now because they are legal to buy and help me sleep. I don’t think I am going to pass.

I excitedly told friends and family I got the job I was hoping for and now I can’t even contemplate the shame of telling them the offer was rescinded due to a failed drug test. None of them know I use these gummies and the embarrassment and feeling of failure could break me.

My brain goes straight to jumping ship if that happens and just giving into ideation and ending things.

Just some life thoughts,1716347496.0,"Life is shitty a lot of the time. You can put in so much work, ignore so much bullshit and still end up getting kicked down time and time again. Some people live easy, comfortable lives where they barely have to work or give anything of themselves away, while others are given the worst situations to try and survive through. No matter where you are and what cards you are dealt, life will give you challenges to manage and distractions to alter your path. Sometimes in order to continue, we must put down the societal rules, that we must be a certain way, do certain things, look so called ""attractive"". When in reality, what's the point of all of those things? Who really cares if you have a fancy car, or a really cool pair of shoes. Life overall, isn't about any of that, it's about what you make of it. Life will only get as good as you allow it to be. Those people I mentioned, who can be given everything on a silver platter, they might have the wealth and the luxury, but that doesn't mean that they are happy or fulfilled. They too might hate themselves and the lives they live. For those people who's lives consist mostly of surviving day to day and prioritizing their time and energy on basic needs, they can still lead happy lives. Life is what you make of it. Find the simple things that bring you joy. It doesn't have to be career related, or identity related, but simple things that light up your soul.

4th dimension,1716345351.0,"
I feel like I must be going crazy, I spend most of my days crying over having to be alive, and not in the way that most people would. It's been like this for months, I'm so alone in my thoughts. I cry because I'm already dead, and always dead. I'm always alive, I'll always have not been born. Every state of me that has or will exist does exist. I can't do it. I don't know how to explain this to anyone, I worry no-one understands. I just try to ignore these thoughts but it's so painful, it hurts. I'm getting it all wrong. I'm fucking up every one of me. I want it over with, I want to be dead but it would be all for nothing, I'm already dead. I want to burn every inch of my body, I want to feel all the pain in the universe. I always wonder what's happening now in the ""future"". What I'm thinking of now. Am I thinking of me now? It's all already over, I've already lived my life and I don't even know what I've done. I haven't grown old but I already have. I'm terrified I'll blink and I'll be dying. I'll have missed every second in between, I don't know where I'll have gone. How is everyone ok living like this? I wish I'd never understood the 4th dimension. I can handle depression but this is something much more sinister, it's like a sick fucking game. I am in the middle of an incredibly sick game. I must be being punished, I must have done something wrong. I can't do this. I can't do it. I'm (almost) mute in person, everyone says I seem empty, like I barely have any thoughts running through me. I don't speak because I don't know how I could possibly get this out. I'd sound insane. I'm not insane, I must be more sane than anyone else in the world to feel the way I do. This is horrific. I don't know what entity could possibly be so evil as to do this to someone. This is a sick game and I have no way of getting out. Dying isn't a way out of this, it's simply a continuation. This will never end. Nothing will ever end. I think I must already be in hell, because this truly is eternal torture. I'm being tortured every second of every day and I will be until the end of time, there is no end of time. There's no beginning. We go through one way but time has no ways, THIS IS SICK. Some SICK FUCKS. I'm so alone.

Everybody eventually calls me crazy and idk why and I ask and I feel like people just won't tell me,1716345339.0,"Like.  It's to the point where idk if everyone just says that about everyone and I don't so it holds more weight when said about me, I pick bad friends, or I'm actually just insane and can't tell. 

I've spoken to therapists for a long long long time, multiple over the years, typically they say that they can't see why but it's difficult because they dint see me interacting with others, and the only perspective is mine. 

Some things I do know. 

My mood can fluctuate with my energy levels and pain levels so some days I'm bubbly and some days I'm short, nit mean or grumpy, just low energy.  I try really hard to communicate this with people but it doesn't seem to help. I feel misunderstood a lot so lately I've had word vomit overexplaining shit, going to pull back on that because I feel like it's making it worse. 

I cut people off after trying to communicate a boundary or issue and still getting treated the same way.  Often, though, after having the same conversation multiple times I'll just pull back real hard, real suddenly. I can see this adding to seeming inconsistent. 

I can cry very easily. I can seem emotionally reactive. I often just need some time to let it out, however due to fear of other people's reaction to me crying I tend to try to do this alone.  This adjustment seems to have not helped how I'm perceived at all.  But when I try to be more open I'm told I'm attention seeking or lying.  So.

How bad do I have to feel to go off an antidepressant?,1716340631.0,"I just started taking escitalopram (I’m taking cipralex but it’s also, and even more commonly, sold under “lexapro”) recently, I’m about at the two week mark now and I feel really bad emotionally. It’s suspected I may have ocd and my intrusive thoughts have been really running rampant (I can’t remember a time before where they’ve been this persistent), as well as my general anxiety, it’s been really rough especially during the past couple days.

However I also have very poor emotional permanence, so it’s hard for me to recall how I felt before I started this medication, but I know I feel bad now and I really don’t think it was this bad before. It obviously wasn’t good before either (why I started antidepressants LOL) but it definitely has not improved AT ALL and if anything has gotten worse. 

I obviously know the side effects of escitalopram, one of them being that it can make you feel worse emotionally (as with most antidepressants), but I’m just not sure how bad I’m supposed to let it be before I say “that’s enough” and go off of it? I’ve never been on an antidepressant before so I’m not sure if it’s a thing where like it can make you feel worse for a bit before it makes you feel better? I’m only on 5mg right now (the lowest dose) so I can stop taking it without immediately consulting my doctor. I’ll also mention I haven’t experienced any other side effects (like headaches, nausea, etc.)

How to deal with pre-work dread and fear of leaving the house? Please help,1716339920.0,"Long story short, I've had a dozen jobs that haven't worked out for me due to severe anxiety. I'm 32 now and got part-time job at a dollar store for very few hours. I thought it'd be perfect, since I'd only have to go in 2 times a week for like 4-5 hours.

Well, today was supposed to be my first shift. It was only for 4 hours and yet, I panicked. It happened the same way it always does. Last night especially, I started feeling serious dread. I tossed and turned all night and kept waking up in a panic, thinking about my shift today. This morning, I felt even worse. I couldn't stop crying and felt nauseous. I get so scared to leave the house.

I ended up calling and making some excuse as to why I couldn't come in. I don't think I've technically lost my chance at this job yet, so I really want to try to see if I can get to my next scheduled shift in 2 days. I need serious advice for this.

The worst part is that I KNOW that 9 times out of 10 for me personally, once I'm actually THERE, I'm usually okay. I'm anxious, sure, but it's manageable. The anticipation anxiety and the dread are what get me every. single. time. I'm tired of losing jobs due to this. I'm a hard worker and wouldn't consider myself lazy.

I guess my question is, does anyone know of any tips or techniques to help me with the anxiety and dread feelings I have while still at home?

The process of getting mentally prepared, going to sleep at a certain time for my shift, waking up, showering, getting dressed, packing up, leaving the house, getting in the car and driving there seem more stressful sometimes than the actual shift. I'm embarrassed to admit this. It's like this instantaneous anxiety that I can't even tell where it stems from. It sometimes feels like even if the house was on fire, I wouldn't be able to get myself leave. It feels like some invisible barrier is keeping me from leaving and it's like my anxiety is fine with whatever repercussions, as long as I don't have to go to work.

Any advice would be so helpful, thank you in advance.",LaughLost936,,False,1cxo0nt,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cxo0nt/how_to_deal_with_prework_dread_and_fear_of/

*currently taking risperidone 0.75mg (~1.5yr), zoloft 75mg (~1.5yr), wellbutrin xr 150mg (~4mo)

- need to sleep takes over all logical thought in the moment 
- no matter how hard i try, i just can't overcome this. is it a problem with willpower? 
- ever since ive started taking wellbutrin i've been waking up early every day (7-9am) however i almost always end up falling back asleep. i still feel extremely tired when i wake up regardless of how long ive slept. other than that, i don't usually wake up at all during the night

My mom doesn’t understand the point of rest,1716336276.0,"I was in the airport all day yesterday, from 5:30 in the morning to midnight. I ended up crying, had a migraine, and threw up from the stress of flying on standby. I feel like the stress is still in my body, as I’ve been eating weird all day. I’m exhausted to say the least. I’ve been working on considering rest productive so I’ve mostly been resting today.

I wanted to go out to an open mic night and walk around with a friend tomorrow, which would help me reset, but my mom says I need to clean my room. I need to sort out my bookshelf, dust everything (which I hate so I know it’s going to take longer), and vacuum. Now instead of being able to rest, I’m stressed about thinking that I can’t leave the house until I force myself to do things I can’t stand on a very low battery level. I feel like anything I do is wrong; either I make myself sick cleaning and feed into her weird toxic productivity or I rest but stay in the house for days.

On top of that, my week is pretty packed. Thursday I have a reunion with friends I haven’t seen in a while. If I can’t see them they’ll be reschedule but be slightly annoyed. Friday and Saturday I’m moving a family friend out, and I’m going to need the mental energy for that. Saturday I’m also having a picnic with other friends. I was going to bake something. Having a day of peace would have been really nice. 

A friend of mine offered to come over and help but I’m really bad at assigning tasks to people or asking for help.

Losing physical sensation,1716335748.0,"When I’m sad I lose most of my physical sensations along with fears.

Extra info: 20, m, never used to be empathetic at all but it’s improved a lot.

I go from being the most ticklish person I’ve ever known (including more ticklish than kids), to not reacting at all. I can feel that I’m being touched when I’m tickled, but my body doesn’t react or feel any kind of way about it. 
I go from loving physical touch from my girlfriend, it brings tingles through my entire body when she rubs just my arm etc… to not feeling any tingles or pleasure, I can tell I’m being touched but it doesn’t feel good.
I usually love soft materials, but once I’m sad, these materials don’t make me feel good. 
My fear of the dark, suddenly vanish’s.
Any physical pain, I suddenly either can’t notice or barely notice. 
My chest goes from feeling full, to feeling hollow like I could put my hand through it to the other side or alternatively it feels heavy, gritty and smokey with a subtle sense of adrenaline but I’m not sure.
When I’m sad I can stay awake for 35 hours straight at a time, my eyes might feel like they need a rest, but staying up becomes no problem.

People don’t understand 
The loudness of the mind
So loud that it almost seems to stop time
It’s overwhelming
Overbearing 
Like the words aren’t mine
Yet here I stay, frozen,
As my brain starts to untwine 

My muscles, they freeze
Like I have some disease.
But no one seems to understand me. 
I can barely talk
I can’t even walk
I just sit there and cry 
As my mind seems to rot 

My limbs they go numb
And then I become 
Like an infant that just started sucking its thumb. 

I feel so damn helpless
Embarrassed and scared 
But no matter what, it seems that I’m never prepared

Has never seen

It wants to hurt me and punish me, 
Until my body drips red.

I plead and plead for it to stop hurting me. 
But it says “That won’t happen, I’ll do as I please.”
I don’t deserve to have fun. I don’t deserve to have friends.

These thoughts keep getting proven, over and over again. 
By people that I thought used to be my friends.

At this point I should just listen to my head. 
There’s no point in fighting, when it has no end. 
The voices don’t stop, my stomach it drops. 
I look at this platform, I’m about to step off.
Will I finally get relief? Will I be able to have peace?
I feel happy, until I think about people’s grief. 

Will they miss me? Will they cry, standing at my grave?
Will they think about all the memories that we had made? 
I don’t want them to think that this is their fault.

A love/hate relationship with Daydreaming,1716333261.0,"I M19 daydream, I doubt that many people would ever consider this an issue with mental health but I promise I will get there. I'm a screenwriter with an imagination about 5x the size of my confidence. For years I have struggled with anxiety and depression so badly that in order to enjoy any part of my life all I would do in the day was daydream. I would dream about a life where I was famous, rich, in love, had a family so on. Until recently I met someone, a girl who is clearly very important to me. I say this because all I do in the day is daydream about her, I still daydream about everything else that I dreamed about but now It has to include her. My problem was that I would daydream so much that after a while the lines began to blur. The other day whilst out with her and some friends she tried to get my attention and in response I called her 'my love' it was the first but not the last time I did that. This week I went away for family reasons, looked at starting to get my life on track. Eating better, losing weight, improving my personal hygiene, dress sense, buying a new aftershave, all in the hopes to mature. I was able to sit down and write a draft script in 3 days because all I did was stop procrastinating and just concentrated. 

I managed to stop daydreaming entirely. I used to tell my friends that daydreaming is the worst, because you create these worlds in your head were everything is perfect but when you wake, you are faced with the reality that your life still sucks and none of it was real. Now that I no longer daydream I am almost more miserable than I was when I did. I dont know why I am so miserable all of a sudden, I got what I wanted but ended up worse off. All of the things I have been struggling with seem to have resurfaced despite the fact that I have worked so hard to find ways to cope and ways to help myself stay positive. Why is it that daydreaming can feel so dangerous but like a drug I am addicted to the high.

My biweekly diary post 😂,1716332792.0,"Hi guys, I always feel just a smidge better after posting so I’ll go ahead and debrief where my current state of mind is.

I’m 26 F, personal injury lawyer. I love being a plaintiffs lawyer, fighting big insurance companies. Cause fuck them ya know. I’ve done this for 6 years and just became licensed about 1.5 yrs ago. I work part time because tbh the job was draining me mentally and emotionally. And I feel like I have a perfect balance. One day the firm I work for will go full time but tbh I’m trying to keep that at bay as long as I can. I can do everything I need to timely.

I am currently going through fertility treatment. It’s sad bc I never in my life thought that I would have to undergo treatment to have a baby. I was recently diagnosed with PCOS which is very common but it’s brought on a slew of medical bills and just bad thoughts. Esp because my family used to joke that I was the career lady, not destined to have kids. I’ve kind of made my peace with that narrative but I can’t wait to have a baby! I’m a cancer and I know that my life will be so much more purposeful, and I’ll feel more confident as a *woman*

I love my fiancé so much. He is a genuine sweet person, so smart and patient. But he can be a little cold sometimes. I’m actively trying to accept that he chose me and I chose him. I don’t want to second guess myself or him or our relationship but. I feel like Ive been doing so much of that. Idk if it’s because of my upbringing (my mom was very unstable and I adopted a lot of those traits, drinking and drugs at an early age)  or were incompatible or just too many things going on at on time this season.

Additionally, my circle feels smaller than ever. I was a cheerleader for 11 years. Then law school and once I graduated, it’s like my imaginary audience or friends disappeared. I’m solo dolo. It’s funny what the ego can do to you.

I’m just a young lady trying her best. But I often feel lost and/ or alone. And I realize that no one cares. 😔/😃

I failed do set a boundary and now I hate myself for it. Please help me decide what to do next,1716331211.0,"I just had someone message me asking if they can post a meme they made in a group chat that has 70+ people in it. Not gonna go into detail but basically the meme was making fun of me for a decision that I made and I how its similar to decisions i’ve made a few times before.

Gonna be honest I didn’t want them to post it. I looked at it and thought about it for an entire 5 minutes and I wanted to say no, but then I worried that I was being too sensitive and that my sensitivity was ruining their fun. I started overthinking about what they might think of me and worried that they might not feel comfortable making jokes around me anymore if I said no, so I let them post it. I was initially going to title this post “I’m way too sensitive to jokes and I feel like it makes people not want to be around me” because things like this have happened before and I always feel like I *shouldn’t* be upset about the thing that I’m upset about.

But at this point I don’t care about the joke itself - Now I’m just fucking kicking myself for not setting a boundary like I should’ve. All I had to do was say no. I didn’t even have to give an explanation. I could’ve just replied “No” and the person would’ve understood because they’re respectful with boundaries, but I didn’t and now it’s too late. Asking them to delete it looks too suspicious to everyone in the group chat.

This shit just makes me so furious. I hate that other people are allowed to set boundaries all they want against me and yet I *can’t* do it back to them, because if I do, then I end up regretting it and soiling the friendship and things are worse for me overall. This has happened to me multiple times in the past. Either I do nothing about what’s bothered me and build resentment, or I set a boundary and end up regretting it because it’s made the friendship awkward and made them less comfortable making jokes around me. Sometimes I think the former is GENUINELY better. I do remember a time in my life where someone was disrespecting me, yet when I think back on it I just think to myself “thank *God* i didn’t set a boundary about that” because I think that doing so would’ve soiled that friendship.

It just makes me so sad because I feel like this is common in my life, in multiple groups. I can tell that when certain people speak to me that they’re more respectful and less jokey that they are around other people and it makes me feel like we’re not really friends or that there’s some kind of distance between us, and it makes me feel bad because it feels like I’ve stunted them and that I’m not fun to be around. It makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me.

I don’t know what to do now. People are reacting to the meme and making fun of it and I just have to take it. I don’t feel like I’m allowed to get mad at it because I said yes. If this is still bothering me by tomorrow then I want to tell them how I feel about this and how I think I should’ve said no, but I’m worried that I’m only doing that to make them feel guilty as a way of getting back at them for hurting me. 

TLDR: I wanted to set a boundary but I didn’t because I convinced myself that I was being way too sensitive, and now I regret not setting the boundary and have built up resentment towards myself and the other person.

Inlove with a fictional character ,1716329265.0,"When I was 10 I had a crush on my favorite cartoon character (adult) and I had a collection of its merch. As I grew older I started to get over it before turning 18, maybe at 16 I think. 

At 21 I started working, a year later I got married, had a child who is 5 now and got separated in 2021. Now I’m 28 and I recently found a movie about the show on Netflix. I thought it was gonna be funny remembering how I had a crush on this character when I was kid/teen but now I have a crush on him again, the same crush I had in my childhood. I brought few accessories again like phone case, keychain, plush, making paintings etc. There are nights that I have romantic dreams and it’s wonderful, makes my day. It’s not that I’m gonna stop dating over this, but it feels so much better feeling inlove at the same time no one upsetting me, no conflicts, no drama after I went through this so many times in mi past relationships.

How can I (22M) heal from this experience?,1716321714.0,"I (22M) have been seeking therapy to properly be able to set boundaries. I never really knew how to set boundaries with others. I’ve been described as a push over by others, not just in romantic relationships but with friendships and family. That being said, I have a core wound that I cannot eliminate no matter how much I try. I had a romantic connection with a woman (22F) who wasn’t available for me emotionally in what I had to offer her. We met at the airport in the summer of 2022 and she came really strong onto me, saying she fell in love at first sight, told me about her mental health history upon meeting her, and started treating me as her boyfriend the day we started talking. She would text me all day and get mad if I didn’t text her, but she would also pick fights and ask for space (to which she said had I given her space she would’ve stopped talking to me), that she was putting a barrier between her heart and me because of her trust issues and getting hurt, and that she was scared this wasn’t going to workout because we were long distance (two continents away), so it didn’t matter trying: “let’s just talk and see how things turn out”. She warned me that when things aren’t perfect (rose coloured), she tends to walk away to avoid getting hurt. I asked if she would do that for me and she said probably love, these things really scare me. 

But she kept picking fights, kept nit picking stuff about me: “you’re not as independent as I hoped because I really value my independence as I cared for myself as a kid. My mom abused me and my parents were never there for me”. Ultimately, 3 months in she never wanted to commit to me because of distance and all the issues, she said she was too difficult of a partner, became distant and ghosted me after an argument. She came back after I apologized and would give me mixed signals by flirting but being cold, being distant, saying she wasn’t gonna treat me as a priority anymore, and her behaviour was a full 180 from what she gave me in the beginning. She went from loving to intermittently cold. Her voice sounded different too. I wanted the person whom I connected with at the beginning but never could. She eventually told me everything was too much for her after I asked to plan a vacation together, due to all the obstacles etc. But maybe in the future stuff would be different. I respected that and wished her the best. I offered to be her friend only. We talked again but I told her no matter the feelings I had for her, if she didn’t want anything with me, not even in the future, I totally understood and that that’s fine. She said: “it’s not that I don’t want it, it’s that it’s too complicated for me right now” but she started flirting again saying: “when we’re married I’ll take you here”, or “love”. 

We talked on and off. She would disappear for a few days and come back flirting. Then again until I had enough and told her strictly friends. She got upset and said that that’s what we had agreed on, nothing more, but that she’s glad that I can see how difficult it was for more as she had already told me before. And then she stopped talking to me for two months but would put me on her private story on Instagram. Eventually I reached out to check in and I asked her why she didn’t say anything to my previous message and she said that she was upset so she didn’t listen to my message of farewell. Regardless, same thing happened. I tried to be her platonic friend, but she would start flirting with me, I would flirt back. But this time, despite being cold (she suffers from depression and anxiety), she didn’t get mad at me. I learnt about her traumas, she was more open with me, and even helped me with stuff. I told her I was looking for something serious. She would flirt and make it seem like that’s what she wanted too, but would still disappear etc. Until I asked her if she wasn’t interested in talking because of her disappearing, that that’s okay. I just wanted honesty because I don’t like getting led on. She said she was interested and she feels the same way for me but that she’s not on her phone and forgets to reply to people. She said “I honestly think you’re really cute and super super respectful.” Regardless, eventually, I did learn that she’s hurt because her ex cheated on her (that’s why she has trust issues) and she told me she has a fear of commitment. What happened was that this uncertainty of us (it was a situationship) caused me a lot of anxiety. I asked her what we were and she said: “we’re friends, that’s what we said no?” “On that day.”. I told her I was confused because we flirted etc. And she said that “because of distance it’s not right time. I’m busy with school and so is she. But hopefully in the future we can be together. That’s always how I’ve seen it. I haven’t been thinking about it because I’ve focused on work”. I said okay, we clarified just friends (what I wanted) and she started saying farewell and that she wished me all the best. 

Next day she messaged me saying she didn’t tell me something and was scared to. That she liked someone near her and hasn’t come to terms with her feelings. I told her I understood and asked if she was gonna commit. She said not yet because she is scared of commitment. 

I wished her the best. She still kept engaging as a friend, as did I, but eventually she stopped talking to me, removed me from her stories (I asked her and she said she didn’t do anything, etc. Unhid me and hid me back). Eventually she unhid me. But I checked out even from the friendship. I thought this was too much of a rollercoaster and despite wanting to be there for her, even as a friend because I knew how hard her life was (I wanted to be there for her to listen to her and even told her that), but her mixed behaviour and signals really hurt me. She still tries to engage by liking my stories etc. But I unfollowed her. I’m not interested in her, but I can’t deny that this experience didn’t fuck me up mentally. I’m sort of scared of meeting others, although I will acknowledge that I missed red flags that my friends of both genders told me I missed (love bombing, trauma dumping, etc). 

I’ve been told she fits the criteria of avoidant attachment (hyper independence, avoids conflict and communication, fear of commitment), which I see as an explanation for her behaviour but regardless it really did hurt me. I don’t really care what the reason was, avoidant or not. I just want to heal and be loved.

I’ve hated myself my entire life and I don’t know how to fix it,1716321949.0,"I have hated myself for as long as I can remember, as I was constantly reminded that I was different and not in a good way. Now in adulthood, everyone is different and it doesn’t seem to matter quite as much but I still hate myself because I’m not who I want to be and I’ve put in the work to get there, but still hate myself. 

I hate my face and the way I look in general. Sure, there are things I appreciate. Sure, I recognize I’m not butt ugly but I’m not beautiful and I wish I was so deeply. I’m not even fashionable, just regular. 

I hate that I’m not strong enough or fit enough, I work out a few days a week and I’m generally active and try to walk a mile a day if I don’t work out. I’m not fat but I’m not strong, thin or fast. I’m average or below. I’m okay at the things I wish I was amazing at. Hiking, skiing, etc. so much so that I cry sometimes when I do it because I realize I will never be great. 

I tried for years to be “smart” getting near perfect grades at the expense of my mental health. Obsessing over it. And I’ll never be smart. Sure I’m not dumb, but I hate myself for not being smart. I hate that I’ll never be the top performer at my job and I’ll never be wealthy. I used to think after all those years of misery that I’d be worth something in the end. 

I will never be artistic. Maybe I’m average or a little above, but nobody will ever look at my photos or my art and say WOW, that is an artist.

I hate the anxiety and the constant social missteps. I don’t quite understand the rules although I’ve worked for years to try. I’m quite personable because I know the formula, but I’ve never had a group of girl friends and I’ve always wanted one and I hate myself for that. I hate that I cry when someone tells me their dog died, even though I’ve never met their dog. I hate that I cry at sad movies now, it never used to be this way. 

My true favorite thing is the outdoors. I wish I could be one of those outdoorsy people on Instagram that are always looking beautiful and strong in a beautiful place, but I will never be that girl because I’m unremarkable in every way. 

I hate myself for being a people pleaser to the point where I’d let them break my back walking on it so their feet don’t touch the ground and get dirty. I hate feeling weak and desperate. 

I hate myself for being unremarkable and for not becoming what I wish I was. Sure, I’m okay at it all but I wanted to be something exceptional. I thought maybe it would make this all worth it. 

I’ve been in therapy since I was a child and I’m in therapy currently, they tell me to focus on what I am good at and the strengths I do have but it’s just not good enough. I’m mediocre at best. I will never be looked up to, I will never be proud of myself, and nobody else will ever really be proud of me. I’m doing what I’m supposed to and not failing, but to me that seems like a pointless existence especially if it’s this much work to maintain mediocrity. I thought if I had to be so painfully different, I should at least be different in an exceptional way. I’m just different in the average, everyday outcast/loser way.

(Rant)

So, summing up, I'm about to start throwing things around (not at anyone or anything in specific)

I'm tired of just seeing the calendar advance both on work and at school, and it seems like the amount of stuff I have done is still the same

I'm doing a group assignment that it seems like the closer I get to it's delivery date the less stuff I see working, I'm about to ask my teacher tomorrow to just see if it's possible to just add my colleague to another group so he doesn't get thrown under the bus because of the major screw up I've managed to make of our assignment, so I can just say f*ck it and do this damn subject next year so i can try to keep myself from going mental

I've made a small analysis of this year so far, and it seems like the only thing I've seen go well is when I went for vacation for a few days with the missus  h

My mom needs to retire medically?
Yeah, everyone seems to agree with that except the people that need to make that decision, and of course we had to go around to tons of places and make tons of phonecalls trying to do that

Need paperwork for school? Sure let's have to ask someone for that every single week and only get it after a few months

Need some schedules for work so you can do your tasks, sure get them a few months late, and have triple the work because of it

Need stuff to make the work magazine, yup, get the things at the last minute and it seems like this year it's everyone's last worry so it's gonna end up being the same person having to speed run everything

I can’t seem to function.,1716326715.0,"I’m a 22 year old male and work 12 hour shifts in a warehouse. I did excel in high school with straight As and 5s on AP exams, but personal circumstances didn’t allow me to attend university so the warehouse is where I’m at right now.

Overall my life is okay. I have a healthy diet, I’m in a good relationship, I’ve got my finances under control, so on. My problem is that it feels like I have this constant tension in my brain that won’t go away, and I’m incapable of being productive at home.

It feels like the tiniest things cause me some sort of tension in the brain. Disorganized bedroom? Tension, I hate it and need it organized. Focused on something and someone tries to talk to me? Tension, I cannot multitask and want left alone to concentrate.

And the worst part is that these things easily combine, leading to where I feel like my brain is about to explode. When this happens all I want is for everything and everyone to shut up and leave me alone. But I normally just bottle it up because I don’t know what else to do - ie I don’t want to ask my girlfriend “please stop talking” when she hasn’t actually done anything wrong and it’s just me with some inner problem going on, I definitely don’t want to make her feel like she’s done something wrong or as if I don’t like being around her. I bottle in the tension and try to go about things normally, but it’s exhausting.

This leaves my “brain tension” levels sky high practically 24/7, which makes it feel impossible for me to get anything done and I’m always tired with no remedy. When I do get time to myself where I want to be productive, I find myself just stuck frozen in time on my phone. I’ll scold myself in my head and try so hard to get up and get into the groove of something, but constantly just end up back where I started as if my brain is incapable of doing anything except attempt to recharge. My attempts to recharge come from either mindless scrolling social media reels, or hyper-focusing on something interesting to me at the moment - which unfortunately is never the things I actually need to get done. Ie most recently I went down a rabbit hole regarding dietary intervention to lower LDL and cardiovascular disease risk. Nothing relevant to my to-do list.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, or how to fix it. I know hyper-focusing on the wrong things is a sign of ADHD, but don’t think I have that as I have never been hyper-active throughout my life and I excelled back in high school without medication. And I don’t usually have that hard of a time concentrating on things, my brain doesn’t bounce from one thing to the next to the next like the people with ADHD I know. I just have a hard time getting up and actually doing anything, constantly frozen in time with a never-ending feeling of brain tension, which I guess might be what people call overstimulation.

"No matter how much sleep I get, Im still tired. Why?",1716326546.0,"Before I start, I’m a 17F If that helps with anything! 🥲

Like the title says, No matter how much I sleep, I am STILL tired. 

Idk if its because of my lack of sleep in school days when I usually sleep at around 11pm-1am, but It’s not THAT late for someone my age, and should it affect my sleep that much? 

Last week I had school for 4 days, and not 5 as usual, and on those 4 days I had slept at like 3 am on most of them..

I’ve searched up what the causes could be, and it said: «The bottom line is that feeling groggy after what you thought was a well-rested slumber is not unusual. In fact, there can be many underlying reasons why you feel so fatigued, including nutrient deficiency, high stress and anxiety levels, hormonal imbalance, and other medical conditions.» 

And I thought like, yeah maybe its because of my lack of sleep in the school days I had?

 So I used the night of Friday to Saturday of sleeping off my lack of sleep, and I did feel like it was VERY needed in the morning.. I even slept early, and woke up at like 2.30pm (Which I usually dont, so I guess thats a good sign of good sleep).

But after that from Saturday til Sunday, I went to bed early again, slept until my friend woke me up, at like 11am, and when I came home after like 1 hour of being outside I went to sleep again RIGHT AWAY. 

After that I slept the whole day from Sunday to Monday (Today) and that was ABOVE 11 hrs of sleep.. 

I woke up at 7am on monday cz I thought it was school, but then some friends of mine told me we dont have school.., and I then fell asleep til 4pm, and even after that much sleep from Saturday to Sunday, and THEN from sunday to Mondays sleep I’m still so fricking tired. 

Idk Its kinda crazy how tired I was on monday bc I slept the WHOLE day before that. I slept for hella long.

Even after waking up today I felt like sleeping some more bc Im so tired. Is this normal?? I feel like I could sleep even more if I could, but my dad would also be disappointed if i sleep and do nothing (Even tho i dont).

I have a severe issue with my mentality. I am trying my best to be as intelligent as possible and my life is starting to fall apart. From simple losses in games, activities to not being able to answer a question, I get so mad and furstrated that my headache returns and my worry is that I wont be able to be a powerbank of a thought. I have tried to enhance my mind in a sense, to never forget any single bit of info I learn or to never fail in any activity I do and to be the best at anything at all times and never ever fail in anything. I also have tried my best to do anything in my own power so that I wont look up any YouTube videos or reference to feel assisted, so that I can be proud that atleast I acheived something on my own understanding. 

Now I am suffering like a nation that once used to be a long survived and ruled dynasty and now is just a pile of nothing on the map. Losing a Forza race or not being able to drift in a car game and constantly flying out of a track race is making as much as raged as a construction contractor would be mad when the team piled down a nice house foundation. Please help me. I dont know how else to explain this. But I will do this way, ""Its like they took me out of a perfect person and locked me in the skin of a imperfect person"" Thats how I feel like.

Help! 10 year old explosive and verbally abusive! Mom in the verge of breakdown!!!,1716325434.0,"10 year old verbally abusive, explosive, has tics. Mom beside herself and on the verge on a nervous breakdown.

This isn't the typical ""asking for a friend"" post...I really am asking for a friend. A friend I know has a 10 year old daughter, 5 year old daughter and 17 year old step son. The two girls live together with my friend and het husband (the girls' dad) and the step son lives with his mom. This friend has expressed to me over time some of the things going on with her 10 year old and I am becoming increasingly worried about my friend's well-being dealing with all this as well as what could possibly be going on with her daughter. Her daughter CONSTANTLY tells my friend to f*** off or f*** you and is angry and threatening and demeaning from sun up to sun down. The minute my friend taps her to wake up in the morning she will say ""get your hands off me"" or ""don't touch me"" and my friend occasionally get a frustrated and teary eyed with these verbal beat downs and her daughter will say ""oh you're gonna cry now mom?"" In a snotty tone. She'll call my friend ""stupid"", ""dumb"", and has threatened to tell her teachers if my friend tries to spank or discipline her. Yet this little girl has been kicked out of school multiple times. Yes! Kicked out!! And the classroom has had to be cleared and the cops have had to be called more than once because of her behavior. She has told her mom she's ""going to kill"" her and will sometimes tell her mom ""why don't you just kill me"". Her daughter currently takes adderall for adhd and trazadone for sleep but has been on multiple other meds off and on with the same results. She has documented every incident the school has told her about and has given the school additional information about the situation at home. And she has given her daughter's psych medication provider all the information as well and left multiple voicemails when incidents come up to let the provider know and it is hardly ever addressed, even in the next appointment. 

I am a nurse and have a little experience in Psych and I am just appalled that this poor mother has been left to sink or swim by the school and the mental health providers. And yet, next, social services will be contacted and it will be the mother who gets the finger pointed at her or it already is because I'm sure most people just see this as a parenting issue ( which we all know means we deserve as parents to suffer for...NOT). This isn't just a parenting issue from what I can see and hear about. And this poor mom is going to absolutely snap if she doesn't get someone respond to her cries for help soon. I am so fed up with the mental health manifesto in America yet here we have a mom who has all the facts and evidence laid out and people just want to point the finger and say deal with it. As a result this mom is suffering a rapid mental health decline as well and so the cycle will continue. 

I have interrogated thoroughly and observed and talked to others who know her even better and her husband is not adding to the problem or modeling any of the daughters behavior by being abusive but he is a war vet who watched his buddy get blown up in the seat next to him in Iraq and he's not much help with the situation either. She said he pretty much dissociates on his phone and tunes it all out. Occasionally he'll speak up and tell the daughter she is out of line but doesn't nothing to follow up or be consistent in earning her or monitoring her behavior to and around her mom. 

I also thought of PANDAS but I don't know the full extent of whether or not this child has had a recent strep infection or a latent /hidden one but she does have tics that appear and disappear very suddenly sometimes like noises or shoulder shrugging and the way she uses profanity and blares it out unprovoked sometimes, one would think she has turrets as well. 

My friend needs to advocate for her daughter and get some answers and she has. But it seems like no one is pointing her in any direction. I don't know if she's been fully transparent with how bad things are but she says she has. If that's true, why is no one listening and stepping in to help this mom and daughter. I want to advocate for this friend so she can advocate for her daughter but what resources/treatments do you think might help and what direction would you go first /next with something like this. 

I'm afraid someone in this family is going to snap!

Why am I sometimes physically violent?,1716324733.0,"I’m a 28 year old woman. 
I’m generally a very chilled person, have a lot of friends, loved by many. Only the very close family members have seen this side of me. Sometimes when I feel injustice, extremely hurt, undermined or ignored/stonewalled.. I sometimes get this anger out through physical violence. I can slam something so hard, strain my leg so hard that I hurt myself and in some cases it can come out towards the person infront of me by pushing them violently/hitting them etc. 

I regret it straight away. There and then. I never felt like it was ok or right to do but it feels like something is possessing me in that moment and suddenly I snap out of it. I get apologetic straight away and I cry and I feel hurt and hate towards myself and my action. In the moment though, the anger gets too much that I don’t think straight and it comes out like that.
I have suffered through mild depression in the past and I think I MIGHT have ADHD but never got diagnosed. I’ve had psychiatrists and counsellors in the past who just said I have mild depression but does depression make you act like this?

I did suffer a bit of domestic violence when I was younger (but nothing too bad, my parents are amazing!). But my dad used to also be very bad at controlling his anger so maybe it’s genetic. 

What could this be? I feel like surely this isn’t normal. It’s really negatively affecting my marriage as I’ve gotten out of control a few times towards my husband too. I apologise straight away, but still, the damage is done.

I can't get a grasp on who I am.,1716323672.0,"This is a lot and I am sorry in advance for not being able to tldr this. i dont know whats going on. From a very young age I was taught a lot of things concerning how to treat people. The do's the don'ts and everything in between right? So I've led a lot of my life with those values being put first and then naturally I learned what a lie was. I never forgot and overtime I keep learning that people can do such horrible things and mask it all with a smile. Watching my mother go through things and seeing her say ""It's okay, you just gotta be strong."" is where it started. The silent urge in the back of my head to ""be strong"". I started to become obsessed with it and a lot of unhealthy practices started. At first I thought it was about knowledge so I became that ""know it all prodigy"" and found that I still got hurt by things. Then it was onto the next definition. And the next. And the next. I started exploring every single version of ""strength"" I could by putting myself in positions where I would get horribly hurt for doing something. All so I could try to teach myself the kind of strong that I thought would make me ""invincible"". No I never asked for help. Instead I wrote journal entries that were filled with manic ramblings about the one emotion I couldn't seem to wrap my head around. Being a teenage boy that was obviously love. I found a girl who I fell in love with, truly. We will call her Six. She gave me hell. I have never been in more mental anguish then when I was dealing with her. She had been treated horribly too by life and she was in shambles. I thought it an act of love to try to help her. ""I can fix her"" basically. The journey of ""teaching myself"" really started when I met her. From the age of 12 till now I spent so much time with her being used, manipulated, and hurt over and over and then going back to try and figure out where I went wrong.

I was laser focused on this. Surely someone else could see what I saw out of the world right? Someone had to.

I branched out and began dealing with other girls in my vicinity, emotionally experimenting with them to pick up bits and pieces to the puzzle of my twisted ""bigger picture"". And I forgot. I forgot every single girl I dealt with that wasn't her or an actual friend. Overtime, the initial goal of learning actually faded. I forgot it entirely because someone told me that I was hurting myself by dealing with her, something I had neglected to accept. I separated from her and as far as reality was concerned, I was a hurt boy being hurt by a hurt girl. I worked on myself and mentally I began to focus on the positivity that my mother initially instilled in me as a child. I stopped dealing with a lot of people and I completely forgot about that whole strength obsession. Might as well have been a phase but no. One heart break via someone else and some time later and now I'm in a new relationship. I was happy with this girl too. She didn't deserve any of what happened next. I found my old journals and I read them because I had forgotten they existed. I got sick a few days after that and it was bad. Like victorian child bad. Convinced that it had something to do with the old journals, I ended up leaving the girl. I felt like she would most certainly get hurt if she kept dealing with me. As fate would have it, I was back to better health in 2 days. I went through senior year with my positive streak, keeping a small crew close so I had friends and I met Six again. She said she changed and I believed her because I still had feelings for her. A relationship started and she put me through the same hell only it didn't take me 6 years to leave. I attempted to help her. I tried to give her everything she needed. I put my best foot forward for her only for her to continue to mistreat me at every turn. I was angry about it. Angry that the one thing I genuinely gave everything to was spitting in my face. I left after 6 months. Let me say that I have never been openly angry to anyone a day in my life until the day I left her. I was yelling in the middle of the road as she had tried to trap me into staying with her by showing up at my job. The thought started after that day. I began openly talking to myself. Poking and prodding at myself to hold her accountable for what she did instead of blaming myself for it. To get a get back or something. I always replied as if I was another person, reprimanding a friend for saying something really concerning. Then I started really paying attention to what I was saying to myself and I realized I was making sense. The negativity that I was speaking out made sense and now I was rushing to my journal to write out another entry. Reading that entry back I am concerned. Titled in bunched up letters, ""iknowtoomuch"" was an essay where I rambled about knowing too much about people and how they perceived life mentally, physically, and spiritually and that I could see people for what they could really be and how I could try to help them become their best selves and if they didnt want to, I would make them. Manipulate them even. I was convinced that I knew some guide to mental perfection and everyone else was the problem for not listening amongst things about hurting people who were labeled as ""failures"" by my standards.

And I am horrified. I can't unsee the words or unhear the things I said. I can't stop thinking about the goals that revealed themselves after I finished reading. The silent agendas in my head that kept telling me to let people use me, to smile and put all of that genuine kindness forth as some sort of weapon that people could use against me. Now I feel that I can't even look at some of my friends because I know they're only here as guinea pigs. People that have been hurt in various ways, sharing all of their problems and experiences with the ""therapist friend"" just so I can learn what makes a person tick at the end of the day. Then I offered them my sincerity by giving them genuine help that could nudge them in the right direction. It always made me happy to find that my thoughts and methods were helping people. Their lives were always perfect after they listened. And then there it is. Even now I'm talking in the same way as before because I can't get it out of my head now.

Am I my mothers son? Someone who helps people because he was raised to? Or am I crazy as hell and forcing my twisted and everchanging ideals on these people? Feigning kindness just to prove that my methods of being ""strong"" can work and that through controlling others I can be strong myself without having to lock my heart away. Whats even worse is that I can't even find a fault in the second statement. To me it sounds right! It sounds just! I don't know what to think anymore.

Then I ask myself, how the hell am I weaponizing being healthy? That part is what doesn't make sense to me. Isn't what I'm doing just helping people? Getting them out of tight spots by telling them better and healthier things to do? That's what it feels like. Then it gets worse. And I remind myself that I wrote;

""I know so much. You. Reading this. I know you. I know you so well that you reading this was something I orchestrated. Every person I interact with, I see every possibility for what or who they truly are. I spend my days worrying about what the next person could do to me. What I could do to them.""

and now I know that I can hurt people as well as help them and the idea that I can just flip the switch becomes intoxicating. Then I'm horrified at myself all over again.",AcceptableImage3506,,False,1cxi22h,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cxi22h/i_cant_get_a_grasp_on_who_i_am/
Is it normal to not remember your childhood,1716323366.0,"Hi, I've been desperate for answers for years and finally decided to give reddit a go

Everyone tells me that no one remembers their childhood, but then they're able to tell stories about it. I can't. I have very very few memories from my life. I am almost 22.

My diagnoses: ADHD, generalised anxiety disorder, depression. I am medicated for all three (only for about 3-4 years) 

I have struggled with mental health and started seeing professionals at age 13. I've been in therapy for many years but had to stop last fall because my financial aid for it ran out.

No professional has ever given me a straight answer. I've always been told it's normal, or have not been taken seriously.

But I can't accept it. I don't remember almost anything. I remember very specific flashes from here and there,  but I don't remember ANYTHING that I could tell a story about. I have a bad memory in general, I forget most things.
 
e.g. I don't remember the names of my online friends from when I was a teenager, but my best friend does even though that was only second hand information to her. I don't remember anything I have done, except for things that there are pictures of, or some other form of proof.

I have never been able to learn the months of the year without saying them all in order first - like I have tried to study many many times which month is the 7th one, but I just can't remember.

I know these sound like small things but I can't explain what I don't remember really

I hate living like this, it feels very scary. I feel like my life is fading behind me as I live it. I had a hard time with my therapist, because when we tried to talk about my past, I couldn't remember anything.

I really need some validation or some suggestions of things to look into. Thank you in advance.",basilikaolivers,,False,1cxhxrk,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cxhxrk/is_it_normal_to_not_remember_your_childhood/

Have you ever had family that fucked up your life? And how did your get over it?,1716319987.0,"I hope it get some support or responses. If your family really screwed over your life what did you do to get over the FEELING?

My family never put time into me or raised me so I had to pickup things on my own. 

Last year I started getting on my feet and I moved. I did have a little hiccup along the way, but given where I came from that was improvement for myself. 

However recently my family has really fucked me up and put me in a bad position. No of my family knows how to do anything, they are too overly involved, only worried about their concerns, and when you do actually need help they either play Casper the friendly ghost or become a rock.

It was distant but we made it happen I went 3 times there and she came 3 times in 6m so, everything was great. 
I was looking for a job and we were discussing for me to find a job where she could also work (I’m in finance so it’s “easier”).

Intense anxiety since moving countries,1716316634.0,"Hello, 35 yo female here, I've just moved countries a month ago and I've been having some pretty intense anxiety, derealization, heart pressure which last for hours sometimes and is quite painful. Last night I even woke up in the middle of the night with a sharpening heart pain and heart beating really fast, and couldn't go back to sleep. I'm quite a stressed person in general but I've never had this high anxiety before. 

For background, I'm someone who has lived in many countries, since I was 2 yo (+ 8 countries) with my expat family and also with two different partners and have never experienced this anxiety before. So I don't really understand whats going on. I'm in a country I've always wanted to move to, I love the surroundings, culture, the weather. I speak the language. I also have a few friends here. It's something I've wanted to do for so long.  Yet I can't help but feel this weird anxiety feeling which is ruining my life since I've moved here. I can't enjoy moments without feeling this anxiety and feeling something is ""off"". 

Has anyone experienced this? And how have you dealt with this ? I'm scared this will never go away and also that I've made the wrong choice and my intuition is trying to tell me something. Also I'm also finding it very difficult to be far away from my family. I miss them a lot and it hurts to be far away from them. This is very new to me. At the same time I left my home country (only lived there 5 years) because I don't really feel I belong there and I connect much more to the culture of the host country I am in. But in a way I do feel like I had to choose between living close to my family and living in a culture I feel more confortable in.

Also, I'm not working at the moment and looking for a job (I have savings)… I also went from having my own place to sharing an appt (rent is too high to live currently alone where I am). Maybe too many changes I don't know...
Would love to hear some advice or hear from experiences...

how can I break free from thoughts about her? ,1716316569.0,"English is not my native language, that's why I apologize in advance for making mistakes. 

I recently got in contact with my ex, who I've been dating for 1.5 years before she left me for another guy because of my awful behavior. They've been together only for 4 months and for that time she's been criticized and abused by this guy and, soon afterwards, they broke up.

For this 4 months, I went through the whole spectrum of negative emotions and intentions, from panic attacks to s****de attempts. When I found out about her breaking up, I immediately suggested my help, moved by my remaining feelings and idea that she doesn't deserve to go through the same stuff I went through. 

It's been around month since I started communicating with her again, but, the further we move, the worse I feel because of my feelings to her. I lost her once and I don't want to lose her again, but it seems like she's not interested in relationships at all for now. I still support her and try to make her life better, but when I'm left alone, all I can feel is pain. 

People around me always telling to focus on people who's still on your side and still support you, but the catch is that I have no one around, except my parents, who's always busy and I don't want to disturb them with my problems. I've got no friends who I can spend time with in attempt to stop thinking about her, or any interlocutors who I can discuss my problem with and because of that, I'm seeing my only way as by staying with her and I would love to, but I still don't know if that's mutual.

Is it normal to be THIS sad after vacation?,1716315704.0,"I have struggled with mental illness my whole life. I have bipolar 2 (no mania just periods of being “normal/productive” with periods of depression) so I don’t know if this is normal or not. 

I just spent a week vacation with my family (literally doing nothing together at a family members house because we’re all poor-just movies and cooking and drinking and talking having a wonderful time when usually I’m visiting family for a stressful event/new baby and it’s jam packed and I don’t ever feel like I got to see anyone for real) and it was so wonderful and relaxing my dad kept telling me how he can just see I’m different and how I look so happy and I really was. 

Well my boyfriend, dad, and I left the other family and had one more day together at my house it was magical. I was already sad to separate from the others but we had such a good 24 hours at my place. I dropped him off at the airport this morning and I feel like I can’t do anything. I feel so sad I’ve been crying all morning and can’t eat. 

I don’t see everyone often we are all very spread out across the country and my boyfriend and I are always working and tight on money so it’s very special that we had this time off and just be together…

My house feels empty and sad and I keep waiting for my dad to be loud and obnoxious (I love it) or cooking for him and my cousins and their dog and just how being together felt. 

I’m supposed to work today but I really don’t think I will I feel like I’m in mourning. Ridiculous because I just had such a good visit with everyone I feel like vacations are supposed to refresh you but instead I’m dreading “real life” again. I can’t understand myself right now.

My boyfriend and I are so happy together, we like our apartment and have two wonderful dogs we love…but I feel miserable today thinking of getting back to life. Nothing is wrong so what is wrong with me?! 

And my dad’s comments about how happy I looked has me wondering is there something I should change about my life but what? 

I guess just our time constraints and tight budget are pretty depressing at times but that’s just life right now…a lot of people go through it.

to those who’s loved ones have unalived themselves,1716314774.0,"If you are left with questions or even unexplainable guilt about someones motives after this happens, you are right to feel that way.

There is likely someone (or multiple people) in your own family or the network of people around your loved one when they were children that destroyed any hope for their self esteem a long time ago, and the more the note talks about “the pain of the world” the closer to home that abusive fuckbag actually is to you.

The person you lost was probably sensitive, and their tormentor took great joy in bullying them.  You might even be married to this person without realizing it.

You kept telling the victim as a child that they’re making too big a deal out of it, you told them they were being too sensitive (which is, you know, something they can’t actually control).

So yes, you deserve to feel guilty about your loved one offing themselves because you helped put them in that state of mind.  Maybe the direct abuse even came from you, but some asinine notion like “bullying is good for you” got put in your head by society, and now this person is dead.

You should feel horrible about it.  They’re gone, and you’re here.  They probably didn’t have kids, so the problem is perpetuated via darwinism.

Now go watch football so you can exercise the part of your brain that feels happy when your army blows up the “filthy dirty people” on the other side of the war.

Pre-2020, I could do anything. I could go anywhere I wanted. I went on dates. I had relationships. I lived on my own for a while. I never missed work, even when I was sick. I took trips down the shore with friends, went to amusement parks and drove states away to visit family.

I began developing symptoms of IBS in early 2020. By January 2021, I ended up in the ER for the first time in my life. Following that, I missed 3 months of work on FMLA. I went the next 2+ years missing about a day of work per 2 weeks. Doctor visits, new medications and new treatments barely helped. Late February of 2024, I had my first major panic attack. I was unable to return to work and went back on FMLA in early March. Fast forward to today and I have less than a week of FMLA left and despite working with a team of doctors as well as a psychologist and psychiatrist, I'm still dealing with daily anxiety that keeps me from leaving the house except for doctor's appointments.

What the hell happened to me? I've become a shell of my former self and don't recognize myself when I look in the mirror. I mean they literally, I used to have a short, clean beard and short, spiky hair. Now, I have a scraggly, disheveled beard and my hair has grown past my mid-back. I spend most of my time sitting in the house with a constantly elevated level of anxiety. I am on medication (45mg Mirtazapine daily and 50mg Hydroxyzine). Every night that I go to sleep I wish that I won't wake up in the morning and I have become a huge proponent of the right to die movement. I don't want to keep living this life if this is what the rest of my existence is going to be like.

Why can't I just convince myself that I'm safe and loved and that my anxiety doesn't have to define me? Why did I go the first 33 years of my life without any major issues other than maybe being a little bit indecisive at times. If I'm not ready to return to work next week, I will lose my job protection and my health benefits. I have no money left due to having no income while on FMLA. I live with my friends right now but what am I supposed to do if I have to go on disability (which I likely wouldn't even be approved for)? Why the fuck is this happening to me? I don't know what I did to deserve this but I'm sorry for anything wrong I may have done in life.

I'm such a fucking loser and piece of shit ,1716310232.0,"[28/M] 

I seriously don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. My entire life is just a series of making bad decisions followed almost immediately by regret. I have no follow through and no motivation to change anything in my life and I'm destined to be a piece of shit forever. 

I have a loving partner who I'm absolutely obsessed with. I'll get drunk and flirt with someone else, or download a hookup app (I don't even message anyone I just want to look???) and immediately feel like shit afterwards. I have absolutely no intention of cheating on him.  I literally don't understand why I'm doing these things. I could quit drinking, but I'm not. I want to, but I'm taking no active steps to do anything about it. 

I have a major spending problem. I used to be very cheap, and had $10k in the bank and a 700 credit score when I was twenty. Now, no exaggerating, I have $47 in the bank, multiple things I let go to collections (I had somehow convinced myself that all I had to do was throw a fit for a bill to go away, and if it went to collections that was teaching THEM a lesson. I am so fucking poor. I work a decent job and make above the average income for where I live. I don't understand where it goes.  I'll have $10 and a bunch of maxed out credit cards to last me from 2 days after payday to the next one. I keep telling myself this isn't sustainable and then not even an hour later I see something I want and immediately buy it. I dont even try to save up or anything.

"im 17, failed my year, do or die exam coming up. Down bad tremendously. addictions/no motivation at all.",1716310478.0,"I am at my lowest point.

From Ukraine, refugee in a European country, above middle-class family by European standards.

From being motivated as fuck for 2024 having around 10k$ in assets, mid relationship with my parents, good grades to finish the semester and a really good mindset, forgetting about how i feel about not being in a place i dont like to call home. I was addiction free except the average vape cigarette yadda yadda, i was making great money online, good in school and had a really good mood 80% of the time.

After the beginning of the second semester I went from doing that good to eventually starting to get myself in a shithole one step at a time (there were a lot of steps). I started gambling heavily, not an average one day bender but now all my money goes on it, of which I have almost none (2k$) left, completely quitting what I did to make money or study and having no motivation to restart. I had periods of alcoholism where I drank up to a bottle of jager in one day. Alone or at parties where I just left after an hour to go back home and rot. My grades are at a low low low!! I suck balls in school, play brawl stars in half the lessons etc. AND on top of all that I dabble in hard drugs which make me go geeked mode and I sit at my desk tweaking balls to not do the shit i have to do and not even think about it, not mega hard shit but light benzos that I mostly get off the dark web. 

Worst of all of this is the gambling problem I have which is literally works like heroin on your brain. I'm fucked for life because i have a developping brain with 6 years of gambling addiction (xandemic type shit).

I get no joy from anything except those sources and long walks, which I still usually have a beer with but even without the beer I enjoy them cuz they feel like an escape.

I am writing this whole thing because opening up is the best thing as everyone tells me but I never do it because I really am embarrassed about this deep hole I dug myself into and am struggling to get out of. I am gonna give myself a ""self diagnosis"" of social anxiety due to me not talking to almost anyone new because i literally start shaking and make things really weird 99% of the time. I do not know where to vent except the few friends i had back in Ukraine who i am now disconnected with because of my mental health (my fault completely, i was a burden and yapped too much about my problems not taking in consideration theirs). 

I have a huge exam coming up in 2 weeks and i have not been doing shit neither do i plan to because it really feels like i don't care. I literally want to rot and stop being a shame in this family of hard workers where in 2 generations my elders went from being dirt broke slavs to quite a good financial situation. I have no one in family who struggles/struggled with any addictions nor is that even talked about.

I feel really embarassed, am scared and ashamed to talk about these problems to anyone close with the fear of abandonement or losing the ""close"" people i have left. I do not know what there is left to do. I am stuck in the past, living in Ukraine, being 14 and playing video games on discord. That life is far gone now.

venting this heavy for the first time, am sweating while writing this, want to delete it all but after all if i post it, worst thing that can happen is that nothing changes.

"My dad has anger issues, lost his job and is avoiding his responsibilities ",1716311362.0,"Hello, I don’t know where to post it, but I need to share it. 

My dad recently turned 60 and he has lost his job. He’s been self-employed but nobody hires him anymore. He’s been unemployed for almost 6 months. 

Now he’s scrolling on tiktok endlessly and he doesn’t help my mom financially. Losing a job is not the issue here because it can happen to everyone! It’s just that he is so avoidant when it comes to taking care of things. He has lots of debt because he ignores the payment reminders and it starts piling up. My mom used to pay for his health insurance debt by asking my grandma for help (who is narcissistic and uses these opportunities to make my mom feel like shit and like a loser). 
My dad has gotten so lazy. All he does, is lay on the couch. 

He’s always been mentally unstable, he has anger problems and treated me and my mom like garbage. I remember he would talk down on my mom, saying what she earns monthly is the bare minimum which was so disrespectful of him to say. And now he’s laying on the couch watching tiktok Live and ignoring all of his responsibilities. 

He is a hoarder, so our basement is full of stuff. The apartment is clean but the basement/cellar  is full of stuff. When you mention that he should get rid of it, that seems to be a trigger for him. 

He has psoriasis and because of the medication he took, his teeth started falling out. But also, I‘ve never seen him brushing his teeth. He could’ve worn dentures but he said that they’re too uncomfortable, so he would rather walk around with one tooth in his mouth. 

Now that he doesn’t have any income, he could go and get some help by at least getting unemployment payment so that my mom wouldn’t worry so much about how to pay the bills. He could also get health insurance, he just has to fill out some documents and that’s it! Then he could take care of everything, of his health, his teeth, skin. We live in Germany and he doesn’t have any health insurance. 

I even offered to pay for his teeth or try to help to! But he never contacts any dentists so I really don’t know what to do or how to help. 

Anytime you want to tell him something, even if you talk nicely, he immediately lashes out and starts screaming. He would do it a lot in childhood, but now when he screams, I scream back louder, and then he usually goes to a room, looks at his phone and is mad. It’s an intimidation tactic. In childhood, he would throw plates at the walls. 

Me and my mom don’t know what to do honestly, we have tried EVERYTHING and he is that stubborn. I think he’s been depressed for a long time. He doesn’t have any wishes or desires.  He doesn’t treat my mom respectfully. It’s never been a healthy relationship to be honest. 

I told him several times that if he wants to talk about something, or if he feels down and needs some help, I will help him. Me and my mom have always been there for him but he doesn’t seem to appreciate it. I‘m really trying my best here and I have wasted so much energy building a relationship with him. 


I am working full time and my income is not bad, so I‘m helping my mom with rent, or I‘m paying for groceries, and other bills. But I‘m already 27 years old and would like to start a new chapter in my life, move into an apartment no matter how small it is, and decorate my space the way I want to. But ultimately, I just want peace and alone time. 

I really want to move out.  But because of this situation it’s difficult to save something up. I was thinking about moving into a smaller apartment with my mom and my cat because I really don’t want to leave them behind. And once we’re set, my mom could look for her own apartment or she’s going to go back to her home country. 

My parents are both in the contract and my mom is already panicking about the possible outcomes. 

For example, what if my dad refuses to clear the basement? Then we would have to pay for someone to do it and he’s also hoarding the basements of our neighbors (who for some reason agreed to give them their space). 

My mom is very sensitive and very passive. It seems as if she is stuck in the situation but as I said, I really don’t want to leave her behind. 

I really don’t know what to do. Honestly I‘m scared how my dad is going to react once he realizes that me and my mom are leaving for good. 

He was homeless when I was a child, so I‘m 99% sure he is going to end up homeless again when he doesn’t have us anymore. 

I just don’t understand how someone can be so stubborn. Even if I offer help, he ignores it and acts really aggressive. 

My dad never talks to us, he’s always been so closed off and emotionally cold. I mourn my relationship but it’s already started to turn into indifference towards him. 

Do you have some advice what to do?

She wouldn’t, which also hurts the most is that she didn’t want to make an attempt to figure it out, all I wanted was a hug or a talk in person or over the phone and she can’t give me that.

Do I have anything,1716308468.0,"I KNOW people here cannot diagnose me, I just want to see possibilities if I have anything…
So, for the past several years, I’ve been unable to find a cause in life, like I lack an identity, constantly shifting interests, and when I’m done with this, feeling ‘empty’, I suppose. It’s a hard feeling to explain lol.
I also cry VERY easily, a mild rejection sends me to tears, people call me sensitive (I agree)
I’m quite paranoid with people on the streets, I stay away and if someone’s walking behind me I  speedwalk forwards to avoid them, I ‘speedwalk’ to avoid being seen as weird, just sprinting around in a (probably) harmless situation.

I self diagnosed for a bit but I've given up on it and I don't know exactly what issue I have but I want to avoid self diagnosis because I realized it probably does more harm.

A little background info :

My mom thinks that the worst problem I could possibly have is having to study a little extra. When I asked her if I could see a psychologist she said ""most of the psychologists are people who couldn't pass the medical exam so they settled into this job instead .There are very few good ones out there. I don't think you really need to see someone but If you really think you need it find someone who isn't a quack and if I can afford to pay for it, we'll do it. "" My relationship with my dad isn't good enough for us to talk about this kind of thing. (It isn't Great with my mom either but at least we can talk about these things)

I know most parents wouldn't even be this supportive so I'm thankful for her response.

The problem is that I don't know where I can get help. I tried to talk to the school counsellor but when I asked my class teacher to sign it she asked me to talk to her and when I kept saying it's nothing she told me she can't help me if I didn't want to share it with her and after a few sessions I realized school counsellor isn't the most helpful. My family can't help me (If anything the cause of why I need to get help) . I don't want to end up like my parents and I know I won't be able to live with myself if I do. I am very close to my sister but I don't trust her like I used to. I used to share everything with her but now we barely talk.

I live in delhi which is one of the cities with the best healthcare in this country and I still don't know where to look for help. I don't want to go just anywhere to any unqualified quack but my parents can't afford anything too expensive. Im also hesitant about online therapy because I want some privacy from my family and I want to create some physical distance with my house.

If anyone could help me figure out any good treatments in delhi please do because I'm getting really desperate

"Opinions on ""Hero Journey Club""?",1716306449.0,"Had a couple sessions with a normal therapist through insurance I had from a job and it was starting to help, but now my 5 sessions are over, I no longer have the job or insurance, and still needing help with my mental health struggles

Scrolling through Facebook I keep seeing the ads for ""Hero Journey Club"" first session 50% off and $30usd a week for 80 minute sessions while gaming with an experienced therapist. Sounds right up my alley! 

However I'm skeptical about everything and this kinda sounds like one of those ""too good to be true"" type of things especially because it's advertising on Facebook of all places.

Wondering about others' experiences with a particular set of issues,1716297243.0,"I'm trying to learn more about others' experiences with something I have.

 

As a kid, did these apply to you?

Nervous habits such as grinding teeth, putting fingers or the inside of your cheeks, cracking knuckles, plucking hairs, or other habits you couldn’t seem to stop

Trouble getting along with others, sometimes aggressive, possibly getting into fights

Jumpiness, maybe even a tendency to run and hide if you were in a room alone and anyone entered

Lots of difficulty in school, despite adequate or higher intelligence

Attention disorders, ADD or ADHD

Memory issues

Trouble fitting in, tending to be a loner or outsider

Possibly, easier to relate to teachers than classmates

Difficulty imagining how your words or actions would be received by others, resulting in behavior others saw as weird

Trust issues

Suicidal thoughts (Possibly at some point you were *surprised to learn that not everyone has these*.)

 

 

As an adult, do you experience these?

Omnipresent anxiety—anxiety that never goes away

Social anxiety

Depression

Tendency to isolate

Feeling apart from/outside of society

Irritability or anger issues

Inconsistent empathy—usually you have a lot of empathy, but sometimes you have none

Being completely exhausted by even a small amount of socializing

Adult ADD

Hyper-attention on others, looking for any hints of criticism or rejection, no matter how slight

Low self-esteem, insecurity

Tendency to “collect” memories of things you said or did wrong, and torment yourself with them for the rest of your life

 

Why I ask:

Yeah, I have all these.  And after 40+ years of seeing therapists (16 therapists in total) I finally found one that figured out why.

 

She actually listened to me for the first three hour-long sessions, really got to know me, and then she said that when a baby doesn’t receive enough affection and attention, its brain doesn’t develop properly, and after a certain point, their brain stops growing in that way, so if it hasn’t fully developed by then, it never will.

 

This instantly clicked for me, as from my earliest memories and things my parents said to me, I know they left me alone a lot as a baby and very young child.  I’m not saying everyone with all these particular symptoms has had this happen, and I have no qualifications to diagnose anything.  I was just wondering if this clicks with anyone else.

I know the title sounds like a joke compare to many other addictions that exists in the world (nicotine cocaine crack etc) but i know i have an ddiction with my internet habits and I want to to stop. I've used it heavily since was like maybe 10/11. Now im 21 and I hope there's still time. I'm in college and I can do my day to day fine but the problem is that i have too much free time and whem im not with my friends(which is many times) or at college(it's a large chunck but negligible compare to internet time) I basically spend it on youtube insta twittter (mainly youtube). It reached a point where i cannot try new things: i tried gym a couple months startted strong and then basically stop going a couple of weeks ago. I tried to read books or meditate or do some exercise at home and obviously those things failed since it's so fucking boring. Like the fun hobbies are all far away from my home and even then i would be there for a very short time, for being out of shape for so long and having such a sedentery lifestyle. This addiction has also led to poor accademic performance. I've been struggling to move on to the next year to the point where i might get kicked out if I repeat a grade (look im sorry if the english is a bit weird... it's my best atttept to translate to english what im trying to say). So there's that... how do I breakout from this situation? I just want to try new things in life and be happy and successfull but i love the internet. Don't get the impression I spend all day watching shorts normally it's really good videos from topics i like and i feel at least i learned something new you know. I also play some games watch some movies/series you know normal stuff, the problem is filling all those free hours with that, which at this point cannot be changed to anything else. It's like my brain telling me: "" you need to be on the fucking computer from X hour to Y hour everyday"". To me that sounds like an addiction. One more thing: please don't suggest for me to go to a therapist or psychologist or any of those people. I went to a few ones in the past and I didn't like it. They didn't help me at all. They did nothing basically. They were just there the entire time silent and then in the end they suggested bullshit like ""Have you tried meditation?"". And also i wanna solve this by my own like I think of myself of someone capable of solving their own problems. That's just my mentality.

I need some help..,1716305189.0,"Content warning for ED, SA, and Addiction too

So this is going to be a long one, i’m sorry in advance.

I am trying desperately to figure out what i need to do. Before i start - i have severe BPD and the worst self esteem, i am manipulative at times, i have a fear of being alone, and im also bulimic... so please be kind. I know some of the things i did in this were not fair to him, but he hurt me and i acted how i did and i can’t change it. 

So i was with my ex from age 15-18 (fully together) and off and on until 19. We had a really rocky relationship at the end. He touched me in a way i didn’t want about a year or so into the relationship and that’s where things started to change. After a while i started getting interested in seeing other people, before i did anything he started being physically abusive. Then when i did start seeing other people he was always still around. One of those people i ended up seeing was a friend of his i met because of him. Me and that friend hooked up behind his back and i eventually told him. 

Me and the friend started dating and everything was fine, i was no physical contact with my ex, until i found out he was seeing someone. I completely lost it. I didn’t know what to do. I acted out of who knows what, and i went and saw my ex. We argued, then talked. I came back again and we had sex. My current bf wasn’t very happy obviously but he didn’t say i couldn’t do it, he gave permission.

We ended up being in a relationship with all of us because both my ex and current bf are bi. However that didn’t last long because they got jealous. They started to hate each other and it really sucked because i was as happy as can be. I felt so safe with them both. So now they hate each other, but im still with my current bf, but havent stopped seeing my ex. 

To shorten this up a bit… we kind of went through the same cycle of he would try to talk to someone but i wouldn’t let him leave me, while still being with my current bf. 

I ended up becoming an addict and my ex was there for me. He told me he was going to help me and he was going to get me back. But a week later he snapped on me. He told me he was done and he didn’t want to do what we were doing anymore. He treated me horribly about my addiction and basically called me pathetic, (this was all over text.) After that i told him i wanted to see him in person and talk to him. He told me the same things but nicer, just that he needed to move on.. but i didn’t want him to because i wanted to end up with him again when he decided to change and actually make up for putting his hands on me. 

We kept talking in the car and i cuddled him and bawled my eyes out. I wanted to kiss him but he told me no at first, then he gave in. We talked for a while and reminisced about our life together, but i eventually had to take him home. Before he got out of the car i asked him if he was going this because of a girl, he said not exactly, but he found a girl that he thought was pretty. I panicked, but he assured me he wasn’t just going to run off and forget me. 

A week later, on snapchat i see pictures of him and that girl at our old date place, and i lost it. I had a panic attack and i didn’t know what to do. I was so angry, he lied, and he always lied when we were together. All i could think about was the fact he promised me he would take my pain away and we would be together again. But no, he was gone with her.

 After the panic attack i pretended i was find for a week and then i eventually messaged his girlfriend and told him the shitty things he did to me in hopes they’d break up, well it didn’t work. So i continued with my life once more until i couldn’t handle the pain and i texted him apologizing for everything and how i acted about him hurting me. I told him i would hope for another chance for the rest of my life. His girlfriend ended up texting me saying nasty ass shit to me. We argued but then came to a middle ground of not hating each other somehow. 

All was fine until i found out he groomed my little sister, and that brought him back into my mind again. I was so angry and all i wanted to do was make him look like a piece of shit to everyone, and i did. And it was all worth it until now. 

Now i absolutely understand what love is. I sit here and i do everything i can to make myself hate him and everyone else, just to hide the fact i am completely in love. I think about him daily, i look at all of his social media, i don’t know if ill ever let go because he was my first love. 

I am still with the boyfriend i had through this whole thing and i don’t even know what to do for us. I don’t know what i feel for him. I know i love him very much, but it’s just not the same. We have very severe fights where i become the aggressor. It’s constant, almost everyday. 

I feel like im lost. I don’t know myself. I am a mosaic of everyone i have loved, not me. I have become a monster of self hatred. I do not know what to do anymore. Where do i go from here? I feel like giving up and just wasting away.  I need some advice.

I had it rough growing up, unlike my siblings, especially my little sister. That's why I don't want them to go through what I went through. Ever since our parents passed, I've tried my best to take care of my siblings, but I also do my best to teach them to be independent such as doing house chores, etc. 

I let my sister to just focus on uni and let me and my brother work, because I know how exhausted it was when I had to work and go to school at the same time. All I ask her is to do is focus on school and help around the house. 

It's been years and I feel like I've failed. I feel like she doesn't listen to me. She barely helps around the house, barely picks up after herself, she never ""noticed"", always have to be told what to do that she ends up complaining because I keep telling her what to do. She's almost 20, and can't even do a simple task without me telling her what to do.
For example : if there's a piece of tissue laying on the floor, I would have picked it up and throw it away, but? She would have walked passed by it. 

What should I do? I give her everything. I give her money, I buy what she wants, I buy 2 when I buy something for myself, I share everything. But, why can't she help me a little? Why can't she ""realize"" without needing me to tell her, yet she still wouldn't do it. I don't wanna be mean like my mom, and I also don't wanna be controlling.

I work 11 hours and I just wish she would take one thing off my plate and help, but instead, I come home to a filthy smelly house and crying because I'm just so exhausted with everything.

I feel like I have a hole in my chest whenever I'm not with her,1716301221.0,"Hi, so this is going to be kind of long, and honestly I don't even know why I'm doing this but I guess I'll do it. I am currently un-employed, I graduated from University and haven't found a job since then. I spend some of my free time gaming and through one of the games I play, I met a woman. At first I remember her being into me and I ended up telling her to not get attached because I am currently working on myself, physically, mentally and also in terms of where I want to be in life. But as time passed by, even though it hasn't been that long since we met on the 9th of April of this year, she grew on me. She professed that she likes me, we flirt and everything. And when she was around, I finally felt some sort of happiness that I felt like I've been lacking, so I developed feelings.

  
Now for over a week, she's started replying less to my messages and such, she has classes so it's understandable but even when she's home. I ask to call if she's free but it doesn't really end up happening. And like I know she's busy with her life, but for some reason I can't help but feel empty when she's not around. There are periods where I finally feel normal and then it's replaced by a longing of her presence and it doesn't feel nice at all. I feel like I have a hole in my chest half the days and I have no clue what I should do to fix it because I try to distract myself but even then I end up just thinking about her. I'm pretty sure I'm over reacting to all of this but I still can't help but feel like shit. I've been cheated on the last two relationships I had so that probably has something to do with it. She has exams so she's probably studying but I don't know why even knowing that, I can't help and relax. The thing is, over the weekend, she called me first thing when she woke up while she made breakfast, we spent time together and even gamed. And she sends me sweet tiktoks, even spammed me at one point and said ""Sorry, it's just that I send you things that make me think of you"" or something along those lines so the fact that I get sweet romantic tiktoks obviously means she does like me. But for some reason my chest feels empty until we spend time together. Well that's not true because last night we didn't talk, yet sent voice notes and I felt content. And a few nights prior, we texted and I felt content. I honestly feel like a mess and I don't know what to do so I came here to vent and get it all out because I feel like I'm losing my mind. Yesterday I asked if she wanted to spend time together and call, and she said that she called me earlier on but I didn't pick up.

"Had a job interview for my dream job, now feeling like I just want to go to a coma until I get the rejection",1716300923.0,"I really hate myself. I am married to the love of my life. I have a healthy and freaking cute 8-week-old daughter. I have a lovely (albeit sick) dog. But I cannot be happy. 

I used to have dreams. These dreams related to my career - I was a scientist. However, things in academia absolutely fucking suck at the moment. So I had to give up for another type of career - data analysis in fucking marketing. I fucking block all possible ads, for fuck sake. And now I have no dreams. Yes, I want to be happy with my wife and my daughter. But my job occupies 8 hours of my day, and right now, I absolutely hate those 8 hours. I do the bare minimum, and if my managers operated with half of the brain cells of an amoeba, I would have already been fired. But they are too incompetent, and, honestly, I don't think they care either.

Today, I interviewed for my dream job. Of course, I still have no dreams, no ambition. But, in my current career, this would be absolutely my dream job - still doing data analysis but for something that I believe in. I would be helping out people which is extremely important to me. 

What kills me is that the interview went well. I had the head of the department nodding along, smiling, and being generally nice. But after getting ghosted so many times while looking for a new job opportunity, I no longer dare hope. And so, here I am, completely stuck. I just want to fast-forward to next week so that I can receive the news that I didn't get the job and move on. I know, I know, there is a chance of being successful. But everything has been going wrong in my career. I feel like a fraud. I feel like I cannot compete because my current job is too fucking pointless, too fucking poorly managed, and too brainless for me even to learn anything that would help me compete with others. 

I have no friends. I have autism. My wife already has too much on her plate, and I am afraid of losing her with so much negativity around me. So, I have to resort to Reddit to get some support. I have a therapist. But only on Thursdays. And Thursday feels like it is a month away. I just want to lay on the floor and be swallowed whole. I am so tired. I didn't use to be like this. I had hope, dreams, ambition. And now there is nothing. When people ask me about my job, I just want to scream. I am tired. I just want to remove myself from this society. I just want to be left alone with my wife and my daughter. 

I was born poor and somehow managed to climb my way to the middle class. But, after so many years of studying to be a scientist and finding my way to decent-paid jobs even after stopping being a scientist, why do I still struggle financially? All my clothes are at least three years old. I have one pair of shoes. I have a sick dog that has to wait until I get paid for me to be able to go to the vet. How did I end up like this? After so many years. I have a fucking PhD, and that amounts to jackshit. So many stupid life choices. So many mistakes. And all because I was a fucking poor kid from a poor neighbourhood, bullied throughout my teenage years, too naive to understand the real world. I fucking hate it. I hate my parents for never bothering to teach an autistic kid about the real world. I was the best student in every Uni that I went to - Bachelor, Master, PhD, it didn't matter what; I was always the best. Not because I am particularly intelligent, but because I worked fucking hard to achieve my goals. But now I have none. And why? Because no one bothered to tell me that no one cares about my fucking stupid interests. That it doesn't matter if I am really good at this one thing if that thing doesn't make someone else money. And now here I am. 

I hate the person that I have become. I just hate it. ",handicapped_runner,,False,1cx8y2f,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cx8y2f/had_a_job_interview_for_my_dream_job_now_feeling/
3 times where ADHD impulsivity became life threatening to me.,1716299236.0,"Hi, I'm currently 20 years old with the high suspicion of having adhd or if its not then a mental health problem. My muslim asian family doesn't believe in mental illness so it is so hard for me to get diagnosed or even seek mental health. Mental health is something that is still a taboo in my culture and the only representation of mental illness is schizophrenia. Let's start!

1.When I was a kid I literally smashed a glass, with an intention of putting it to water and drinking it with an intention of unaliving myself. (I got the idea from a tv show) I just did it because my bro didn't took me to a swimming and my cousins were literally teasing me 😭 because my bro didn't bring me. I did it out of petiness and gultripping my bro. I was 5 years old. 

2.During my highschool years I got bullied a lot, like A LOT because of my lazy eye and body odor and that took a lot of mental health problems and depression. I had a lot of issues with comming to terms with my looks. Then pandemic happened and I felt so under simulated. I felt so helpless and imprisoned with the current situation. I spent a lot times on tiktok and added a lot more insecuries in myself that I didn't know exist. Seeing beautiful people made me blame God. I had discovered that I have an overbite due to my tongue tied, I was so frustrated by it because I looked so ugly. I watched a lot of videos about cutting your own tongue tie, which helps with fixing overbite And I (almost) did it on myself using an unsanitized all around scissors.

3.Just yesterday I almost put myself in danger, as a woman with an adhd we carry a lot of shame of not being the woman that society wants us to have. It is so hard to even do the simpliest basic humanly function as an adult. I hate doing dishes and often my food will go rotten because I forgot about it or didn't wanted it. I will only wash my dished if it smells a lot or the plate has accumulated rotten foods. I only washes dishes once a week.

 Yesterday I drained the left over rice into my sink and my roommates complained of how bad it smells in our group chat, it smells like 💩 and it comes up to their room. I was in panic attack mode and so afraid that the landlord will be mad (This isn't the first time that my dishes became a problem). I heard my landlord's son being so angry because of what i did. I was so embarrassed that happened and literally I sneaked out of apartment with wet clothes (due to dishes).

 I carry A lot of shame of being a woman and being so disgusting.And walked alone at NIGHT as a woman with no phone or no protection. Because I was so embarrassed of what happened. I walked around outside my school grounds walking in and out of a room then my slippers even broke. I saw a man outside of school while i was walking around tryna hide, because I was finding a place to sleep while being overwhelmed of what is happening and I literally ran because I was scared that he would grape me. I went to a room in the school ground then school guards have caught me in that room and assisted me to go home and advised me to don't think of other people. They even accused me of being drunk. What?

It was my garbage all along that was smelling and not my sink. I feel like I'll make a video to make it clearer. Adhd is not just a quirky uwu thing but it a disability for a reason, That is so distructive and life theathening.

Need help moving on and getting my life togther.,1716298651.0,"I've been trying to move on from my girlfriend of 5 years. I met her after school when I was young, I thought she was cute and had an interest in her, but didn't pursue that until college. We had a long distance relationship. During highschool I had depression which made me struggle my last year of school. I never liked school, and my dad always pressured me to do well. I also have really bad eyes and was not legal to drive. I ended up going to my school of last resort and struggled there too. My 4 year computer science degrees took me 6 years, and let me graduate during 2020. I've been working on projects since but still haven't landed a job. I've thought about doing other things, but I can't. If I go about my normal day working on projects etc. I can handle that but the thought of giving it up brings tears to my eyes and I can feel the creep of depression coming back in. This was what ultimately ended my relationship with my girlfriend. 

The first two years of the relationship was great, and I didn't have any problems with her. She has ADHD, depression and anxiety. Although, I did notice she tended to blowup on people. She yelled at her mother when her mother forgot to put on sunscreen and turned red as a lobster. She would complain about picking up her family from the bar, and complained she always helped them, but never could drink herself because she was the DD. She didn't yell at me at first, but I remember when we cooked I fumbled to ask for something and she called my a bad communication. There would be the occasional quip but I could handle or wasn't bothered. That changed in 2020. 

We never saw eye to eye on Covid restrictions. I was very hesitant to go out, while she wanted to do everything and would complain about being stuck at home. She had friends over every single week, went out for supper every week, went to bars, over to friends etc. She threw a Halloween party which I attended. The cases were averaging 1 per day or 1 every other day. I asked that there be masks, but there wasn't any. Things started to breakdown that Christmas. She threw a Christmas party when there was record high cases. I said I didn't feel comfortable getting together because of the party, and to wait until after in case of covid. She got angry, drove over to my house and yelled about me for between 30mins-1hr, saying I was treating her like a child, abandoning her, she is having difficult times and I won't be there for her, complained about how I didn't have a job, that the year that I graduated I had done nothing with my life. I just stood there and nodded. After that I never saw her the same. Each time she quipped at me, it hurt and I didn't brush it off. I started watching my words around her, being more careful about what I said so I wouldn't set her off. When we did have arguments, they never felt resolved and seemed to peter out. I remember a few arguments where I asked her something and she got so mad that I had to apologize to her (about what I don't recall).

I tried to show her the projects that I was working on, but she said that she didn't care. She told me to give up on my job and just find something makes me happy. The job doesn't matter. She occasionally asked me about them, but I got defensive because she never really asked about them. I would say 80% of the time she told me to give up. 

I gained weight and wasn't able to wear the clothes before. I didn't dress nice, sweat pants and t-shirts. She complained I didn't look nice and that I should dress up like she did. We went shopping together and I couldn't find anything in the mall that would fit. We ended up traveling over 2 hours to find a store that had something that fit me. We I told her I wanted to lose weight, she said just be happy and I shouldn't workout. I remember twice she insulted my t-shirts that I wore. One, someone complimented me on it, and she didn't understand why it's so great. The other she thought was ugly and I should destroy it. 

She tried to get me to drive. I do appreciate that she tried this. When I went to get my license they allowed me to get it, but I had to get new glasses. The glasses didn't help, I went to two eye doctors and a specialist. She didn't believe me. She said that she thought I was too anxious and I didn't want to drive. She would pull over during the night and force me to drive. I would tell her that I wasn't feeling well and force me to drive. When I missed stop signs she would always bring up how I was a terrible driver, and shouldn't be on the road, then later complain about having to drive me home. Sometimes this was the same conversation. She called me names about my inability to drive, and would call me them in-front of friends. 

We would argue about movies, and get into circular arguments where I would back down because it didn't matter. I remember her saying she hated that I was logical in my conversations. She'd argue with my family over trivial things, like desserts. I remember one time she argued with her brother over who should pick up a pizza. Her brother was going out, and was going to be up town. She wanted him to pick up a pizza, but it was late to order ahead, and he had some stuff to do. She brought up everything she did for him, trying to get him to bring home the pizza. 

We wanted to move in together, but she didn’t want to rent together first, only move buy a house. She didn't want me on the title, and she told me she wasn’t sure if she ever wanted to get married. She wanted me to rent from her. I understand since I was unemployed, but this was 1 year into covid. I offered to just rent together, she said no. She said my family was toxic and unhealthy and I should move out. She also called my brother a loser. 

We went to couples counseling where I blew up on her and she left. I understand why. I was a jobless (I worked for my dad a bit but not full time and started working for her uncle, again not full time.) and didn't drive. I think I was depressed, and the constant criticism wore me down and I exploded. It's been about 9 months now., and she has found someone much better than myself. I apologized to her for what I said, but she moved on and doesn't want me in her life anymore. I needed space to heal and took too long. 

I started to learn to drive recently, she had convinced me to go to a 3rd eye doctor, and the doctor found the issue. The doctor said I was very legal to drive. I'm still working on my projects. I'm hoping to finish one this week, (it looks to fit the job description of one posting to a T), and another hopefully within the next two weeks. I've found some job postings that I am going to apply to, that seem promising. I've lost weight, I've gone from 240 or so in August of last year to 208 or so right now. My goal is 180. I'm still not okay, I don't cry, but still feel down and bad. I think it's because I'm isolated because I can't drive and don't go out because I don't really have a job. I realized the 1 or 2 weeks after the breakup were the best I had felt in awhile, and some days I do feel really good when I make progress on something. I guess I'm waiting for a pay off or something to change. I never enjoyed school, and thought one day it will be worth it. I am trying which is something I suppose. I'm hoping to move past the learners soon so I can go out on my own. I do find hope some days, I miss her and sometimes want her back as a friend. I think that this year is going to be a 180 year. Just by the fact that I've lost weight, started driving, and feel close to finishing my projects which might land me a job. I understand that I deserve criticism for taking so long to drive, and being unemployed. I think I just someone to say good job and keep going because I haven't heard that in awhile. That you can do this, everything will be okay. All I've heard for the last 4 years is give up, it doesn't matter, never a keep going. I think that's all I need right now.

"I’m Feeling Trapped, Seeking Advice on Dealing with Mental Health and Neglect",1716297570.0,"TL;DR: I'm a 15-year-old dealing with numerous potential mental health issues (BPD, ADHD, Autism, Anxiety, Depression, Acid Reflux, and Insomnia) but my mother refuses to take me to the doctor, saying I've managed this long and she's been through worse. I feel trapped and overwhelmed, surrounded by family with their own mental health issues. I've had to parent my mother and myself due to her negligence and trauma from my past. Despite feeling hopeless, I know I matter and things can get better. Seeking advice on what to do…

I’m dealing with many problems that my mother is ignoring because she thinks they’re no big deal since she’s gone through worse. She refuses to take me to the doctor, saying i’ll be fine. For example, I went through a depressive episode and neglected my hygiene, resulting in a cavity. My mom refuses to take me to the dentist to treat it, saying it's my fault.

I’ve been self-diagnosing myself after years of research and believe I have BPD, ADHD, Autism, Anxiety, Depression, Acid Reflux, and Insomnia. None of these have been confirmed or denied by a professional because my mom insists I’ve managed this long and I’ll be fine. 

I’ve been doing psychological research for seven years, but I’m only 15 and definitely not licensed. I feel overwhelmed, surrounded by family members with mental health issues—my mom, uncle, and grandma all exhibit narcissistic and borderline traits. They want to live through me because they never got the chance to experience a proper childhood themselves. i’m aware of their trauma as well, and i excuse a vast amount of their behavior because of it.

I have a lot of trauma from my past, and I’ve had to grow up quickly, essentially parenting both my mother, sisters, and myself. I feel incredibly trapped and hopeless at times, even though I know things can get better and that I matter.

Please do not judge anyone in this story too harshly, for you have not heard the half of it. I’d appreciate if your advice is not degrading/shaming any one person.

i dont feel absolutely anything for strangers one time i saw someone getting ran over and people around got sad and some started crying i could see why i mean someone died but why getting upset they didnt knew him

i dont wanna sound edgy or cringe and when i say this im fully serious

My father is dying. My dreams  are dying. My spare time is constantly occupied by people asking me to do things or work. Whenever i have time to work at making my dream come true, my family sees it as me not being busy or doing nothing. I genuinely never ask for much. I rarely ask for help and when i do its typically only for a few minutes. 90% of the things im asked to do take hours. Theres no respect for my time and my time is treated as fair game constantly. If i cant move out soon i dont know how i could ever have happiness. There has to be more to everything than this.

Advice about Mother ,1716293705.0,"For the longest time, I've struggled with anxiety and low self worth. It's only been up until recent I've realized it's most likely stemming from my toxic relationship with my mother and things she had done to me during childhood. 

One particular incident that stands out to me happened when I was 16. Me and my younger brother hadn't gotten along well at all and would fight very often. It grealy affected my mental health and my mother made the decision to let me live with my aunt in Texas. I truly enjoyed my time down there and felt a great improvement in myself and my mental health. A few months ater staying there, going to school, making new friends and being adjusted to life down there, I went to visit my mother for Christmas with the full intention of returning to Texas after about a week. Me and my brother were polite during this break. My mother took this as an indication that there were no longer any issues between us and refused to let me return to my Aunts. Emotionally, it was extremly hard for me, losing my friends down there and also being forced into an environment that was just toxic to my mental health. 

There have been other things such as her critiquing my weight as a young middle schooler, being ok with me not eating meals anymore because of the weight I lost, using me as a therapist at times, and her having a rotating list of husbands. My mother has been married 10 times in my entire life span, with me having around 6 different step fathers until I went to college. She has also expressed jealousy whenever I ended up becoming close to one of my stepfathers, going as far as to sit me and my siblings down and explain that the men she married didn't truly care about us but simply wanted to use us to access her. 

I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for here, maybe some reassurance. I just want to know what to make of all this. It makes me angry just writing and thinking about it again but I feel so reluctant to say my mother was abusive.

Why do I feel the need to be good at everything?,1716286038.0,"On top of an Electrical Engineering background, I'm picking up like 6-7 different hobbies at once. Writing History articles, Drawing, Making Music with a DAW, Streaming, Video Editing, Writing Stories and Fan Fictions, and Programming Stuff. 

I don't know why, but I feel the compulsion to master something when I see someone else being super successful with it, like if I hear about a successful manga author online, or a successful indie developer, or when I listen to music I really enjoy, or reading a book I really like. Why do I feel like this? I don't even get into doing the things I plan to do because I get stuck in a loop of constant learning and reading about each of these hobbies I just listed. It's like I can't start any of them unless I know I'm great at it, and if I'm not I go straight back to the compulsive learning phase or just quit temporarily before coming back to it (after seeing someone successful again).

It's gotten so bad that I sleep on average 2-3 hours a night on weekdays, sometimes even 1 hour, then like 15-16 hours on weekends. It's not like anyone cared enough about me to have any weekend plans to begin with, never had weekend plans ever as an adult. Not even as a kid or teenager. Never. Parents didn't want me to hang out with people outside our own ethnic group (which is Serbian, a miniscule portion of the population, when I almost never saw on a daily basis and only if I called the people I knew at our ethnic community centre).

No matter how much I already know, I feel like I'm never enough and never will be good enough for anything or anyone unless I'm good at everything and know everything. I also have been depressed for most of my adult life so far, and have been thinking about killing myself every moment of everyday for the last 5 years, and tell myself and my parents that If I don't solve my loneliness or make up for all the misfortunes bestowed upon me by 25, I'll off myself.

What Happened!? Pls Help!**,1716287115.0,"My mother is retired, 69 year old and healthy. In Jan. of this year 2024, my brother lost his house and was forced to move. My mother lived in the basement apartment of his home also, so she had no choice but to move as well. She had expressed wanting to live with me and my daughter but because of previous circumstances and us getting along better NOT under the same roof, I explained to her that it wouldn’t work. 

My brother and I were able to find her a basement apartment about 15 min from where I live. It was affordable to her income and allowed her to manage her bills and buy groceries. She had expressed her disapproval from the beginning. She started worrying about money, about getting to certain places but my brother and I continued to show her over and over that things would be fine. There were no obstacles to stop her from continuing on. 

Things seemed to get worse, she expressed not being able to have a proper bowel movement and because of that she wasn’t eating regularly. She said the stove top and oven in her new place didn’t work properly. (My brother tried cooking with, and both worked fine) We took her to the doctors and he set her up with ultrasound apt. Etc. From there she would express the apts. being too much for her (1 apt.) She was getting depressed, didn’t want to go out. Simple things she needed to do, she expressed she could no longer do. A lot of which she wouldn’t even try first. She was familiar with public transit as that was her way of transportation when living with my brother but now she was afraid to take the bus. She wouldn’t want to buy the things she needed out of fear of having no money. Even though her monthly income covered what she needed, plus she had a little saved nest egg for emergencies etc. 

I was having a hard time understanding and somewhat felt like she was doing this purposely to try and move in with me. Things just seemed to get worse .. she kept expressing she couldn’t do this anymore, and she would refuse calling the doctor to tell him how she felt. 

She would call me everyday, sometimes asking the same questions that I had previously answered already. Then she would express her desire to not be here anymore, she was done. I have always known my mom to be a strong person so I had a hard time accepting this was now her true nature, it just didn’t make sense. I was hurt because I’m her daughter and I told her that I can’t help her with those feelings and she needed to call the doctor. She would refuse and continue to cross that boundary. 

Because of the frustration I tried to take the time I could for myself because it was very overwhelming and I didn’t know how to manage all her issues. I did take her to the hospitals psyc. Department once and it took a lot of convincing .. she wasn’t sleeping so they gave her something for depression to take long term. 

When I would bring her to my house, she would want to stay days on end without asking if I had anything going on and when It was time to take her home, she wouldn’t want to leave. I also found her rummaging through some personal belongings of mine, and I felt as though she was crossing the line and that I was enabling her to keep acting this way without making any effort to seek out help. How hard could it be the call the family doctor, a familiar face? From that incident I told her she couldn’t come back to my house until she called the doctor. She took it hard and said “well I guess this is the end of us” I said no mom I can come see you but this is to make you take some responsibility and do what needs to be done. That was the last conversation we had, I told her I love you and she rolled her eyes in disbelief .. 

From January to May of 2024 was only 5 months. This past Saturday she took her own life. She wasn’t answering our calls or messages, so I sent my brother over to check on her. He found her that Sunday. 

I am so devastated because I didn’t take her as serious and she was .. she was literally crying to me for help and instead I created boundaries because I was burnet out that pushed her further away. My mom has always been cognitively aware, responsible, strong, aware … I couldn’t accept this new her in such a short time span, it didn’t make sense to me. I feel so horrible, and I know it’s not my fault but I know I could have done more, like make the calls for her etc. 

I don’t understand what happened … this can’t be a normal phenomenon .. she was never suicidal in her life. In 5 months she became someone we didn’t know, like a child and in the end took herself. What was the cause .. how ?? 

I just can’t seem to let it rest as, she got depressed. There has to be more going on .. she lost so much weight so much muscle memory ..

To what extent does your inner dialogue become a mental health issue?,1716283566.0,"I’m not trying to self proclaim any disorder, I am just simply asking, but here’s some details about my situation.

So for all my life I have talked to myself in my mind all day, every day. Sometimes it’s conversation sometimes it’s narrating what I am doing. I also tend to sometimes speak narrations out loud and people tell me to shutup and stuff, which hurt my feelings, so now (as in started like 15 years ago) when I have the urge to do it I just make like beatboxing rythm sounds and a lot of times I don’t even realize I am doing it and it doesn’t hurt my feelings at all when people ask me to stop several times. When I was younger I had 2 characters in my head as well (I’m happy remembering them lol). They were like imaginary friends, had their own voices, had their own lives, names (popeye and jack, roast me lol I gave the names when I first gained conscious) and I would have conversations with them. As I got older they moved on and their voices and everything got replaced by real people like my friends and family. There are times where I confuse very small details of what my actual family and friends have done with said voices and it works vise versa as well. For example If someone was in a car wreck or something like that in real life, something major, I know it’s in real life and again works vise versa. It’s just the details you wouldn’t pay complete attention to that trip me up. I “calculate” details in my head too so when I am talking to someone they don’t know I am mixing stuff up, it just sometimes takes me a second to get everything straight which leads to small pauses in conversation. These voices and conversations are not there all the time, just my own voice is all the time 24/7. Whenever they are there it’s typically just 1 and not like all of them trying to talk over each other, but I said typically. There was 1 time about 5 years ago now where I had a rough patch in high school and for about 3 days I had a ton of anxiety and just due to the circumstances I guess, I had like 4 of my friends voices just yelling over each other one day for like 10 minutes. It scared me shitless honestly. I couldn’t understand what any of them were saying, but nothing like that has happened since.

I know it’s lengthy but that’s what it’s like. I don’t have suicidal thoughts, thoughts of harming others, or anything of that nature; I do have mischievous thoughts though sometimes, but that’s a whole other story and it’s actually pretty funny. The entire reason why I’m making this is because my buddy and I just tried weed for the first time a couple days ago, I didn’t like it nor did I really feel any different, but he had a good time. But all my thoughts did go away, it was like fog clearing away from the road. That basically got me to thinking this could actually be some sort of minor issue and not just normal, but idk. I’m also not planning on using drugs of any kind or anything, it was just a 1 time thing to try and will just be another exciting memory.

Again I do not make this to claim I have any disorder, just simply wanting to know others thoughts. Over my life it hasn’t become better or worse so as of now I have 0 concerns for medical help. I am just simply wanting to know if it’s just a strong inner dialogue system or potentially something else is all.

Depression/anxiety,1716290699.0,"Hey so this is a big rant but I need to get this off my chest and don't really have anyone in real life to talk about this stuff to.

I've had a string of bad luck recently in terms of an abusive relationship and moving homes, getting a restraining order against them, and being dropped by a close friend group unexpectedly a few months ago.

I've also become a total shut-in, I can't help but feel like everyone hates me or something like that even when I have no reason to believe that.. Maybe this is related to the friend group stuff and some unprocessed trauma I don't know but now I'm in this place where I really want friends and to have a solid friend group again but I'm losing the motivation to try as whenever I go out to events I'll have conversations with mutual friends and they always say something like ""we gotta do something soon!"" but the plans always fall through. I'm so over putting in effort and feeling like its one-sided or getting played, both platonic and romantic relationships. 

I have people mention to me that I must be so busy all the time and that I must have lots of friends. I tell them I don't really have friends or that I feel like everyone hates me people are always really confused to hear it and say that it's actually the opposite, but I just can't shake that paranoia that people just put up with me to be polite or something. I've only felt this social anxiety this bad in this last year.

I am tired all the time, although I sleep a lot. I used to wake up early and sleep 7-8 hours, exercise, hang out with people, work 5 days a week, study well, and now I go to bed at 4am (I can't fall asleep well anymore) and then I wake up at midday, feel bad about myself for that, don't exercise anymore because I'm still tired, never hang out with anyone, and quit one of my jobs because my mental health got so bad at one point I couldn't work as well as I used to. So now I only work 1-2 shifts a week, which weirdly feels like the biggest effort. I have become so exhausted and lack any motivation to do anything nowadays. 

This is all stressing me out because I'm finding it hard to focus with my studies which isn't the best timing because I've got exams in a month and I must do well this semester.

I just feel like a failure because I'm 22, am only just in my first year of a bachelor degree (I switched degrees recently so I have to restart my whole degree again), don't really have friends, not really on good terms or close with my family and haven't become good or skilled at anything because I'm so disorganised and tired all the time, I've got an ex who keeps harassing me and although I'm really trying to stay positive about it all I'm really feeling a bit like life keeps trying to turn me into a villain or something.

Lowest point in my life ,1716289516.0,"

I am 16 years old, I come from Poland, and for over 2 years I haven't felt any sense in what I do. Every day consists of getting up, doing what I have to do, and boredom. I can't find a way to occupy my time, and because of this, I have fallen into regular marijuana smoking in large amounts. The main reason was changing schools after primary school. I was in one high school, but I didn't feel comfortable there—the wrong group of people, difficult subjects, overall a tough school. So in October, I changed schools, but I didn't have many choices and ended up in a school where I don't even want to be. On top of that, the school year ends in 2-3 weeks, and I'm on the verge of repeating the grade. I really don't know what to do with myself; I'm not sure if I can handle all of this. I am in the worst phase of my life mentally, with a lot of pressure from my parents that if I don't pass to the next grade, I can say goodbye to them, etc. My mother is an alcoholic, and this fact alone has hit me hard because often this year, instead of going to work, she drank vodka, and sometimes I stayed with her for a week just to keep her from drinking, and so I missed school. I've accumulated so many things to catch up on that I don't even know if I can manage. I really don't want to disappoint them, and I feel like I'm just a burden to them, a problem that needs to be fed without a future.

How to talk to ex best friend,1716289327.0,"In August last year I got really depressed and from August up until December I burdened all of my issues with OCD, depressions and my ED on my best friend. Since then we’ve not been as close. 

The whole time we were friends I apologised for telling her and I said if it was too much I would stop telling her because I felt bad. On one hand I feel guilty but on the other hand she told me to tell her and that she wanted to know how I felt.

A couple of months ago she told me if was really difficult for her to deal with and she couldn’t do it again. That kind of caused another spiral for me. I’ve not told her about it because I don’t want to burden her.

We’re still friends but I’m finding it difficult to talk to her? If she asks how I am I have to lie and say I’m great. I don’t want to tell her specifically what is wrong but I’m tired of putting on a mask of being extremely happy. Some days I am happy and it’s okay but some days I’m in bed sobbing and really struggling but I’ll sit there and text her about how boring school is?

stressed about sexual orientation,1716288473.0,"I struggle(d) with addiction to online sex, attachment trauma, no history of committed relationship, some other mental health issues, broadly speaking some emotional abuse and sexual assault that I don't know if and how it affected me, and last risky sexual behavior with stranger that was self-harm behavior probably. I am into BDSM but the addiction led me to selling my body..

 I'm telling all of this cause it might affect another issue I have with my sexual orientation. I had HOCD after discovering some sexual experiences in the past weren't consensual. When I was treated for HOcD the doubts diminished but the ""false arousal"" toward particular women remained. I didn't stress about it anymore. But lately I do because I want to fantasise about a specific guy and fantasies about girls make me orgasm much faster and harder.. I really like him but it's complicated as always. I feel anxiously attached to men, but deactivate before a relationship can form. We actually met when I was selling myself, but he's a great guy with his own issues. Things became more intimate with us but sexually I was mostly attached to my online escapades and not with him too much. After some dates I srxually shut down. it's not that I didn't enjoy it though. I cried after the date and before I dreamt of a sexual assault. But also I felt like maybe I should feel more aroused by the sex and I blamed it on not having explored our kinks fully which are very similar. 

I also had phone sex with a guy who is sexually Dom and I came so hard I was shaking. But I usually struggle with feeling that electric sexual feeling with men although I like having sex it doesn't arouse me so stronglycompared to the fantasies with women, also tingly sensations around some women, whereas with men the arousal would follow the desire to be intimate. I enjoy giving BJ, but penetration can feel difficult sometimes also receiving oral isn't too great but maybe I have my specific techniques and when someone employed it it was great with their hands.. 

Seeing women, I get a faster arousal by now, that was never there before HOCD but remainrd. I DON'T like the thought of eating them out at all, or being affectionate with a woman or being in a romantic relationship with them. But the sexual arousal and less sexual arousal with men is making me struggle.. until last week I was infatuated with the guy, we had issues we discussed and weren't in touch for some time, but I felt so anxious obsessed confused spacey ungrounded and I really wanted to be with him but so stressed too. now I feel blocked anddisconnected and I'm scared I'm lesbian or simply not attracted enough to men to have a relationship with them.

I’m completely lost.,1716287596.0,"it all started when I moved. I never really knew I was moving, just knew that I was going somewhere. I hated not being involved in important manners with my parents and my two older brothers, I wanted a voice. I loved my life where I was, at least I made the most of it, tons of friends, I was a student athlete and a top student at that, but it all just went away. This year I was forced into a new school, all because I moved areas, I tried suggesting everything, from possibly living with one of my friends for the first semester of school and then transferring just so I could get to play volleyball for the school team with them, and we could’ve won a banner too, we trained really hard, and the competition could’ve been easily swept through if they had me, and I’m not saying I’m a god, but I trained with them, and I abandoned them.  They had lost a key player and I was to blame for it all, or at least I wanted to blame myself. I tried suggesting other things, like my willingness to wake up early everyday just to continue to go to the school I’ve known with the people I’ve grown up with. Everything was a no, and my family called me crazy or stupid for even considering it or thinking about it. The school year started, and I was off to a bad start, I was already two weeks late because of delays in my enrolment, meaning I was behind in every class. On top of that, there wasn’t the feeling of knowing I was wanted or needed by people, there wasn’t anyone I could be around, nobody to connect with, everybody was so cold shouldered. I joined the volleyball team for this school, we sucked, we were losing every set, every game, and there was a point where I was at my lowest of the low, at night, couldn’t sleep, just bawling in my room. My friends at my old school had been winning their volleyball games, and prior to this year, them and I had lost every game and had never made playoffs, but the thing that genuinely gave me depression was the fact that the year I’m not there, they win, and I’m still losing. I used to not believe in depression, but I was sleepless, and always crying, and bed rotting. School didn’t help either, teachers weren’t as assistive as how they were at my old school, I even got ignored five times by one of my teachers.(for context, I was unable to do any work in that class being new to the district and all and not having accounts to any of the websites they used for assignments and homework) the teacher knew this, but taught the class like normal, and never noticed me, I was always on my phone in that class, never got scolded. What hurt me the most, during lunch one day, before his class I go inside and ask if he can actually help me this time so I’m able to do my assignments and not fail, he said he’d help me. He goes straight up to my side of the classroom, chats with the students around me, laughs, and completely disregards me. That’s what drove me to start skipping. I had never skipped, I was a genuine good student. But I had and have so much mental stress and trauma that the only comfortability I can find is skipping and staying home. I had skipped a month of school before the counselling first called one of my older brothers, I had been caught, and my parents had to know, and I got shit for it. The second time I was caught, my brothers were pretty upset, they knew I wasn’t okay, but couldn’t understand why I was unable to go to school. The last time I was caught, my brother already knew I wasn’t going to school, but he wasn’t mad, but he listened to what I had to vent and gave some words and that was that. The guilt of seeing my mom cry and get upset over me skipping hurt me a lot. Everything was piling up and my glass was well pouring past its limit now. I’m still not okay. I’ve been inconsistent with my attendance and it’s almost the end of the school year, I don’t know if I can pass any of my classes, and it’s too easy for me to want to stay home, but the hardest for me to actually want to go. The counsellor is very for the student though, I did share with him why and what was on my mind. There’s a lot more I wish I could share on here, but that’s for another time. So far in my 15 years of life, I’ve never been so depressed and broken. It is 3:32am on a school night.

~rant/vent~

🔍I had pretyped this just ranting then I realized i can post it anonymously here bc i’m really struggling and would like some outside advice human to human feels like i’m gaslighting myself lol. They have supported me and given me everything I need materialistically and do what they are supposed to as parents in that aspect I am very grateful and appreciative of that. in no way shape or form will I ever complain ab them giving me food, shelter, clothes etc. I’m not seeking to be coddled or get sympathy either i just need to know if it really is that bad or am I tripping. 

🔬emotionally manipulative & guilt tripping  parents will be their own demise. lol. finally dropping that mask you have with them, making them look at themselves and see the torment i had to mentally internalize & take on over the years > sitting back & letting them continue their behavior and control to keep destroying your identity & self continuing to deal with immense shame, guilt, sadness, and anger because you know how they are and you think theres no point in opening up to them or telling them what they do wrong bc they always do the same shit & continue to blame you for everything. note this though when I finally released all my years of internalized emotions on them and started texting them very knowledgeable shit about themselves, how they treated me, my mom trying to control and ruin me and my girlfriends relationship when we first got together (+ we have continued to be together for 1yr and 3 months still going strong she ain’t ruin shiiiit) & shit talked my gf for no reason at all. When I started texting paragraph after paragraph (+ texting them back and forth.) I was met with my mom thinking something isn’t right regarding my mental health and telling my dad and brother she thinks something is wrong with me again (she was surprised how I could speak so knowledgeable bc I barely even interact with them anymore) them texting my phone asking if everything is okay and they are worried ab me (she’s also made many comments before this situation like “you seem like you need to get back on ur medication you’re being irritable” etc when clearly that was the correct response to some fucked up comment she made i’m sick of that shit.) (sorry that was lowkey irrelevant but holy shit). them throwing what they do for me as PARENTS in my face, blame shifting, manipulation, lying, her saying she has no acknowledgment of ever treating me like that over the years, trying to ruin our relationship, or saying any of the vile shit she said about my gf. OH and how she thought It couldn’t possibly be me that’s writing these exceptional level paragraphs and she thought my gf was controlling me and making me send all of that to my parents(me texting her ab this shit went on for like 3 days, 3 days of her not taking accountability for anything, lying, trying to manipulate by making me feel bad as well and she had the nerve to say “it feels like i’m being abused” GIRLLL STOPPP HUH im still confused ab that one) it’s honestly sickening and baffling knowing ppl can think & say shit like that. i’ve been so detached from them since I was little (never knew why at the time) but THIS makes that detachment 100x worse and I feel like that’s a GOOD thing for me even though the outcome wasn’t what I wanted, bc i’m feeling free, released, not pint-up, etc most importantly more like I can finally be MYSELF!!! i’m way more comfortable in who I am and my Identity now at 19 could you imagine that like damn (just hoping it’s not temporary)!!! just putting this out there in hopes that someone else going through the same thing or similar will see and maybe help them a little. now i just gotta move out.

⚛️ she can’t see how what she says to people effects them drastically and takes 0 responsibility and acknowledgement of doing so and passes it off as “you don’t know me” “i’m a good person” “i have a good heart i love everybody” etc or blame everything on me for examples “we do everything for you” “you’re going to treat us like that when we sacrificed so much for you” etc um .. yeah they signed up for that when they decided to have a child so it’s fucked up to throw that in my face. THEN she loves to do this the most playing the victim card “you’re abusing me” “it feels like you are abusing me” “we feel like we can’t say anything right we are always walking on eggshells around you it’s exhausting” she knows damn well I’m not abusing her in any way shape or form that’s disrespectful to many people who actually had to go through and endure actual abuse. “do you want to hurt us? is that your goal” “you’re destroying the family” “you’re destroying our marriage” etc literally used to be all the timmmme when i was going through sh and stuff too. i didn’t do anything wronggggg all I did was speak up for myself FOR ONCE (bc it’s been YEARS) ab the shit she does and how i’m not okay with it i internalize literally everything (that’s y it took years. just sick of their shit idk what to do). low and behold after all that expressing I get met with all that blame shifting and lying. the reason why i never open up to her is bc when I do ever since i was little she always blamed me and made it seem like this whole other thing so hell yeah i’d rather internalize then talk to her that’s a way better option than getting met with guilt tripping and shit what else could I do but internalize n doing that fucked my head up BAD. there are MANY more examples of what else she would say and my dad too but i really think he’s brainwashed by her so idk that’s just off the top of my head .. lmao. she makes me feel so insaneee i even feel like i’m exaggerating and making a big deal n being too sensitive writing all this😵‍💫. there’s SO MUCH more context but fuck all that i typed enough. thx for coming to my ted talk🕷️.

I’m in the same state all the time and don’t feel any emotions - is this dissociation? ,1716286076.0,"I went through a very stressful and traumatic time last summer which made me develop insomnia and anxiety and I wasn’t able to sleep for 3 weeks.

Should i support this friend for what they did?,1716285874.0,"Hi, i am currently in high school (year 10-12) and this story happened backstage at a musical and i was wondering your opinions on this and whether you think i should support them.

my bad this is long as hell

TLDR: 2 of my friends got into a one sided altercation which led to a threat on the others life, they were kicked from the show and suspended, the one who made the threat has Autism and ADHD and said he was out of control of his body, he has done little to apologise for the matter (from what i can see) but i have been urged by a mutual friend that they need support as they are going through a tough time and didnt mean what they said, and i am not sure what to do expecially with the fact they are now back at school  


There are 2 main people in this story who we will call Jack and Sam

  
Jack and Sam have know each other for a long time but had a falling out a while ago, neither of them care for one another but they could tolerate each other sometimes. i am good friends with jack and kinda friends with Sam, Sam has ADHD and Autism.

Backstage Jack was putting a chair down to sit in the vocal booth, Sam did not like where the chair was as he believed it was in the way and told Jack to move it, Jack calmy reassured Sam that it was fine and that there was no need to worry, Sam became increasingly more loud and angry while Jack remained calm and eventually  Jack asked Sam to be more quiet as a scene was happening on stage. Sam proceeded to grab Jack by the shirt and yelled ""Shut the fuck up before i stab you"" and then he stormed off.

with this not being the first time Sam and Jack had an altercation and not the first time Sam had exploded and ran off, we were scared for Jacks safety and Jack was scared for his own as we were not sure whether this was a real threat or whether he was just angry.

Sam had a quite major character in the show and was then forced to give up the character 4 days before the show and he was suspended.

Sam has made quite a few online statements on the matter, most of it he doesn't apologies for his actions besides one lone and short paragraph where he says he is sorry towards the people he may have hurt and the cast, he did not mention Jack. the rest of the statements are him rambling on about how the school has lost all care for him and that its the schools fault for kicking him out of the show. He claimed that due to feeling ""antogonised"" that night by cast members he lost control over his body and didnt mean what he had said as he had no control.

after the dust had settled a few days after the incident i was asked by a mutual friend of Sam and I to try and support him as he needs it right now, This mutual also has mental health struggles and has stated that they know what its like to lose control over your body. i said i didnt feel comfortable supporting him right now due to the fact it doesnt excuse what he did and he scared multiple of my friends even excluding Jack.

if i am to be honest, i resent Sam now and honestly never wish to see him again, due to his actions and the fact he has done little to apologies

i was wondering whether you guys believe whether i should try and support Sam though as he claims he had no control over his body and he's been having mental health struggles. And since Sam is now back at school i'm honestly not sure what to do

Id see their friends cry and beg for mercy at my feet as i keep going. Looking at emotional scenes, particularly characters crying made me feel... irritated?

It would apply to animals too, smaller animals. Bunnies, squirrels, other rodents, though puppies and kittens would sometimes work too. Id imagine drowning bunnies and cutting them into pieces. Imagining them squealing and trying to get away made it so much more enjoyable.

Feeling out of control,1716283689.0,"Hi friends! 
I don’t know what this is or what I “have” I honestly just want to feel know if there’s other people that experience this.

Sometimes I (20 f) feel genuinely out of control of myself, like I’ll say or do things that I feel like before I can stop myself I’ve already done them.

For example,
I saw an old highschool friend when I was out with my boyfriend, they said hi to me and I said hi back.
The next thing that came out of my mouth was “can I have a hug?” I DID NOT WANT A HUG, I don’t even know why I said it!! 

Or
My uncle the other day offered me a alcoholic beverage at a family event (I am of drinking age) and I gave him a look like I was uncomfortable as he was listing what drinks they had at the house. His response to this was “don’t get me wrong I feel weird offering it to you” because he thought I felt uncomfortable WHICH I DID NOT.

Idk maybe this is silly but I do stuff like this all the time and I just don’t know why.

I’ve talked about it with my boyfriend being like “hey you know when you just say things you don’t mean?” And he’s like “nope.”, which obviously makes me feel like I’m going crazy but yeah.

I don’t have generalized anxiety, thought I should say as idk if that might be apart of it.

"After 6 years of begging, my 55yo mum is finally considering therapy for her major depressive disorder where do I start?!",1716272245.0,"\* TW mention of suicidal thoughts

Please if you have ANY insight, whether it is things you’ve personally experienced, wish you’d done different or have any other advice I want to know. I finally got her interested in the concept after mentioning how many alternative therapies there are now adays- such as those using psychedelics and MDMA to rewire the brain. This is about 6 years in the making of encouraging and begging her to go to therapy, so the stakes are high, and I’m terrified of messing this up. There’s a lot of contexts but in the interest of making this succinct ill just give the main points here and you can skip the context if need.

**-              I specifically need advice on:**

* What kind of therapist I should be looking at for her needs (home based, post support need, alternative, CBT or other etc.)
* How to navigate her wanting to give up if rapport is not established with the first attempt.
* How to navigate if the therapist makes it worse/how to stress how delicate and important the situation is to a therapist
* How can I be involved in ensuring she is getting the right and best care as she is not good at communicating her needs or situation.
* If talk therapy is not helping, what therapies do you know of that have been successful in treating-treatment resistant depression.
* How to find the best therapist for her needs.
* In a nutshell I think her treatment would need to surround potential PTSD, childhood trauma, depression, anxiety, social anxiety and a lot of repression stemming from years of suppressed trauma.
* She does not like driving places it makes her anxious, she does not work and spends her days doing crafts, hobbies, being a house wife and being with her animals.

**\~Context:\~**

-              **Treatment history:**

o   Has tried antidepressants/anxieties for many years, id say she’s been depressed for at least 20 years. Different varieties to. Dads a doctor so classic pill pusher.

-              **General history:**

o   She is south African (although we are in Aus now). Their culture is not very open about mental health.

o   She was a nurse in south Africa in the 90’s, she has spoken briefly of the things she saw and the stuff she describes is not something that has ever been depicted in movies or books it is that bad. She never sought therapy for this.

o   She then met my father, a few months in got married and then uprooted her whole life to move to Australia, leaving every family member and friend behind.

o   She had my autistic brother and sister, and my father was emotionally absent. He worked nonstop and the support was mainly limited to financial. Meaning she did everything herself. I am ADHD to, so she may have some undiagnosed disorder.

o   The 20 years from when her eldest was born were filled with extreme stress for her, until now she has never been interested in or ever had close friends. Meaning she had quite an isolated existence.

o   She is communication aversive, potentially childhood trauma of being shamed for speaking out about struggling or her mental health. She shuts down, becomes depressed, overwhelmed and isolates if she is confronted with speaking about her feelings surrounding her mental health.

o   At around 40-45 she had her ovaries removed- following she tried HRT, but didn’t realize that she was not absorbing it, leading to a few years of psychotic behavior, extremely traumatic depression, completely suicidal although never attempted. Ever since she has been on AD and after years of chronic depression, she is so exhausted she believes she won’t be able to continue indefinitely. That is why I’m so anxious to get this right, I don’t think she has the stamina to go through multiple therapists or whether shed even try again if the first one sucks.

o   She has never considered therapy because she says the minute she starts trying to unlock those things she’s suppressed and try to talk about them its so painful it triggers her depression and suicidal thoughts intensely, but the meds are not working anymore, and she finally seems open to giving something a shot.

In conclusion I’ve left a lot out, but I believe this is a complex case, far more than just find a therapist and go see them as I’d normally suggest. I am 22yo, I’ve had therapy for dealing with her through her abusive years. I have a special interest in psychology and have worked on getting her to be open to this for a very long time. If you know of any other places, I could ask this too, let me know. Apologies if this is the wrong place to post about this. If you are someone who can relate to her and have sought treatment yourself or for someone you love please enlighten me.

Am I wrong for needing a ride to the ER,1716267780.0,"(F20) I will try my best to keep this as short and to the point. My mom got sick a couple of weeks ago and I got sick starting 3 days ago after visiting a relatives house. 

I have been struggling to breathe, gasping for air, walking even 2 steps winds me and I have to recover, coughing up mucus, throwing up, nausea, not eating, chest pain, back pain, cough, diarrhea, throat pain, headache, stomach pain, everything but a fever (as far as I'm aware. I didn't keep checking) 

On Saturday I woke up literally gasping for air with 8/10 chest pain. I went to the ER and got 2 antibiotics. Had tests done and came back with pneumonia. I went home. Continued to struggle while waiting for antibiotics to kick in and I kept taking a bunch of meds my mom suggested (sudafed, mucinex, ibuprofen, Tylenol, vaporub etc) but nothing helped and she wouldn't really believe me.

I kept struggling and groaning in pain and while walking so much that my dad kept yelling at me to shut up about it and told me to get out, cussing me out and then he called out of work and told my mom he's not going to work because of me. Then I started feeling really sorry. 

On Monday its been 3 days of taking antibiotics and I am still gasping for breath. I called my PCP’s Nurse hotline and she basically was threatening (not really but just very concerned) to call me an ambulance but I know that would make my mom very angry. 

The nurse had me straight up give my phone to my mom to try to convince her to take me to the hospital but my mom was not having it. I'm aware and sympathetic that she is feeling sick as well, but at least she was breathing and able to sleep. I was constantly gasping for air, but since I could get out sentences sometimes she did not believe me. I eventually stopped being able to get out sentences. I seriously don't know how to get anyone to take me seriously.

She took me to the hospital very mad and frustrated and it showed and I felt more sorry and I just kept apologizing. She said that she will quit her job and that she should just quit. She started screaming and stomping. (F50) (she has PTO, I don't, so I will not be getting anything) (she also submitted my medical papers for her to miss work)

I kept telling her she doesn't have to take me and I will find someone else but she insisted but continued to keep blowing up on me.

I go and wait for about 4 hours then I come back with asthma and bronchitis with the pneumonia. I didn't know I had asthma prior. They sent me 6 medications to take.

I can now breathe currently after respiratory therapy. I'm still nauseous and in pain though.

We got home and I apologized to her, then she started yelling at me and then I cried (I always cry because I'm weak and sensitive) and then she says I need to go to a crisis center, get help, get back on my medication (I got off of it because it was messing up my body. Now I'm only just in therapy) and that my depression is ruining her mental health. I continued to cry and I called my sister then my sister told me how she's tired of hearing from us (my parents get drunk every night and they got drunk a couple nights ago and had a nasty fight and I was also targeted because my mom overheard me crying in my room because they were fighting long story) 

My sister says she understands how my mom feels. 

My mom denies anything that I say that she has ever said or done, even if they said or done that thing 3 seconds before. She blacks out and scares me. 

I don't know how else I was supposed to get to the hospital besides calling an ambulance because she would be mad then. But I couldn't call anyone else for help (I don't have anyone) and the nurse wouldn't send me a ride because my condition was too severe I guess. 

She only takes about herself and how I affect her and I feel like garbage for it. 

She didn't stay with me or anything, just dropped me off and picked me up. There isn't an ER in my network that is nearby in walking distance.",Ok-Pianist-9729,,False,1cwzzyh,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cwzzyh/am_i_wrong_for_needing_a_ride_to_the_er/

How do I cut it out with the narcissist-adjacent thoughts (longass post),1716260362.0,"Alright, I'm going to describe a maladaptive thing I believe:

There are *whole* people with inner voices and internal lives and higher cognitive functions and there are *simple* people who are more like, I don't know, animals or chatbots. I'm going to quote a tweet I read because it sums it up: ""as someone who contains multitudes its so annoying talking to someone who contains a single tude. u can tell right away.""  

It isn't as simple as 'I think I'm smarter than other people.' In fact, my developmentally delayed unemployed-living-with-parents ass feels like the dumbest person on earth sometimes. I'm talking about a different thing that's harder to define. My idea of Full Personhood is mostly based on verbal acuity; when I talk to someone who's inarticulate and unfunny I feel like my brain is being tazed. On the inside I'll be thinking: ""you're beneath me. You're barely even sentient. I degrade myself by talking to you."" Doesn't matter what we're talking about. I'll mentally dehumanize a person because of their opinions on Bluey. 

This is why it takes me an eternity to write anything, including this post. Which sucks because fiction writing is one of my hobbies. The number one piece of writing advice I get is to write a huge, really bad first draft as quickly as possible. I cannot do this. You have no idea how high the stakes are. When I read crappy prose I feel genuinely angry at whoever wrote it. I keep imagining my 'peers' having a similar feeling while reading my writing (a fate worse than death.) Ergo, it feels perfectly logical to me that if I post bad fanfiction on the internet, I may as well DIE. I lose part of my SOUL. People tell me my writing is really good. Same for my art. This doesn't reassure me, because the people telling me my writing is good don't have standards. I can tell because I've seen \*other\* stuff they like and it's all ew ew ew ew ew ew ew.

It's difficult for me to just \*let go\* of this mentality, and stop holding myself to this standard, because then won't \*I\* just become one of them? 'Yeah, sure, why don't I just lobotomize myself and spend all day gazing slack-jawed into the middle distance while my friends and family watch sadly?'

Based on what I just described in this post you might imagine that in real life I come across as a pompous dipshit but I do, in fact, act like a normal human most of the time, including toward people my brain screams at me about. But this is always running in the background. See what I did there? Referring to 'my brain' as an external force, as if it's someone else thinking this shit and not just me? That was dishonest. As insane as it sounds written down, I do believe this, and I don't act contrary to it because deep down inside I am a kind soul; I just don't want to get caught. 

It's the same reason I feel bad when I'm consoling my friends. They'll apologize for crying or venting to me and I'll say: ""you don't have to apologize; I'm doing this because I love you and it's worth it"", but inside I'm thinking: ""I hate this and I wish you'd shut up, but I can't say that because then I'd sound like an asshole and you'd stop liking me"".  People tell me that thoughts alone have no morality and it's what you say that matters etcetcetc. Ok. But that either means that I live in a world in which everyone else is also constantly thinking mean shit about me OR I am a uniquely evil person. Which is better? I DON'T KNOW!

What the hell is wrong with me and how do I fix it?,1716259847.0,"I (24M) am having a serious life crisis. I wasted the last 6 years doing absolutely nothing (3 of it obstructed by COVID) and barley holding part time jobs for more than a month due to extreme social anxiety. I am extremely depressed and tried to take my life once. I play competitive/online video games a lot but I am absolutely horrendous at them to a point where there might be something wrong with me.

I can barley speak/communicate my natively language cohesively so the recipient can understand. I have never had a girlfriend and I am extremely socially inept. I was bad at school but yet ""decent"" at it enough in which I would be called bright because I was in the ""advanced classes"" with little to no effort but most of the time glaringly obvious concepts heavily alluded me.

I am literally statistically bad at everything and I never understood why despite my meticulous efforts in being better at...well...anything which led me to a clinical psychologist to get a ""pseudo"" mental evaluation (only tested matrix reasoning and visual puzzles). Turns out I am 90th percentile in matrix reasoning but I cannot do visual spatial reasoning for the life of me... within the 30th percentile. I struggle with directions and space to put it bluntly. Would having such a low score in visual spatial reasoning really make my life this hard? The psychologist I was speaking to has no idea why I struggle with so many basic things either. I brought up the possibility of Autism, ADHD, Anxiety, Depression to him and he only agreed with the probability of depression and anxiety while he disregarded the other 2 without clarifying why. It was basically: ""You don't seem autistic nor do you have any trouble paying attention to what I am conveying.""

Trying not to get back into my depression,1716254031.0,"Around four years ago with, well, a lot of people, I went into a really bad depression with Covid. I was in high school at the time and things were getting pretty bad. At the time I was practically living out of our basement, I had set up a ‘bed’ there (which was only a bean bag), and I would sleep down there only coming up for the occasional food and even then I would only eat like once every other day. For about 6 months I lived like that. I had lost contact with all my “friends” during that time, and had even started harming myself then. I still don’t know why, I was never good at explaining feeling. Things escalated a few months later though, when I had started getting caught up on helplines. I was contacting them almost every night, I’d have set times where they would even call me, and I don’t know why but it felt like, nice. A month or so later tho, it got bad and I had called multiple times in one night, and I was really having nasty thoughts, and was just terrified that I would act, and I ended up calling the same person twice, and they called the police and got me ‘help’. That was when I couldn’t hide it anymore. 

Idk after a few years of therapy and everything, I finally got a job, and things at least till just recently were good. But after just recently my aunt passed away, everything’s just gone down hill. I thought of my aunt as a second mom, unlike mine though, she could tell when I was feeling down-and she would always make sure I was ok. Now that she’s gone tho things just aren’t the same. Works gone downhill, it’s just not the same, and I feel even alien to my online friends as well. My older brother has also moved back in, and now I feel alien even at home too now. I just feel like I don’t belong here. Even with my cousin, who’s only just younger than me (my aunt that passed  daughter). It’s just so hard to not go back to what I was doing before.

How do I ask my partner for help when I need it,1716252391.0,"Hello everyone, I’m not really sure what to do or where to turn to and I just need some advice. I have struggled with my mental health and suicidal thoughts since the age of 10, I’m 17 now so it’s been going on for a while. I have been with my boyfriend for around 5 months, when we first started dating I sat him down and told him about all of it and let him know how bad it gets sometimes. I told him that if he thought it would be too much then I wouldn’t blame him for leaving and trying to find someone less insane, he told me to stop being stupid and I’m very glad he did. I was doing a lot better for a while I think mostly due to being in a new relationship and making a few new friends, however lately I have been feeling worse and worse and it’s getting too bad to hide anymore. A few days ago we were out at a college event and I had a really bad panic attack and ended up trying to leave, he doesn’t know but my intention was to not come back. I’m not sure how I was hoping to accomplish that but I knew I was going to do it. Then he came running after me. I tried to get him to go back but he wouldn’t. I ended up breaking down and telling him a little bit about how I feel. Something along the lines of “I’m so sorry, I just can’t be here anymore, I don’t know how much longer I can do this” when we got back to my house he seemed angry with me and immediately just said he was going to sleep. I started crying again because I didn’t know what I’d done wrong. Then he started crying too, we both just kind of sat there and held each other while we cried. I’m not going to lie, it completely broke my heart. I think he started to have a panic attack as well and through his gasps he said “I’m sorry that I’m not enough to keep you here, I just don’t know what to do” “how do I help you?” When I tell you my heart physically hurt, like genuinely I felt such a sharp pain in my chest I thought I was having a heart attack or something. Obviously after this I’m a lot more wary of telling him about stuff, I mean if he was that upset and anxious at just that then I can’t possibly tell him the full extent of how I feel can I? It’s not fair on him, but at the same time I desperately need help and he’s the only person I feel like I can really talk to. 

Every time I have a breakdown my first instinct is to call him but I usually don’t. Tonight however I did but it just made me feel worse because he sounded so sad and helpless. Basically all I did was just sob down the phone which made me feel like a massive bitch because he’d already said that he was tired and wanted to go to sleep. What I’m asking is
 1 - should I continue to try and deal with everything myself? 
2 - should I just tell him some stuff? 
3 - should I tell him everything? 
4 - if I should tell him, how do I do it?

Am I sick? Am I mentally ill? Surely this is isn’t real?,1716248909.0,"I was married 14 years… everything was great well… well almost… 

My wife slept with my brother in law January 1-2020. For some crazy reason… I was willing to make it work. I’d built business’s and we had amazing kids. I felt like it could be fixed. 

I bought a huge house and moved to the next neighborhood. It went well for six months but then everything changed. I went out of town to midland and when I came back.. Everything was different. My wife was distant.. she started living in the bathroom… I kept hearing her talking but I’d say what? She would just say she didn’t say anything. Except I could hear her! I could see her lips moving!! Over the next few years it got worst. It started happening at night! When I was sleeping… it would wake me up… and she would roll over fast.. I’d say who are you talking to?? Shed say no one! You’re crazy!! 

Then oddly enough, I was listening to previous activity on the Alexa… just to hear my grandma who has been sick with dementia.. but one voice at midnight… on a night I wasn’t home… was clearly not my voice.. but in my master bedroom.. 

It was simply a guy asking Alexa to Stop. Apparently this made me even crazier to my wife… who started telling everyone I’m hearing voices. Everyone accusing me of being on drugs!!! 

The cops are called twice on me for being crazy. 

Long story short.. there was no way I was crazy. I changed out all my cameras for ones with audio… I started recording… boom I catch her talking all the time!!! But she won’t listen to it or watch them… because she doesn’t need to watch it to know that she’s not doing it! 

Sooo I move on! I get a new girl… random girl I met at the gas station. 

Soo my wife moves out and … she moves next door… I bought multiple houses when we were happy…. Jokes on me… she’s my neighbor. 

I’m super happy…. Then one day.,. My girlfriend starts talking and doing the same crap my x was doing!!!!!!!??!??????

Literally… then I find out my computer is hacked badly! My cameras are hacked badly… My it guy says it was installed… 1-11-24 at 3:42am… oddly enough the voices on the cameras (that are recorded) are that of my girlfriend and my x wife!

I pull up my cameras… at that time… my girlfriend at the time…. Broke into my house and was on my computer!!! Then it seems like she called my wife at the time… and bragged about some crazy stuff… Sooooo I have all this recorded… but surely it’s not real???

Sooo I break up with her… and try to move on again…. But the day of my divorce… I’m feeling happy… I go and sign!!! Divorced!!!! I come home… the cops pull up… and commit me… saying I’m hearing voices and am suicidal.., which I’m not! Mind you..,. I just got divorced this day! Not sure how my x wife can get me committed… but o well… I get out of the hospital two days later… with a clean bill of house… then she calls the dog pound on me… and child protective services…

Could I be crazy??? All of this exists… am I nuts?????????? Why doesn’t anyone ask to see this stuff? What am I missing?

What professional or doctor should I visit related to dyslexia and ADHD? Plus I can talk about my mental health problem ,1716280772.0,"
I'm 19 years old now; I'm an upcoming freshman. Since I was a kid, I have already struggled with reading, speaking, and writing or spelling words in grammar; I am even experiencing stammering. Because of those, they have had a big impact on my life. I am struggling to learn Filipino and English since I am always mixing the position of the sound in the word. There's a time when I confuse the look of the letter. Changing the position of the letters like {C, S,X,Z), {I, E}, {U,O}, {B,D}, and {A,H}, I am done if those letters exist in one word. That's why I hated so much spelling and reading time from elementary school until high school. I easily forget the spelling of the word, even how to pronounce it. When I am trying to learn a new word, it is always difficult to follow the audio and learn how to pronounce it.


About ADHD, I am always struggling to fix my schedule. I can't focus on staying on one task. I can focus for just like 2 minutes; I am lucky if I can focus for 5 minutes. Moving on to another task while the other task is not even finished, or even not 50% finished. There's some occurrence after focusing for some minutes on one task, I will end up talking to myself or daydreaming until the pending task is not finished in exact time. I am not even an organized person; I always struggle to organize my things. I even call myself lazy, but whatever I do or try, I always end up doing nothing about my pending tasks. I am easily distracted by sounds in my surroundings. 

Plus my mood always changing overtime. 

I don't know if I have dyslexia or ADHD but If ever I have(hoping I don't have) I want to know how handle it. I am really afraid that it affected my learning skills in college. It really affects my daily life. In communication and handle my daily routines.

And I respected the rules for having one.
However, I was curious as to what a knife was capable of. Due to where I lived at the time there was mass amount of lizards and bugs. Before I continue, I warn that this might come off as scary or psychotic.
I use to capture lizards and place rocks on them so they couldn't move or I would hold them on the floor outside so they couldn't move. I would get my Swiss army knife and choose between the tools (pliers, knife, or scissors), I would remove limbs using the knife, or crush the bones in their limbs with the pliers. I use to hurt them in ways that were brutal. Crushing skulls or slicing them open. I would observe the effects of my actions and continue to do so. I would slice the legs of bugs off and watch as they squarm helplessly, placing them underneath heat lamps and watching them flail as they try to escape before they scorch.

am i just making it up for attention without realizing it?,1716272101.0,"
here’s a bit of context: for the longest time i just thought all my little “quirks” and odd thought patterns were due to autism- like needing to follow certain routines and doing things in certain ways. however, over the past month or two i’ve started to think that maybe a lot of things could be explained a bit better with OCD. i always just assumed that since i never had “physical” compulsions like flipping a switch x amount of times, that i couldn’t possibly have anything like OCD. i’ve only been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, depression, and autism. 

today i haven’t been able to eat anything at all- not because i dont have anything, but because of thought patterns. i tend to usually eat one really big meal at night because im insanely busy all day. for the last 4 days, i’ve been cutting up and eating an apple before i move on to cooking and eating my big meal. today was the same routine- i grabbed the last apple in the fridge and cut it up. but, before i could eat it, i dropped it on the floor. 

i immediately freaked out and just started crying, because something in me went “you can’t eat anything else until you eat an apple, since that’s what you have been doing. you need to finish the last apple in order to eat”. i thought maybe i could pick up the slices and wash them off and eat them, but i started freaking out even more because the slices touched the ground as well as the trash can and i’m convinced if i eat them i’d get very sick. and then i freaked out even more because i realized i’m wasting food by not eating it and wasting food makes me a bad person since someone else would be grateful to have an apple. 

so now it’s hours later and i’m starving but i can’t eat anything. it’s like my body and brain physically will not let me cook anything or eat any snacks at all. and i’m just sitting here confused, because could this be OCD? or is it just because of my autism and the fact that a routine was disrupted? 

any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. i’m really anxious that maybe i could just be attention seeking without realizing it and don’t want to say anything to my psychiatrist until i get other opinions (since if i AM just attention seeking then maybe my psychiatrist would fire me as a client).

For years I have not been myself. I’ve been doing and thinking stuff I would never before. I want to ruin all my friendships, I want to run away, I just want to ruin my life and I don’t know why. My childhood wasn’t that bad though I moved around a lot, didn’t have any parental supervision, my mother basically didn’t put much effort into raising me because i’ve been “independent” since I was 6. I started staying home alone at 7. I did things on my own. But my mother still was always nice and I haven’t been abused. 

Yet for some reason I can’t help but feel completely depressed all the time. I have urges to sh (though not very extreme as I haven’t before), I smoke weed (though I’m not addicted or rely on it to feel better), I rot in bed all day, I can barely do basic hygiene, I have no motivation to do anything.

I recently got a girlfriend and it hasn’t even been a month yet but I have an urge to ruin my relationship. I love her so much though, I don’t want to lose her ever but there’s something in my brain that’s saying “you hate her, she’s annoying”. I feel horrible for even thinking that because it’s not true but I can’t stop these thoughts. 

For years I have also had violent thoughts about harming people around me or my brothers. I would never, EVER act on these thoughts and I feel disgusting for even thinking about it but I just can’t stop. 

I have had urges to develop an ed because then I wouldn’t be fat. I am overweight and have always felt extremely insecure about my weight and looks. I had a friend recently who called me fat (as a joke, but it hit too close to come) and it triggered these thoughts tenfold. I know better to act on these urges but it’s getting harder everyday to reason with myself. I genuinely got sick to my stomach the other day when I looked at my face.

I want to SCREAM. I’m tired of people that don’t know me labeling me and deciding they know more about my mental state than my own damn self. IVE BERN DOING THIS FOR 20 YEARS.

How do I (23m) become more positive?,1716261838.0,"
Hi,
Im a 23 y/o man who is trying to fogure out how to have happiness and enjoyment from life. Growing up around a lot of bad, mentally unstable people and the experiences/traumas that came a long with it really hammered home how life just sucks and that I'm going to hate it. My family, school and people around me made sure that I knew that.
Getting out of highschool and gaining some freedom, I was the happiest most positive version of me that I had been. I had genuine hope that life was going to improve.
Then covid came and pulverized any hope of happiness that I've had. In order to change that I went to university after finishing college and moved out on my own. The problem is I can't find that spark that I had before covid that drove me to improve, love myself and people around me. All I see now is depression, poverty and hate. 
It's having a horrible impact on my ability to form and maintain relationships, aswell as succeed in my studies and find work. I have little to no access to mental health services, and even if I did idk how I would force myself to go. It's almost comforting to be this miserable.
I want to know how to climb out of this sunken hole and be the more alive person that I used to be. I'm tired of feeling lonely, unloved and ashamed.

I never did any internships, so I still haven’t found a job with my degree and am completely discouraged because it feels like everyone has experience or social ability to make up the difference but me. I never got a credit card and so now that I need to find my own place I feel disadvantaged again. 

The worst part is I feel deep inside me that a part of me or something I care about is lost every year. I feel stuck spinning my wheels. I want to break this cycle but I feel powerless to my mental health. I’m tired of feeling like I’m late to the party.

I get comfortable with whatever scope life gives me and that’s when I feel I really fail. I don’t want to look ahead I want to avoid worry altogether until time slips by and I’m left a nervous wreck.

Opinion on what to do with my life ,1716261325.0,"Okay I'm gonna get straight into this, I'd like to say to say that I've had a pretty difficult upbringing, my family was always a mess and there's alot of family issues, my parents would always fight and say horrible things about eachother and everyone in my family. Since my older sister was pretty much a straight A student in everything, my parents expected me to do better, which I couldn't do, since my whole life I've only been ever so slightly above average at everything, which may sound good but it ends up causing me to be good at nothing, which causes the most praise I've ever gotten from even my parents to be ""good"" or ""okay"". I have no idea where I'm going here 

Now I would like to mention that I have taken steps to improve myself, I practice multiple martial arts, workout, like I said, have not bad grades. See recently I do wish to push a little harder though, during a 300m race at school, just for regular gym class, I had a horrible start but still managed to somehow catch up to 1st place and was beat by milliseconds, I was running faster than him I just ran out of track to beat him on. See that loss made me really reflect on life and I realized that I've always come 2nd in anything I do.

See, getting to my point now, I do know I have enough potential and that aslong as I try I might be able to make it big but the thing is I just doubt I will. I mean the odds are like probably eighty in eight billion. So I just don't see a point in trying, but at the same time I literally sometimes dream of being so high up no one can reach me.

So yeah I got no idea what to do in life, I'm still in highschool but I have no interests or hobbies, often it feels like my entire personality is based of characters I see in media.

The only idea I've kinda has is that if I can't make a difference in this world, I become some highschool maybe middle school teacher and help kids make a difference.

Been a tough past 1-2 years,1716259456.0,"25M, depression & anxiety are something I’ve dealt with virtually my whole life, stemming from childhood trauma. It was really bad when I got out of the military, but I did a really great job figuring it out for a year or two after hitting my rock bottom. I was grateful/thankful for what I had, had a positive outlook on life & the future, and didn’t have constant anxiety. Lately, over the past year or so, I’ve been fighting to keep from dwindling back down into that pit and just nothing is working it seems. I’m not sure what’s causing it this time.

I have a job that I despise, although I do have a business venture I’m going to pursue. I have health issues that I have been dealing with the past year, nothing life threatening but it does make me feel sick nearly 24/7.

At the same time, I feel guilty because I know how fortunate I am. I’m with the most incredible woman that I’ve been with for the past 3 years and we are engaged. She is an angel and I don’t deserve her. Occasionally, due to my shit, I cause problems and am not the partner she deserves.

It all came to a head the other day when we had the biggest fight we’ve ever had, by far, considering we don’t fight often at all. She was in a bad mood and instead of trying to be nice and supportive, I threw her attitude right back at her. I threw a cabinet across the room after about 1 hour of bickering, and she screamed the loudest I’ve ever heard saying “STOP”, and immediately dropped to the ground and broke down. I’ve never really done this, it’s all just been building up over the past year and I just needed to get it out, but I’m not going to act like it was a good decision. We just sat there and cried together for awhile, getting everything off of our chests. When I went to touch her, she flinched initially, as if she was scared. It completely broke my heart. Me throwing that cabinet across the room brought up some of her childhood trauma of her dad abusing her mom. We hugged, kissed, apologized, and said how much we loved & cared for eachother.

Should I sue my old psychiatrist?,1716257625.0,"I have bipolar 1. I used to be completely stable on meds. I had a good job that I didn’t struggle to keep, I had financial freedom, my social life was thriving, I was happy, and I was mania and depression free for the most part.

But then I got this new fancy psychiatrist who claimed to specialize in bipolar and schizophrenia. I thought, well if I’m successful now *and* I have this disorder then I better get the best treatment money can buy before this illness fucking sabotages everything I’ve built. 

New psych disregarded our entire intake and after talking to me for 15 mins about my life, he said there’s no need for an intake because there’s nothing wrong with me— I’m too successful to be bipolar or have any mental illness. He told me his “real” bipolar patients can’t hold down a job or maintain relationships, like I can. And there’s no way I’m bipolar. He even called his “real” BP patients “crazy”.

I was on 400mg lamictal and 400mg seroquel. He told me to completely discontinue the meds, cold turkey. This seemed like bad advice, but he insisted I’d be fine cold turkey quitting since I’m not *really* bipolar.

I listened to him. I wanted him to be right because I don’t want to have this disorder…So, when I went off my meds, I destroyed what I built (which was what I was avoiding in the first place). Wound up in the hospital for 45 days! Lost my job. Ended up in extreme debt. Had to move in with my parents. Basically my whole life fell apart.

I’ve tried SO hard, but I’m stuck in a cycle of mania and depression. I just want to feel stable like I did before all this happened. Then I could turn my life back around and build back up to where I was before… maybe even surpass where I was before… But I keep having episodes. Which makes it near impossible to live well. 

If I had never taken his advice, wow… I’d be a different person. I wish I never listened to him. But it’s too late. I do want justice at this point, though.

"Im sure I don’t have bipolar. despite this, my diagnosis may be preventing me from being able to do TMS",1716256737.0,"I don’t identify with bipolar. I don’t have manic episodes. I’ve never had one. Now I am BPD, OCD, MDD, have GAD, but no bipolar. I swear upon it. In fact, I was diagnosed by someone else with unipolar depression. How can I be bipolar if I have unipolar depression??

Despite this, I’m still diagnosed with bipolar. I’ve also been given bipolar meds it seems (gee I wonder why they didn’t work?? Well besides the fact that I’m very likely not bipolar, I might also be treatment resistant). But bc of this diagnosis and all these meds I’ve taken for bipolar, the TMS doctor I saw today probably assumed I’m bipolar and maybe thought I was lying to him to try and get TMS treatment, and therefore said I wouldn’t be a good fit for TMS.

I’m so SO mad rn. I so sure I wont have mania or overstimulation because of TMS (if I’m able to get it, ok? I’m so sure I won’t. I DONT HAVE MANIC EPISODES. IVE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE.

I mean, just consider that my psychiatrist actually told me I have dissociative identity disorder. There’s actually a chance she might’ve diagnosed me with that. NO I DONT HAVE MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES. even if she didn’t actually diagnose me with that, to tell her patient verbally she has DID is bad enough.

So, bc of a likely misdiagnosis, I’m sure I’m being screwed over and not being able to get TMS. which I could likely benefit from. I’ve tried 16 meds, all failed.

Mental Health Safety Plan - Visualisation Aid,1716254469.0,"Mid-2023 was a pivotal time for me, as I was grappling with overwhelming triggers and events.

This visualisation emerged from a deep need to manage these overwhelming moments effectively and ensure my mental well-being amidst various challenges.

My journey has been marked by complex trauma (CPTSD), advocacy for my sister with an intellectual disability, and navigating the often frustrating mental health system. Through these experiences, I've developed a robust and comprehensive [Mental Health Safety Plan](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGF0f151G4/qveH7153WB2MwymoULkHeA/view?utm_content=DAGF0f151G4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor), which I visualised [using Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGF0f151G4/qveH7153WB2MwymoULkHeA/view?utm_content=DAGF0f151G4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor). This plan has been instrumental in helping me maintain stability and resilience.

I hope that by sharing this visualisation, others find inspiration to piece together their Mental Health Safety Plan. Whether you're dealing with similar challenges or supporting someone who is, this tool can be a valuable resource in managing mental health proactively.

Everything feels weird,1716253202.0,"Idk if this is the right forum to post this in but Idk where else so. Does anyone feel the same way?

It‘s very hard to exactly describe the feeling but basically everything feels more like in a dream, like it’s kinda not really happening right now and nothing makes sense anymore and feels just unfamiliar? Sometime it feels like I‘m in some fever dream where everything is really random and doesn‘t fit together. Sometimes I can’t see humans as humans anymore, just figures that are there and don’t have their own life. I‘ve also been losing a lot of motivation for anything and nothing is really fun anymore, even things that I used to enjoy. Like I just wanna exist and daydream and not actually do anything that I have to do

I don’t know if I feel like I don’t exist either, I guess the best way to describe it is that my body doesn’t feel like it belongs to me, but I do think that I‘m real (not 100% sure though as it’s such a weird feeling that I can’t put into words)

When I looked it up I found out about derealisation but I‘m not sure if that fits because I heard that it’s caused by anxiety which I don’t have a lot, nor do I have trauma or anything :/

How to deal with a person that probably has multiple personality disorder,1716252987.0,"A friend of mine was facing being homeless and having to go into a shelter if room was available. All options had been exhausted, so I am letting my friend use my spare bedroom on a temporary basis. What I didn't know is that my friend seems to have multiple personalities. 

There is the person I knew (albeit not well, but felt well enough to let the person move in). And there is one that seems that doesn't know who I am, throws out random names with no coherent flow from topic to topic. Doesn't feel threatening or confrontational, just more like a random string of names, words, and phrases. There might be a 3rd personality where the person talks about an implant in their face, makes random gestures using their hand from a motion like flicking from the jaw, pointing to the their eye and then flicking from there, and another motion that was similar to a throat slash. That personality seems a little more confrontational. 

My question is - what's the best way to deal with this person? Do I bring up the episodes when I think I am talking to the person I knew? Do I try to get a hold of one of their relatives and explain what I am seeing? Totally lost here as this is something I have never directly experienced, although someone I dated about 5 years ago was so hot/cold from day to day that many who knew her wondered if there was more than one personality.

About two years ago, I've made a couple of friends online, we were all in a group and we generally had a good time, however one person from that group was really toxic towards me, at one point I couldn't take it anymore and just blocked all of them and told them to leave me alone. Months passed by and I thought I'll never reach out to them ever again, from time to time I would remember them but I would also quickly remember how they treated me and just brush it off and remind myself I wasn't the one in the wrong.


However about a month ago I've went through a really horrible event, I'm not gonna talk about what it was because it would take me too long and doesn't matter in the context of this story, all that matters is that I felt really bad and for some reason got this urge to apologize to one of them. I absolutely should not have listened to these thoughts, but I did and the one person that I have contacted forgave me and things continued as normal. A short time later they told me I should apologize to that one toxic person, and even though I didn't feel the need to do that, I did so anyway. I at least expected that they would apologize to me as well because they treated me horribly, but instead they just told me they still dislike me and how maybe that would change with time and how they don't feel the need to apologize to me.

Soon after that horrible situation ended, I was able to think rationally again and I left them once again, I quickly realized how stupid it was of me to apologize to pretty much any of them, mainly to the toxic one who treated me horribly.

Pregnant and I don't know why this comment about anxiety is affecting me so much,1716249747.0,"I don't know why I'm here on reddit for so many hours today.

This is not because I think people shouldn't be able to post about negative outcomes or get support for their losses, just because it might be nice to have a place for positive stories when you are feeling anxious. 

A commenter called me cold and insensitive to people with loss and I tried to explain that I was just looking for a way to help with anxiety. she said ""I mean it is interesting to me in that I have not spent this pregnancy in constant stress and fear of a loss despite going through multiple. I learned how to deal with anxiety. I learned how to hold space for negative things.

But it seems like everyone on this thread thinks I'm evil/ stupid for wanting to talk about anxiety or for having it at all. I'm questioning whether all of this is just me being stupid and if I really have mental health issues.

Some background about me:

My mom's mother died suddenly in a car crash when my mom was pregnant with me. My mom was depressed for most of my childhood and physically and emotionally abusive to me (and my dad was physically and emotionally abusive to her) She has not really been here to support me through my pregnancy. My husband is wonderful but his mother hates me because of my race (she literally didn't like me before she met me and has made all sorts of racist comments and now no longer speaks to him for marrying me). I've just been kind of sad and depressed throughout my pregnancy realizing I've never really  had any maternal support around.

I've also just had a tough few years feeling like I'm not enough no matter how much I achieve though workaholism and perfectionism.

I don't know why, I feel so stupid, but this comment has really re-triggered not wanting to live thoughts in me. I shouldn't be having a baby, she deserves better than me. How could I do this to her? I can't stop crying. Idk, just looking for some reassurance that it's ok I have anxiety and talked about it.

I have a very polluted mind. I am aware but I don’t know what to do about it. It’s filled with jealousy and hatred. I don’t even know where to start to identify the problem. I wasn’t like this before, or if I was but I wasn’t conscious about it, although it didn’t feel like it. I started blaming everything and everyone for these feelings, my genetics, parents, religion, culture, school life, myself, god, what not.

I fear this is going to destroy me, my future, and any chance of getting a life. I’m not determined either. I feel disconnected from god, nation, people because I have to look towards the other side of the world to find it. I’m an immigrant. I enjoy cultures, not like I hate it, but there’s short outbursts of jealousy that come up, and me being aware of it, trying to suppress it and smile. Sometimes it changes and I get genuinely happy.

I couldn’t get the award as I wasn’t qualified on paper, even though having the skills on hand(she took two course while I took one as I joined late because I wasn’t aware of this system), big setback. I was genuinely happy for her and then suddenly my smile faded away and I started hating myself, forcing the smile back up.

I think i could be autistic ,1716245640.0,"
I dont know because i might just be weird, i mean i dont act like other autistic people like in media and stuff, i tend to keep it to myself (i think masking is whats its called and what it could be) but i still have a lot of symptoms and stuff, like i have lots of sensory issues (common ones like tags and the socks not feeling right but also ones like i cant drink out of cups with thick rims and i have to be wearing socks at all times except when im in the shower and i literally can not eat crunchy food it makes me cry). I am super sensitive to loud noise (unless its my music in which i cry if its not loud enough) but like i cant walk through hallways because they are too loud and crowded which makes me late to most lessons (i feel like this has nothing to do with autism and more just claustrophobia). I constantly rock back and forth or fidget my legs and what not and when im happy/excited i tend to jump around (stimming potentially?)

 I constantly get told by my family that i shout when i speak even when i think im being quiet and that what i say is rude even when i dont think it is. Ive always had some form of obsession from as long as i can remember tbh (harry potter when i was like 5-8ish descendants when i was around 8-10 and now haikyuu) and its like a very full blown obsession. One more thing worth noting is i almost always feel like my bones are trying to crawl out my body (this probably has nothing to do with this but its so annoying i have to mention it) it makes me almost always in a constant state of uncomfortable ness and it drives me insane.

 Another thing is that i completely switch personalitys when im at home. Im relatively outgoing at school and would defo so im an extrevert but when i get home its like my whole personality flips. I hate speaking when I'm at home and usually just talk with grunts and 'yes' 'no' or 'ok'. Idk i might just be overthinking it. Ive also always had this weird feeling that im just really different and that im not like real compared to everyone else and yeh (check my last post on r/mentalhealth about the feeling weird) but i feel like wrong saying i think i might be or even asking to see like a person to talk about it with because i dont ""act out"" like a lot of the autistic people you see in media and yeh.

I’m also not one of those people that thinks, “Oh. There are so many other people that have it so much worse.” Because that’s not comforting. Though my wife is. If anything it makes me feel worse when I think about the state of the world in general. But that’s neither here nor there. 

I’m looking for advice from those of you who have hit below rock bottom. I mean. So low that you also have considered ending the story of your life but only realizing how much that would only cause more issues for your loved ones, wouldn’t solve anything really cause you don’t know what actually happens after death, etc.

And they don’t seem to really care that they don’t have things together. They are very nonchalant about their lives.

how do you meet people and get over social anxiety? Feel like I'm reaching a critical point in my life,1716232950.0,"hello, i do not typically use reddit but i've hit a bit of a rock and figured i could use some advice or comments from other people. This is a bit of a rant, but I feel like some context is necessary to understand where I am. I'm a 21 year old guy with basically no social life, and I've really never had one. I have a few friends from High School I talk to every now and then, we play games online sometimes and text here and there, and I have a very small circle of online friends with a similar dynamic, but as far as irl interactions go I've basically been completely isolated for many many years. I've also never been in a relationship or dated. For a long time I've felt very very unsatisfied with my inability to make meaningful relationships (platonic/romantic) but I convinced myself everything would sort itself out. I wasted my entire life up to college basically doing nothing but sitting around on my pc all day outside of school (never invited to stuff even by the people I did consider friends) and I had wanted to make a big change in college. I tried for a bit. Coursework got overwhelming, had very little luck actually making any friendships. Ended up back in my isolationist hole. Three years down the line, I'm going into my senior year in the same exact situation. Never invited to places, never got to hang out with people, never really got out to do anything fun. Despite spending so much time online I have very few friendships there either. Recently I decided I'm sick of it. I'm starting to feel like I'm running out of time on having these first experiences and building that social backbone. I want to change, I want to be better, I want to actually live a fulling life, I'm done pretending it's not a problem.

  
Here are my big problems though; as you'd expect from someone in my situation, my social skills are abysmal. I'm rarely in a position where I can talk to people anyway, but when I am, I feel like I have so little to talk about or connect on. I always show interest in the things others talk about, but it seems they quickly realize I have nothing of substance to contribute myself and grow disinterested. Secondly, as far as relationships go, I've been realizing how much of a detriment it is to start feeling ""behind,"" in a sense. As in, most people have their big relationship screw-ups and figure out what they do/don't like during their teen years and are able to work that stuff out and be more prepared going into their later life. They know how it goes, they know what to look for, because they've already gone through the ringer on it. Unfortunately, I haven't, which means that I will definitely be fighting a very uphill battle in that department. I also have a lot of social anxiety/self-esteem issues that I've been wanting and trying to work on, because it really feels like people are able to feel the ""negative vibes"" or whatever when you're too down on yourself internally even if you don't make a point of it outright. Unfortunately this transitions into my last big problem and really what I want to ask about: I live in a very rural area with very little in the way of clubs or bars or anything that isn't about an hour or more away. No real hang-out spots or fun social activities near me outside of things like church (I am not religious) or groups of people 40 years my senior. Essentially, this is what I want to ask: how do I even begin fixing this? I want to put myself in uncomfortable situations and break this mental barrier, but there's really just nothing around here to do or go to. I'm so, so tired of living my life in a cycle of isolation with no one to talk to and nothing to do, but it feels like I have no course of action to even get started. For a bit of extra context, yes my college obviously has parties and stuff that go on as does any college, but I'm not privy to any of the details/locations and I only have a year left there. It's also an hour out from where I actually live, so it's not super easy for me to just hang around the area where there's a bit more stuff to do (although honestly, if I could find friends there I'd be more than willing to drive out everyday just to hang around and do fun stuff).

What can I do to help myself?,1716230396.0,"For context, I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, psychosis, and most recently borderline personality disorder. Sometimes I have episodes, which I have now learned is called splitting, where it feels like an intense emotion controls me. I can't control myself when this happens and only realize that I wasn't myself after the episode ends. Every single time this happens, it leads to a plan on S\*. I always come back to myself before anything happens, but mainly because I had someone to live for. That person is no longer there and without that support it feels like there is nothing left. For the first time, I have taken the first step in this plan. I do not feel these S\* urges right now, but I know when it happens again I will have nothing holding me back. For the longest I have tried to find something to keep me alive, but it really feels like there is nothing. It is a bit weird but watching Dexter has kept me alive as it is something to watch and occupy my mind. But that is all I am able to do. I have not been able to actually do anything to further my life like sign up for college classes. For as long as I can remember, I have not once felt an actual drive or will to do anything. It has always been for someone else but never myself. How can I find that will? I don't want to die but am scared because I wont be able to control myself if it happens again.

Have I become too Mature at a young age? ,1716228471.0,"Tbh, pls dont bully me and whatever I say, is fact about me, not made up. 

I am a 14 yr old Male, so I am a kid. 
My family isn't toxic towards me but towards my big sis, whom I love with all my heart. Not my whole family is toxic towards my Sis but only my Mother is. And I, I love both of them but as I grew up,coming to like age 10,i started seeing this family issue scene as I have to pick either mom or my sis. I love both of them with all my heart and non of them is toxic towards me. My dad tries to avoid this topic and my Middle-child sis (I am the youngest) is a devil. She tries to cause fights b/w my sis and mom, that my dad has seen so much that he's tired of this shit now. 

Still growing up, I've seen both my mom and sis say suicidol things, which as a kid, couldn't handle and didn't know how to react. Instead, I cried instead and ""tried"" To comfort them. 

In the following years, this family issue has lowered by alot as I've seen and figured a way to solve these but, I've left the battleground with a stain, with my lessons and skills. 

I have some friends on discord and I have a friend, who I see as my big bro, invited his gf to the server and I've became friend with her. After some time, apparently, my friend told me that his gf said that I am Mature. To which, I remembered this isn't the first time that I've been called Mature for my age. This happened before too. 

This Psychological Trauma I've got with growing up toxic family  experience have left me totally changed. It's like I am the most mentally intelligence person in the whole classroom and let me tell you-

It really wasn't easy to pick b/w THE 2 people you love the most and PICK BETWEEN THEM. Man... Those were real dark days, everyday was just crying and being called dumb and asked question if ""my sis did this or not"".

Do I have a fear of women/relationship/commitment?,1716226756.0,"Hello, (TLDR at the end)
For the past 7 years I have been single(I am 26M). This is not the biggest problem itself, however I would love to find that person someday, that’s why I am using Tinder and other dating apps. I had partial success there, went on a few dates and with some it even clicked. But then afterwards I have very heavy self doubts. Usually like:
What if she doesn’t fit in my friend group? I am too fat, how could she like me? What if she sees me naked and it ends there? Am I too unattractive? My teeth too yellow? Double chin? I just have this feeling that every single thing about me is judgable. Afterwards, I always ended contact and stopped the dating thing for a few months and tried again. Recently was the 4th time this happened. I can’t bring myself to workout in regards to that insecurity. I am ~180 and ~107kg. I don’t consider myself too fat most of the time, while I am obese but I still consider myself quite sporty as in I have no restrictions regarding movement or health problems. Then again I have also been judgemental about that to my dates, as I cannot see myself dating someone overweight that also has problems moving. (Yes I know double standard…).I don’t think I would have a problem dating someone similar to me, as in, overweight but still sporty enough. And this is where that 4th date happened. She was like me in that regard, but then my mind went ahead and ruined it again: What if I’m too bad at Sex? What if she thinks I’m too fat? Small dick? Bell too big? Can’t pleasure her? As it seems, whenever I reach a new goal (here, a woman that I liked and we were similar in a few regards and I thought to myself this could work), I create new problems that either exist or don’t and I don’t even try to give it a chance. I don’t know if I went and included everything but I feel like I typed enough. Now for my problem/question:

What is it? Is it a fear? Am I stupid?


TL;DR: whenever a relationship situation could tend to get serious, I get self doubts and cancel all, feel down for months and try again

is it okay to disappear for a while from texting/social media to feel better?,1716221036.0,"I’m 24F, I’ve been going to therapy since February (4 months) after a one-time psychotic event during my study abroad experience. That episode forced me to come back home and take care of my mental health while being close to my family. That episode really affected me emotionally and impacted my mood. I started having really weird thoughts about wanting to end it, but never idealized it, just thoughts like “why don’t i die?” “i want to shoot myself”. Then therapy and meds to regulate mood helped me feel better. I’m still fighting with my emotions, i’ve been feeling lonely for a long time now. I lost majority of my friends because of them moving away, when I more needed them. I see a friend very sporadically and nobody ecxept my family knows I see a psychiatrist. It’s like a secret I keep without having no one to vent to. I’m seeing a guy for some months now, and even tho i wanted to keep it casual I probably started having feelings for him. Yesterday I asked him what was his position in our relationship and he said he’s okay with a casual thing. I was surprised because we text daily and talk a lot on the phone. I didn’t know how much his answer impacted me and now I feel like a need a break from everything. I’ve been really sad today and skipped lesson to stay home.

Depression camp,1716235660.0,"Hello. I'm depressed (and ADHD, ASD, most likely PTSD and another burnout) and I can't deal with it myself, even with therapy and meds.

I've been working hard on my mental health for the past 5 years, but life wasn't giving me a break. The last straw - I'm being laid off of my job soon, I really liked it, it was the only thing that kept me getting up.

I'm ""highly functional"" and even look decently healthy, but my body is in constant pain because of poor self-care, barely moving and even eating became just whatever to not starve. I don't really have friends and my family is far away. I can't visit them (war). I'm probably asexual and aromantic, I stopped caring about material stuff and I just don't have any motivations.

Now when my job ends, I will have some time and a little bit of money that I won't send to my family. I want to improve my mental health, I can't keep going without reason. I chose to focus on restoring ability to enjoy day-to-day things, like cooking, self-care, hobbies. And making friends! I'm chatty, but don't connect to people, out of sight - out of mind.

And I should be able to work on these things myself, but I failed so many times. I don't want to waste more time and end up in my misery. I'm easily making reasonable plans with my therapist, very positive when I try to discuss it with friends or support groups, but then it's all gone when I'm on my own. I was always chaotic and relied on motivations, so with ADHD I struggle with structure or habits and they never stick, it's constant effort that I can't make now.

Now, as a student, I participated in some clinical trials. The experience was amazing - everything is arranged on the clock and you have no choice, no say in the matter. Like a prison, but better food and cheerful. I miss that place, it was more relaxing than any vacation.

And so I was thinking about similar experiences, but focused on adapting to a normal life and self-care. Like a camp, where a bunch of people live together, cook for each other, have like cooking lessons to make better food; physiotheraphy (guidance would be good to recover at first, when I push myself to do something I end up hurting myself); do some hobbies, like art theraphy and shit; play boardgames, etc. 

That sounds like something from a movie, a fancy rehab for rich people. I'm fine with something rustic, but it needs to be something focused on this ""develop habits and affection for daily life"". Any ideas where to look for something like this? But not a cult / religious / idiological :D

And maybe someone even has experiences? I'm in Belgium (can move for that period or fully relocate), have EU passport, speak English. Western Europe or non EU probably would be expensive, but Eastern isn't much into mental health.

Hopefully I can find and afford something like this, it's my only hopeful idea. Thanks.",MindlessHead11,,False,1cwp1ey,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cwp1ey/depression_camp/

"Scheduled an appointment, but I’m scared now.",1716240152.0,"I have seen psychologist and psychiatrist before in the past. I’m fairly certain I have ADHD, (was actually diagnosed with it around 5-6 years old, doc told Mom I would outgrow it because I’m female) but anyway never considered it until recently, like less than a year ago. Professionals in the past have diagnosed me with schizophrenia, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and BPD. I have a lot of past trauma ( who doesn’t) I won’t go into all of that here but I’m not sure I agree with all of their diagnosis’s. In fact it has been years since I’ve seen someone. Anyway, after doing my own research I found these are commonly misdiagnosed due to ADHD. 

My mental health has greatly affected my personal relationships (3 failed marriages already), and cost me multiple jobs in the past. I am 43 and for the first time in my life I have found a healthy partner, and a great career. He is caring, patient, understanding, and supportive. I have caused many fights between us and said some very hurtful things to him on multiple occasions. I take full accountability for that and know it is not fair or reciprocal on my part. Like just because he loves me and has patience with me doesn’t give me the right to behave the way I do. 

He has said in the past that he won’t give up on me. Truth is I know that’s not true. At some point it will be too much for him and he will leave me. In fact we almost broke up 2 nights ago. We were having an argument and he asked for 5 min, which I should have immediately given to him, but I panicked thinking he would take those 5 min and decide to leave me. (I obviously have abandonment issues) This actually enraged him that I did not reciprocate this request as he had given to me the last time we had an argument and I asked for 5 min. He said he was done and for me to leave in the morning. We did end up making up but I know this may repeat if I don’t do something about myself.

So today I scheduled an appointment with a mental health professional. I can’t keep losing people I love. I can’t keep hurting them. I can’t keep pushing them away. On top of that I absolutely LOVE my new job (it’s been 1.5 years) and I worry that my mental health will eventually take this away from me as well. 

But I’m scared. I’m scared they will just put me on some medication that doesn’t help, misdiagnose me again, or just say things to keep me placated without actually helping me heal. I don’t have time to waste I only have this one life.

Sexless marriage,1716243274.0,"Hello everyone, I need some advice. Two and a half years ago, I entered into an arranged marriage, and since then, I've been facing the issue of a sexless marriage. I'm unsure if this is normal and have no one to ask.

In the first three months, we didn't have sex. I thought I needed to be more understanding and give my wife time since we had just moved to another country. However, even after two and a half years, the situation hasn't improved. After three months and several arguments, my wife agreed to have sex, but now we only do so 2-3 times a month, and that's usually after I push for it or we have a fight. We've never experienced a honeymoon phase or mutual desire for sex, and we only ever have one round. Her vagina is always dry, so we have to use lube.

During these two years, we've traveled and enjoyed each other's company, so I don't think communication is the issue. I believe she simply doesn't have the desire for sex. When I bring it up, she says she's tired, which I understand, but she finds time for social media. What about weekends or holidays? Is she always tired? Even when I return home after being away for 2-3 weeks, she's not interested in sex.

This situation consumes my thoughts, and I find myself watching porn and masturbating every night, worried that I might end up having an affair. I've had numerous discussions with my wife, but they always lead to arguments. She believes this is normal and that I'm the one with an excessive need for sex.

For context, she doesn't like masturbating, has never watched porn, and never gets wet without lube.

Idk man, I’m just scared. I am also scared that if I don’t have something to do this summer then I might get in my own head and get anxious.

A Question - Brain Operation + Stroke + Seizures = ??,1716238331.0,"Long story short, I was operated on a little under a year ago for an unruptured brain aneurysm. It was too big to deal with in a conventional way, so they had to do a ""bypass"".  During the operation, the aneurysm popped and started to bleed.  In order to stop it, they had to kill a vein sitting close to the aneurysm which caused a mild stroke.  About four months after I had an epileptic seizure.  Am now up to two and have been seizure free since my last one roughly six months ago.

But a few days after the operation I started feeling ""off"", and the further I get from the operation the less I feel like myself.  Like the original me is off doing his own thing and I'm just a copy doing my thing in a way.  

I feel these abstract feelings at times that are hard to explain, like I'll feel normal and then all of a sudden a rush of a feeling will wash over me making me feel like I'm in another place, in another time.  Or all of a sudden I'll relieve emotions from many decades ago.  Not remembering anything, just feeling the feelings I had during that experience, like my Disneyland trip when I was four!  Not all the emotions are negative, like the Disneyland feeling.  But some are just off putting but just gives me anxiety as they're just so out there.

I'm going to see my GP doctor next week and just want to give him a good explanation as to what I'm experiencing, or maybe ask is ""this what I have"" if someone can throw some ideas out there.

I don't know if it's the medication I'm on for the seizures or what. For the first medication I was on was called Lamictal. They would give me extreme anxiety attacks but I still felt like myself.  Then they switched me to a medication called Zebinix.  And I'm unsure if that's causing it or what or if something else is going on.

Can you advice for a 67 / F?,1716236650.0,"Hi, I am asking on behalf of 67/F (my mother).

Summary to the situation:

1. She has been aggressive and violent all her life.
2. Lately things are getting worse - Her manic episode happens once a month and lasts for 7-8days.
3. She is tormenting my father and everyone in the house - She simply doesn't like her in-laws (my brothers wives - they are not to be blamed).
4. My dad has been suffering from a serious medical condition and bed ridden. He is helpless and so is all of us.
5. I suspect she has some kind of mental disorder (Schizoprenia/Bipolar) but she refuses to acknowledge (confirmed by our family doctor although not formally diagnosed) will get help. The country laws prevent us from forcing her to get treatment.
6. Her behaviour could well be an issue but its difficult to say - Narcissism is the term I believe but at this age nothing can be done.

My question:

1. Apart from point 5 & 6 I was wondering if there is anything that could be physically wrong with her - I am just thinking - is it anything to do with hormones for a woman at that age that could make go into rage/manic episodes once a month? I am just looking at all possibilities for her behaviour so I can understand the root of her problem - I know none of this matters as she refuses to believe she is causing hassle to everyone in the house but I still need to understand why she is behaving the way she does.",Friendly_Success4325,,False,1cwpfup,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cwpfup/can_you_advice_for_a_67_f/

How to talk about my feelings without crying in the first minute?,1716236448.0,"After COVID lockdowns I (21f) started tapping into my mental health issues and reviewing some family trauma and I’ve come a long way when it comes to self confidence, being at peace with myself and my life etc. but I still struggle with talking about my feelings.

That is fine when I’m talking to my best friend bc I’m comfortable crying in front of her, but I don’t think I’ll be able to get my thoughts across to my parents if I start crying before I even make a single coherent thought out. My mom is very emotionally intelligent so it’s easier to talk to her as opposed to my dad who is probably worse at it than me.

It may take weeks if not months to heal but give yourself time to mourn, feel those big feelings and try to find some comfort in happy memories.

How to Manage Guilt and Emotional Strain During a Parent's Cancer Battle?,1716231649.0,"TL;DR: My father, who was diagnosed with lung cancer two years ago, recently had a recurrence after a period of stability. This time feels more challenging due to his deteriorated health and diminished optimism. My mother is struggling as his primary caregiver. I have been experiencing persistent guilt without a clear cause and am seeking advice on how to manage these feelings.

----------

Two years ago, my father was diagnosed with lung cancer. After various treatments, the tumor stopped growing, and it was no longer necessary to continue the treatments. This was extremely positive news, considering that this type of cancer can never be completely eradicated; thus, this was the best possible scenario.

Unfortunately, at his latest check-up scan a little over a month ago, it was found that the tumors have started growing again. Today, my father had his first new chemotherapy session.

The initial diagnosis two years ago was emotionally very tough. However, this time it feels even more challenging. My father is not as optimistic as he was during the first round of treatment and is much weaker (he has lost 10 kilograms in the past three weeks, partly due to stress). My mother is also having a hard time. She is a very caring woman and seeing her struggle is difficult for me. She faces the disease and my depressed father 24 hours a day.

For the past three weeks, I have been experiencing a lot of guilt. These feelings do not stem from any specific situation but seem to exist without a clear reason, making me feel guilty. These emotions are affecting my daily life, and I want to learn how to manage them.

I am very curious if others recognize this in themselves and what they have done to minimize these feelings and/or cope with them.

6 months ago both of my grandparents, the two people closest to me, passed at the same time. Prior to their death was two months of taking care of them, in and out of hospitals waiting for the end. 

I’ve struggled ever since, and things seem to be snowballing. 

Everyone told me I would grow around the grief and that it would seem easier over time but it just seems to be getting harder. I haven’t been able to leave their house aside for obligations like work, major family events, etc. I’ve always considered myself a homebody, but now I rarely go out and do things unless I have to.

My depression is pretty bad and I just want to lay in bed most days. I’ve been eating like shit because I can’t really make myself go to the grocery store or cook. My hygiene is fine but I’ve gained somewhere around 20 pounds and it really hurts my self esteem. I live in a small town so another reason I don’t want to go out is because I’m afraid to see someone I know and have them say “have you seen her lately, she got fat” 

My boyfriend had an honest conversation with me today because he is very worried about me and it really opened to eyes to the big picture. Im always thinking about each thing individually as it happens, but I was able to see from his point of view everything all at once and I feel terrible that he’s been struggling silently and felt so much pressure to keep me safe and happy. He told me today that my sadness is turning to anger, not at him but in general, and although I didn’t see it until now he is right. He has been wonderful to me through all of this and has been there to take care of me when I couldn’t take care of myself, but said he can’t keep helping me until I help myself, and I agree. 

I want to get better, for me for him and for our future, but I don’t know where to start. It seems like so many things all at once. 

I’ve struggled with depression for many years on and off but I grew up in a house where therapy was a big no, and talking about mental health was basically forbidden. Even as an adult I’ve had a really hard time getting over that. Generally, I am bad at asking for help.

What's the deal with all the tone-deafness surrounding Avoidant Attachment?,1716230854.0,"^(TL;DR at the end)

I have a Fearful Avoidant Attachment Style. Finding that out about myself initially made me feel hopeful, because I had finally found a rigorous description of behaviors that even I couldn't understand. I thought I could hang around in online spaces focused on Attachment Theory, because that's what mental health acceptance is all about, right? *Overcoming shame, because it keeps you from getting better.* You can't argue with that, that's literally the entire point of mental-health-focused communities; being reminded that you're not fundamentally broken for having developed maladaptive patterns, and that you can fix them.

Well, acceptance is not what I am perceiving. More often than not, I come across people sharing their bitter opinion on Avoidants, as if that's something that has any place in a space that's meant for people who are on a *self*-healing journey. I keep seeing harshly worded takes that come across as patronizing at best, insulting at worst. We're basically being told that it's inherently wrong to even try to connect with other people, because we just can't.

It's not just mental health spaces, either, this feels like a more general social phenomenon. People will naturally show more sympathy to someone sharing a story of how they dealt with an avoidant, rather than someone sharing a story of how they unwillingly ruined a relationship because they felt inexplicably suffocated by it. And I just don't get it. Both those situations are extremely painful. You're losing a valuable connection in both cases, and that's equally painful for every human alive, avoidant or not.

There's an *excruciating* amount of guilt and shame that comes with not being able to reply to a text/call from a loved one. Focus on my wording there, I'm using the phrase ""not being able to"" because that's what it is; my aversion to intimacy makes me *unable* to do what I actually *want* to do. I *want* to keep up with friends and family, I *want* to be an open book, I *want* to be social and accommodating, I *want* to be warm and inviting. My ideal self looks like that, and I know that because I have been in healthier places before, I know I'm a people-person deep down, but there's just this barrier of pure dread standing between me and acting the way I *want* to act.

I understand that some of the people acting bitter towards avoidants once the conversation steers there could be doing so out of a place of self-defense. Maybe they're projecting their feelings caused by an emotionally-unavailable person from their life onto the whole topic. The point is, why are we (avoidants) asked to kindly deal with it and press on? Why are we supposed to just ""suck it up and go to therapy if [we're] offended""? I understand that it's the logical thing to do, to think ""oh this person is projecting, this isn't about me"" in situations like these, but how come we are expected to manage our feelings of guilt like that by default, when the whole point of mental health acceptance is to learn *how* to do exactly that?

Here's the real mind-blower (/s); avoidance is a self fulfilling prophecy. You're scared to get close to people because you ""know you're gonna hurt them"", but that just ends up making you hurt them sooner. Guilt and shame arise, perpetuating the cycle. You meet someone new, your past experiences of unwillingly having hurt people make you believe that you're an unlovable monster, and you end up encasing yourself in a brick wall once again.

How are we supposed to break this cycle if we're constantly being exposed to reassurance of just how terrible we are? It does not add up. That's not how mental health works. You're just not helping by preaching that avoidants should just ""stay alone until they fix themselves"".

I do understand that my avoidance is my problem and my problem only, and I know that nobody is responsible for my feelings. I just wish that people were a tiny bit more empathetic about it.

2. Switch to Whole Grains: Choose whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread, and oats instead of refined grains like white rice and white bread. Whole grains have more nutrients and fiber, which help regulate blood sugar, improve digestion, and keep you full longer.

3. Cut Down on Added Sugars and Processed Foods: Reduce your intake of sugary drinks, candies, and processed snacks. These often contain unhealthy fats, excess salt, and additives.

Lowering contact with parents/ family,1716227442.0,"I (31 F) have sort of come to the conclusion that it would be better for my mental health if I lower contact with my parents and family members. Long story short: I’m the youngest  child, my older brother was my grandparents favorite, my mom is mentally ill (bipolar disorder), and my dad was gone for a lot of my childhood working. Most effort has gone to my brother and I’ve just been dealing my entire life. Unlike my brother no one taught me to drive, I didn’t get high school grad pics, no college tours, no big college graduation party. I’ve either just gone without or made it up on my own. I paid for my entire college myself (via loans and scholarships) and the one time I reached out to my parents for help to paying for school, they refused to co-sign a loan with me. My then boyfriend, now husband (32M) co-signed a private loan so I could finish school. I was sexually assaulted in college and when it finally came out (due to my grandmother saying some racist shit about my now husband), the reaction from my dad was why didn’t I tell him that had happened (while yelling) and I then had to go apologize to my grandmother for yelling at her (keep in mind that during that conversation. I politely asked her to stop and physically removed myself from the situation but she followed me and it all came out before I literally ran out of the house). I was never offered therapy or anything just sort of had to pretend it didn’t happen. My parents never visit me but visit my brother who lives hours away all the time. At one point I lived an hour from them and they visited once. I moved to another state 4 years ago and they haven’t been to visit once. My brother lives further away and mom is visiting right now. I’m finally starting to do things with my appearance that make me happy and the reaction from my dad/ grandma is that they hate it (and basically remind me every time they see me) and my mom says how she’s thinking of doing whatever bc dad’s reaction to me doing it wasn’t as bad as she thought it would be. 

Other “fun” stuff:
- lost our home in middle school (have tried to talk to my parents about how that affected me and pretty much had to console my mom)
- had to take care of my grandparent while they were in the hospital (while working two jobs and going to college and caring for their animals. My parents were just in an adjacent  state and realistically could have been there)
- constantly being my mom’s emotional support and knowing WAY too much about my parents’ relationship since a young age
- had to hear about how they would just get rid of my pet since the animal isn’t just easy to deal with and I’m a good pet parent (my coworkers have shown more support for me dealing with my pet’s medical issues than my family)
- constant body shaming for as long as I can remember 
- being told when I got diagnosed as an adult with adhd that “I always thought you had that” by my mom (apparently my brother being diagnosed as a child was fine but wasn’t worth perusing for me). My anxiety was so bad in highschool two drs thought I had mono
- never telling my family I’m bi bc frankly I don’t want to deal with their bullshit

Anyway I decided to basically just lower contact a month ago. It took them two weeks to realize that I hadn’t been messaging them (keep in mind I checked in on them weekly and messaged them almost daily). I feel like I would be less stressed if they just never reached out. I could say fuck it and move on. Now I’m in the awkward spot where an apology won’t fix all that shit and talking to them will result in me consoling them and telling them it’s all right (I know this bc that’s what has happened in the past). It took me YEARS to accept that while my family isn’t outright malicious, they should have/ could have done better. Anytime I’ve talked to my brother about this stuff, he makes excuses or tries to tell me he had it worse (this isn’t a pissing contest and I’ve never tried to make it one) 

Honestly I’d be less distressed if they just stopped talking to me (and yes I’m in therapy). I have a lovely found family with my friends and hubby and my pet. Idk what I’m asking for exactly.

I'm can only love or hate something and it's exhausting ,1716227340.0,"I feel like I could list things that I love or I hate, but I couldn't tell you what I liked or disliked. I'm neutral to things like things I don't know or understand. Even with family, I just don't feel I love them like I maybe should, I just feel nothing towards them.
It's exhausting coz I can also very quickly go from loving something to absolutely hating it, and for no particular reason either.

It's just so tiring for everything to be nothing or an extreme positive or negative, and I feel bad for my family who haven't done anything wrong but I just can't honestly say I love them.
This goes into friendships too, my last friendship group was the best and I really enjoyed being around them until I realised that they were ignoring me more and leaving me out, and after that I just hated them and avoided them.
The same if a family member hurts my feelings or angers me, I just never want to see or talk to them again, I just avoid them until I've had some time but I never seem to get over it and properly move on, the incident always lingers in my mind.

I'm always so convinced when I find something I love that I'll never hate it, not this time, not again, and yet I always seem to end up hating it after a while anyway.

My high school counselor let me keep cutting myself and I ended up in a mental hospital.,1716225880.0,"This is my first and possibly only post, but I wanted to share my story. I have a handful of mental health issues that in high school I didn’t know how to cope with. One day, my friends caught me with a binder spine that I had ripped out and bent to the point it snapped in half. I used the sharp edges to cut myself. It wasn’t very deep given the tool I was using, but it was self harm nonetheless. I had a history of self harm since middle school so this wasn’t new for me.

When my friends saw what I was doing, they all but dragged me to the school counselor. I didn’t want to, but I told the woman, let’s call her Ms. Smith, that I was cutting myself and pulled the broken binder spine from my purse to show her what I was using. I didn’t want her to take it away since it was my (very unhealthy) comfort. Deep down though I wanted help. I knew what I was doing was bad and I needed to stop. To my shock and horror, she didn’t care. She just talked to me and asked why I did it. I gave a basic answer: I wanted to.

The reality I didn’t feel comfortable sharing with this stranger was that I needed the release. Seeing the blood coming out of me when I cut myself with anything felt like all the emotions I couldn’t get out was released. I didn’t think it would make sense to anyone so I never told them. Thinking back on it, I’m glad I never told Ms. Smith.

After talking for a few minutes, in which I also told her I was having a lot of suicidal thoughts, she asked me if I was ready to go back to class. It felt like a punch to the gut. She didn’t care that I was hurting myself. She didn’t try to take away the tool I was using. She just wanted me to focus on school and leave her alone. This made me loose so much faith in people who were supposed to be there to help. I felt like I couldn’t trust anyone to help me. I didn’t want to stop, but I also really did if that makes sense.

I told Ms. Smith that no, I wasn’t ready. I wanted to kill myself. I wanted to die. Why didn’t she care? Did no one care about me? But all I told her was no. She called my parents, but only my dad was available to pick me up. She gave dad the run down of what we talked about before we went home. Dad wanted to stay there and talk to me about it all, but I was hurting too much from how Ms. Smith handled it all to really open up to dad. Instead, I just got angry with him and my mom and at the world. I was angry with my friends for making me go there.

Eventually dad took me home. He told mom about it all and she practically shut down. I later learned she had called her therapist and asked what the heck she should do. Her therapist told her to keep an eye on me and if I brought up suicide again to take me to the hospital. Instead of comforting me and trying to help, my parents made me do manual labor. They said if I was going to skip school I was going to work instead. At the time, they were hurting so much that their daughter was in such a dark place that they handled it all in a way they shouldn’t have and I know now how much they regret that.

I was forced to dig a fire pit in the back yard and I hated every second of that. We were already going to have one there and it became my job to dig it when I was feeling suicidal. After school got out, my then boyfriend called to ask where I had gone. He was a crap boyfriend. While I was on the phone with him, I had also moved on to helping mom sort out the costumes in the basement. I was ignoring mom but talking loudly enough for her to hear. I told my then boyfriend all about how my parents didn’t care and that they just wanted me to do work when I was feeling suicidal. That almost broke mom. She and dad were doing the best they knew how and lo and behold I mentioned suicide again. Mom told dad to get ready, they were taking me to the hospital. My then boyfriend told me to lock myself in the bathroom so they couldn’t take me. I did for a bit but eventually came out. I had given up. We all got in the car and dad told mom to sit in the back seat with me so I couldn’t try to hurt him. It’s been years since then and that memory still breaks my heart. I was angry with them but I would never hurt my parents.

That day was the first time I had ever seen my dad cry. He isn’t a very emotional person, so seeing that hurt worse than everything else I was feeling.

We drove to the ER and they checked me in. Eventually I was taken back to a room where a nurse asked me all sorts of questions about what was going on. I wish I had lied. I wish I had told the nurse I was fine. But no, I made the stupid mistake of being honest. He told my parents I needed to go to a “behavioral institution” which let’s be real, is a mental hospital. The only one with available beds was three hours away. Mom looked the place up to see what it was like and voiced her concerns on how terrible the reviews were. Years later when we talked about it she told me she wished she had put her foot down and told them no. Their daughter wasn’t going to go there.

The hospital staff brought me paper scrubs to change into. Paper. Freaking. Scrubs. All I could keep on was my underwear. No bra, just underwear and paper scrubs. It was humiliating on top of everything else. I had to be driven to the mental hospital in the back of a police car with my parents following behind.

The officer was as nice as can be, asking what I wanted to listen to on the radio and if the temperature was okay. I told him all of it was fine and spent the whole three hours silently sobbing. When we finally arrived at the nut house it was late at night. All the other crazy people were asleep. A nurse offered me a sad ham sandwich and a diet ginger ale for dinner. To this day I cannot drink that because of the association with that place.

My parents gave me a tearful goodbye and told me they love me. I couldn’t say it back. I couldn’t speak at all. I was taken to a room with another girl already asleep, and told we would all be woken up at 6am to have our vitals checked. I’m not a morning person at all. More like a perpetually exhausted chicken. That news was just another thing on top of everything else that made the day the worst of my life.

I could barely sleep that night. There was a security camera in the room watching me and my roommate. I still have a fear of security cameras due to that red cyclops eye always monitoring me. There was a small bathroom in the room with a thin sheet for “privacy.” The camera was aimed in a way they could see our silhouette as we showered and used the toilet. I understand the need for keeping an eye on all of us since we were all there for mental issues, but it was still awful to suffer through.

This mental hospital had a thing called “drop anchor.” That meant the residents did something to get in trouble, and the punishment was everyone had to stay in their rooms unless it was time to eat or have group therapy. It was both torture and a blessing. When I arrived, they were a few days into drop anchor, so I stayed in my room like the rest. A nurse told me since I wasn’t in trouble I didn’t have to do that, but it was better than being alone in the mentally messed up adolescence wing lobby.

I made it a few days without having to interact with more than my roommate before drop anchor was lifted. We were forced to go to the gym and participate in sports and meditation, group therapy, and meeting with a doctor. None of us were allowed to sit too close to each other or, Heaven forbid, touch. No hugs or even a pat on the shoulder. We couldn’t even have our legs up while sitting in a chair. There were so many rules that it was a prison more than a place to help people who were in such a dark place we needed to escape from the world to get help.

We even had scheduled bathroom breaks there. I couldn’t make it to the bathroom break one day and begged the nurse to unlock my door so I could go but was told to wait. It got to the point where it was painful to hold it in. I was sweating and almost in tears trying to hold it in. Finally, twenty minutes before the bathroom break, they gave up trying to keep me from peeing and let me go to my room. I didn’t make it and peed just a foot away from the bathroom. The security camera saw it all and whoever was monitoring the footage did too. Humiliation stacked on to misery. I had to change and clean myself off as best I could with toilet paper since our shower supplies was locked away. When I came out, the nurses acted like I should be beyond thankful they let me go early. I could have strangled them.

We were given visitors day and my parents came to see me. I was still angry with them for sending me there. They both looked so relieved to see me and heartbroken that I was at a mental hospital. I remember shouting at them that they locked me in there and storming away. That’s a regret I still haven’t forgiven myself for, though I am trying.

I lied my way out. Each day we were told to fill out a sheet of how we were feeling mentally and if we had any thoughts of hurting ourselves or others. No, of course I don’t want to hurt myself. I’m perfectly fine. All cured. A week locked away made my mental issues so much better. If I had been honest I would have been kept there longer, so I lied my butt off to be free.

There was a very small library there. I borrowed a book about Hellen Keller that I remembered reading in middle school. That book kept me sane. I read it as often as I could, escaping into the story. One day, a nurse came to the lobby to tell us something or other, and told me to put my book away. I kept it open but set it down to keep my place. She yelled at me and told me they would take it away if I didn’t put it away fully. That book was my comfort, and this woman wanted to take it away from me. I saw red. I wanted to scream and shout and throw the book at her. But I knew I had to escape, so I did what she said.

It may sound dramatic, saying I wanted to escape. If you had been there you would understand. That place was terrible for everyone. It was a place to lock kids up instead of trying to help us heal. It was Hell.

Mom told the whole family that I was in there and the letters poured in. There was so much love and support that I was overwhelmed. I kept every single thing they wrote me. Even extended family that I wasn’t very close to wrote to me. When I’m in a dark place I go back and read those letters and it reminds me of the good in my life.

The whole experience, from the moment I was dragged to the guidance counselor to the moment I was checked out of the nut house, was awful. For years I couldn’t even talk about it. I couldn’t say the name of the place without having a severe anxiety attack. It took a lot of therapy to finally talk about it. When I passed police officers on the road anxiety set in, even though the officer who drove me there was kind. Security cameras still freak me out. So much of my life was affected because of that week.

When I finally came home I felt like a stranger. One week away in a mental hospital and I was the family outcast. Everything was different and so hard. I should have been thrilled to be home, but it was almost as bad as the nut house.

I’ve forgiven my parents for taking me there, though. I know they were doing the best they knew how to do, and they’ve sincerely apologized for it all. They felt awful for it too.

Hypochondria Is Taking Over My Life ,1716226348.0,"Every day my daughter comes home from school and I sneakily ask her whether her friends were there today. I hide my true desire to know if anyone is unwell through questions that - although I am interested in the answer for - I know are a front for my own hypochondria.

It started as a fear of being physically sick, which I got therapy for and have kind of learned to deal with (I no longer shake in a corner and stop eating for days). But now it seems I’m just waiting for the next time someone is ill. Someone mentions they were unwell a last week? I become a nervous wreck they might still be able to give it to me. My partner tells me she’s feeling under the weather? I think the worst will happen. Latest is my daughter’s teacher wasn’t in school today, so I’ve got it in my head that it might be something my daughter will catch.

I lose sleep over this. Why do these things always happen at night? It comes as a complete surprise, catching everyone off guard. Or if it’s a cold/flu it seems to last forever and I wonder when things will get back to normal.

I know these are semi-natural feelings. No-one wants to be unwell, no-one wants the people they care about to be unwell. But I live my life thinking about it. Literally every day, without fail. I spoke with my therapist but he seemed to want to steer the conversation away (maybe it’s not something he knows as much about?)

He hasn’t been taking care of himself. Showering, hygiene, sleep. It’s heartbreaking because he used to go to the gym every day. He’s gained 150lb after his friend passed. It’s gotten in the way of our intimate life. 

He’s been eating himself until it hurts, taking trips away from our house to buy extreme amounts of food in the middle of the night and down it before I can find out.

He’s been going to work late. He’s shown up at or past 10am to a job that should start at 9. He promises each day he will get there on time, but fails to do so. He said he can’t sleep and just can’t get out of bed.

He started going to therapy about a month ago but I haven’t seen any improvements. We’ve broken up and gotten back together multiple times.

Dr stopped my Rexulti cold turkey and I think it’s fucking me,1716224909.0,"im not asking for advice or anything, I just want to say it and maybe get some reassurance it’ll be alright 

My dr and I discussed regarding how many medications I was taking, as another medical professional had commented on the number I was on just for my mental health. We decided i could potentially benefit from getting off of a few, little by little of course. So it’s been a week since I’ve stopped, and it’s supposed to stay in my system for about 15 days, so this could possibly just be withdraw symptoms. I feel slightly delusional at times, having mild hallucinations, my head hurts terribly. I can’t think clearly, I stumble on my words a little and I have an even worse memory. It worries me because I was taking it to help with depression, but I know it’s also used for schizophrenia. And suddenly when I stopped I’m having symptoms of it. It could just be withdrawal from going cold turkey (the price of medication went up and I couldn’t afford it even at a lower dose)

My insecurities are destroying my relationship. I need to learn to love myself.,1716224385.0,"I am not going into detail of what has been happening in my relationship. I am a guy dating a girl and my insecurities have been manifesting in a way that is toxic. I am constantly afraid I am not good enough for my girlfriend, creating a self fulfilling prophecy. I seek validation from her to comfort myself in a sense, give me a temporary feeling of everything being okay when its not. 

I really do love her and I am able to see through mistakes I have made that my lack in confidence in myself is poisoning our relationship. This is my first relationship, I am 22 and we have been together for a year. This is not her first, she has been in quite a few relationships. She understood going in that my lack of experience would be challenging and she has been very lenient on me. But I keep letting my insecurities push the limit.

  
I hate myself for my mindset. Growing up, and even now, my parents always expressed disappointment in me no matter how well I achieved. I was at the top of my class and they still were disappointed in me and found ways to compare me with other people that are doing better. Even going as far as saying they wish they could replace me with a better child. I believe I have identified that as the root of my problem. I don't want this to define me. Why am I letting my strict parents dictate how I feel about myself. I have set goals I would like to complete in a year, hoping that this will increase my self esteem and have been working on them. But it will take time to change myself. I know that my past experiences does not excuse me from my behaviours now, I am 22 and should know better, why is this still affecting me?

  
My question is, how else can I begin to learn to love myself. I don't want her to carry the brunt of keeping my ego boosted as well as working on herself. It is absolutely not fair and I'm disgusted at myself. I am ashamed that I have caused my issues to bleed into her life. We have been friends for years, and she obviously cares about me deeply and sees something in me. Until this started coming up in the past couple of months, we had lots of wonderful moments, we were excited for our future together. I have put that all in jeopardy. I don't deserve the chances she gives me, but I know I have the capability to change. Even though it doesn't sound like it from what I have said, I have grown considerably in the past 2 years in how I see myself. It is definitely something I can do. 

I have sought out counselling but it is still the early days and obviously there hasn't been a lot of time to sort myself out. I am considering proposing a break, not to see other people, absolutely not, but to focus on my studies and self love. I have heard that breaks are normally precursors to a break up. I don't want an ex or a relationship with anyone else. I wholeheartedly want to treat her right and make myself a proper man who is confident in himself and free of negative self-talk.

It may be too late to salvage this. I don’t even deserve her for being so unfair and for hurting her with my jealousy towards her exes. The damage may have been irreparably done. But I am willing to do anything it takes to try and make it up to her, prove that I can let go of my jealousy and negative mindset and insecurities. The way I am is not good enough, not for me, not for her, not for our relationship.

How can I better help/support my Wife? ,1716224330.0,"Hello, this is my first time posting. 

My wife struggles with extreme depression, anxiety, and body dismorphia/self-esteem issues. 
Throughout the years I've felt like I've supported her fairly well, I would help more around the house, ask her how she's feeling, acknowledged and support her feelings, massage her nightly, express my love for her, and re-enforce how beautiful she is, support her dreams/goals and much more.

I'm tired of not knowing whether I have ADHD and I have no means to know if I do.,1716220987.0,"Before anything else, I do not have access to a therapist right now, not a good one at the very least. I do struggle with CPTSD from CSA and Childhood Abuse, which makes all this a bit harder to diagnose ADHD from, but I'd like to try and describe myself anyhow.

This problem goes way way back. I've always had difficulty concentrating. Even as a child, I'd often be lost in my own world, run off in the middle of classes that were being taught and fail to understand why it was a problem. I was said to be smarter and creative of the bunch, told I was gifted but not putting it to use, which is also reflected in my IQ which is 135. I was bullied because I was very emotional, and I was always looked at weirdly for how I acted. I never understood social cues or etiquette and used to act in manners that others would consider out of place.

My teachers were often frustrated with my lack of concentration in classes as I'd be doodling all the time, or just chatting with whoever was sitting next to me all the time, and being inattentive even when being talked to directly. Sometimes, I found myself focusing really hard at people's words to understand them, or rewinding movies again and again because I didn't pay attention to the dialogue but instead on some random fucking detail irrelevant to everything.

Eventually, I got into various forms of art and still tend to get into hobbies but leave them after a short while. I had a short phase of learning to draw as a child and I got good but never too good as I'd leave it as soon as I was getting serious about it. I got into poetry and story writing and that's how I got good at Creative Writing but failed at not hitting my impatience with it too. 

Even now, sometimes I just can't concentrate because I'm too in my head, overthinking way too much or just hyperfixating on something for weeks. I have to listen to music to shut my thoughts, and I keep singing or humming all the time even when it's inappropriate to without even noticing I started doing so. Music helps but sometimes even that's not good enough to shut the thoughts down most of the time as I'm always distracted at something other than the subject matter.

I'm 18 now, and realising more and more that my life's a mess. I got into therapy but my therapist ended up as incompetent and my parents who barely agreed to it gave up on it pretty quickly. 

In the past few years, life's got harder. My room's always a mess, and I get too depressed to shower for many days, and while PTSD affects me in ways that completely ruin my life too, I do begin to wonder whether this unwillingness to live life, work hard and this inability to be engrossed in something might be a result of ADHD.

I'll answer any questions that might be asked of me and I just want people to be kind, whether they think I have ADHD or not because this post has been in my drafts for a while too (yeah, I even procrastinate posting shit on the internet lmao).

Bodily reaction to stress?? Help,1716219013.0,"Hi, I would really appreciate it if somebody would take the time to read this. I 17F have ADHD, am due to take an autism assessment soon and have struggled with my mental health since I was 10-11 years old. School (obvs) has always been a huge stress factor for me - to the point that I've stayed off school for months even before covid.

For the past year or so my mental health has gotten a lot better and I just have bad episodes but right now I don't feel like I'm doing too bad. There is quite a lot of pressure in school, bad things happening in my private life and I'm pretty sleep deprived but in general it FEELS managable...

...at least it did. For the past few days I've gone into these horrible panic attacks whenever my homework/study material feels difficult in the slightest. I'd just burst out crying, hyperventilate to the point of almost passing out and just not be able to snap out of it for literal hours at a time until I give up and decide not to do anything. It's so exhausting and NOTHING helps. Taking a break doesn't stop it and none of my usual skills help - not even unhealthy coping mechanisms. Hell, I almost broke my arm trying to reduce the stress in any way possible but it just didn't stop.

It, quite frankly, feels debilitating. My head hurts, I'm dizzy and my entire body is just worn out by now. I physically cannot finish my work even though I KNOW I could. I can't even get myself to work out bc my body reacts the same way.

I just don't know what to do. I don't want to stay off school again because there's quite a few exams coming up that I don't want to miss and I'll be done with school soon anyway, no point chickening out now. But I really just can't achieve what I need to if it stays like this.

Is there something I can do? Ask to stay home, get the material sent to me and try to come for the exams? Then again, being present in school isn't the problem.

Any advice on how I can help myself?,1716217615.0,"Hi Reddit, this is a long shot in the dark. I just want to get some stuff off my chest, and also ask for advice on what to do next.

So a little back story. I grew up with an abusive super traditional Asian dad who would punish me for any however minor imperfections. He would frequently beat me until I black out. Or he would lock me out of the flat for hours at night, saying that I was useless and nobody wants me. He would control what I wear, who I make friends with, and when he is pissed, he would berate me, or straight up pretend I didn’t exist. Thank to that I was suicidal since I was 7. And started SHing since 8. 

Fast forward to now, I have been living on my own, and things had been better. Then I dated a guy for two years. Things moved fast and I moved in with him (I didn’t really want to but he pressured me) very early on. Then it turns out he was an alcoholic with anger issues, who couldn’t hold down a job. He did almost everything my dad did to me. I finally left several months ago, but now my mental health is at its lowest point ever, and being with my ex has brought back and amplified a lot of my past trauma.

I’d have panic attacks several times a week, meltdowns, SHing again, and binge eat. And it’s getting worse. I have bouts of strong anger that are getting harder to control (just to clarify I never hurt anyone; mostly it’s screaming or crying that I couldn’t suppress). I have these episodes where I feel like my body is not my own. It’s affecting my work and my social relationships. For example, a concerned coworker found me mumbling to myself and turning the water tap on and off in the bathroom. Another day I was walking on the street and noticed a woman staring at me horrified, and I realised I was speaking loudly about how everyone is a liar, I hate people etc. Both times I had no idea I was doing it, or what started it. I’m scared, this is not me. I have seen my GP and she reckoned I have cPTSD, depression and anxiety, but we’ve sent referrals to all psychiatrist/psychologist in my city now and nobody would see me because ‘my case is too complicated’. I still keep seeing her about once a month but it hasn’t been helpful.

I am coming close to the end of my rope. I guess my questions are, what is wrong with me? What is happening to me? How can I help myself? I really just want it to all stop.

TL:DR Abusive childhood and relationship has tanked my mental health. Symptoms are getting worse, but I can’t get professional help. What do I do?

How to stop feeling this way ,1716178818.0,"As a man I'm a surrounded by hate, I would argue justifiably, because of things other men have done. The simple fact that I as a man am seen as a threat to others weighs heavily on my conscience and pushes my self esteem lower and lower. This is partly due to being acutely aware of the potential harm I can cause others by being physically stronger than others. I try to limit contact with others to minimise this effect but it often spirals into self hatred because I am so aware of the potential harm I can cause. I have found myself trapped in a self disgust and hatred bubble that I cannot seem to shake.

 I am pessimistic because of this awareness. The more I see people posting horrific shit men have done, the more I see what I could become. This disgusts me. I don't hate others because I don't know them. I hate myself for knowing I may have it in me to harm. I do not self harm because it in my eyes is pointless but if I could self harm my brain without death I would. I haven't enjoyed being a man for a very long time due to this understanding and have no desire to become a woman. 

I have been numb for too long. I barely feel anymore and not many things excite me. I tend to fail things because I care not about the result. I think about death a lot because with one less man in the world it may be safer for others. However I won't do it because I want to try and shake these feelings and emotions I want to fight for my life. I want to feel again.
 
I want to be truly loved. Whether or not I deserve it is a different thing all together. As a man I hate being a man. I suppose that makes sense.

How do I deal with my anxiety?,1716164263.0,"I get these random anxiety episodes where I struggle to breathe or be productive. 

I genuinely get scared of going outside (or downstairs) and things like certain topics or deadlines have me reeling. It feels like a weight is placed on my chest and I struggle to breathe. I feel guilty and ashamed because of how incapable I am of handling this. It always catches me off guard and I can only see the triggers or build up in retrospect.


I am seeing a therapist and we're slowly working through things but right now we're focusing on other topics. My parents are understanding and supportive but I keep feeling like I am disappointing them since I only let them know at the last minute or not at all.


My first reaction to my anxiety in general, especially these episodes, is denial. I try to set goals and talk to people but it's like my mind has started to gaslight me into thinking everything is okay until it's too late. My psychiatrist has ghosted me and the app I use for insurance is absolute crap (it only loads 1/5 of the time). The few times I've been able to force myself to pick up a phone to call a different office for help, I've been turned away. 


Right now I'm in bed again. My dad and I decided I need to find a summer job but I'm finding it very hard to apply. Actually, I haven't been able to apply at all because once again I'm in this position I put myself in. I try to console myself with the fact that it's very overwhelming since I only got my SSN a month or two ago. I have no idea how to tackle this new chapter in my life.

Advice needed for someone lost like me,1716162947.0,"I'm not sure how to start this post off but I want to get right into what I want to say. Ever since I was younger (like elementary years) I would have these odd thoughts that I would find either really bad or that completely go against what I truly believe. Around 3rd-ish Grade I told my sister about them, and she told me to tell my mother about them and I did but I don't believe I elaborated on them anymore than them being ""bad thoughts."" My mother chalked them up to the fact that I played games that weren't suitable for me (I'm talking COD and things like that). But life went on and I just accepted that I had them. Up until now when I would have one, I would try to push it away. (In specific I would usually look away and shake my head while saying it was a bad thought for every one that I had or something similar). In 7th - 8th I unfortunately discovered smut and at first it didn't affect me until it became an actual addiction later on. At the beginning of 9th I would hop on self-improvement and trying to beat your PMO addiction. It was mostly an up and down cycle where I would be happy that I was ding good until I failed and got upset then tried again. One day I managed to make it to 30 days and I felt great, until I failed again on my birthday. I felt hopeless then, and I just went on again. I eventually forgot about that and just move on for a bit. However, there came a time where I guess was acting particularly douchey and my sister would be pissed with me. When this started I would ask myself over and over if I was ""truly evil."" It was this same line over and over until one day I was in the shower and while I was in there I started asking myself if I was crazy or going crazy. It came out of nowhere and eventually I started feeling shaky and panicked. It felt as though all the blood in my body had been drained. I recognized the feeling as I swore, I had felt it before. I felt like was fading away. I got it to stop by gripping myself tightly under the water and assuring myself that I was fine. When I went to bed and woke up the next day. this massive wave of depression hit me. It was the worst I had felt in my entire life, and I only found solace in a few things. It went on for a few days until it felt as though I could cry any minute, and I did. Also, during this period everything felt off, my world didn't seem the same as it was before my incident in the shower. But, eventually it felt more and more ""normal."" Part of me was thinking that I was getting better until everything felt ""weird"" again. After about a week, I had left that depressive state but something new would come. Thoughts about me taking my life or someone else doing so would appear but this clashed with the fact that I don't want to die. And these thoughts would be constantly there. One day, they started to disappear and I was happy they were, however, since around the beginning of 9th, I would sometimes go through these periods of time where I would go on the internet and look up mental health conditions. I always knew I was a little different compared to those around me and my conclusion would always bounce around from ADHD to Autism or anything else I would think of. This time, I realized my feelings went along with nicely to OCD or something closely related. And thoughts about this would plague me too. I could be enjoying a good show or video and as soon as I looked up, I would think, ""I'm going to live like this forever there is no cure, this is life now"", and similar things. This would go and attack me for a few days until it got a little better, especially with me discovering breathwork. However, I am still afflicted with my problem with PMO, and I feel like now, I question every little thought that goes in my head, including the ""bad"" ones. My mind can't and I feel like every thought is like its own little fractal that goes on forever. Some days are good, and some are bad but every day it's like something new comes to clutter my mind even more. What's even weirder is how volatile my feelings are. Some days I feel fantastic while another feel completely doomed and even feel scared for my life.

How do I help someone mental when u need help yourself?,1716160810.0,"

First of all maybe this is written awfully but I just don't know from where to start and I need desprete help. I (16F) my boyfriend (16M) we knew each other since 8th grade but we started getting close back in March 2024. him and I have been dating for good two months and let me tell you the amount of shit we had to go through to just date were uncountable from fighting my crazy Psycho ex who SA me which I kind of didn't move on from plus his mum finding out Abt our relationship and threatened to call my mum also she tried to manipulate him into thinking I am playing him and I am dating two guys at the same time. It was horrible, really bad era that I would never wish to go back to. And Bec of the trauma my late ex caused my mental state probably isn't the best plus I got a lot of issues like I get really stressfed, anxious and worried over any minor inconvenience, I need attention and love 24/7 and lastly I get really moody at times but I still try to be my best for him...we are really great couple and I know it's pretty early to judge but the things we went through were not easy nor little, at least that's what 16 years old think. Through my relationship with him most of the time I am the needy and clingy one in the relationship but today It was the way around which scared tf out of me right away. Today morning he texted me and said that he might not be responsive Bec he got issues at home, I knew that a long time ago, his family issues are real bad. His parents fight all the time, they never were a great match. Moving on, him and I talked a lil bit through the day, we were texting in TikTok, we were laughing, happy and yk everything is fine (kind of) then he randomly went like ""can I ask u favour?"" I didn't reply right away cause I didn't notice the notification (I didn't take long like a min or less) then he send another text saying ""sweetheart are u there?"" I was confused asf, I texted back and asked him what is it. He said ""please never leave me"" that stabbed me and anxiety hit me, what's going on? What is happening??? I asked him if he is okay and he said he is fine. I didn't believe it so I kept asking more questions and that's when he gave in and told me everything. He said his father hasn't been constantly at home and he hasn't been home the last 4 days, however, today early morning at 4 am to be exact he tried to sneak in to take some of his stuff. His mother woke up and his parents talked for a lil bit then for some reason she opened his backpack and fucking saw protections and sex related medicines. Her only response to that was screaming her oldest son name which is my bf, he woke up went running to her and saw both of his parents standing in their bedroom. The moment his father saw him he closed the door but he could still hear them fight. His father admitted that he got married secretly to a second wife, he also have intentions to have kids with that woman and his only excuse for cheating and abounding his three children is that he didn't feel loved through this marriage. He kept telling her Abt how hot and perfect his new wife is which brought my boyfriend's mother into tears, he also told her his grown ass used to watch porn Bec she left him deprived. I was honestly left speechless when my boyfriend told me Abt the whole thing, he will have to take care of his younger siblings (they are twins 10f and 10m) and also his mum. His father absence means that he have to fill that rule at fucking sixteen. Fucking sixteen, he didn't even make it to college yet. I am scared for him, I don't know what to do. I comforted and assured him that I will take care of him but i can't help but cry for him, I am really weak and fragile..I want to get stronger mentally to take care of him but I don't know how. Please someone help me and give me tips. I need that. Oh and put in mind my bf is suicidal, before him and I got close he actually planned the whole thing however things changed when we became close then eventually started dating. He said I saved him. I want to stay with this dude through everything but I also need help to deal with my own emotions first. It's too much to take in and for some reason I feel like it's effecting me more than him.

"Male friend lashing out following trauma. TW: SA, suicide ",1716160724.0,"Trigger warning: sexual assault, suicide 

I (29f) have been friends with Friend A (40m) and Friend B (39m) for six years after meeting in the office we all work in. About a year and a half ago, A started experiencing severe insomnia and depression. B and I recommended A to seek professional help, but A rejected this for many months until December 2023 when B called emergency services following what we considered to be credible suicidal threats. Since then, A has started therapy and is taking medication for the insomnia and depression. B and I have continued to try to be present friends, listening and offering encouragement. End of March 2023, A confided in us that he was raped as a teenager. I won’t pretend that we landed the response perfectly, but I have apologized for things that I did wrong (not discussing the assault and aftermath) out of fear of making our friendship all about the assault. We have reiterated to him that it was not his fault and that he do not see him any differently. 

I believe the situation is toxic. I understand that A is hurting and I can only imagine the burden he’s carrying. As time passes, our relationship with him gets worse as he lashes out saying that we are only pretend friends and is completely isolated. He’ll make passive aggressive comments to us at work and send us expletive ridden texts telling us that we aren’t doing enough, accusing us of abandoning him. We have not disappeared. We’ve all hung outside of work together since this happened. We still talk on a day to day basis, even outside of work. When he expresses feelings of abandonment, we tell him we’re trying to be there for him and ask how we can do better, and he just gets upset. He reminds us not infrequently, almost angrily, that the only reason he’s still alive is because B made that call.

I’m a single mom to two small kids (2 and 4). I’m doing my best to be there but I just cannot offer on call support. In addition to this, there was an indication in about September that A has romantic feelings for me. This all makes my partner very uncomfortable, as he doesn’t want me so emotionally invested in another man but also doesn’t want A to kill himself. 

Last night A texted me expressing his feelings of isolation, and within ten minutes as I sat trying to provide a delicate response, he sends an expletive filled mini rant to the group chat with A, B, and me about how he’s done and with an emoji with a gun to his head. I told him I would call him once I put my son to bed, and I did. We spent about an hour on the phone, where he cursed at me and continued to tell I vanished. I told him I wasn’t going to say anything about how I responded in the past because I didn’t want to make it sound like I was making excuses, but that I was sorry for not being what he needed before and I was here. He just got angry and laughed. He demanded an explanation for my approach in different situations, and when I provided them, he just called them BS. He gave me an ultimatum, saying I needed to show I could be a real friend or he would “move on”. I told him he needed to tell me exactly what he had in mind, and eventually he said I needed to be more intentional in asking about his emotional wellbeing and not keeping him at arms length. I told him I could do that. 

It turns out that after we hung up, he had the same conversation with B but it ended badly. I woke up to a string of nonsensical texts to the group thread, the last of which said “I'm about to have done dipshits that think the know a damn thing promisr me it's my fault. In reality I love you and want your babies”. I find this to be grossly inappropriate and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Such things are disrespectful to both me and my partner. I told him that what he said was not okay, and he responded he was “going to hide in shame” and talking about how much he needs us. 

I’ve been yelled at, laughed at, cussed at. Anything I’ve done for this person has been equated to nothing despite the significant turmoil it’s caused in my life. So far I have taken all of this on the chin without blinking but I think a line has been crossed here. This feels like a scheme of self sabotage that I’m caught in the middle of. Trying to establish and maintain healthy boundaries is something I’ve been focusing on since my divorce. How can I do that here? I have to sit next to this person at work and I am not comfortable in this relationship where it stands. I’m at a point where I feel an intense need to protect myself and my relationship — my partner is not going to be okay with this. Am I actually being a bad friend and not realizing it?

I've never really tempted to kill myself because i thought of my parents, and i angrily told my self ""i won't die only to piss of the ones who doesn't like me as much as i can by staying alive"" (i think a long school harrassment was the foundation of my mental state)

Never looked at it). Failer college after having 3 retaken years to do 1 assignment... and never starting it. Can't focus on a YouTube video unless it's sped up.

I've always read up on the self improvement stuff, had delusionally high targets and ideals and thought "" yeah I'll fix myself by X age"" and became increasingly convinced I have no agency as I slept through the years.

But I'm starting to wonder if that actually is my choice? The relationship avoidance is out of hands as I'm subhuman genetically (ED, small penis) so I never try and turned down the few women who find me funny. Extremely pessimistic about dating modern women as well for various reasons that are hopefully wrong.

But the rest? I'm so content day to day just looking at screens, day dreaming and masterbating. No relationship I could ever get would compare to what I can imagine in my head. If I became a billionaire today I would still spend all day in bed ( I don't know if thats my choice, I love it but I have low testosterone, energy and sleep). I have a passion for cooking but never cook just imagine great meals ""yh it'd be so great to cook that one day I'm excited life is great"". I don't work either I just daydream over material riches.

I know it's terrible for me ( and this gets excused way to much on reddit) but I'm too comfortable being alone, I never have a desire for friends just intimacy and think I would ace one of those prison isolation punishments. I'm also incredibly scared of death and aging because of the loss life's pleasures.... but then never pursue them. I don't cook, I don't pursue intimacy ( for reasons above) don't travel I don't do hobbies I want to do. I'm very irritable and cry over life once in a while but day to day very at peace.

Is this just an incredibly low level of self control or do I actively want to rot? And by implication a simple switch in desire would fix me.

I wouldn't bother with self help steps as there's no chance I'll follow it. I'm interested in the psychology mainly.

\[Disclaimer ; Going to be a bit long and cringe\]

Hi guys,

I am in a weird spot right now. I'm going to give you a summation of the events that led me here

1st GF left me and came back to me (5x) -> We finally break-up -> Met my 2nd girlfriend -> It was fantastic -> 5 months in I discovered that she lied about 95% of everything -> I forgave her -> We lasted for 11 more months -> Over the course of those 11 months, I was already deteriorating but I stayed because I loved her -> She said that she is also unhappy and unfulfilled because of our relationship \[LDR\] -> I break up with her because she deserves someone better, even though I loved her very much -> Met this girl --> Liked her for 2 months --> Formally met each other when our friend group drank together --> Found out she had a boyfriend --> Talked as friends --> They break up --> We hit it off --> Do couple things --> Ex comes back --> Ghosts me --> Sleeps with him --> I ask her if she's going to ghost me again and go back with him --> She says no-> Christmas break--> Ghosts me --> Went through a phase -> Met another girl--> We hit it off--> I found out she then slept with another guy hours before meeting up with me -> I left --> Stalked my ""classmate's"" Instagram --> they are now officially together \[She and her ex\] --> Try to cut her off --> We became blockmates --> We became groupmates --> Now..I am checkmate -> I try to ignore her, can't as we're always put closer for some reason -> I try to work it out with her -> She does something fckd up \[Rinse and repeat x infinity\] -> I bit the bullet and reached out again --> I drove her--> We talked -> Asked her if she wants us to just keep ignoring each other --> She says no -> We talk for a couple of days --> She ghosts me again --> I see her everyday as not only is she in my class, but we're in the same group -> Now, I am here.

So.. what is ""here"". Well, I realized that I was being toxic to myself. I have some serious issues.  I hated being myself. I hated being alone. I can't open up to my friends and family as I didn't want to burden them, I have longed believed that I should only open to my ""partner"" about my issues, as I know I am not a burden to her. Ever since I was a fat sixteen-year-old kid, I have always wanted to experience having a girlfriend. Someone for myself. Someone to go on dates with, Someone to take cute pictures with, Someone to hold hands with while walking around/home, someone to cuddle with, Someone to go home to and just cuddle after a long day of school, Someone to take care of me when I'm sick, Someone to rest my head unto when I am tired. Those kinds of things. And though I have had 2 exes, both long-term \[1st =13 months & 2nd =16 Months\], So even though I have had girlfriends, I never really got to experience having a girlfriend. I was in a relationship with my phone as both of them were LDRs. So when I met my classmate, I thought that it was finally my chance to have something ""Easy"". To finally experience the things that I have long wanted to experience and in a sense..I did. Little did I know that.. that cute girl with glasses was about to treat me the worst. That's why I kept jumping from one girl to another. Cause I wanted someone to ""unload"" my issues to. I wanted someone to listen to me and then hug me afterward. 

  
It took me 21 years to realize that.. that was stupid.

I shouldn't depend on other people for my peace and happiness and to fix me. I needed to learn how to be self-sufficient. Yes, I am used to being alone, because of my LDRs, but I was never really okay with it. I just acted like I was because I had no choice. 

Now I am trying to be okay with it.

I ghosted everyone. I ignored all of my friends' messages and requests to go out. I want to be content while being alone. That's why the moment we get dismissed from class, I immediately leave so I can be alone. I don't want to hang out with my friends as I don't want to bring the mood down cause I can't be my normal jolly self, and I know as well that .. going out with them is just a bandaid solution. Yes, I'll be happy when I'm with them, but the moment I go home and I am alone.. Everything will rush in and break me. I don't want that. I want to rejoin them when I am fully okay.  I don't want to rush into another relationship or girl again, as I don't want a repeat of what happened. I don't want to meet another girl as I will eventually fck it up again by being too volatile and by just acting too fast and just start unloading my baggage.

It has been 2-3 weeks since I last spoke to any of my friends. I have been going out and hanging out by myself for those 2-3 weeks. And.. this is the tricky part.

I seriously have no idea where I am. When I zone out, I don't cry anymore, but I am nowhere near happy. It doesn't hurt as much anymore not because I am doing better, but because I got numb. When I'm alone, I think about my ex and my classmate all the time, but this time it doesn't immediately break me. It just makes my chest tingle a little bit. 

To be honest, I am scared. As I don't know how to let people in anymore. I don't know when to go back. A part of me is telling to me to go back now, but a part of me is saying I am not ready. The thing is I don't know when I'll be ready. Here's the thing too, when it's daytime I just distract myself by sleeping and working, and it doesn't feel as painful. Yes, I still get a little ""*When will I have that ..?""* Whenever I see couples around me, but not as painful. But when it's nighttime.. when I no longer have enough energy to work. As I lie on my bed, I realize how ""alone"" I am as I have no one to end my day with. But the fucked up thing is , during the day I have almost no interest to talk to anyone. I actually don't reply as fast as I used to. Before, I'll reply as soon as I have the chance. Now, i'll reply like 6-10 hours later, not on purpose or anything.. I just don't feel like it, I don't know why \[For real tho, can someone explain that..?\]/ I want someone to be there for me, but after the past few weeks, I am afraid that they might not have space in my life anymore. Cause to be honest with you, cringe.. but when I'm sitting alone, a part of me wishes that someone would follow me and sit beside me. I've wanted that for years now. But I am slowly smothering that dream out. 

 I know I can't stay like this. I want to be better. I want to get out. 

I just don't know how.

I want to be self-sufficient. I want to be happy and content on my own so when the time comes that I let someone inside again, when they inevitably do something fckd up, I won't hurt as much as I can manage on my own.

I want that.

But I know that I can't stay like this forever, and I don't know if I'm making progress or not. When I'm alone, things don't hurt as much, but when I see my classmate in class.. When I see her texting on her phone as the message I left a week ago remains inboxed I get pissed off. I don't know why. I know this looks like me putting all the blame on my classmate, and yes, she did do the most amount of damage in the smallest window of time.  But to be fair, it was my fault as well. As a part of me kinda wanted to use her a way of getting over my issues that I have faced since I was a kid and from my 2 exes. Again, little did I know that Instead of helping me get back on my feet, she'll deal the coupe de grace that will make me kill the past version of myself. She isn't the sole reason as to why I have broken down, but she did do enough damage to kill me 25 times over, She was just the last straw to break the camel's back..but *boy* what a straw she was.

I still want to have a girlfriend, I still want someone to be there for me when I get home from school. I still want someone to call before I go to sleep, but I know I'm afraid to risk it, cause maybe I am not ready yet and I might rush and fuck it up again, so I shut myself out until I am sure that I am ready. But i know to myself that there's a huge possibility that I'll never be ready and one day I'll be surprised that 2 years have past and I am still in the same spot and I am still *alone*.  This puts me in a loop as shutting myself down also shuts down any chance of me getting one.

See why I am so fckd?

Ugh I'm a mess, but I am not stupid enough to be delusional and think that I can do this on my own. I need some help guys.

Like any of it matters, Ill never be able to keep a job. I don’t have relationships because I cannot hold a conversation anymore and hate physical touch. I live with my parents because I’m a danger to myself and need to be watched and have my medications managed so I don’t try to OD again. I am 98 lbs because I can’t eat. I have tried everything. There is no suggestion i have not heard and gave an honest go. Even my best friends have moved on from me. My notebook is my only conversation partner. I have no community. Im invisible. I moved back to the Midwest  from the city I once loved. I used to have so many interests. Now I can’t even watch a movie because why should I care. I have no hope left. I am Bipolar, have daily panic attacks, and ADHD. There are multiple medical professionals working on me. They are unsuccessful. I tried a therapist, she said my issues are behind her abilities to help. I am sick of trying. I live in my head all the time and know it is unable to change.

I need a suggestion on how to pass the time until death naturally comes and finally lets me rest. My life has no plot, no arc, its just a carousel where each round gets more dizzying. How can I make this time go by faster between my psych appointments. I don’t need encouragement it means nothing to me.

How to cry for help,1716153452.0,"Been dealing with sh and suicidal thoughts, I don’t know how to communicate these feelings as I feel like a burden to everyone around me, and if I do kill myself, which I eventually plan on doing, not a soul would notice yet alone care.

How to deal with health anxiety?,1716152050.0,"Hi, just wanted to come on here and ask about how to best deal with health-related anxiety. I'm not sure how common this is, so I thought I'd ask here, as there are loads of people who use this app.

 Basically, when I was little (like, from when I was 4-9 ish?)  I had EXTREME anxiety, like to the point where I would have panic attacks if I was in a room by myself, even if one of my parents was in the next room. This also included a lot of health anxiety. I would have intense panic attacks about the thought of death and would often convince myself that I was dying. (I know, I was such a positive kid!!)

I did go to therapy and after finding a brilliant therapist, my anxiety improved a lot and I was able to function better. However, literally YEARS after recovering from this, now I am starting to feel it again? Less the general anxiety about literally everything, but I've been so paranoid about my health recently and I don't know why. Have a pain in my leg?  It's definitely a tumour and I'm going to die. My teeth hurt? Yep, it's 100% a deadly infection that's going to spread to my brain and I'll die. I'm making jokes about it to cope but realistically it's such a terrifying thing to deal with and I guess I just need some advice, especially from other people who have also dealt with this kind of thing.

 I am in therapy currently with an amazing therapist, but 1. I'm on another waiting list, so I can't actually talk about this to someone professional for a few weeks and I'm kinda losing my mind here and 2. I just want to know if anyone else has dealt with or is dealing with this issue, as it's all fun and games talking to someone about it but it can be much more helpful talking to someone who truly understands. 

So yeah, I would really appreciate any advice if possible!! Thank you :)",sagdog69,,False,1cvy43v,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvy43v/how_to_deal_with_health_anxiety/
My Journey. A Testimony of How I Pulled It Together.,1716152007.0,"For starts, I'm new to Reddit. I have only got on here recently and have been trying to offer perspective in this area specifically. So, I figured maybe I should talk about me and my experiences. If it helps others going through it, that is the goal. A lot of what I will talk about is very personal, my honest views and accounts. Some things will probably be upsetting to others, but like everything else, you need to know as much info as possible to get the full picture. Apologies, this will be a long post, bear with me.



I'm 6 years old, going to orientation day of Kindergarten at a super small private catholic school (20 kids) before the school journey got kicked off. We were told to bring school supplies and our favorite stuffed animal! I brought the dude, Teddy Glow, a hand-me-down teddy bear with glow in the dark pajamas. I got made fun of for my stuffed animal, not sure why (HE WAS COOL). What I didn't know at the time was this was a foreshadow to the next 10+ years of life, in a lot of ways. There were twin boys in my class, the ring leaders. Myself and Two other boys in the class got the shit kicked out of all the time by the guys. The twins were you're typical school bullies. A lot of influence over the other guys on what was the cool thing to do. Anything from name calling to everybody vs the 3 of us in dodgeball at recess, to the more violent stuff, (I steered clear  from the boys bathroom for a reason). This went on every day like clockwork until an incident occurred that involved a huge chunk of my hair being pulled out, and I was transferred to a nearby public school at the start of the 2nd semester of 7th grade. My parents definitely cared, often trying to intervene with the school/faculty and try to ""solve"" the issue. But what they weren't telling the school is how bad home life was. I grew up in a very ""loud"" place, my trigger to this day is people raising their voices (instant raise in my heartrate/adrenaline response).

My old man - Hard working, always put a roof over the head and had food on the table, active in the community, short fused, no regard for how you feel if you cant perform, bi-polar, textbook narcissist, quick to judge, generally unaware of himself and how he present himself, pathological liar, abusive, and doesn't believe mental health is a real concept.



My mother - Carefree, kind to all, empathetic, understanding, supportive, big heart and cares a lot, got angry but didn't wear it on her sleave, active in the community, very honest, loved by all, truly, abuse victim.

Don't ask me how these two were ""compatible"", couldn't begin to understand it. Everyday when I would come from school, got about 1.5 - 2 hours of peace and quite, and then it would start up. Parents got home, Dad started bitching, then yelling, then screaming at my mom, my sister and I for seemingly nothing. Some of it was carry over from his frustrations at work (insurance agent), some of it was just because of who he is. Didn't take much, one wrong word, glance, or nonverbal signal, and the rest of the night was just high decibel chaos. The first time I remember going to ""war"" with my old man was when I was 8 years old. Not sure what my sister (13 at the time) did, but his anger was pointed towards her and then my mother for trying to diffuse. He will deny it to this day, but i heard my sister shriek from the other room. I ran in, saw her on the ground crying and my mom with her jaw on the floor, and a wire coat hanger in my dads hands. That was the day I learned how to scream in anger. I lost my voice, and couldn't talk for 3 days after that. A few years later, I was sexually abused by my sister. Not getting into in great detail. The way it was explained when I finally brought it up years later is that sometimes young girls experiment with neighbor boys.. I was her younger brother and was 9 years old. She'd say, ""lets play fort!"" (making a makeshift tent out of bedsheets and furniture) and that's where the stuff happened. To say I felt disgusting, misunderstood, and used was a bit of an understatement. We haven't talked about it, and I don't have a desire to bring it up. The one I brought it up to was my mother, who talked to my sister, who denied it and called me an unstable liar, and under the rug it went.



This was the norm growing up. Never really knew if other kids I knew dealt with it or not. This was just life for me and didn't know better and wasn't permitted to talk about it. Enter my family. We're from a small town in the Midwest and have been there for 3+ generations, ""well off"", and very much care about image and what others opinions are of us, catholic, city governance involvement, all that. I wasn't supposed to talk about it and I knew it, because the story would ""be in the county paper for everyone to see"" - words from my grandma, my dads mother. They knew what was happening to great detail, so did my dads sisters. No discussions were had about getting my sister and I out, and my Mother was scared of the whole thing. Scared of retaliation from my dad and his family, scared of what a divorce would do to my sister and I, and scared her job wouldn't be able to support the 3 of us.

As I got into the early and mid teen years, things were just getting started. I was reserved and depressed looking back. When I transferred to the public school in 7th grade, I tried hanging out with the kids I knew from sports. That was an awkward couple of days. Switched it up, ended up hanging out with ""the bad kids"" (other peoples words, not my opinion) who were a lot more accepting and welcoming. Got exposed to things like weed, k2, ciggies, drinking, sex. Didn't partake in much of it, got into skating instead, still with the same crowd, still around the same stuff. Lost my virginity to my middle school girlfriend (I'm laughing audibly at that while typing this out) the first day of 8th grade. Not sure what the correlation between what happened when I was 9 is with that, but I feel like I was thinking about it the kind of stuff earlier than most, maybe? idk. Either way, kind of messed me up. She was the same age, had been with older guys before, and it wasn't special or whatever people think. People walked in, got made fun of for my ""performance"" by her friends. It was all bad, big regret. Eventually started to become suicidal in the same time frame. Got reported for making comments, sent to the counselors office. He asked if I was suicidal, short and sweet. I cried and said yes. Was escorted out of the school by an officer, put in the back of a car, and away I went.



The place I went didn't help at all, got put on 2 different meds, got really good at lying to get out of there faster. Nothing good. Got out, friends were asking were I went, lied about it. Anything I could do to cover up the shame I felt, I did it. Dated a few girls, talked about some of it, they didn't understand it and I felt the same fear from them that my family felt about the opinions of others. One in particular liked to weaponize my experiences and use them as ways to put me down, or hurt me. Got into weed around the same time and she didn't much like that either. Later on, she'd say she didn't want to be with a pot head, and we'd break up. The next morning she calls me to tell me about the night before, and how she fucked some guy who was ""way bigger, way better"" lol. That will fuck with a young guy for sure, and I was no exception. Back to a psych unit I went. Wouldn't be the last time but were getting closer to the end, sort of.



Now we're heading off to college. Don't know why I was going, just seemed like the next step. Didn't have a lot of aspirations or drive, but I knew my family expected it, and so I went. Was undecided my first year, then switched to graphic design. Met a girl, very kind and sweet, very unique in the sense of I hadn't met anyone like her. She was genuinely good, nothing superficial about her. Talked about some of my experiences, and she didn't judge me, and I was head over heals. And then the chapter that's hard for me to talk about. I Fucked up, bad. I became just like my old man, in a lot of ways. I lied, I did wrong, Lied some more, I yelled, all that. The guilt and shame was the only difference. My dad doesn't feel these things, but I do 10x over. Step on an ant, wonder what I could have done to prevent it type of thing. Eventually I had a complete shutdown. Stopped going to class, stopped eating, nothing but sleep and blank stare at the ceiling. Made another attempt on my life, parents showed up. Officially dropped out of school days later. Now I'm back in the home I grew up in and things keep getting worse, the shutdown continues. I make a lot of passive comments about how I don't deserve to be alive, I'm pointless, etc.. All the while, my dad hasn't said a word to be or acknowledged my existence in weeks. Now I'm back in the psych unit, based on a court order signed by my old man. Although I wasn't happy about that fact, I did my best to make it my last appereance and get as much out of it as I could.



The final chapter is ages 23 to present. I got into music production, always been a music head, cant hold a job, made sense I guess. My dad didn't talk to me, ususally just walked passed like I was invisible. My mom, while she didn't approve exactly and silently wished I would quit the bad habits and get it together for my own sake, she talked to me everyday. While I was obsessing over the music thing, she would sit in my room and listen, every day. I will never forget her unconditional love and support shown throughout the years, and never giving up on me, always telling me ""You got this, you can do it, I know you can"". Not much happened around this time until 2 years ago. Just hanging out at home, smoking weed, making beats, working here and there but not consistely, taking meds, going to therapy, 24/7 on the computer, just hiding from the world. 2 years ago my Mother fell in the bathroom, went to the hospital the next day, and was diagnosed with a brain tumor linked to cancer. From that day until her last, My dad's true self came back out, not hiding it at all if inside our house. He would go red in the face, almost daily screaming at my mother about how he ""cant believe she is doing this to him"". Not an uncommon sight for me to great them after getting home from the hospital, and see my dad silent walking away from the car. I get the walker out the back of the car, ask my mom with tears in my eyes how things went today. She'd say ""I'm just tired"" fake smiling but trying to hold it together. We'd make it halfway into the house before the motion sickness would trigger and she would get sick (everyday/multiple day occurence). Didn't know what to do but try to stay strong, hold the bag, and rub her back saying ""its okay, things are going to get better"" and then get her back to her room. Then I'd go to my room for a few minutes, bury my face in the pillow, and cry my eyes out. Eventually she became so debilitated that she couldnt speak, move, and had a feeding tube. The night before she passed in the house my life started in, she had to go to the restroom and didnt know how to tell my dad who was staring out the window. He figured it out, starts screaming, yanks the feeding tube in half, and fireman carries her into the bathroom and drops her on the toilet. At this point I'm sprinting into the room to figure out what the hells happening. My moms head is leaned back, eyes rolling to the back of her head, with my dad screaming at her holding her head up saying ""DO YOU REALLY WANT TO GO OUT ON THE SHITTER"". I'm balled fists about to beat him to death, then she snaps back. We help her back to bed. I plead with my dad to call the doctor, we need to get her somewhere now, we cant wait. Earlier on he had thrown a big fit at the hospital about nurses getting my mom her meds 10 minutes late, so he got her signed into Hospice care so he could be in control of her treatment. Next morning, I'm standing at the end of her bed surrounded by first responders, watching her go. My Dad instantly goes into victim mode, he doesn't know how she got bruised, he doesn't know he was screaming at her, he didn't remember smashing her walker into mangled metal right in front of her and overnighting a new one. No legal will, no autopsy, first cremation in our families history. No formal funeral, had a celebration of life and my dad loved it. So many flowers, cards, sentiments, all to my dad and sister. I hadn't learned a thing either, I kept my mouth shut for the next year.



I'm not sure how to describe the last part other than I stopped making excuses or letting myself off the hook for things I had the power to change. I got off meds, without medical consent. I stopped smoking. I started working more. I took therapy much more serious. I starting eating better/going to the gym. I started talking to more people/quit hiding. I cut ties with my family with the exception of my grandpa. I gave every ounce of my being to becoming better than the nothing I felt I was. Wasn't overnight (took over a year), but I eventually became the young man that I wished my mother could have seen while she was still here. Nowadays, I work full-time. I'm sober and unmedicated. Have aspirations to have a family. I get on the computer every couple of days, log like 3 hours a week maybe on steam. The most I've been on in recent history is getting on this thread to try to help others. As long as this is, and if you made it this far, I hope there's some takeaways that could help. My DM's are always open if you need advice or just someone to vent to or talk too. We're all stronger than we give ourselves credit for.

Why do I feel so sorted and good sometimes but not most of theothers times? ,1716151947.0,"Well the title says it all. Most of the times I (M-27) do not feel good in my mind. Many existing problems of my life makes me feel down, keeps me hopeless, I stay fatigued, demotivated and feel very unsorted on a regular basis. Sometimes to the extend where I even feel suicidal. But sometimes, very rarely, there are days when I suddenly start to feel good about everything. Nothing happens, I just all on a sudden start to feel this powerful energy inside me. I feel motivated. I become very alert and attentive. I walk and talk with a very strong confidence. I feel this strong energetic vibe inside me on every level. I even become very good at everything that I do. I feel this strength building up inside my mind body. All the fatigueness goes away. All the negativity goes away from both my mind and body. Even my libido goes up. It's like I never even experienced any issues in my mind at all in my life. In conclusion, I feel very sorted with my life, I enjoy every single thing, my confidence rises to a whole new level and I just feel like doing so many things. The sad thing is it passes away after a day or two. In a very short while I once again start to feel shitty. In those moments I try to hold on to that good feeling with everything I have. But it goes away. My question is what is it? What happens? Why? And most importantly, how do I keep feeling that? If not always, atleast in a regular basis how do I achieve it?

NB : I come from a region where the mental health of a person does not matter at all. There are treatments, but it comes with a high cost and I am not that strong financially unfortunately. Therefore, I know maybe I'm suffering numerous mental issues, but I don't know any of them.

Will I be able to sell myself?,1716218846.0,"I'm 29M, college graduate, 2020 I graduated college and since then I wasn't able to find a job. 

I fear people, I mean interaction with others, it makes me tutter of what I am about to say to the point that even if I memorize my answer, it will all gone blank when I face a stranger. Or rush other thoughts would come and I'll be losing all the things I prepared.

I could say I am average when it comes to task, I can understand and do it, I know. My profs considered me as a smart kid what they told me, also I score higher in academics than my other classmates, its just that my self-esteem and confidence is so low.

I get along well with anyone, I mean if we already meet for a week, I don't go into fights with others, whole class was like my friends, even the weird ones, and on my training my supervisor is satisfied with my computer skills and my behaviour towards other staffs but pointed out that I should engage more like in terms of speaking up, and my confidence and all.

I got into my training because there's no interview, a friend of mine do it for me, she was the one who reassured the company that I am okay to work with. but after that training and I finished college, I find it too hard to enter a job.

It's a constant self beating, lots of hopelessness, false hope that I should try again, push harder, change, learning about self improvement, applying it then again and again I wasn't able to sell myself. Till I am on my last chance now, help is no more, money is just a fantasy. 

I am just trying now not to lose myself, to fall into deep self-pity and all negative thoughts... Now I wan't to hear it from someone else, some sort of encouragement, inspiration, just to add more force to myself, will I ever be able to sell myself?

here’s my current situation. i’m a university student home for the summer. i don’t have a job. not because i don’t want one, but because i can’t find one. i have been searching for months, been referred to through friends and family, applied online and in person to over a hundred jobs. nothing. even considering i have plenty of past work and volunteer experiences it seems not to be good enough. the previous two jobs i worked in high school were horrible yet even they won’t take me back. the exact same situation of being unemployed happened to me last summer. many of my friends are in the same position this year. this has taken a major toll on my mental health. i’m fortunate enough that my parents are able to provide for me. but i feel extremely guilty when they spend money on me. i’ll use my own savings when buying things for myself or going out with friends but it’s difficult to watch that number always go down so i’ve started to avoid going out with people just to save my money. i also feel really embarrassed when people ask me if i’m working this summer and i have to say no. even though i try to explain that i’ve applied to so many jobs, everyone just assumes that i’m lazy or that my parents are so wealthy that i don’t need to work. neither of which are true. i’ve been trying to avoid interacting with people because i don’t want to be judged. but this isn’t even all about the money. i don’t like being perceived as spoiled and lazy. i also don’t like the fact that i have nothing to do all day. i just sit around everyday job searching and feeling like a piece of shit. if i can’t even find a part time summer job how on earth am i going to have a career in the future. is it stupid to base my self worth off of whether or not i have a job? probably, but i can’t help it. 

so that’s the main issue here. but i’ve had this lack of motivation to live for years now. i can’t talk to my parents about this. my grandparents were immigrants so growing up mental health wasn’t really a thing for my parents. because of that, mental health isn’t a thing for my siblings and i either. when i first started high school i would get to anxious that i would throw up every morning before school and feel nauseous throughout the day. all i got was a “what’s wrong with you? stop doing that.” there were other times where i felt so depressed that i couldn’t pull myself out of bed. “stop doing that for attention. i know you’re faking it so you don’t have to go to school.” i was never really allowed to have emotions growing up. recently my mom told me that my sister was going to go see a therapist. she told me that she doesn’t understand what’s wrong with our generation and why everyone needs to go to therapy. 

so yeah. i don’t know what to do. i can’t talk to my family, i don’t want to burden my friends, and professional help is too expensive. but i wake up every morning and go to bed every night with the same thought in my mind: i don’t want to live anymore. i don’t think i’m suicidal, i think i just need help. if you read this whole thing, thank you.

"Facing my nemesis at long last. No, I won't go to therapy.",1716150854.0,"So when I was 15, I couldn't breathe. It started out of nowhere. It was like the air was made of glass. The longer I inhaled, the more I was feeling like I was suffocating. Then I would go over the top trying to inhale so my lungs would start to hurt, aggravating everything. I thought I was gonna die. I told my parents, they took me to the hospital where they did all the test they could think of, only to find there was nothing wrong with me. So they concluded it must be a psychological issue. My family was poor, you see. And all of those tests basically put us in a terrifying amount of debt, only to find out it was all in my head the whole time. 

I felt like shit. So pathetically weak. My folks sent me to therapy and despite the crippling debt, they were gonna keep paying for me to go. But I didn't. Cause I knew it was all in my head, it couldn't actually hurt me, it was just...the sensation of suffocating, all the time. And I could live with that. So two therapy sessions in, I came home and I lied to my parents, saying I was all cured and I could breathe normally. I could see the relief on their faces. And all I had to do was live the rest of my life feeling like suffocating all the time, I thought.

And I did live like that, for almost a year, until I smoked my firsr cigarette. I couldn't believe it. After coughing up the disgusting tar, I could breathe. For the first time, in a year. I don't know what kind of idiotic paychological loop closed up in my head, I think I finally gave my body a reason to think I was hurting my lungs, thus shutting down the cognitive dissonence, maybe it was just the anxiolotic properties of nicotine, I don't know...point is, I became a smoker immediately after. And I became able to breathe.

I've been a smoker for 11 years now, and every time I tried to quit, the sensation of suffocating came back, worse than before. This time, I was determined to go through with it. Approaching the 1 month mark since my last smoke now, and I fought back fiercely, felt like suffocating for weeks straight, even had two panic attacks, which never happened before, but I did it.

Thing is...the suffocating thing isn't as bad anymore. It only happens every once in a while, and even then, I've gotten really good at dealing with it. But other things started to happen. Things that worry me.

On one hand, I often feel excited. More excited than ever before. I dream, I see life in colour, I create and I think about the future. I sing and I dance along with my favourite songs when I'm home alone. But other times, I catch myself staring at empty walls, thinking of nothing, several times a day. Too many times a day, for far too long, sometimes up to 20 minutes. I fear I might be developing bipolar disorder, though I know very little about that. 

And I can't sleep. Smoking used to help me sleep, now I'm lucky if I catch 4 hours per night. And I'm afraid. All the time, I'm terrified and filled with dread, and I have no idea what of. 

Look, I know whatever started happening to me 11 years ago remained untreated. And it got unleashed now when I stopped self medicating with nicotine. And since then, whatever it is grew to monstrous proportions. And I am still determined to fight it.

I'm in my final year of med school, I'll be a doctor next year. I have friends, good ones, but I refuse to tell them about this. My ex girlfriend is pestering me with texts saying she sees I'm not okay and she wants to help, but I'd rather pick up smoking again then open up to her. And I went to several shrinks throughout my life, and frankly...all of them were absolute morons. They made me lose trust in anyone with a psych diploma.

Petition Instagram to get rid of harmful features?,1716147874.0,"Can we get meta to get rid of the explorer pages?

I (like most other people) really enjoy being able to keep in touch with friends and family that I wouldn’t be in touch with so much if I didn’t have tools such as facebook and instagram. However, that is all that I need and want from those apps. I understand that some people also enjoy the “explorer page” content, which is completely valid. However, I think that it is a very reasonable request to ask meta to make a toggle or account setting in which you choose if your app shows the explorer page or not. The explorer page can be really distracting as well as unhealthy. I know that not everyone feels the same and that we should take away that element of the platform entirely, but I think that for many users it would be a safer app without the explorer page. And just as you can control the kind of content the app feeds you, or switch you account from public to private to business, I think that there needs to be a way to turn off the explorer page. 

I don’t know where to start, as emailing meta isn’t going to get me anywhere as an individual, but I’m sure that there are many people who feel the same, and hopefully if enough people get on board meta will realize that adding this feature would really help a majority of the users of the app, and maybe even attract more people who previously were using the apps because of the distractions associated with it. 

Hopefully I’m not crazy? I’d love to know if other people think this too, and maybe we could get something started. ",bestfemcel,,False,1cvwjmu,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvwjmu/petition_instagram_to_get_rid_of_harmful_features/
I think I SA someone and I don't deserve to live ,1716147556.0,"16f

Sorry for mistakes, english is my third language 

When I was younger, like 14, my cat once jumped on my bed while I was masturbating and lay down near my thigh and it made me came faster because of warmth and vibration she was making. And I remember since then I couple times moved my thigh closer to her on purpose while doing that and once I put my hand on her while doing that.

I didn't think about it then, but I randomly remembered it like 4 months ago. I of course got concerned like wtf does it mean I'm attracted to my cat? So I felt like the only way to know is to do that again. So I did. This time my intention wasn't to achieve sexual pleasure, but to check. But I don't remember. Maybe it aroused me, maybe not. I remember at first it was just to check, but did I moove my hand from her or I came while still touching her?? I don't remember... like maybe I would somehow deal with it if it was just the thing I did when I was 14, but when I did something similar when I was 16.. it is way worse.

I mean I was just so anxious about possibility of me beeing a zoophile that I didn't thought about how wrong the action is itself while I was doing that ""check"". Now I don't think I'm a zoophile cause I have no urge to have sex with animals and I was never interstated in stuff like that. I think It is juts because im hypersexual, it was like that since I was like very young, I'm sometimes physically aroused by very random and non sexual stuff. But it was still an awful thing.

Like it is basically SA... some people wouldn't agree, but imagine if I did something like that to a sleeping person. Like it wouldn't cause any harm, but it still would be SA and a disgusting and awful thing to do.

I juts can't stop thinking about it. People are saying ""forgive yourself"" and of course not beeing able to forgive myself for that is a part of the problem, but the other part is how disturbing and disgusting the memory is itself. Like It's so wrong and unnatural on a subconscious level, like I almost physically feel the disgust for the memory and for myself.

This memory absolutely ruined my life. I don't see the point in living anymore if it's just 24/7 suffering. I think it absolutely ruined me as a person. 

I never was really into living because of my mental health problems such as eating disorder, ocd, hypersexuality and I also used to struggle with depression. But I was kinda doing better and then this memory came and absolutely fucking ruined everything. 

I can't even imagine what wad going on in my head when I did it. Like WTF was wrong with me.

Like whyyy. My cat is like a child to me. I love her so much. And I did that shit to her. 

I just can't do that anymore. These 4 months I was trying not to kill myself just because of the chanse it will get better. But it doesn't. 

I don't think I deserve happiness or forgiveness. I think that if anyone knew this irl they would judge be and call me a freak. I hate it so much. It's so digesting and I hate myself.

I just think maybe I should start doing hard drugs and overdose after a while cause I can't do that anymore. ",ksjskkalq,,False,1cvwfer,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvwfer/i_think_i_sa_someone_and_i_dont_deserve_to_live/

Is anyone liable if I had died? What about now?,1716148405.0,"I attempted suicide recently and I'm just wondering if anyone would get in trouble for it?

I told my Councillor that I felt suicidal and he kind of brushed it off and didn't do a risk assessment. The next week I came back and told him I had a plan. He asked me what the plan was and I didn't answer in fear that he would do something to stop me. He then replied "" is it thoughts of a plan or a real plan?"" At this point I started crying because I was down playing my own pain for the sake of suicide. I said thoughts. I'm not entirely sure if he could get in trouble for that and I don't want him to. 

The next one is my friends. They knew of my suicidality but they didn't really do anything. Obviously they won't get in massive trouble and at worst the school would probably do an assembly.

The last one is my favourite teacher, bless her she is so sweet but I can tell she doesn't know how to react.

Help! (28F) Can’t enjoy things recreationally anymore?,1716217179.0,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. This started around the age of 22. Prior to that, I’d dropped out of college and was just at home playing video games and watching anime for about a year. Then I felt like I was wasting my life and a fire lit under my ass to start living. I went back to school for a different major and finished early. I ate and breathed school. Did nothing else but that and watch YouTube. Stopped playing video games, watching cartoons, or reading fanfiction. Stopped drawing or writing. Then I got my first job and I basically worked and went home (parents house) No dating, no going out, nothing. No hobbies. 

I recently finally moved out and it’s like I’ve been in hyperdrive trying to make up for the lost years of my twenties that were spent doing nothing of note. I have a tasklist for myself for my free time and I’m almost never relaxing. I’ve been out here 5 months and I haven’t spent a single weekend in. I’m always exploring some new area or part of the city. Running around museums and going to shows. “Enriching my mind.” I feel guilty or disinterested when I want to do something “just” for fun. 

Sometimes I can muster myself up to read or watch something for fun that only takes up maybe 30 minutes to an hour but I end up feeling like I’m wasting my time. Same with video games. I used to love them but they’re just so 🙄 to me now. I haven’t touched them at all for a year. Prior to that, I could play maybe a couple of hours max every few months. I’d rather just watch a Let’s Play on YouTube these days or just watch the cutscenes because it’s faster. All my former hobbies feel like chores now. I’ve become so fake, like I only want to spend time doing shit that’s “worthy” or hobbies that seem cool and well-rounded. Hobbies that move me forward in life in someway. Monetarily or intellectually. Nothing just for fun.

"How to cope with stress, despair or even panic? ",1716217069.0,"Hi. I (28M) went through 2 years ago through a break up after 8 years relationship and I was broken and lost meaning. I got back on track since, having a girlfriend now for 1 year, a few new close friends and focusing on my career, one thing changed though... 
I am very vulnarable for stress and panic. Even small things, like getting home after party, or possible future arguments, or future problems make me stress a LOT. My stomach cramps up, loose appetite, losing motivation on work or even chores, and getting into a feeling like depression. This happens pretty often, like even weekly or more times a week. 
After my break up I attended psychologist for half a year, but didnt really change or added anything. Maybe it wasnt a good one, but I talked with a few people who attended psychologists and noone got help they needed. It is getting a bit worse, since I have issues with stomach acidity, I am going next week to see a doctor for that. 

Can someone give suggestion, what could I do, practice or anything that can even a bit help to get less effected by stress or even occasional panic attack like feelings? (Might not be full on panic attack but few times came close to it.)

They do not support my decision to collect them, in fact nobody knows about it  if they found them I would be done for, they would destroy every single one of them, and they are right I am a compulsive hoarder, my room his always a mess and I already cleaned it tow times, papers, plastics, old toys, recently I got read of t a box full of toys and tow plastic bags full of useless trash all scattered in small room.

That is why my family doesn't want me to collect this supposed useless electronics, because they take to much space and I wont ever stop getting new ones, and I think they are right I already have contacts of over 30 different people, only some can give me tv's but they are quite numerus.

I already have hidden at least 9 TV's of which only 4 work. I am thinking of giving the broken ones to an old pawn shop but I don't have car and I hide them by bringing them myself, I cannot possibly throw them out or give them because their a secret and I cant go to neither to the pawn shop or the recycling plant do to the distance.

Also I ask literally everyone, I am still asking people, and not asking makes me stressed and depressed, and waiting for other people to give them also causes stress and anxiety, and I also ask in very inappropriate situations some friends of mine have already call me out.

I cannot bring my self to let go or to get rid of them, and my room is already filled whit old radios, cd players, a vcr, a crt tv, books and comics, musical instruments, old consoles and new electronics etc recently my desk almost broke from the weight.

I cant bring my self to sell this items and I am always getting more crap, I still have storage space in the factory but when will someone in my family find out and what will they do.

am I a bad person for having bad thoughts?,1716185340.0,"I’ve been struggling with some personality shifts which I believe was trigged by recent long term relationship ending and I’ve been feeling shame for it, and was hoping to get some perspectives and maybe some advise on how to correct my thinking.

Any perspective is welcome good or bad. I’m very ashamed of my views so I don’t think I can talk to anyone I know about this without being anonymous. DMs are welcome if you aren’t comfortable posting publicly.

backstory:
My (m/usa) relationship was with a girl I’ve dated a total of 8 years. We’ve had an our ups and downs in the relationship, however we had great communication  and understood and supported each other at a deep level, I’ve never loved anyone else romantically. We had a two year break after infidelity on her part about 2 years into the relationship but we rekindled and resolved the feelings. During this two year break time I did not feel a connection with anyone so just focused on my career.

About 8 months ago, I’ve found out about some more infidelity and the relationship ended. I did not take this well and my view of the world and people has shifted.

the issue:
lately I’ve been meeting new women and I feel like I don’t respect them and just use them. I see them as selfish and untrustworthy without letting myself get to know them. I’m deeply ashamed of this when I reflect alone but when I’m around women I just have no respect for them and almost see them as objects. I don’t believe I’ve felt any of this before the recent breakup and have been described as sweet and a caring personality and I know this isn’t how I was raised.

this shift in my thoughts makes me ashamed as I knowingly using these women. I keep having this belief that the women I’m meeting are also just trying to use me so we both know what the deal is, but I’ve hurt a few people already unknowingly.

Until I’ve figured this out I’ve stopped engaging with women but I want to stop having these thoughts that all women are manipulative and just trying to gain something from me. I want to find someone who can emotionally bond with and someone I don’t see as someone trying to benefit from me just for material things.

about a week ago i was on vacation in florida visiting family and we went to the beach. while there i had a blast (apart from losing my prescription glasses in the ocean) and i was fine for the next few hours. shortly after i got back to my hotel room i started replaying every second on the beach. i feel in my legs nonstop the way the waves made my feet and legs feel and i have come to the conclusion its because i faked or cheated death in some way. i was supposed to die on that beach and im not supposed to be alive. since the beach every part of my life (even before i realized i shouldve died) has felt extremely odd. like just genuinely off in a way, where you wouldnt notice it without some hindsight and i think its bc i was supposed to die. therefore my entire life and story and whatever is happening on this earth is reacting strangely to me interacting with my environment, like a coding issue in a video game. i haven’t slept in days. ive become extremely paranoid, to the point of seeing snd hearing people, and i dont know what to do. i’m so scared and i cant sleep ive been up for days and i just want to be normal again please help me m",throwaway7272748593,,False,1cw92f3,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cw92f3/someone_please_help_i_think_i_cheated_death/
I want a toxic relationship.,1716187903.0,"I guess this is venting I’m not really sure what I want. Sorry if this is all over the place I just need to tell someone about it or else I will keep thinking about it and it’s not fun. 

For as long as I can remember I was always around or in a toxic/unhealthy relationship. My parents and grandparents constantly fighting and my friends not being the best to be around. I didn’t really understand that I was being bullied in elementary school when all the boys would hit me or make fun of me I thought they were my friends so it only really hit me at the end of middle school. In middle school I had a friend that was always uncomfortably touching me or making rude jokes about me to others in front of me. Another one of my friends had a crush on me and we started “dating” she was always mad at me for something, she would tell people she would date them if she wasn’t with me, and would talk bad about me behind my back. We broke up then later got back together then we broke up again. I had a best friend I was friends with since 4th grade and we would always fight and I would beg her to tell me when she upset so I could apologize but she would never tell me. She ended up not wanting to be friends with me because she thought I liked my other friend more than her or that’s what she told me it was for.

Right now I am surrounded by three amazing friends people that love me and care about me and I love them so much. We talk every day and hang out when we can we all go to different schools. I’ve known K for 7 years, M for 5 years, and D for 1 year. They mean the world to me. 

But recently I’ve been wanting more. I’ve thought about wanting a romantic relationship/partner but I don’t want the sexual stuff that comes with and I don’t want to have to force my partner to not do something they want to do. But for some reason I am craving intimacy not sexual intimacy but I guess emotional intimacy? I have a really hard time talking about how I feel and what’s wrong because I don’t think anyone would truly understand the way I want them to so I never bothered. I want the miscommunication, the emotional dependency, the obsession, and the jealousy. I know this is wrong I don’t want to get hurt or hurt anyone else. But if I’m with someone that wants me so bad they can’t even think of themselves with someone else I can’t get hurt even if that’s unhealthy. I know you shouldn’t depend on someone to be happy but I want to. I get so jealous of everything and everyone that I hate it. I get jealous over my friends having other friends, I get jealous over my parents hanging out with their significant others. I just don’t want to be alone anymore I want someone that will be there forever no matter what.

My mental health has been quickly deuterating.... ,1716190024.0,"Long story short, I was laid off from my job in March. Ever since then I've been applying to tons of jobs and although I've had a few interviews, none of the jobs can sustain my living. I'm getting to a point where I'm feeling incredibly hopeless: I wake up not wanting to be here anymore, I drink every other day, and I can't get the help I need (I drank today). 

Since I don't have a job I don't have health insurance, and buying it off the market is really expensive. In 2 weeks I'm going to have to tell my landlord I'm not renewing the lease and move back in with my mom. Going back to my mothers home, dishonorable as a loser and a failure. Losing my sanctuary, losing my privacy, losing my home, all because I'm worthless and nobody wants to hire me. My gf has to deal with my mood swings and suicidal ideations. I never take my anger out on her verbally (or physically) but I know my current state hurts her. She doesn't want to see me like this. Yesterday we went out to eat because she's been craving a burger from a diner. She knows I love to eat, but I barely touched my food. More than likely I sucked the enjoyment out of the day from her. I'm also drowning in credit card debt, every month I go $2000 over my limit. However, that's the least of my worries. If I die, I don't have to pay it back and I don't have dependents. 

Last week I called my old college to inquire about their masters accounting program. They said I could finish in a year or 2 and sit for my CPA. However, that's an EXTREMELY hard exam, that requires a lot of preparation. How can I do that and work? What if I don't pass it and still can't get a shitty accounting job? What then? The idea of going back to school leaves me skeptical because I don't trust the value it brings. Too many people have shitty lives, therefore I don't trust it. 

I'm 34, but I feel like my life is over. I feel like its too late. How could I make so many meaningless decisions? Why am I here at 34? I really hate myself. I wake up hopeless, mad at God for not stopping my heart in my sleep. I don't want another day, please give it to someone else.

"Thinking about breaking a 6 year relationship with my gf (24F), whom I still love. Her mental health relies almost exclusively on my presence and the responsibility is suffocating me. Should I break up with her even if she’ll probably have suicidal thoughts?",1716209383.0,"TLDR: My(23F) Gf(24F) of 6 years relies on my presence to be happy, every day we can’t see each other, she gets depressed and won’t even leave bed, even getting suicidal thoughts. I’ve refused plans and job offers because of wanting to spend more time with her just for her wellbeing, as I feel guilty and responsible for it. I love her but I think I can’t handle this situation anymore, as I’m really anxious about how can I handle her and my own life (friends, family, projects, jobs...) at the same time, as she leaves me with so little time to work on it. She won’t attend therapy or try anything besides going for a walk with me. I’ve been mentally ill myself and not even my experience and reassurance convince her to try anything. Should I break up with her even if I know she’ll probably get suicidal thoughts? Should I try to endure it? I do really want her to be happy, but I feel exhausted.

——

My(23F) gf(24F) gets depressed every time I cannot see her for a day. Calls and texts won’t prevent it. It’s been like this since the start of our relationship — 6 years ago. On those days, she will either not leave bed or leave it but stay extremely sad all day, sometimes not even eating. It makes me feel guilty and responsible for her wellbeing, so I’ve ended up more than once missing out on things I would like to do or postponing things I need to do (examples of things I’ve refused for her wellbeing: attending one friend’s birthday party, some family reunions and trips, getting a better job because it demanded me putting more hours in than the one i had —I didn’t need the money, but it would’ve been nice—…). Nowadays, I’m more able to think for myself and attend those things, even if it means not seeing her for a day, but she will still get depressed and I would feel sad for her.

Example of a recent situation: a month ago, I was sick for 2 days and couldn’t see her. She also had some exams coming up, which made her even more anxious. Both things affected her so much she couldn’t sleep for those days and she ended up texting me she was thinking about suicide. Other times she had been anxious because of exams and I had been able to see her, she would maybe sleep a bit less, but wouldn’t ever think about suiciding over it.

She refuses therapy and won’t speak with anyone about her issues beside me. She doesn’t meet up with anyone except me (unless they ask her to, which is infrequent), so she can’t even try to “fill the void I leave on her”.

I have to admit that something that it pains me that not even once she has even considered trying one of the options I gave her, not even for making me happy or calmer. The only time she agreed to do so was a as lie, 4 years ago, used to negotiating with it just to convince me from not getting a job that wouldn’t have let us have as much time together as we have now — so I lost that job offer AND didn’t get her to go to therapy, double loss. Even if I try to not show how I feel when she’s talking to me about her issues, she has sometimes seen me cry about it and even get anxiety attacks (she told me she would kill herself on that night, happened more than once) and not once has thought to even try something even just to say it didn’t work for her. It makes me feel as if she mostly values our relationship on how I keep her “not alone” and distracted from her bad feelings. I had struggled with mental health in the past (depression and anxiety disorder) and I went to therapy because I didn’t want my loved ones to suffer about me and I wanted to get better, so it crushes me how little she listens to me about therapy or my feelings during those last long 6 years.

QUESTION: Should I break up with her? Is it even correct, knowing how it will crush her? Or should I stay and try to keep on helping her? I know I’ll keep making her sad every time I can’t meet up with her, and it will lead her to suicidal thoughts on some point again, as it has been in the past everytime I’ve tried to put up some boundaries",ThrowRA_Tomatoes,,False,1cwes81,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cwes81/thinking_about_breaking_a_6_year_relationship/

Basically I am a woman in my twenties and I've noticed that I've always had these intense obsessions with media for example bands, tv shows, anime and characters and real life celebrities (usually band members).

My entire life can be categorized by my obsessions. They're intense and can last up to years, but lately they only last for a few months. Right now I'm obsessed with a band from UK. Its all I think about and want to talk about. I refrain myself from talking too much about it because I assume its annoying as hell. And I have a huge obsession with one of the band members!! I even run a blog about them and have over 3,000+ pics of them saved on my phone. Now I'm starting to notice that my obsession may be fading a bit (or I'm trying to get myself out of it) because I read some icky things about them and I'm worried about my mental health. I usually feel empty inside when i have nothing to hyperfixate over and I'm not sure what to do...? I'm already going through a bit of a depressive period and this band member is one of the few things that bring me comfort in my life. I'm looking to hyperfixate over a fictional character bc having this type of fixation on a real life person is causing me some emotional pain. Likely because in my head I feel attached to them in some way. (Parasocial relationship anyone?)

I'm 28f, married for a year. I quit my super shitty job of 9 months in March, and now started a new job last week. Currently WFH, will switch to hybrid.

We'll be moving to a new house this weekend. Our current house is a mess. Everything is everywhere. Packing stuff is just terrible. 

I got over a sickness a week ago, my body is also still sore after cleaning the new house last weekend. At the same time, I'm trying to just work and train myself on this new job cause I want to be a good at it. 

My husband has his own business so he is always home. I have to cook and clean during my breaks from work. No I cannot let him in the kitchen. He's the clumsiest person ever walked on earth. And he's very keen on me so sometimes seeks attention and cuddle breaks in the bed. All I want recently is just to lay in bed and listen to music and daydream. 

I used to be a bookworm. I have a huge library at home. I have not even read a single page since last year. I'm losing myself. 

Life is constantly busy. I'm drowning. I cannot even cry because I feel so empty. 

Seen several doctors, all said it's just depression and gave me pills I already used in the past.

Has anyone left a job due to work ethic declining from mental health issues?,1716208182.0,"I started working at this company a year ago and was doing well while my managers had me on a path to become a leader in the team.

Want to go back to normal ,1716206161.0,"Hi everyone. I (F19) have been struggling with anxiety for as long as I can remember. It used to be about things I said to people, someone breaking into my house, etc. I kept it under control for years and felt like I was in complete remission. Well, at the age of 16 I had a terrible panic attack that was induced by smoking weed. Following that was a terrible episode of derealization/depersonalization, feeling not normal/not real. Constant crying/anxiety. Eventually with therapy and a low dose of Zoloft I went back to pretty much “normal” with time. Until two weeks ago. I had a horrible panic attack because one of my regular meds I take at night got stuck in my throat and started burning. We called a medic and I ended up throwing up everywhere. Eventually I got to sleep, but that didn’t reset me. Ever since that I’ve been waking up with extreme anxiety. Feeling like there’s something “wrong with me”. I missed a lot of work . I think I may be struggling with some form of OCD because I get these horrifying obsessive thoughts and feel drawn to spend time doing research or find ways to “check” or convince myself that it’s normal to find some temporary relief. My thoughts are often very existential in nature, and I’ve convinced myself multiple times I was in a pre-phase of psychosis. I’ve convinced myself that I’m going to get stuck in pain forever, like until the end of time. When I’m in a better state of mind all these thoughts don’t make sense to me but in the moment it’s so real. It’s debilitating. We think this sudden change of my mental wellbeing is because of a weight loss injection I was previously taking, it’s thought that it had an effect on my Zoloft absorption. I can’t get proper sleep like I used to. I wake up super early with anxiety. I usually throw up once a day. Feeling very down and depressed. I was so scared at one point I almost admitted myself to the hospital but now that I know it might be OCD it feels like a slight relief. I have a follow up with my doctor today. I just want to go back to normal. I spend time ruminating on how my mind “used to work” and thinking about the thoughts I “should be thinking”. My goal is to get into some kind of clinic for frequent therapy (I already have a therapist who is away until the end of this week). I honestly don’t completely know where I was going with this post but I just needed to vent and I need some support. I just want it to get better. I feel like I don’t know how to relax and enjoy myself anymore.

Need urgent help,1716205982.0,"Hi everyone. I'm in dire need of help right now. My girlfriend is currently suffering from anxiety, might be depression. We've consulted some psychiatrists, and therapists, but her condition didn't improve much. It's getting worse day by day. 

She overthinks a lot. She tells me that many time she even questions her own existence and even her surroundings. She keeps on getting in this rabithole of overthinking and it causes her breakdowns and anxiety regularly. I am not able to do anything, and it is killing me seeing her in such pain. 
She had also had some prescriptions of Panazep, Toficalm and Clonotril (for emergency). But she stopped taking them after 2 weeks. I have no idea as to whether being on antidepressants has any side effects, but during that time, she seemed a little better. And then she stopped taking them.
I've heard that many therapist & psychiatrists have this kind of thing where they tell the patient to consult the other and we've already faced that loop.

I absolutely have no idea what to do in such case. When we're in a call & she's having an episode, I mostly tell her to try to stay calm, everything is fine. I tell her to do her chores regularly, like making bed after getting up, and getting some morning sun light with a walk on the terrace, freshening up and only then starting her work for the day. One day she does it and the next, she doesn't, saying that she didn't feel like doing these activities. She's at working from home currently as we thought being with her family might have some positive effect on her mental health. I always tell her to stay in a well lit room and not to work on the bed, etc. I tell her to go outside regularly, even if it is for nothing for 20-30 min each day. 

I came here to get some advice as to what should we do? Should we go to a psychiatrist and continue the meds? Can this be cured by just therapy? Also how do we find a reliable therapist??

TLDR: I think (but I'm not certain) that due to constantly hearing her and supporting her during this period, I'm starting to have some negative effects on my own mental health. I'm worried about this. (Not that I don't love her, infact we're gonna marry each other one day) As I myself am on a critical juncture at my life. I'm preparing to do MBA and studying for that and managing my full time job with it (which I hate).

Usually , when I am having a really bad day. And I decide today is when I want to end things. I can reason myself out of it, their is a boundary I can't cross to do it. 

Today tho I snapped and finally told my gf I don't want to live. And that, last week when I said I just needed to work, I had gone to attempt suicide at a bridge. My son had called me which brought me back down. He hasn't known , it was just coincidence. 

Now, the things stopping me just don't seem right anymore. I am constantly told how the pain I will leave is selfish. But, when my family member killed himself, it took a year or two and people got on with things.

"Potential break up with my partner, fertility exam, upcoming graduation ",1716194227.0,"Me(19) and my bf(20) are together for a year in couple of days. We are long distance, never have met, we are planning to meet and stay together for a month this summer. 

I really love him and can't imagine losing him, we have done so much for eachother.

5 days ago my classmate shared that she is infertile, and based on her symptoms I might be too, so I shared this knowledge to my bf(he really wants kids and family at young age, that connected us). He wasn't really pleased with my news, and said that he needs a family(biological kids)and you can imagine how much stress we started to feel. I said I will go to the gynecologist to do fertility test on Monday (today) but I got super ill during weekend due to anxiety(shitty immune system). 

We are arguing about me not going to do the fertility test today. But I really couldn't because of illness.

Why I'm stressing so much? We will not stay together if I can't have kids, so it's either having everything or nothing, my bf said he would stay with me but it wouldn't be a life lasting thing and that's just a no for me. So we would break up. I will lose the ability to have children,  and my partner that I love so much. We planned our life together that I was really exited for. To add to stress I'm graduating soon. 

I just wanted to vent, I'm in so much pressure I can't do this anymore, I just hope everything is okay and I can continue my life. The thing is the test will probably be okay and I'm fertile but there are so many things dependent on that result.

Am I depressive or is it just a phase?,1716198599.0,"In the last weeks I felt unmotivated and down. Its mainly cause I don't have anything to do. I used to play Fortnite (pls dont hate) and now I play Valorant (pls don't hate again) but Valorant isn't as fun and my PC can't run Fortnite without it lagging and its just unplayable. Now I'm just at home as before but without  anything to do except being on my phone and watching TikTok. I don't like being with people or going outside in general. I isolated myself and only go outside if I'm in the mood for it. I don't really have things to do outside because I live in a small village with few people of my age and I already cut one of my best friends off because he evolved into an ignorant idiot who only destroys himself with smoking and stuff (he's 15 btw). I only meet friends online although I know them and we do stuff together but I mostly just watch them do it and I'm mainly just a side character that gives some comments nobody laughs about. I like a girl in the group and I already tried to get a bit closer with her and also offered her help when she needs someone to talk to. But if I'm in a call with all of my friends and we all just play Minecraft or something I would just close Minecraft   after half an hour because I don't have the motivation. Then I just watch their streams and I think to myself ""Why don't you play with them and have fun?"","" Why are they having fun without you?"" or if I hear the girl  talking "" You will never have a chance with her"","" You're not good enough"",""She probably has a Bf"",""She will cut contact if you tell her"" and then I just feel a void inside of me and if I can't do it anymore I just leave the call and go to bed. Now there are signs that I maybe could have a mental illness but I don't know if I really have one and I don't want to offend any people that actually have a mental illness like depression.

"I almost got put on a psych hold, then got SA'd",1716200614.0,"(This whole story has so much complexity; please be patient if I struggle to keep up with follow up questions- I just found out the big sad cherry on top of this tale about 6 hours ago. )


Due to a recent mental health interaction resulting from a week worth of high dosage  benadryl taken for treatment of a poison oak rash I had over a lot of my body, My polycule & one new partner in particular started to think I was manic/bipolar and made some unreasonable claims that I might be a danger to myself or others. 


 While I was not actually a danger, it was reported and agreed that I was perhaps ""an emotional danger"" and the doctor was privately told by Jaye that my other nesting partner felt unsafe; however no actual harm was ever done, even as the scenario escalated further and further into ethical issues later that night, cops were called several times, I was prevented from leaving but not permitted in my own home until the cops themselves ordered I be let back in.


I *actually* managed to get out of this psych hold mess by simply saying I would go voluntarily, didn't want to get in the ambulance, and then just totally walking away from the paramedics instead, but the hospital incorrectly or just lied and told my group I had self admitted and that I ""wasn't actually fit for a mandatory hold"". The level of personell they had rolled out spoke otherwise, (LITTERALLY 8 very large people) and I think my very extremely peacefull response to that shit show surprise either just caught them off guard enough for me to walk away, or they abandoned the belief I was a danger,  and later on once I reached out to them, All the people involved from the polycule were extremely remorseful the next day about having not trusted me to be safe without any basis for that belief, then trapped me in a place that was not safe, and all parties claimed they had not intended to have me psych held, but many small things stated that day made that assertion truly impossible to  believe.

The fact I escaped and was perfectly fine by myself disproved a lot of the concern trolling that had occured- I returned to the group later by my own choice.

The next day Jaye swore to me upside and down that they had not pre-meditated to place me on that hold and had no knowledge it was going to occur; and yet their own word choice on the recording they themselves made and sent me, perfectly hit the legal requirements so that the Dr office would be *required* by law to place me on a hold. (This person, by nature of their education and work, MUST know this. That's undeniable, of this at least we all in the polycule agree.) Jaye also undeniably helped keep me in the office for 90 minutes while they gathered their medics to come take me, but still claims they had not heard the doctors mention a hold; and coincidentally Jaye also allowed it so I was exceptionally stoned for that doctor interview.

They still deny knowing I was about to be abducted.

The part about this that causes me the most heartache is that Jaye had spent the day prior telling me they didn't think I needed a hold, more or less in my honest opinion so I'd agree to go to the place I could be most easily abducted.   after this all happened and the entire group is apologizing to me for their actions, denying they ever wanted what happened, I gave Jaye the chance to acknowledge &, explicitly stated that it would be without repercussion, if they had lied to me about their level of involvement, desire and their intent in getting that hold placed, and they then AGAIN swore on their honor they had not wanted me to be hospitalized involuntarily. I was very clear I would be checking this for validity but that I wanted to trust them, and although I was still in this mental health episode, I opted to trust them without proof.

The audio recording they themselves made at the office and later sent me (and many conversations that had happened prior to going) had Jaye cuddling with me wonderfully and speaking to the doctor and to me in room about medications and then immediately outside that room Jaye was directly asking for an option where I didn't get to come home that day. The whole group had been two facing me for days, telling me I was delusional but then getting regularly caught in the details of little lies and then denying it and they held onto that big lie even as I asked for the truth and told them directly that our relationship would be over forever if I found out they *still* didn't tell me the truth at a moment when they had a free pass to have been wrong.. I was gentle and kind about this but firm when I *repeatedly* offered them the chance to change their story, because being dishonest here would ruin everything. They cried, they lied, and they spent most of the evening trying to get me to move in with them, since, that same day and probably on their own active recommendation to my primary partner, my housing was suddenly and arbitrarily going to be contingent on long term medication usage- something I refused to agree to on premise alone, and- remember, this was and still is just a temporary benadryl reaction in my book. I'm doing mostly fine now, (aside from when I figured all this out.)

Jaye denied and did *not* acknowledge their later very obvious and deliberate (and we have an audio recording to support this) role in causing and furthering this psych hold development. I  had a big sweet heart to heart and gave them the chance to come clean explicitly without consequence, since I in part understood their concerns had some validity, but that I needed to be given the truth in full to continue to trust them.

This person, Jaye, who is a licensed family therapist, in one breath convinced people I was 'clearly' a danger, EXPLICITLY lied to me about all aspects of their involvement and then INNITIATED SEX WITH ME less than 18 hours after trying and failing to get me put on a involuntary psych hold.

just prior to that intercourse I said exactly and clearly that I would accept their truth right now but that I could not have a relationship or sex with them ever again if I found out the truth of their actions were otherwise and lied to my face for a third time about their intent that day. I actually thought before they fucked me that this would be extremely non consensual if otherwise was true, and this level of accusation was merited at the time, as the recipient themselves agreed.

I was super clear about that part too, that they COULD be honest, I accepted that the situation was a hot mess, etc., but that to trust them, as I so dearly wanted to, I needed them to tell me what the truth was. I promised them forgiveness, and they swore to a lie. 

What should I do? My housing is now gone, I feel like I was sexually violated, I don't think this person should be a mandatory reporter any more, and LITTERALLY the next day they were basically starting an investigation into the neighbors friends as if they hadn't just ruined shit for enough people. 

I humorously would really like to forgive all of them, but after one of my other fem partners told me in relation to this that I should look to the future and let this be in the past.. I almost exploded on the spot- and since this all happened two days ago and I had just found out an hour prior I was SA'd yesterda,. I was understandably furious for hearing what I interpreted as being told to get over it already, and then I was punished with more loss of housing without legal notice or parameters for daring to feel that way. 

This happened in Oregon.

After 6 months they'll either leave me home jobless or hand me another contract for maybe double the wage but my anxiety is over the roof and I fear I won't be able to make a good impression to keep working for a better wage.

I barely focus on stuff and keep in mind what I'm told(I gotta get diagnosed for a potential ADHD), I struggle with socializing(I'm autistic) and at this point just thinking about the fact that I'll have to work 8 hours a day for 5 days a week for the rest of my life just to be able to live on my own is making me want to k*ll myself.

I have so many projects that I wanted to finish but when I used to have free time I didn't do much to accomplish what I wanted to and now that I have even less time since I'm horrible at managing it I won't be able to do anything at all.

I can't fathom the idea of a person requiring to toss away at least 3/4 of their life just to be able to barely live, I don't even consider that living at this point.

Paranoid / Anxious in public spaces,1716199047.0,"Hello, I'm a 30 y/o male.

Last January, a man approached me at a petrol station and demanded my keys. It wasn't violent but worried that things could escalate, I gave him the keys to my car. He was arrested a week later.

The reason I mention this is because ever since this, I'm far more paranoid in certain public spaces such as carparks, petrol stations, walking the street etc. I'm fine if I'm inside a shopping centre or something (anywhere that something is very unlikely to happen). 
Prior to this incident I wasn't worried about this sort of thing at all. 

What's concerning me is that even though it was almost 1.5 years ago, the paranoia isn't really fading. 

To make things worse (extremely unlucky) a junky this morning was in the middle of the road yelling at me while im in my car, wanting my car and telling me to get out the car. 
I was able to drive off and called the police but this situation after trying to convince myself for a long time that nothing like that will ever happen again, has messed with my head a bit...

I feel like I probably really need to talk to a professional about this as its something that's basically always in the back of my head. When I need to go to the shops or petrol station, there's always this worry of being in another encounter.

Side note that I am a tall guy but I'm skinny, never been in fights and not really confident in the self-defense option if something was to arise.

I want to start by saying that this is not me at all trying to self diagnose, but more over seeing if I can do something to improve o soothe some of the symptoms that I get. 


I constantly feel as if I’m living in flight or fight mode, even in my house. I’m really prone to burn outs and getting overstimulated, as of right now I’m studying with earplugs bc the sounds are just too much. 
I also get overstimulated with textures and sometimes when I’m processing too much information. 
I have a hard time staying still in classes, I need to either multitask or fidget, do something with my hands anything but staying still. 
I have a hard time doing a long and tedious boring task, since I get distracted easily, in fact the only study method that works out for me is the pomodoro method. 
I don’t like trying new foods and whenever I’m stressed I have a set of “safe foods” that I eat to self soothe. 
I am really good at reading the subtexts of conversations, figuring out people and reading expressions, bc I have a special interest in emotional intelligence and psychology (so I read books on books about the topics).

Why is my focus so bad?,1716191405.0,"A lot of times when I try to focus on a thought my mind will keep racing. Is it anxiety? Like it’s very hard to focus on one thought. I also sometimes have intrusive images or thoughts that pop up. Could be violent, sexual, or just fucking weird. I think weirdly about things a lot of the time and Ik it’s weird but it’s in my brain you know. Sometimes I get a burst of energy and start saying inappropriate things and sit back and wonder “what am I doing?”. I’m VERY insecure and I will make a baseless assumption that someone’s talking about me and I’ll go with that and sometimes act off that assumption(just not good behavior). If I’m angry I can act reckless and have this fuck everyone mindset. Like if I’m in the gym and I’m feeling insecure, and I’m tired of assuming what people are thinking about me, then I’ll just have a thought like fuck everybody. I could care less if everyone in this gym died. But if something like that were to truly happen I would be remorseful and extremely depressed. I just have these thoughts and assumptions that are so incredibly difficult to shake off. I feel so weird and sometimes crazy a lot of the time. Anyone who goes through similar problems or has some words of wisdom I’d appreciate to hear your voice. I also am I terrible self critic and I think I can have bad judgment depending on how I’m feeling. I’ll feel like a bitch if I don’t look someone in the eye long enough, or if I just glance at them.

I finally realized why I can't unconditionally love/accept myself,1716190663.0,"Hi folks, I recently had a revelation where a lot of things seemed to click, so I thought I'd share in case it ressonates with anyone.

It started when I was trying to figure out why it was so hard for me to accept myself as someone who has fallen behind and is struggling to pass my university exams and graduate. It feels like no matter how hard I try to accept and love myself for who I am there is always a part of me that is resisting it. So I started to think back on where this notion may have come from.

I remember growing up people would praise me for being smart, passing exams without trying, etc. Not only did I start to attach my self-worth to academic success but at some point other people would implicitly or even explicitly do so as well. At the time it seemed so straight-forward. Doing well in school will lead to getting into a good university, which will lead to a good job, stable income, and eventually you will have a life that will make you happy.

If that's the case, it makes sense then to socially reward those behaviors, since they bring us towards this happy successful life. But what happens with you don't live up to those expectations? Then there is the social punishment. The disappointment, the lack of praise, etc. The only way for you to feel valuable as a person again is to do the thing that will lead you down the path that society deams is the most conducive to happiness. We are so convinced that this path will lead to happiness that we decided to take the one thing that matters most to a human being, their self-worth, and attach it to something they don't fully have control over in order to push them to achieve something against their will. Now doesn't that ring a bell?

The reason it's so hard for me to accept myself for who I am is because some part of me still believes that this emotional manipulation is necessary for happiness. That without completing university on time and getting a certain job, I won't be able to be happy. And the only way to get those things is to not allow myself to feel content until I've reached it. But when I think about the evidence from my past, that plan has always failed. Even if you were to assume that getting that job would make me happy, feeling like a worthless human being is a great way to get me to distract myself constantly to avoid those negative emotions. The times I was most motivated to be productive was when my emotions were in line with the task.

When I think about how I treat my friends or how I will treat my future kids, I am convinced that unconditional love and support is more effective than this form of emotional manipulation. But I am now realizing that it will take some time to convince that subconscious part of my mind of that and to learn to let go of the need to succeed. To accept myself for who I am, even if it means I will need to make some sacrifices.

An analogy I like to think about is being on a hike with a friend. You're trying to reach the summit to see a beautiful view of the surroundings. If a friend of mine was struggling to get up the mountain I wouldn't be judgmental, and disappointed in him for not being able to reach my expectations. I would accept that he's just not able to at this moment, and I'd say something like ""hey, it's alright, I really enjoyed hiking up here with you, if this is the most you can do we can go back down and try again another time"". I definitely wouldn't make him feel bad about not being able to get to the top, in order to push him to reach a reward I attached myself to. But when it comes to myself that's exactly what I do. I attach myself to a goal, then I set unrealistic expectations for myself, and then tank my self-worth when I can't achieve it.

So yeah, I hope this ressonated with some of you. Let's all try to be that supportive friend who loves and accepts you, and is willing to miss out on the view, if it means showing you that they love and accept you unconditionally.",InfamousKey6677,,False,1cw9vhf,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cw9vhf/i_finally_realized_why_i_cant_unconditionally/
"I can't get an erection because I'm worried that I can't get an erection, which then leads to not getting an erection. ",1716190149.0,"I'm 38 years old. When I'm by myself or with a long time partner, I have no issues getting a full and long lasting erection. But even when I was younger, I sometimes had problems getting an erection when it was the first time with a new partner. Only in the second or third night I was relaxed enough to make it work. Just with some partners it worked right away. 

The problem of sometimes not getting an erection got worse over time. And now it happens pretty much every time I try to have sex. I feel like I never had much anxiety when it came to sex. I don't have the highest self-esteem and I have anxiety when it comes to dating – but once someone entered my bed, I feel pretty confident and was never worried about my performance, and I'm relaxed enough to take it all not too serious. But now, there's always this thought in the back of my head that we might run into a problem when it comes to the erection. And the more often it happens, the stronger this thought becomes.

But it feels like the only reason why I can't get an erection nowadays is because I'm already worried that I can't get an erection, which then leads to not getting an erection.
When I have a date with someone I like, the thaught of meeting the person makes me really horny and hard. But once I'm making out with her, nothing moves at all in my pants.

It's really frustrating. Also for the partners, because they usually start thinking that I'm not into them.

I think i was SAed as a child,1716189477.0,"Sorry if some details are confusing i was a kid and have bad memory but also dont want anyone  i know to find this

When i was a kid i think i might have been SAed, im 15 now, and i think this took place when i was probably around 6-7 maybe older and the person who did it to me is my brother whos 8 years older than me, so he wouldve been 14/15 (he couldve been older). Hes my step brother technically and he had a bad life growing up with his biological dad and he experienced SA himself as a child before he moved in with us  when he was in 7th grade. This happened when i was young and have bad memory from a child so the details aren’t amazing but i remember at least three times when he would do this. When my parents werent home or my grandma who lives with us wasnt paying attention he would have me come into his room with an excuse then he would ask me if i could hug him cause he was sad or something and i would and he would sometimes kiss me but he would like touch my butt and have me close to his “downstairs area”. I also remember this one time he had me under the blanket with him and he like made out with me but i only remember that one time he did that. It was mainly just him having me hug him and he would kiss me and touch me weirdly.

I cant and dont want to tell anyone about this irl. I have a semi good relationship with my brother now and this hasnt happened in years and i dont think he even remembers. Like i said he had childhood trauma himself and some of these times he would do it after getting in trouble and i think that might be why. This has been weighing on me a lot recently and i dont have anyone to tell if this could be considered sa i think i forgive hi, he is a good brother he does some bad things but i love him.

"Weird behaviour after experiencing trauma, please help",1716187524.0,"Past year I've lost two very close family members, one of them being my parent. The second death occurred in summer and when I reflect I see that my behaviour afterwards was very strange and prevented me from day to day life.

At some point I started overfocusing on my voice. I started recording conversations with other people cause I thought there was something wrong with my voice and I tried fixing it accordingly by speaking unnaturally quiet and deep. I still hated my voice even after that, so I refocused on something else.

I started filtering what I was saying, decided I would never say anything filler-like which resulted in my behaviour once again being unnatural. I don't speak a lot, people tell me to talk more, so now I spoke even less, I am also not very expressive, so this made me sound like a robot.

I woke up from these behavioural patterns after the summer holidays ended and I had to return to normal task-filled life, I messed this up by neglecting my sleep and drinking higher doses of caffeine which resulted in my anxiety going over the roof to the point where I could barely function. I cut caffeine and started sleeping better after months, so I did fix that and now I am alright, my discomfort was caused by these two factors which I understand, but I don't get why I behaved the way I did during summer.

Apart from that I had some strange ideas/thought patterns even pre summer, after the first death happened. Is this common? What exactly was happening with me?

Do bullies even take accountability?,1716187461.0,"XD Hi, my mind took me back to primary school again because I met one of the popular girls that bullied me. She just told me hi so casually xD

My ex helped me by telling me that I actually was not the ugly monster and was actually beautiful judging from my old photos and maybe they felt jealous. 🤣 I agree I was not ugly but maybe he wanted to flatter me with that.
I think the reason I was bullied ever since kindergarten was that I had undiagnosed autism and ADHD, I was the "" daydreaming kid"" and they, the * normal kids*  kinda sensed it and wanted to eliminate me. That's what even chicken do when there's a new one of a different colour...

We came home, he said take meds and that's it. He got busy on his phone.

I can take u to a hospital. I felt deeply sad.

Was i wrong? Was i expecting too much?

4. I told him I can't be with a man who is unkind, disrespectful and has zero empathy. To which he said you won't get a better guy than me now (hinting I am 36 and won't get a good guy he is 32) I said even u won't get a better girl than me to which he said ya of u to say so. How cocky can one be?

Symptoms of seasonal depression or something else? Also potential moving questions,1716183697.0,"I live in Colorado near Denver. I feel like I have a clearer head this Spring than I’ve had in Fall especially and a little in Winter too. Although we’re approaching the warmer months of Summer and I have grown to hate summer now too. I don’t put up with the heat as well as I did as a kid. I have been able to put up with the cold better than I used to though than when I was a kid, but that could be a variety of things I suspect are not necessarily related to mental health but I’m not certain (would be happy to explain further). I have also been to Florida when it’s Summer though and I notice I can get lethargic and my brain doesn’t work as well with the heat. It has been some time though since I’ve been to Florida in the summer so I can’t guarantee this statement is still true.

 I’m wondering if I would do better if I lived in a different climate? I like being outdoors but sometimes Colorado’s sun feels so stark. Plus it can be very suburban where I live and I’m indoors a lot so I don’t experience a lot of nature. I like green grasses and the occasional rain but not perpetually foggy weather. I don’t like how dry Colorado can feel and therefore don’t know if I would do well in Arizona?

Anyways I do feel like the bulk of my movement happens in Spring and then the rest of the year I’m just miserable. I think I can feel more miserable in the summer because it’s so nice out and I’m just wasting away in this house.

I was harming myself from 12 years old to 16 or 17; I was hospitalized for the last time of 4 (for mental reasons) at 16 or 17. I haven’t been mature or anything close to it. Maybe this it my mature awakening or something, because reviewing my life from a third person pov is depressing me. 

I started hurting myself around 12/13 because I couldn’t handle the feeling of being unloved (my mother had bought me a book- the second of a series that I had never read- and some clothes that didn’t fit me) and feeling like I couldn’t love my father- whom I hadn’t seen since the beginning of my memories- that same Christmas. I just didn’t believe that I belonged in my family or even alive. 

Eventually my mom and I got bad enough that I decided to live with my dad at 14, because she decided she didn’t want to deal with me that summer. while he was stricter, he showed me the truth of the world and was trying to prepare me for adulthood the best way he knew. My mother had no such inclinations. 

I smoked my first blunt at 14 years old, and ended up SA’d by that guy. I started smoking both weed and cigarettes with my mom at 15, after she tricked me into staying with her under the guise of a summer trip, because “my dad did a horrible job looking after me”. 

She got injured the year after, and diagnosed with stage 4 cancer later that year, and as her only daughter and oldest child, I was the first person in line for all of the caretaking chores: making her, my little brother’s and my blind grandmothers food, helping her to and from the bathroom, and everything in between.

Eventually she cut me off from weed, which led  me to letting the local high school drug dealer basically sa me because I was hooked on what he was providing me. 

I failed out of college my first year, as mom was going through cancer treatments and all I wanted to do was party, so once i got that letter I decided that moving to the other side of the country with her was the best thing to do. Miami is crazy. Crazy expensive, crazy people. 

I lost my first “good” job because my car broke down and they refused to let me go an hour early for my birthday, and I left anyway. The 2-3 months I was unemployed threw my budget, so I couldn’t get registration or keep insurance. I lost the second because I slept with a coworker. I then got into a relationship with an asshole who insisted on keeping me as a housewife/sex slave, and plied me with alcohol to keep me with him. 

Which leads to now: I have slept with a married person who just had his fourth kid, have damn near lost my newest job from being a prideful cunt, and have no money to spend on my upcoming 22nd birthday (May 31) because I came to Dallas to celebrate my grandmas 80th birthday. I lost my car because I decided to drive to the store for cigarettes snd alcohol after being placed on a no drive order from the state of Florida for non compliance. 

Everything seems to be going downhill, and I’m sick of it. Some people have told me that all I need is to get back into religion, some that I just need to get away from my family in general. I am a shit person trying to do better. 

TLDR: I’ve been a bad student, a bad sister-daughter-family member, a slut, SAd and arrested, and I don’t know how much longer I can hang on as I am; I’m gonna end up cutting all the ropes to my own bridge, and I’m scared.

I don't know what's wrong with me.,1716181923.0,"Recently I've been noticing a common trend with how I interact with people and it's concerned me for a while now. This is more of an incoherent ramble so I don't expect anyone to really read all of this.

For some background, the vast majority of my life I've been unable to talk to people face to face, sometimes even people I've known for years. Most interactions I've had I speak softly and if put on the spot stutter and forget what I was going to say. I often have to plan out my entire conversations with people just in order to have some kind of intelligible discussion. After I have these interactions I think about how the person I just spoke to might have thought about how awkward I was, and how I probably sound like I don't know what I'm talking about.

I really see this at work. See I'm a paralegal, and I work for the U.S. Army JAG Corps, so I interact with people that lead thousands of people. I have to brief these people on legal matters regarding their Soldiers while also remembering several army regulations and written orders. Not only that but I often brief battalion command teams on the status of their entire battalion's legal actions all at the same time in person. It's so stressful that in order to make it through my typical day I smoke anywhere from 3-6 cigars. That seems to be the only way to keep my hands from shaking, and even then I still stutter and mess up what I'm going to say.

I'm concerned for my health, I know smoking is horrible for your body and I don't want to smoke but I feel like I have to just to feel normal around people. The worst part is when people around me start talking about how bad it smells but refuse to tell me that I'm the one who stinks because of my smoking habits. Here lately, for the past month or so, I've felt so lethargic and out of energy that my physical training has declined and I've even been asked if I was okay by several people. I feel lethargic yet at night, when I'm tired and miserable, I can't sleep at all. I stay up alone in my dark room, laying in bed, thinking of all the things I did wrong through the day.

And now comes the newest, most concerning portion of this issue; I feel like the conversations I've had with people recently have been very robotic and disingenuous. Like even with my family, I feel like they're just checking the boxes to see that I'm alive. I called my mom and she was just silent unless I spoke to her, when I went out to eat the waitress felt awkward, and it just seems like I'm not real anymore. I know that's insane to even think, but that's how it felt to me.

It's already midnight and I always wake up at 3 am in order to workout for my job, so I know I'm going to have yet another long day at work where nothing gets accomplished and I sound and look like a fool. I don't know if anyone will see or respond to this, I don't know what anyone would even say tbh, and I'm also not entirely sure I want people to see this. I just have this feeling that if I don't say this now I'm just going to avoid talking about it later. Like I could go to therapy for free through my employer but I choose not to because the face to face interaction makes me not want to say anything at all. I've even tried therapy, I had to wear a facemask to cover my awkward smile and I almost cried just saying the two or three sentences I said before I left. 

Anyways if you want more details I'm not actually that shy about talking online (for better or worse) so feel free to ask questions I guess. Just know that this has been ongoing since I was a kid, so none of this is new and I have tried a lot of self help which ultimately was pointless.

I’ve completely forgotten how to comfort after a toxic relationship ended ,1716181230.0,"About 3 years ago, a toxic relationship for I had been in for two and a half years ended, after the breakup we remained friends and still are, it was toxic on both sides since we were both mentally ill teens and I don’t blame them for anything.

One specific thing that would happen repeatedly throughout the relationship was that whenever my partner was upset, I’d comfort them, only for my comfort to not only not work, but make it worse, way way way worse, no matter what I said or tried to do. There would be periods where they would get upset over something everyday and I’d comfort them, only to make them more upset. Having that go on for two years seriously messed up my ability to comfort someone, around the middle of our relationship a switch just kind of flipped inside of my head and I completely lost the ability to comfort, I was so scared to do it so nothing would come out of my mouth, whenever my partner was upset I’d just stare at them, literally not knowing what to do.

I don’t know why it happened, maybe it’s a kind of learned helplessness, having my help always make things worse just ended up shutting me down so much that I straight up can’t do it anymore, I don’t know what to say or do without an overwhelming fear being present, the only thing I can say without feeling like I’m going to panic is “sorry”.

After the relationship ended, this continued, and it has been for the past 3 years, I don’t know what to do when someone is upset and I just sit and stare at them like I did with my ex.

For clarification, my comfort when I still knew how to do it wasn’t bad, it worked well in the beginning of our relationship and it was a slow process of one time not working, and then it would not work more frequently, and it would escalate as their mental health got worse.

I don’t know what to do, therapy is currently not an option for me so I guess I’m just on here lol",splendidspaghetti,,False,1cw7lk1,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cw7lk1/ive_completely_forgotten_how_to_comfort_after_a/

Based on my previous experience with summer classes during college, I got burned out due to not having enough time to rest causing me to fail a class the next semester because my brain can't absorb anything anymore.

Is luck attributed to your own personal mental health,1716180077.0,"I ask this because I’ve noticed when I’m struggling with my mental health or I’m pushing myself past my limits. I receive no help or coincidental betterment. And I feel like this “Luck factor” has a lot to do with how I interact with people and how much I interact with people

I’ve went through 2 years with only online interaction with the outside world and I gained nothing I worked for nothing I achieved nothing  and at the end of it I asked my self if I got what I wanted or what I thought I deserved which in my case was friends people naturally wanting to socialize with me a new way to make money etc etc it didn’t come and I believe that it’s because I put no effort in

However in another instance this value of effort contradicts itself

A few years back my son was being made I was going to school 8hr per day  5x per week and then going to work 8-12 hours 5x per week and I was making time to do plasma donation and it got to a point where my mental health was awful and i would tell myself it’s ok to get going because if I quit my son won’t have a father that is actually able to be in his life because he doesn’t have enough money to provide and  I was also in abusive relationship so it ended up getting to a point where I didn’t have enough time to sleep and I would get less than 4 hours of sleep most nights with a 30 min nap sometime during the day then
I crashed my car
Then
I crashed my gf car
Then
My son was born and my mom kicked us out and we moved to California
And I just kept on rolling and rolling and rolling annnnnnnd ROLLLLLING with the punches

But towards the end aswell as throughout it 
I thought ya know I’m lucky to have a son to look forward to I’m lucky to even still have this job I’m lucky to have an option other than homeless
And that’s gratitude and I don’t really believe in luck but I do believe my is the thing that kept me alive

I has a serious thought but I ended up just venting and going on a rant I’m sorry yall

Leaving toxic family,1716179575.0,"Hey guys, long story short, just cut off all my family members and moving out of my moms house.

Growing up I got abused by them, they always apologize and say sorry, but than my sister sends the most toxic invalidating letter to my therapist. After reading that I knew my stance. They were supportive in some aspects, like money, financial support for school, and they use that and think thats why I should talk to them.

There were moments where they showed deep, incredible support, but overall feel like it isnt worth the negatives

Morever my Indian mom always says ""its a family so you have to talk to us"" which is crazy bs. I cut all ties, argued with my brother, he ended up insulting me, i insulted him back and he cried, than they point fingers at me and ask ""how can you be so cruel"". They do this after barging into my room and forcing me to talk to them when I was minding my own business and not bothering them, they try to make you the victim. They are so mad that they even say my therapist is a horrible therapist since I dont talk to them, meanwhile my therapist helped me so much.

I decided to work a minimum wage job, move out into a cheaper apartment with roomates, and grind and support myself until I get my dream job, and after that will just build the life I want with my own career and hobbies. Im super happy im 25 and have this realization fo their toxic nature.

How can I find a way out?,1716176835.0,"I’m lost in a world that doesn’t exist anymore. Let me give a little context on this.

I’m from southern part of India (29 M) had a not normal childhood and my family isn’t exactly what one would call normal, it was great until one point but when I was around 13-14 my parents joined a religious group (not a cult) but were so much invested in that they forced me and my brother to follow their ideology and the path as a family, the time me and my brother realised that the path wasn’t for us it started a turmoil in the family causing lot of arguments and situations are still the same. My parents wanted me and my brother to stop our education and join the religious community, after a struggle and lot of arguing we opted out of that. It was at that time I met my love of my life, she was such a wonderful person. That was my chance to have my own family, feel like home. After we graduated I joined in the same company she was placed in our final year so I could be with her (not insecure but just wanted to be with her) we had our ups and downs like usual relationships but I was determined to always make things work and so did she I thought, I think she kept all the downs at one place and one day after ~8yrs into our relationship she decided to call it quits. I couldn’t accept that, wanted to fight for her and make her see the ups too, it was the time of Covid initial stages where the world stopped moving. All I could do was talk or chat but couldn’t meet, she stopped listening, even blocked me everywhere, after a lot of struggle got her to talk but only to know that she has already moved on within a few days, some guy who was able to be there in the time. After what felt like a world-ending struggle she managed to break every contact with me. She wasn’t to be blamed even I didn’t want to be with myself I was just glad that someone wanted to, just wished it would last longer.

I was heartbroken, devastated, depressed so much that I couldn’t even imagine living anymore. After contant support from my brother and friends I joined therapy but it didn’t feel like it helped. It’s been 4 years since she ever spoke to me, she moved to a different country for masters. I haven’t been able to regain my will to live, I’m not going to kill myself and cause pain to my brother or my friends. I tried many things to move on, therapy didn’t help much, tried dating apps, dated a woman for a while but couldn’t really connect with her, gave therapy one more shot didn’t work out, took a long vacation solo and with friends but everything still feels like it’s still happening. I look at my phone hoping every notification was a text from a person who probably doesn’t even think about me. I look into the crowds hoping to find a known silhouette. I don’t know how to get myself out. I don’t know how to stop looking for my home which doesn’t exist anymore.

I don’t feel like asking for help from anyone anymore, my brother or my friends. I’ve imposed myself enough and don’t feel like disturbing their lives for my own. I just want to sleep one night peacefully. I want to feel alive again. Smile without having to force it for the sake of people around me. I don’t know what to do.

Manipulated?,1716179215.0,"So me and my bestf had been close for the last 5 years. Two years back I fell in love w him and I didn't regret any of that until yesterday. 
It was like we never dated but we liked eachother initially but he fell outta that and I didn't know when I was alone in this and he was in it only for fun or like you call it FWB. It was one sided after that. He took lust for love. 
When I confessed to him finally he says it had always been a fwb, what you talking about? Like WHAT? He claims that he said it at the start but I don't remember. And am pretty sure he didn't say that because I have always hated the idea of fwb. 
Anyway we jus remained friends and didn't date but he would touch me every now and then and I would let him because I didn't wanna lose him and wanted to be close to him. I regret that. Not sticking to my values.
Everytime I got pissed at him and tried to talk, he would give some reason trying to justify himself and they would be so believable that u couldn't say no and would look stupid infronta him. I always apologized. 
He would always come by when he wanted something and the next day I could feel him getting distant. All I said was communicate if you want space from me or you don't wanna talk so that am not left overthinking that omg he hates me, did I do something wrong? He said how am I supposed to communicate that when I don't wanna talk. Me pushing you away speaks for itself. It's always actions over words. Can't you see? 
He says I always need to be told everything like a kid and I don't understand anything. It hurt. Am I asking the wrong thing? If I don't wanna be pushed away like that? 
When another dude came along who was treating me right, he got mad at me and says low-key I was falling for you but you did that. You play with dudes. I don't know anymore am done. I thought we were exclusive like that but you go and talk to him and flirt w him. I immediately blocked that other dude. I did what I did by my choice, I don't regret it? Did he somehow manipulate me there? Is that manipulating? 
We in a group where everyone adores him. He is like perfect to them. They call him such a gentlemen, they most nice and charming person they have met. If I try to say what he did they say rethink and put back efforts again. Don't stop talking to him. He nice. I keep running back to him. 
I feel scared that omg they calling him sucha gentlemen, what if I lose him? He seems so perfect, what if I lose him? There are so many reasons to hate him and I've tried, but none makes sense. If all of us in a group sit and try to point out one toxic trait or weakness of his, we can't. 
He calls himself stoic. Says that's why he doesn't care when his best friend who has done what not for him left him and went. Because he never processes emotions, he says stop whining or thinking and solve the problem. While I need to process my emotions and then pick myself up.
He makes me feel so stupid but I can't let go of him? I did yesterday when I blocked him because he started flirting with my best friend. 
Yet somewhere deep down I keep hoping for him to come back or I don't know. 
I feel did I do the wrong thing? Was I harsh with him? Did I overreact when I said get the fuck out and he said I didn't flirt with your bestf. She sent me the texts where he is calling her his cute lil bear, mi amor and what not. He says that's not flirting?

Conflicts about Adult Children/Parent Roles,1716178084.0,"Hi all! I recently got in a conflict with my mom about whether adult children have obligations to their parents. For context, my mom is planning an upcoming trip and asked over the phone if I could do research for her on it. I told her I didn’t want to do it, given that I had already had a stressful work day and didn’t feel that I could do more computer work, but would try to make suggestions for websites to look at. However, my mom was super upset that I didn’t want to do the specific thing she asked, and she hung up on me. 

Tonight, my mom texted me saying she was still hurt by the discussion. She noted that she had to do things she did not enjoy as my mother, and that she believes love is sacrifice. But I do not feel that she is being very considerate of where I was coming from in that moment. And I feel that she tried to guilt trip me into doing something for her by holding her birthing me over me when I did try to still help her. To me, relationships are unhealthy when someone holds non-consensual obligations over you. Since this initial discussion, I still believe that I need to hold firm about needing to protect my boundaries and my piece, even with loved ones. I did tell my mom I would try to think of other ways to actively affirm my love in the future if she feels that she needs that, but that these actions would be on my terms.

At the time, I had been sent away to a resident hospital, for 6 months, I missed out on getting the chance to have any lasting friendships with people mentally sound, and after getting back I decided, Enough  
I got a job, was more extroverted, Had the OPTION of having friendships, for 2 months, I went to high school, this was in 12th grade, It was the time when homecoming was coming up, the therapist/ program who I had been forced to see at the time.. by fam, ( or else be homel;ess) kept saying she was worried, She was the kind of therapist who didnt listen to me, what I felt or anything I said, when we met, I tended to just stay qiuet until the time was over,   
I was Doing Fine, I had been asked by quite a few girls in school, (whom I didnt even know btw) to go to homecoming, It felt nice to have a social circle, I Had friendships, people whom I was getting closer with,  I said ""I was fine, I dont need to go to a hosptial"" It was nice to have an aspect of my life, not ruined by fam, or anything else  
 no self harm, wasnt suicdal, But the week before homecoming, she shows up, with Cops, and forces me to hospital, I tried saying no, but not only did they not listen, They did THE ONE FUCKING THING that worsened my PTSD, the excuse they did, was that I been to a lot of hosptials before, So I should stay at this one this time, and Have doctors do more shit  
Man it was hard to come back, learn that my date thought I stood her up because I couldnt call her while stuck there  
For a week I was stuck there, missed my homecoming,, and just stopped going to school entirely, I missed auditions for the plays the drama club was putting on, my homecoming, and it damaged my social reputation  
After stopping school. I soon after quit working, because It was hard to fear everyday, the thought of her showing up at my work, with more cops, and FORCING me into another hospital, It  was too horrifying, the fear of everyone around, would WATCH me go back, when I didnt even need too, was too much  
For MONTHS I LAID in bed, not doing anything, barely eating, staring at the ceiling, This BITCH did nothing. didnt send me back to another hospital, after deciding I didnt want to spend more time like that, I tried job hunting, Unfortuantely, I had to get a ride from fam, and after that interview at a potential job t his bitch shows up a few days after and forces me back to one, (Family mentioned the job hunting probably and whatever was a convient reason to send me back), this didnt just happen with jobs, I didnt even get to maintain irl friends, bc I couldnt even see them, I wasnt Able to get a learners or even a liscence, bc I kept trying to get a ride from family, only to be yelled at, told how incovient it was, or have the cops called because fam couldnt win the argument (yes Just because i wanted to live my life) and the threat of being kicked out or sent to another hospital  
This happened repeatedly, every time I tried bettering my life or escaping, I was railroaded back into hospital after hostiapl. Ive been to 14 at this point  
  Every night I have nightmares still, every day I have to try to get out of the memoris, Its HARD  
It was Hard to watch everyone else go to my homecoming, It was hard to miss my prom, Its Hard, to see everyone else have what I want, Its hard to watch any friendships die because If I tried to get out, everything was Purposefully made worse  
I moved to a decent apartment Now  
previous apratment was in the hood, No hood now, No gunshots every night ,No more violent roommates, Its right next to a college  
I work at pizza hut, I I comeback, to my empty apartment, log onto my pc, play games, go to the gym, and go to sleep, I still cant even drive, I walk 2 miles to work, and 2 miles back, even If I could, no car, No friends, and the small bit of social interaction I have is at the gym or work,  
I missed out on the option to have lasting friendships, I wont get my homecoming dance, the memories of having my 20s,   
Anything else Everyone else had, I wont get, Im just starting my life, And now its so damn behind  
I am NOT suidical, but honestly, it feels pointless now  
Im tired, im so far behind everyone else, solely because someone made the decisions for my life, and abused me when I Tried to live,   
Its hard sometime, to not just OD on bleach and then go swim in the pool  
The funny thing is, My dad constantly cries about it, saying shit like, i have no idea how hard it was, for hm to make the choice to ""help"" me,  
It wouldve been better to do NOTHING, than to worsen my life to this point  
, I want to go to college, but honestly it feels too late, I want to pursue a bachelors.....  
I have a GED and dont want to spend more time at a cc, college is mainly for the social aspect, but Im 25 , so even If I  got into a college it would be hard to not feel out of place

I want to to end everything, I am tired of life being unreasonably hard, I am tired of having a detriment because, getting up everyday to an empty apartment, no irl friends, nothing to look forward to, exept the hope of a dim future keeping me going, more time trying to catch up because Im so far behind, not getting to live, No chance to make dumb decisions, having to watch everyone around me have a life, have freedom

Instead, I just keep slapping myself in the face and flicking myself with a hair tie until my whole forearm is bruised. I always think about being either blind, deaf, or even both. I always say I’m going to kill myself.

The environment is ruining my health,1716178583.0,"Two years ago I was living with my parents and it was Hell. If you want details scroll through my post history. I was miserable there, self harming, anxiety, depression, had physical health problems like not being able to grip things with my hands, dropping things a lot, and every single joint in my body HURT. I was afraid it was long COVID, rheumatoid arthritis, something crippling and incurable.

Then I went to a group home and the self harming stopped immediately- not even triggered- and within a week the joint pain was gone, no more dropping things all the time, etc. This was supposed to be a transitional group home but I stayed there for nearly two years because of a lack of other places to go. Had a few ups and downs but was mostly well, would drop things when stressed out but that was about it. Unfortunately I could not stay there forever and had to go.

So I went to another group home, been here almost two weeks, and it's hell. Not as bad as when I was with my parents but barely a step up from there. This place doesn't have to be this bad, but they make it bad.

I have reactive hypoglycemia,  (spoiler tagged just because I spent 4 paragraphs about the food)>!I was diagnosed about 3 years ago and it explains a lot about my weird relationship with food, how I'd get moody and ravenously hungry despite eating if I ate too much sugar/carbs. This isn't just 'in my head' or soemthing trendy to latch onto, I have bloodwork to prove this diagnosis, my endocrinologist changed my life teaching me how to live with this condition. It's basically go low-carb, avoid sugar, eat whole grains and have plenty of protein. This would have been in my application to live here about dietary needs. The first night here diner was a sandwich on white bread- I asked if they have whole wheat because I'm not supposed to eat white bread because of the reactive hypoglycemia. !<

>!""no""!<

>!This place is obsessed with white bread. Today breakfast was egg, cheese and sausage sandwiched on white bread toast. Lunch was lasagna with buttered white bread on the side. Dinner is always a sandwich on white bread. One day I forget what we had for lunch, i think american chop suey, and it came with a slice of white bread cut in half wrapped in wax paper- just a slice of naked white bread for the hell of it. I've been discarding the bread and eating what is in the sandwich on its own because they refuse to get wheat bread. !<

>!Some mornings breakfast is cereal. Sugary cereal. One morning it was Capn Crunch. I'm better off not eating at all than that stuff on an empty stomach. !<

I've calculated what they feed us in a day and it doesn't meet the minimum requirement for protein for adults. It's like a cult level of protein deficiency. My insurance gets me protein shakes (only covers one a day) and with that I'm still not getting the minimum. I don't have any income but i was able to buy a jar of peanut butter. I think everyone else here is protein deficient. All they do all day is either lay in bed watching TV, sit around staring blankly, or smoke outside. I never see anyone playing any kind of game, reading or anything that requires thinking.

(spoiler long details on how disgusting it is here)>!Supposedly a housekeeper comes in once a week but I see no signs of it. The shower-tub has not been cleaned since i got here and looks like it has not been cleaned in months. It's disgusting. The other shower, a stand up shower, is not much better. It's a ""zero-entry"" or curbless shower, basically the shower floor is part of the entire bathroom floor. A zero-entry shower isn't a bad thing except for how the shower drain is so clogged that the shower water backs up all over the bathroom floor. I told them that the drain is clogged ""That's because people shove their hair down the drain"" - they aren't going to fix it, they're just going to let it continue on like this. Periodically cleaning the hair trap of a drain is basic maintenance.!<

>! The other day they had to replace some ceiling tiles. Chunks of ceiling tiles and plaster dust was left in the hall for hours. They couldn't be arsed to sweep it, pretended to not see it while they played with their phones at desk next to the bits of ceiling tile and residents walked through it tracking it all over the house and their bedrooms.!<

Keeping clean is an important part of self care, not showering is a fast way to become depressed and destroy motivation to go out or do anything. I've noticed that a lot of people no longer bother to keep up with basic hygiene, and with how this place makes showering so difficult and unattractive i don't blame them.

Feeling lost in life,1716175175.0,"Okay, so this is probably going to be long, please stay with me. 
So, fresh out of high school i fell head over heels for this guy. He was older, i was 19 & he was 24. We had so much in common, so much shared love & passion and hobbies. It was an incredible feeling. We did everything together for a year on and off. We never were officially anything, just best friends who were enjoying life. We ended up going our separate ways, he was recently divorced & he was hanging out with other girls. I knew he wasnt good for me anymore.  i found a new guy & he found a new girl. I always kept searching for that love that we had. It was so passionate. It literally brought life into me. 
Me & a guy from school ended up dating for almost a year and I became pregnant. 
It broke me at the time. I was in college & was not expecting it. 
During my pregnancy, it was so much. I caught him constantly watching porn, buying only fans ect. It broke me. As a new mother & being 20yo, i just never could understand it. He eventually quit, and our child is 3 now. We are still together. I love my child, he brings so much happiness to me. 
But, i am numb. I am constantly wanting the love i had before. I want passion. I want more. I want physical, mental love. So much more than i have. Ive tried to talk to him about what he can do for me. Mentally, sexually, & physically. He does it for a day or so then back to the same old stuff. Im not sexually attracted to him anymore, because i have no emotions toward him. We are just parents who live together. 
I just feel very lost in life. I find myself constantly daydreaming of this love i had before. 
I am 23yo, a successful business owner. I have an amazing child who is incredibly smart. I have so much to be thankful for but i cannot seem to get over this. Its been almost 4 years & i still yearn for the love i had before. 
Is this normal? Is there anything i can do to heal me & my childs fathers love? I feel like i have so much life ahead of me & i do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling like this.

"Can believing I have a problem, create a problem in my life?",1716177924.0,"Asking for opinions on whether believing you have problems, can literally cause the problems to exist in your life?

For example, I have many negative beliefs that I’ve obtained since graduating college in 2021 such as: I’ve become slow-witted, have nothing to talk about, have poor memory and recall, and have become bad at describing events from my life/past, etc.

I find myself attributing these beliefs to:
1.) concussions in football growing up
2.) moderate marijuana use, mild psychedelic use, moderate alcohol use in high school
3.) moderate (for a frat guy) alcohol use and mild cocaine use in college
4.) 7 years of SSRI use (drank alcohol on them frequently)

Could my extremely firm-held belief that the above points cause my current mental problems, possibly make these “problems” become real in my life? Like maybe I’m so convinced that I’ve damaged my brain, that I now actually have problems? Maybe if I just delete the belief that I’m damaged, then I will find I’m actually fine?

Or can anyone at least relate to my dilemma? I’d love to hear what some ppl have to think about this. And for additional info, I haven’t done drugs since 2019, have been off SSRIs for 3 months now, and drink nearly every weekend with friends. No drugs, and no alcohol during the week.

Proof it gets better.,1716174402.0,"For the last decade+, my (29m) baseline was:

6/10: anxiety (±2)
5/10: depression (±4)
7/10: stress (±3)

There were periods where one or more of these were higher or lower, but these were the averages and I never hit 0 on any of these.

Last fall, my anxiety went to an 9, depression was a 7, and stress was a 10 through to January. 

From January to February, I was at a solid 10+ across the board, with daily panic/anxiety attacks, inability to take care of myself, intense feelings of hopelessness, sleep was atrocious, non-stop heartburn, binge eating, and my pulse was never under 100.

I couldn't take it anymore.

I quit my job and moved thousands of miles to be back home. I now have my support system back, a job I love, and am making solid progress on fixing my financial situation.

Since then, I've noticed that I feel so much happier, more relaxed, and at peace generally than anytime in the last 10 years. I've been able to diet and start losing weight. I'm sleeping dramatically better; not taking any anxiolytics, antidepressants, or other medications; and socializing significantly more.

My baselines are now:

1/10: anxiety
2/10: stress
2/10: depression

I still have a little bit of healthy stress and anxiety every now and then, get down on myself and wish certain things were different. But this is probably the first time in my adult life where I've felt like I can relax and breathe. I actually feel good about where I'm at, what I'm doing, and my future.

is there any psychological reason for this? i didn't grow up with alcoholic or drug addict parents or family members, and again i have no traumatic events in my life connected to this. even if i'm repressing something, while my family isn't insanely strict, they are still hardcore christians and there's no point in my life where i'd ever be exposed to those things in an unsafe matter, so there's nothing to repress. any ideas?",Embarrassed_Flow_104,,False,1cw5jm7,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cw5jm7/why_does_being_around_people_that_are_under_the/

I know there are no right words, right time to break up with someone and of course I am putting it off and in doing so it is worse for him and me. but it is a 6 year relationship and he struggles with depression and has these meltdowns often where he feels like he is stuck in his life and multiple issues with his parents and for as long as I can remember we have always struggled with communication issues. At first I was very concerned for him when he had these crises and really tried to be there for him and support him as much as I could but 3 years ago I started to feel tired and even upset when these crises would happen.  Sometimes he would wake up saying he ""felt bad"" and when I would ask him how I could help him he would just say he didn't know and I understand that part, I figured it must be hard for him to even explain. I tried sometimes to distract him with activities or sometimes I would ask him if he wanted to talk about something specific or keep him company but each time I felt it wasn't enough. I still feel like I'm not doing enough and every time he tells me he feels bad I get this feeling of annoyance and the first thing that goes through my mind is ""here we go again"" and I hate myself for it, I feel guilty and selfish and like a terrible person because I feel like I should be supporting him because I'm his partner and how could I not? but I can't help but have these feelings of guilt and sadness that I can't help him and at the same time feel tired.

Violent thoughts due to mom being sa'd,1716170402.0,"Hey guys.
I'm gonna try and keep it pretty brief but basically my mom has been sexually assaulted by 2 people in her life, very brutal instances to be clear.
One of the people who did this to her is gone, the other is still walking around.

As a son,
I basically can't go more than a couple days without having rage filled thoughts of doing extremely violent things to this guy and i basically end up going into this spiral of just imagining murdering him over and over again in different ways, maiming him in an extremely violent manner etc. 
It's extremely taxing and it keeps me up at night sometimes, it can turn a good day into a bad day and it can rob me of sleep.

I have been boxing for many years and it takes off the edge a little bit but it doesn't solve the issue, i have a GF, i have good friends and i take care of my health so i'm okay on general aspects of life (i wanted to clarify since having a lack of these can cause depression etc). 
I'm afraid of talking to a therapist since it involves these kinds of thoughts and i'm certain i wouldn't kill the guy. Break some bones? Most definitely, which i think is a natural reaction but i wouldn't kill him.

I also wanna clarify that i'm a very chill person in general, i don't engage in street fights etc and i'm not inclined to get angry over stuff at all, it's just this one thing that lights my brain on fire.

My experiences with therapists have been quite bad so i'm not confident going there anymore, i feel like it's difficult to find someone who can understand my issue and who can help me solve it.

I'm just enraged this happened to her and i'm at a loss of how i can get rid of this anger, literally typing this out right now since i'm restless in bed thinking about crushing his head between a door for the last 45 minutes.

Not Feeling Like Eating? ,1716170346.0,"So in the past couple months I've noticed that I gradually ate less and less. Normally since I'm (16M) basically a hermit in highschool and all I do on the weekends is sit inside and play videogames after I do my homework, I would not eat as much. But lately I've noticed that I just don't feel like eating and I don't have the stomach to eat anymore. I'd wake up and skip breakfast and when I get really really hungry, I'd only eat until I don't feel hungry and not when I'm full. It's gotten to the point where I'm used to the feeling of being hungry and during the weekdays I'd only eat lunch and dinner and on the weekends I'd only eat dinner. If I try eating anymore than that ""not hungry"" point then I start feeling sick and nauseous and this worries me because I used to really like food and I don't know what changed.

Why am i so insecure,1716169912.0,"Hello reader,
I feel like there is something stuck inside me that i really want to talk to people about and try to understand, but i don't want to talk to people in my life about it in detail. Feel free to ignore this since it is basically just me venting. If anyone is interested in interacting with me about it that is completely fine too.

I am a 21 year old male. I live in the netherlands with my parents and my life is going in the right direction. I have adhd and i am autistic. I had a lot of struggles over the last couple years, but i have been working hard on trying to do better and feel better.

I have been very depressed for a long time and that is going way better to the point that i would say i am not feeling depressed 90 percent of the time. Sometimes these feelings still creep up on me and those moments are hard but it is going well. I was also a heavy drinker and i had some help with that but i could quit drinken relatively easy. I had to stop drinking because i wanted therapy, but there they said i had to stop drinking since i drank a lot and it couls effect my mental health a lot. I quit the next day and i have been sober since that day (about 2 years ago now). I also used to do some drugs (speed, xtc, mdma, wheed, 2cb) but that was not a problem at all to stop doing.

Things were going okay and i got a girlfriend that i loved a lot. After a while i got into an autistic burnout. I couldn't leave my house without instantly getting panic attacks and feeling sick. This kept getting worse even though i tried my very best to do things. I tried going to the supermarket 2 times a week, but if i did that i had to rest for a few days and was barely able to do anything. I also tried to go to my girlfriends house 2 times a week, but she mostly came to my house. Then my gf broke up with me. She couldn't handle it anymore that we were never able to go out and i completely understand that, but it hurt a lot. It made me think in the depressed mindset again that everyone will always leave me and i got a bit worse. Then my grandfather died and he meant a lot to me so it hurt very much. It was expected for a while now and i am grateful for the time i had with him, but i almost didn't go to the funeral since i was so afraid for panic attacks. I went anyway and that took a lot but it went okay. I think the funeral was scary because it would also make me confront the reality that he is gone and that is exactly what happened but it was good.

After that i realised that it could not go on like this so i just had to get out. I still felt like i had no future and that everyday was gonna be like this for the rest of my life. But that is also going way better.  Right now i go to a place where they try to help me get back into the ryrhm of life basically. I go there 3 times a week now for 3 hours per day (we started with 2 times per week 1 hour per day). I can be creative there and they are very respectful and understanding. I think it is helping me a lot, but since i can think a bit more clearly and rational right now i tend to look at my self to see what i can improve.

One very big and annoying thing for me is that i get very mad at someone if i feel like they don't take me seriously. It doesn't have to be the case but i feel for the tiniest bit that they think i am lying or that i don't know what i am saying i just feel very mad and angry. I know very well that that is a reaction from my ego and i understand that that comes from feeling insecure. But i do not know what i am insecure about. I don't tend to feel insecure, but i know that i have trouble with noticing and undertanding my own feelings. If i think about how deep i was and how far i have come, if i think about the skills i developed and the friends i made over the years, if i think about the things i have made and all of that i would probably say that i feel proud, but i don't really. Deep inside i don't feel proud. I still can't take a compliment to heart and i still probably feel insecure a lot. I just don't understand why.

Anyway that was my rant. Feel free to say anything or not it is all good anyway. And if you read everything, thank you for listening.

Why is loneliness & change/lack of identity SO painful? ,1716169301.0,"I dealt with an identity crisis in my early/mid 20s (like most of us) then finally get my feet underneath me but I’m now going through another. New city, new boyfriend, new house, new job (same field but still vastly different), I’m 28, and I am feeling that EXTREME pain of loneliness that is accompanied by not knowing your place in the world or feeling a strong sense of identity, placement and mattering. I have a good circle of people around me and I dont expect my boyfriend to understand all of my emotional workings but he is kind and compassionate and I do not like to dump all my shit onto people. He knows I’ve been struggling and understands to his best of his abilities (he’s lived in this town for 12 years with a very well established and happy life & circle). But his brain does work much differently than mine so he can only understand to an extent. I have also noticed in my life that romantic relationships tend to stir up these feelings in me which is alarming to me sometimes, no matter how much the person “gets” me. And in fact I don’t want my boyfriend to be my identity and I dont want him to “fix it” for me. Just want him to be there with kindness and love which he always is. 

I remember doing practices in my early 20s that was literally just writing down positive things I identiy with or would like to. But it’s absolutely gut wrenching painful sometimes.

 	I was am a sole from this point on. The moths of darkness just began a fetus in the woumb. Both mother and father have litle knolige of my existance my begening is heare hethy with nknone emosion untill I was sliced from my mother. My parents fell in love with me from the begening little did they know that tere was somthing wrong. It was not there falt I think that I loved them at that point to. I was dieing. My heart broken by imprefection that only flesh offers to the potentialy imortal relm of God placed soil named Earth. Spoler alert I servive otherwise you would not be reading this.
One day out of my life I fely horible sick beyond what the doctors had already fixed I was dieing still alive but dieing why they “forgot” ( neglected) to tell my parents that I have a paralised vocla chord is beond even my ant’s comprehencion and she is a sergical nerce. What made them fear my parents? What made them fear so much that they could not tell my perents what hppened? I ask these questions so often that I wonder why I servived. 
 That is when one day out of my life I felt amasing like God was truly there to witness me changing to somthing worth more than any dimond in the world. My parents kept me alive by questining the doctors did so little. My grandmother prayed so much I wonder how I survived.
One day of my life I felt horible Thank the lord that I was not dieing my great gradfather was putt to sleap in his grave I now have a feading tube one year old no birthday cake for me. I gess that there is where my life chages yet again. I wonder how I survived. 
One day out of my life I felt Exuberant I am two years old ,Birthday cake ;-) Yay, my first ever the tube is gone. My parrents still wotty but they realy don’t have to any more until laiter. Gram is there. So is most of my family. I love my gram so much at this point I would taher be at her houce than at home there is so much I still have to live for. 
One day out of my life I feal loved I am at home having fun with my gram telling her stories that I make up as I go along. She loves me I know it in my heart. There are not enugh words, colors, and sounds to describe what I felt in this world at that moment for my little mind to wrap its gentle fingers around I am less than five years old so the only resion that I remember is a home movie.

One day out of my life I am still five and going to kindergaden I love to run around and hide out undeneath the slides if only I knew what the world was than I probabley whould not have kissed a boy on the lips so soon. I shold have knone that such an act as this was for the day of prom or highscool. I was definatly not ready for being in love, nor was I ready to kiss boys impishly under the that particular Emitsberg Elimentery slide. The boy’s confusion was so great that I belive he ither liked me or he did not know who I was to tell the teacher what had happened.

Why did they chose to give me exta practice in my faverite subject the only problem I had was telling lowecace  B’s from lowercace D’s until a nice teacher taught me a trick  invalving the word bed. Putt your fingers on your left hand so that it resembles a lowecace B than have your fongers on your right hand resemble a lowercace D place coth hannds together and make a bed B.E.D. that was somthing that realy helped it was so ingraind in my nogin that after just that one clarifacaition I had the difrence betwean D and D down pat. I read Juny B. Jones boks up the wasoo after that and most of my class was reading picture books that where to easy so I stoped reading them. I didn’t check out books from the scool library because I had books at home to read if I remember corectly. My parents sau that it was the comprehensin part I gess that I understood the book’s meaning but not the questin of “ How did the caractar change throughout the story?” silly me I putt ( this is acording to my mother) “The carictar did nit change throuout the story.

I gess that if God dose laph that he might have been lafing at me and I would laph with him once I came to realise my childish ignerance at the age of seven and a half. I realy do not know why I relised that particalar fanticy was falce but I gess that visiters from the fith grade shook that idea right past my young lips and took me from that faticy I was somhow living in at the time. As I wright this I am sitiosly remided of that anoying yet cachy toon of the Caillou theme song whn it said “ Growing up is not so tuff…” I would like to add to that paticular snippit by saying that being or fealing grown up is the hard part.

I just thaught that God knows everything so he realy should no have to ask but I gess that even God has set rules for himself in promisess and fofilment of priofficy. The idea is that we have free will and he wants to ask and not tell us to be with him in spirit and in mannor.

What’s wrong with me?,1716167288.0,"apologies in advance. i just really need help. 29 F, was in therapy (4ish years on off total?) diagnosed social anxiety and on lexapro for a year-ish, weened off due to feeling like my anxiety was “removed” but i still didn’t feel right/ felt blank, stagnant, no sex drive whatsoever, ate a lot, didn’t care and didn’t work out

i’ve been off for about a year but i just feel so different. mentally paralyzed.  unable to make a change because ive tried in the past and they resulted in me failing. i constantly mourn who i should be but cant. as i get older i get so much more lonely and have no true closeness with anyone except my partner. 

i cannot workout anymore. when i do, i physically feel like i weigh 500 pounds and the amount of mental effort it takes me to get my shoes on is debilitating. im 15ish lbs over my goal weight, if that, and it feels like im 500 pounds overweight. during covid i ran 2-3 miles and lifted daily. i cant imagine doing that now 

almost everything feels like it takes enormous amounts of effort to do. cooking equates running a marathon. shower requires a pep talk. i am constantly questioning what the best order of things to do is to get optimal output of my actions. run washer first to get it going so it runs throughout the rest of my tasks, wash dogs bowls so they’re ready after his walk, make any dreaded, dreaded phone calls during dog walk so i dont have to be back in the house during dreaded phone call.. etc. constantly filling every minute with something to have “chill time” later which never comes. 

i cannot stick with anything longer than twice. i try different means of exercise and/ or hobbies , either fall in love with them and try them twice before stopping forever or i never get that loving feeling to begin with. 

i have no confidence. i used to be so smart and driven and now i just have no personality hobbies or interests. i have a shit job that makes me dumber by the day and gives me no drive. i have no friends of my own and am with a man who for some reason loves me to death, but has a trait of finding the good in everything to a fault. i.e. why i don’t deserve him and im confident everyone around us believe it as well. (everyone makes fun of him for liking terrible movies shows etc, this is an actual thing i make myself we wear a scarlet letter for? does that make sense?)

i have a horrible, horrible memory. i joke that i can watch the same movie, for the first time, ten times. i don’t remember anyone’s name or face. i don’t remember really anything about my childhood or teen years or 20s. i feel like im meeting everyone for the first time no matter how many times ive seen them.

when im at places with a lot of noise, i noticed a specifically at parties with my boyfriends friends or at restaurants, i CANNOT hear the person speaking to me. i hear every other sound and spoken word smashed together in a mush instead of being able to digest the person speaking to me. 

whenever i try to meditate or do anything that i find helps lessen my issues, i cant stick with it as long as i should. i give up on everything which gives me no confidence in myself

i exhaust myself just by thinking. i’m constantly constantly thinking. daydreaming a life i wish i was able to give myself , lots of dreading usually upcoming social events (they could be like 5 months out and im still filled with dread about them) im always “thought tornado-ing” as i call it

Is there  name for what I’m going through?,1716167172.0,"I began to notice that I’ve become unnaturally reclusive and it’s gotten way worse as i’ve gotten older. When I was a kid I preferred to spend most of my time by myself, but I did enjoy time with others. I never hated people, and wished the best for everyone. If it makes more sense I’m autistic and I was told that it was common to be an introvert as an autistic person. But ever since I graduated high school I became more solitary. I also grew out of most of the friends I’ve made in high school after I realized they weren’t healthy people to keep around. Afterward I made new friends and have gotten along pretty well with them. About a year ago I started to take everything down. Like, my artwork, my writing, everything. Even seeing myself in other people’s content made me want to throw up and send me into a breakdown. And it isn’t just online either, when my parents tried to point me in the direction of an art job I was sickened at the very idea of it. I couldn’t imagine seeing me anywhere and I frequently denied any opportunity that involved my creative work. It got to the point where I started to become more and more hidden, I barely put myself in situations where I’d be seen or under scrutiny. The thought of someone hearing my voice or referring to me is horrifying. Even in video games where I would see other people I would back out and go to more isolated areas. Though I don’t have issues speaking to strangers, if i have a reason I can walk up and have a good conversation with someone. The reason I’m making this post is because my friends think I’m becoming more avoidant. Recently I’ve stopped wanting to take calls, to hang out. Sometimes I have genuine reasons as to why I can’t. But other times I just feel out of energy. When I asked them what they think the issue is they say its probably depression or burnout. But this has been going on a long time and I don’t think a lot of it is regular depression symptoms. I really care about them and I don’t want them to think I don’t. Is there anything I can do or has anyone went though anything similar? ",SkinBalcony,,False,1cw3fl3,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cw3fl3/is_there_name_for_what_im_going_through/

It’s so hard to figure all this out when I’m a first generation college student. I went to orientation for the summer and they told me a lot I didn’t know which left me questioning If I should go to college. I’ve only ever know college as my future I have no backup plan. I have no job, or anything and I’m trying so hard to not stress financially but I can’t not stress it’s to overwhelming to me. I want to do nurse but I’ve been thinking of changing my major but idk. All this is so mentally draining and not knowing what my next steps are have made me more depressed cause most people already know what they’re doing and I have no clue anymore. I’ve only planned of going to college for the past 7yrs that’s the only thing I invisioned for myself.

22 in high school and struggling to finish it,1716165386.0,"Tl;dr: I'm feeling so guilty and tired of only failing at life 

Hello! I'm 22F, really scared to never make it in high school, don't know what work I wanna do, I have a vision but I don't know if it's possible. I used to be so focused and was ready to finish it, I was so smart and I had so much potential. After Covid started 4 years ago, I hated online school with passion, I like to be with other students in real life, seeing that they study makes me want to study and I understood that already in the first day of it, I made that year but It came crashing down after I basically started drinking every day, went to my job I had at the time either half drunk or hungover. When the school year started again I got to go to school again and I was so happy about it, also moved out of my home because of my obsessive and manipulative mother. I started drinking there again, I was so out of control and my feelings were all over the place. Because the online school started later on I failed the year, next year of school I had to go to a new class with people who were so entitled and full of themselves, I didn't feel like going to school and I failed again. A year after that I went to a new school, an Adult High School with high hopes, I was counting on tge fact that some of my friends are going to be there and we could do a group of studying but they chose online school instead. I was left alone again in school, the class was okay but I started drinking again, until the summer came up and I stopped and I failed it again. This year I've focused alot more on school but I feel like that I'm not gonna finish, though I'm still gonna try. The reason for that is that this year I've focused on what's going on in my head, mental health and not drinking.

How should I go about this?,1716160494.0,"I'm fairly certain this post doesn't go against the rules but if it does I will take it down.

So tomorrow I'm going to give my GP a letter asking for an ADHD referral and my mum knows this. However I also want to hand in a letter asking for a referral for social anxiety as I have been pretty certain I have it for many years and I really want to see if there's any way my life could be made easier with a diagnosis. The problem is I don't really want my mum to know. There is no reason I shouldn't tell my mum she's very understanding and wouldn't have a problem with it it's just my anxiety that makes me not want any attention and if I tell her ""hey I have social anxiety"" I'm gonna get a lot of attention and a lot of conversations about how I'm feeling which I am not prepared to deal with, even if I tell her to leave me alone I will know she's thinking about it. There's no reason I can't hand in this letter I am 18 it's literally just my anxiety holding me back. I'm not even entirely sure what I want out of getting this diagnosis as it would force me to talk to doctors about my feelings too and I might not even get anything to help me out of it. Even if I do hand in the letter it might be months or years before I get any kind of reply. Basically in my mind I have 3 options.

1. Hand in the letter without telling my mum and end up telling her later on when the doctor calls me back. (This will likely result in her thinking I hide important things from her.)
2. Tell her about my decision and hand in the letter. (Resulting in a lot of attention and conversations which will make my anxiety worse.)
3. Just don't give the doctor the letter and continue living my life filled with anxiety knowing there might be something that could help me.

So I know the objectively best decision is to tell her and hand in the letter but I'm hoping some people who read this will know what anxiety feels like and understand why it's so hard for me.

"I don’t know where to start. Medication, therapy, or general self-improvement?",1716157865.0,"Bit of background: 22M, dealt with anxiety and depression pretty much since I was a child old enough to understand my own thoughts and feelings. I’ve always been extremely self-aware of my own feelings, but they’re also difficult for me to control at times. Even when I was in elementary school, my mom would describe me as a “perfectionist” and didn’t understand why certain things were hard for me or why I was so emotional.

Growing up, in adolescence, I was bullied and made fun of, mainly because of my sexuality and my more feminine looking appearance. I was overweight as well and even my parents and family would point it out. I’m pretty insecure about my body and I don’t have a great self image physically or in general about my knowledge and abilities, which is something I’ve tried to improve in the way of growing out my facial hair and losing some weight. I still find myself doubting my attractiveness, both in general and to my preferred sex. I am told I am “handsome” by others but I feel like I’m not as I’d like to be, if that makes sense. I’m still a virgin, and I’ve never really been on a date or in a relationship, which also makes me feel behind socially and impacts my overall mindset, as well. I have “talking phases” but never really anything past that.

Now, due to some personal circumstances, I’m kinda at a point where I need to start making some general improvements to both my lifestyle and my health, before it impacts me negatively. The problem is, I’m kinda working with a limited budget. I don’t think I can afford both therapy AND psychiatric help (getting meds.) As well, while I’ve been trying to figure out how to improve myself physically, I also would like to start a diet plan if I plan on starting to work out, to supplement the calories I would be exerting.

Here’s the TLDR/question. In a general sense, would it be better for me to try to improve myself in my physical appearance and therefore try to feel more confident about myself to see if it improves the way I feel and think, or should I pursue therapy and/or medication in order to improve my headspace before I go about trying to build muscle or do other things to make myself feel more “masculine” and confident?",EtibEhtEtavele,,False,1cw09t0,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cw09t0/i_dont_know_where_to_start_medication_therapy_or/

Hello! I hope your doing great!,1716156152.0,"Hey!  
How was your day? Are you ok? Hope you're doing great.  
I just want to tell you, there's no reason to be so hard on yourself. Don't think about what other people are saying about you, everybody got their own problems/personality/struggles so it s normal to be a little bit different, that's what a person is.

If you feel like you are a little bit different, it's okay, that's what makes you unique, everyone's unique in their own way.

I'm also proud that you're doing your best, maybe some people won't agree with me but, you did your best and that's what it matters, if you think you can do better, do it, if not, don't force yourself.

If you don't feel loved, that's not true, there's always someone who's admiring you from afar afraid of approaching you, you're not alone in this world, everybody got someone, you just have to wait.

If you're sad that you don't have many friends, I'm 21(m) and I don't have many friends, but the friends I have are real friends. My advice it's to have some real friends rather than have 100 fakes ones.

"If Mental Health Awareness Month had a theme song, what would it be?",1716153379.0,"Let me preface this by explaining that I am a fan of this song which I found to be personally relevant to some mental struggles that I have been dealing with recently.

There's a song I discovered a few months ago, I believe it came out about a year ago, by a multi-talented Canadian musician called SonReal.  I had first come across his work while surfing internet rap videos and instantly added it to my regular playlist.  After a while I started looking into more of his work and came across this amazingly relevant (to me personally, if not nationally) song that was a stark contrast to the rap that I had been expecting.

Personally I have been struggling to stay strong when so many people close to me are going through traumatic events in their life.  This song really pulled at my heart strings and described what I was feeling in an almost déjà vu kind of way.  The song is called, ""Nobody's Happy All the Time"" and it expresses the way I often feel like I always have to be the strong one for those closest to me.  Despite going through my own inner struggles I always try to smile and encourage others to be strong.

With this being mental awareness health month (in America anyway) I thought I would like to share my experience of a song that is helping me (and my wife since I've shared it with her) through some tough times.

How do I deal with overprotective parents ,1716152010.0,"How do you go about dating if your over 21+ but you rely on parents for transportation 

Hi. I am an individual with multiple disabilities/health conditions (anxiety adhd and possible autism) and I’m 25. I was wondering how you go about dating if you rely on your parents for transportation. Unfortunately I have a condition that causes limited depth perception so I am not sure driving is the best option for me and I’m also afraid to learn even though my doctors say it wouldn’t hurt to learn.

My mother’s only child she is very overprotective of me (and the few friends I have always comment this). However, she does talk about me moving out but I’m almost certain she wouldn’t let that happen because she’s over protective even though we fight all the time. I should also clarify that I love my mother and she can be my friend but she’s also very overprotective. 

Case in point: I needed to get somewhere the other night and neither my parents (my father seems to think my mom is the only one who needs to drive me around sometimes) could take me, and I put it out on fb (just my friends list) that I needed a ride but my mom saw it and said I’m not letting you get in car with someone I don’t know. I mean I wouldn’t have gotten a ride from a murderer…but she yelled at me and made me take it down. Thankfully I did get a text from a family member that they could take me where I needed to go. But that incident made me think what if I met a guy on a dating site and we clicked but I needed a ride to get there and my mom said no. I mean dating is part of how I would move out, but I’m not sure my mother understands that online dating is how the majority of people meet these days. I don’t feel like my mom is abusing me or necessarily being mean but she’s just way over protective. I do plan to bring this up with my therapist as well. Does anyone have any ideas?

Reddit diagnostic?,1716151435.0,"So I have been following this sub for a while… and would like your opinion. Ofc, I am joking about the diagnostic. But I would like to know your opinion. Also, I don’t come from a country very aware of ADHD.

I have the following “issues”
I thought my whole life that there is something wrong with me and and that I have some potential, but I am too lazy to get anywhere:
1) in terms of finishing task:
- I always struggle. My main motivation is not losing my job pr my reputation in the company
- for exams or certifications - I struggle a lot and I only finished them if I paid or if I informed people about what I am pursuing and I am afraid of how i might look if I fail
- it’s very hard towards impossible to juggle multiple tasks. For example last week I had an interview for a dream job. I spent the week before just worrying about it and how will I look in front of the hiring managers. And what are the implications of me looking stupid are. I could have spent the week preparing but nope. Head was stronger and wanted to go down that rabbit hole.

Another thing I believe is important is the fact that I am moderately addicted to zolpidem, alprazolam and alcohol. Because my head was always in the way of me executing tasks, I love the times when my head becomes numb, high, intoxicated. It reliefs me… and I am way slower and less reactive.

Also, I was diagnosed with severe depression/burnout 3 years ago. Followed the prescribed zoloft treatment for 2 years 100 mg. Managed to stop last August.

On a different rent note, I didn’t do so bad in my life so far. I have 2 masters, a good job and a good salary. I visited 50 countries and I overcame severe depression and morbid obesity.

However, I always feel like between me and achieving my true potential is a head that is sabotaging me NON STOP. Is this… some kind of ADHD?

In full disclosure I was so preoccupied with my goal of quitting Zoloft, that I told my doctors some time ago that I am not looking for new diagnostics.

I hope everyone in the world is doing good in their own way. Me, it's a bit complicated.

Right now my life is going great in a lot of ways: I have a job that pays well, I'll be moving out of my parent's house to my own place, I'm budgeting and avoiding impulse buying, all of that sort of stuff.

But at the same time, I'm struggling.

When I read the news, or just talk to my friends, it seems like everything in my country (I'm American) is going to shit. We have two people running for president who probably aren't fit for the office, nasty and vitriolic political discourse, and a media that constantly gives us things to be sad/mad about. All the while the rest of the world stares on as if we're some sort of circus act. I have a lot of non-American friends, and they can't help but remind me of the state we're in. 

Even if America isn't really all that bad and the media is just messing with us, it still feels hard to handle sometimes. I've tried cutting out the news, but it's almost impossible to avoid. How can I focus on improving myself if I feel like the world is going to end?

Is my inteligence causing me to become crazy,1716149779.0,"19M
I myself think that i am dumb af with certain things. Like extreme stubborness. Inability to change currect action, even tho there are more important things to do.

Little childhood background. Told by everyone i was gifted, very smart child. Learned to write and read at the age of 4-5. Basicaly nonverbal, wouldnt want to talk with anybody, extreme stuttering, scared of everything -> very curios and wanted to know everything about my surroundings and the world. Always asking questions. Didnt have any friends bcs i was wierd. Spent around 8 hours a day building legos/solving puzzlez. Forgetting to eat/sleep. Extremly determined. But if i wasnt good at something first try, i was the maddest person on the planet -> would do anything of my power to actually solve my problem. This resulted in extreme agression towards anyone who would intervine with my current problemsolving session. When i was doing my first iq test. Some of these questions vere actually hard, and maybe for the first time in my life i became challenged, trying to do everything in my power to complete the test. Result? 130ish. My parents were shocked, and said i need to attend gramar school. So as 10/11 year old i started my first year in grammar school. Fast forward to current day i am really paranoid, everyone is againts me, i can tell how fake and fabricated conversations in my school are. Noone is genuene. But then, i myself am unable to have smalltalk, i learned that people need smalltalk to connect, but i just cant do that. Im having a hard time replying to my surroundings overthinking everx aspect of my intination, word selections everything, with people i care about(parents, gf, couple my friends) i feel like a robot, having my place, doing the same things every day, i dont even know what day is it, i wxperience extreme time blindness. I always need to do something in order to not let my mind wander around my dark future thoughts. I want to sleep but think of my broken bracelet from a month ago, i am like nah lets do it tomorow, but then i cant sleep thinking about it for 40 minutes with my eyes closed, rumbling in bed forcing myself to sleep, impossible. I get up and repair my bracelet, its 2:45 in the moring and my alarm goes of in less than 4 hours. I am like, how i was just watching a video from 3 blue 1 borwn like 30 minutes ago, turns out its been 4 hours :)) i reflect, what did i actually do. My mind then fabricates these fake memories of actually studying for physics test, texting my friend and watching a hockey match with my parent and went to sleep. Wrong i havent done any of that now in the morning i am stressing having intense halucinations my mind wanders of to extreme depths, seeing images of myself kicked out of the house, homeless, begging for food, then i see my present self bringing my homeless self a hotdog. WHICH IS SOMETHING I DID LIKE 2 YEARS AGO AND WANTED TO HELP A HOMELESS MAN OUT. Seeing this ultimate cycle of life gives me chills. I believe we are all conected somehow. But thats not the point. I dont even know where i was going with this anymore. My mind is racing at milion mph and sometimes i cant fabricate single thought or keep simple instructions in my mind like please bring a shampoo to the bottom bathroom my mum says. I get distracted by taking a dump, then forgetting completely, cuz in my mind i see myself handing my mum the shampoo and her thaking for my service. THIS IS EVEN WORSE IN MORNING, i see myself getting up, eating breakfast, texting my gf good morning text, UNTIL I REALISED IT WAS ALL JUST A WIERD DREAM AND I OVERSELPT 40 MINUTES. Dont even get me started on my dreams, these are to most complex storylines with multiple parts since dreamworld passes slowly compared to realworld time so sometime i csnt wait for second part of my dream which mostly happens next evening i go to sleep, i am now keeping track of multiple dream plotlines where in one me and my friends have our own comunity survival typa thing. My fav dreamseries :D. Honestly i cant unsee how depressing and dystopian current world-state is. Honestly i see myself dead in nomore than 10 years during ww3 where trump gets elected, refuses to help eu with russia invading The baltic states. I was believing i was going dummer and dummer. I resit my iq test, spend like 3 hours answering questions, 144. I started researching if inteligent people go crazy, found a lot of evidence, thats why i am asking, could this be my case??
I havent told these things my psychologist, dont wanna endup in psychward lol, currently we are discusing my adhd, along  ocd i was diagnosed with as a child.
My room is a complete mess, in eyes of a stranger, in my i eyes, my solution for grasp on reality. Empty bag of chips? Helps me remember that time was watching anime with my gf. Nail polish remover at my desk? Me painting my nails for the first time. Dirty clothes lying on the ground?Ii remeber that time i wore it as a part of my outfit on ceetain hangouts with friends. Where my parents see mess, i see my past self, remebering my life, helps my mind not to wander of when i think of these past heartwarming events. Honestly I want things to end, but i cant imagine getting my family friends and gf this sad. Im so lost and dont know what to do

When I was in preschool I would start at 6 am and stay until 7pm when my parents would pick my brother and I up and we would then go to bed at 8 or 8:30pm. As we grew up we switched to before school care, school, and then after school care. School from kindergarten to about to second grade we had before school care in our school lunch room until it got canceled because we were one of the only families that would go, there were about 14 kids that would go to the morning care. But during that time we would get to school at 6:30 to 7:00, the morning care would start at 7:00 so my brother and I would just wait outside the school on the sidewalk. The actual school day would start at 8:00, we would then start after school care at 3:00. The after school daycare would start at 3:00 and end at 7:30 but most days we would be there until 8pm. After the morning care was canceled my brother and I would just walk ourselves to school, our parents would leave at 6-6:30ish. We would leave the house at 7:30 and normally get there early and would wait outside until school started,but the after school hours were still the same. This went on untill 4th grade when we would just walk ourselves to and from school everyday. Also on every school holiday we would also be at day care until 4th grade. During summer time we would also go to daycare every weekday. Also during this time from the age of 4-5 we would dress ourselves, make our own meals, and be responsible for all of our own health. After 4th grade we would do all the same but we would start waking ourselves up in the morning, and we would be responsible for cooking dinner for the family on weekdays and weekends. During covid when my parents worked from home (5th grade) I had gotten very depressed and I wouldn't feed myself, and because of that I would be very tired and not be able to get out of bed without either passing out or becoming very nauseous. My parents would get very mad at me for this and they would tell me to feed myself even when i was too sick to get up and I would just have to crawl to get food(my parents wouldn't bring me food or try to take care of me). Also in 4th grade i fractured my wrist and wasn't taken to the doctor untill weeks later because my parents didn't believe me when I said it was broken, this cause my wrist to start healing incorrectly and I had to have a full arm cast instead of just a lower arm cast. During this time i still had all the same responsibilities. I would also like to mention that when I was in elementary school we wouldn't have any food to pack for lunch so I would either have free crackers and candies from restaurants that I would steal. Or I would use birthday money to buy school food. I now have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and because I have not had any serious traumatic or abusive events I am wondering if this is the reason or if I am just forgetting something. I also was once thrown into a car by my father which caused me to have two dead front teeth, I don't remember this event exactly but I do remember all that happens after wards. Any way if anyone has an idea of weather or not this is related to my bpd i would really appreciate the insight.

I Feel Empty Because I Have to Restart From Nothing,1716145981.0,"So I’m an 18 year old male. I used to have a 2008 Subaru WRX and I loved it so much named it Sylphy would drive around in it when I was stressed or lonely I would never do anything stupid I only ever just kinda cruised around. The power the car had made it easy to accelerate and the turbo blowoff sound was euphoric.

I had been taking college classes and didn’t have much money at the time since I bought the car at the start of the school year. Then on the day of my final exam I get done with the test and on my way to my friends house to give him his calculator I got T-Boned.

I was at a stop sign in an area I’d never been in and someone to the right who had the right of way stopped and let the person ahead of me go then they went. So my brain went there are four stop signs here. Which there were just not facing all four directions.

So then I started crossing and saw someone barrel towards and they hit the back of my car sending me spinning off the road. So the accident was my fault. But in my head even after I had been hit. I thought why the hell did they run that stop sign. I don’t know if it was my ADD (Now know as inactive-ADHD) or what because I really did see the intersection as a four way stop. But I’m not going to use my disability as an excuse though.

Anyways the insurance didn’t cover it because the insurance is in my parents names. Mine wasn’t on there. The car took me three years to save up for working tirelessly day after day after day. Now Sylphy is gone. I also have like $1000 so it is going to take me all summer if I get full time at work to buy another WRX.

But I really am just tired and exhausted. Calculus and other college classes just drained everything out of me. My car was probably the only thing that kept me going because of how enjoyable it was and I had so many plans to mod it for reliability and maybe get a nice exhaust. Now all that is down the drain.

I feel really distraught. I’ve cried five times in the past two weeks since it happened. Sylphy meant so much to me and now that she has just been ripped away from me. Not only that I failed the class because of the final as well so maybe I just shouldn’t have gone to college that day I don’t know. I also have one highschool class that I just stopped doing work for after the accident because I’m just sick of always working.

But everything I do now just doesn’t feel like it’s really worth it anymore. Like I wake up and just want to lay in bed all day. I don’t work out anymore. And I’m not happy about my job anymore. I just feel like shutting down and letting everything play out. There is nothing I wouldn’t do just to have my car back.

I think I was in a VERY dangerous Situation ,1716143014.0,"Didnt want to put anything in the title to not upset anyone.

So here it goes. Yesterday I went to an open air rave with lots of my friends. It was in the City but behind industry buildings so pretty secluded. At one point I needed to pee and since I want to have Peace while going I went a little further away from the music. There was an empty street which I followed and I found a spot between some trees which looked fine. There was a bit of trash laying around but nothing more. Or so I thought. I was looking very closely in the bushes because I wanted to make sure that no homeless people had their stuff their and then I saw someone. He was standing still, I couldnt see his face but his red tshirt. Because there was a parking lot from some building I thought he was standing behind a fence and guarding the buildings. I went back to the path/ street quickly and went a few more meters before I was comfortable with a spot. As I made my way back to my friends, this man comes out of the trees right at the spot I went in earlier. He had a Black jacket on so the only way I could see his tshirt beforehand was if he was facing the way I was on. I thought maybe he was another guest from the open air but he walked right past it. I was really shaken up afterwards and so happy I didnt have more drinks beforehand and wasnt Tipsy and was able to see him. The thought about what could have happened is since then in my head. I directly told my boyfriend and just went to the toilet with other Girls. I know that nobody would have heard me if something serious would have happened because everyone was drunk and the music was loud. I also think the man had Bad intentions because every normal would have made a Sound to draw attention to them if a woman is heading in their directions in the woods.

My mom found out and of course left him. He paid off jail for a long time until I was 11 and he went to jail for 8 months. My dad really struggles with mental health I think and I’m the only thing he has. I love him because he’s my father but my sister is also my best friend and so important to me. It makes me uncomfortable cause I’m also a girl and my sister was young when it happened. I’m in college now and live with my mom with visits to my dad. I feel guilty cause I truly am all he has but it’s hard to deal with everything that has happened along with his sometimes difficult mental health issues.

I go to college far so all my friends are far away and the only thing I really have in my hometown other than family and work is my boyfriend that I grew up with for 11 years. We grew up best friends and then we dated and it has been on and off for 4 years now. He also has suffered with mental health throughout our relationship and I always did my best to be there. He is always the one to leave me and he always has an excuse but quickly goes to other girls. He has 2 girl friends that he chose to stop talking to when we started dating and I didn’t question it. Then he started talking to them behind my back and it made me uncomfortable. They always text him even when we’re fully together without breaking up for over a year and just don’t respect me. They didn’t start texting him until the one broke up with her boyfriend which also makes me uncomfortable because she didn’t care when she had a boyfriend so why would she put me through that with mine? The first time we broke up I ended up being pregnant and during that he would leave me for those girls and a bunch of other girls along with dating apps. I went through the ab0rt1on alone a week before my birthday and my mom ended up finding out and hated him for it. The week after my birthday he told me he had cancer which was a lie but i believed him and started talking to him again. Currently he broke up with me the day before leaving for my past semester in college but throughout would text me and try to see me so i knew when i came back home he would try to talk to me. I love this guy i feel like ill never find anything like the connection i have with him and i cant let go. There are always other girls at this point and now when i ask him about the other girls he leaves me on open instead of reassuring me but my stupid self still wants to believe there isn’t anyone else. My dad texts me nonstop about seeing me and I feel guilty for not being there as often but then my mom also makes me feel guilty for not being with her all of the time but if I’m not perfect for my boyfriend and there whenever he possibly needs me then he will use it as a reason to leave me and to tell me I’m not worth staying.

Getting into a bodybuilding routine changed my life,1716141575.0,"Hi guys,

I just wanted to share a success story which might help others. I have been suffering with anxiety for years mainly due to a highly stressful job, which I have recently quit and found something much less stressful which could have also contributed. I also spiralled into deep depression from June last year to January this year.

Changing jobs aside I think the main factor I believe in my recovery was focusing on the gym and really throwing myself into it. When you go to the gym and start lifting weights, you have both long term gratification and instant gratification. You feel good when you’ve worked out but also you have an idea of what you want to look like in the future. I have become so focused on these short and long term goals it has taken over my negative thoughts and I am feeling so much better. 

It starts to take over small parts of your life, instead of skipping meals you focus on eating more food and eating healthily. You cut out all the things which could stop you achieving your goals such as alcohol and drugs which we all know are bad for your mental health in the long run. 

It actually got me off taking benzodiazepines because I had another way of getting the stress out of my body. I am basically off my SSRI now, only on the smallest dose available and I eventually plan on coming off altogether - I feel ready for it. 

You get tired from pushing yourself so it helps with the insomnia. It becomes somewhat of a lifestyle and I wake up looking forward to working out. 

I find it best to do it in the morning because my anxiety was always worse in the morning than the evening. When i go, I feel 10x better when I get home. Instead of googling about anxiety and sitting on Reddit talking about how awful the world is, you find yourself googling best exercises for chest, legs, shoulders, different types of workout styles etc. 

I would 100% anyone suffering with mental health to incorporate going to the gym and lifting weights 6 times per week. Put yourself and your body first. It might not cure you but it sure as well won’t hurt. I am much more confident now, enthusiastic and energetic. 

If you feel as though you don’t have the energy push yourself to spend 45 mins in the gym. What else are you going to spend that 45 mins doing? Sat watching Netflix, scrolling on tik tok, feeling worse about yourself? Go sit in your car for 5 minutes and if you still don’t have the energy to go, then don’t, but I guarantee once you’re in your gym gear and sat in your car and you will go. Spend some money on gym clothes, supplements etc. and then you will feel guilty for not going - it will encourage you. 

Just 5 months ago I was so low, no energy, not eating, and I gradually forced myself into this routine and I’ve never felt better. I hope this post brings some inspiration to others and sorry for the long paragraph. If anyone would like to chat about workout routines or how to get motivated just message me.

Trauma made me question sexuality,1716140673.0,"I (23 F) was abused physically and emotionally abused as kid, by mostly girls/women. After I graduated, Covid hit and that’s when I started feeling low, lonely and lost sense of purpose. I even had suicidal and self harm thoughts.

I found myself attracted to women, and desperate for an emotional connection and physical comfort. When I told my new therapist about me questioning sexuality, she told me to think why that might be since her approach is all about analysis. I came to a realization that the fact trauma was caused by women; nurses who tied me to the bed when I was in psych ward, students who bullied me, teachers who didn’t protect me and my mother who didn’t hug me enough as a child might be a factor that made me question sexuality as a way to cope.

I hope I’ll someday recover. For now, I’ll take my time to find myself, and enjoy life as it is. I’m sharing my story because I know someone out there is struggling, and to remind them they’re not alone in their journey of healing.

"Better looking & charismatic people made to feel ""wanted"" - results in better mental health",1716139387.0,"I work with huge numbers of people & have noticed a direct correlation between ""looks"" & charisma vs. being made to feel wanted.

Everyone who is considered by the majority to be ""good looking"" or ""pretty"" & has natural charisma (need both apparently) seems to get so much attention from others to the point where they have a non-stop social life, easier (not easy but EASIER) work life treated better by bosses, and never bored or lonely- while the stark contrast is that those who are average looking in the minds of the majority (or less) are treated with indifference, often left alone, have to work harder to keep bosses happy & harder to have a social life (often being impossible).

I've noticed the more charismatic tend to have things ""handed to them"" on a platter so to speak. That doesn't mean they don't work hard- it just means everything seems to slot in relatively easily & they have options.

Those with more attention are naturally happier & live full lives. It's not right. Yet they are blind to it & to the suffering of so many, just assuming everyone's the same.

It's incredibly frustrating. Another example of this is those who are naturally charismatic or good looking not needing to post on reddit for company, understanding, or attention, and thus don't get stressed by reddit's filters constantly deleting their posts that they take time to write.

I find this whole situation concerning as most people rarely are made to feel wanted & it damages health.

Those with more attention are naturally happier & live full lives. It's not right. Yet they are blind to it & to the suffering of so many, just assuming everyone's the same.

I find this concerning as most people rarely are made to feel wanted & it damages health.

Seriously How Lonely Can It Get ?,1716135891.0,"I am 24M Techie in Bangalore, India. No friends no girlfriend. Most people whom I used to call ""friends"" were just playing friends as I was there cash machine(Got to know this an year back, when I had a fight with one of them). Moved in Bangalore an year back.

**Background**:

Most of my year during festival season either I was injured or had some kind fever so couldn't celebrate anything no got chances to make friends or interact with people. My birthday was also in Dec end, so never got a chance to celebrate in school. My parent were not strict normally but when I used to go out as high schooler (Class 8 to 10), they used to ask lot of question, so I kept myself to my room.

**Fast forward**:

Now I am Bangalore, people, chilling going out, what food do you  like, asking body count, asking how many places I have visited, which place did I like ? How many girlfriends did I had in past ? How many friends do you have ? Who is your best friend ? Where do you wanna go ?

What should I tell these people ? . That I am lonely person who did nothing apart from studying who is slowing heading towards su\[eye\]c\[eye\]de ?

These question make me realize that apart from studying i did nothing at all. My interaction with people are zero, I cannot read the situations. Cannot talk to girls. Now with all these my parent want me marry.

**Today**:

For passing some time and to escape from these bad thoughts, I downloaded Instagram for very first time. For first few days it went good until I clicked the share button, then I realized that I am really a very very lonely person, and it's not just my thoughts, but in reality.

Everything feels bad. Can't remember the last time I was happy, probably when I was 8 or something but I don't remember. School is going badly, I feel like I don't fit in anywhere.

Struggling with two parts of myself that are not integrated Dissociation Dpdr Depersonalization,1716140803.0,"Hi I am writing this as I am struggling with some symptoms of mental illness, basically my therapist said that I have two parts of myself that are not integrated, I dont have DID, but there are some incongruences that are annoying me too much:

The number one personality is me when I was maybe 20yrs old, I was very restless, I dindnt know what I wanted to do with my life, and had poor control of my emotions, making me not so functional, but there were good things too, I felt connection to my family and friends, but at the same time I had poor limits and it was easy for me to be mistreated and I wouldnt even notice. Also my perception in this one much more focused in the sensorial stimulus, specially visual and auditive stimuli, making it too easy for me to get overstimulated.

The second me is me after  a crisis I had, because I had to choose my career path and I didnt really know who I was, because dysfunctional family, trauma and stuff, because my parents didnt let me develop my personality in peace. After this crisis I became functional again, but it was a new version of me, of course during the time of the development of this new me I grieved the loss of the old one,  because I missed  how the world used to feel. In my new perception my attention was pretty much inwards and I developed an amazing inner world. I became an animation student and developed this passion for animation but it is too much. Also became very rational, intellectual, better habilities, better awareness and undeerstanding of everything, and smart, also I feel way more in control with this mode or personality I´ve develop, but the downside is that I feel emotions too intensely, like way too much its overwhelming and an inmense feeling of crippling loneliness and low self steem.

The thing is that lately I ve been struggling to be the second me, I´ve been into so much stress lately because of college and because it drains all my energy . Also I have ocd and I have self sabotaging intrusions, that have become stronger. Also I have felt so anxioius and stressed that I felt the old me come back, the first one and I just want her to go away, but I want to me the second me again in peace, but I dont want it to be overwhelming. Also I am scared to become a third me, but I am not letting it happen. My Therapist said that this crisis wont happen again because now I know better who I am.... But because of who I am is so overwhelming I am struggling to be me again because of the pain it feels to be that person... Please I am asking for help, for tips, for reassurance that i am going to be okay again, If you ever felt the same please let me know.

i am now very overly sensitive and apologetic, and i take everything very very personally. i know this isn’t healthy, but it’s gotten a lot better. however i am still hurting people bc of my reactions. 

EXAMPLE: the other day i was ranting about a game to my partner. i am very bad at this game and reiterated that so that they didn’t need to say it, however they ended up saying “well usually when (thing i was ranting about) happens its because i am playing badly” which i took the wrong way and kinda shut down. they meant it as we all make mistakes, and that it’s happened to them as well, but i took it as them reaffirming that my skills are lack luster when i was trying to make it clear that i didnt want to hear that, because that was what i was ranting about. 

usually when i handle these emotional from small instances like above i kind of shut down and get quiet for a minute or two and then slowly reintegrate by bringing up something i know will engage the other person. 

this instance led to a bigger conversation with the issues i have been causing in the relationship. this is leading me to a longer shut down. usually i process emotions alone and need space away from people. i take walks, and just unplug, or draw. i feel very unable to talk or communicate in a healthy way, so i dont. i always thought this was the proper way to handle things but i am quickly realizing its not. how do i handle this better?

I lose my keys, my wallet, my phone often. I forget to turn things on or off. I stop half way between a task and can't remember what I was working on. I dont hear people when they talk to me. It started off not so bad but now it's severe.

The other day I was driving my normal route to work and zoned out, next thing I knew everything looked unfamiliar to me. It was the same road I drove a million times, but it was like I had no idea how I got there and I didn't recognize a thing and I felt terrified.

I went to get tested for ADHD while in college because I noticed I couldn't focus on lectures or homework, but they didn't take me very seriously and thought I was after meds. I did leave with a suggestion to get further testing for ASD, which they did not have the resources available for in my area for adults.

Anniversary of brother’s estrangement,1716136674.0,"My brother is estranged from my family for around a year now. There was an incident in 2016, when my family and me were getting ready to travel outside of the country. We couldn’t find my brother. It turned out that he jumped from his bedroom window and injured his leg so he was at the hospital. After that happened, my brother told my father how he is abusive. When my brother told him, my father disassociated the whole time. My brother requested therapy between him and my father. My father denied and made the whole family go to therapy instead. Fast forward to recent years, my brother was flunking his classes and never finished college.

About December 2022, my mother confronted him about not going to work (doing DoorDash) and how he never leaves his room. After he came out of his room after the argument, my father called him useless. My father also hid his car keys from him. Since that incident, my brother stopped talking to them entirely. Fast forward May 2023, he moved out for good.

It’s important to note that I’m African and family is really big within our culture especially the only son.

"""Fetishizing"" bad things that happen to me as a way of ""coping""?",1716136494.0,"So I've realized that when I'm in a negative situation or something bad happens to me, I tend to ""sexualize"" it. For example, I'm currently in love with someone who doesn't like me back and in my head I visualize it as me being ""below"" them, and as I am a very sexually submissive person, it kinda turns me on and helps me cope. 

If someone says something bad or demeaning to me (I have BPD so those kind of things really sting), I see it in a BDSM/sadomasochistic kind of fashion, which lessens the emotional impact.

It's not being insulted itself what turns me on - it's posteriorly, deliberately trying to view it as a situation which puts me into submission what does it.

Struggling to get my shitty neighbours out of my head. Any methods to doing so?,1716134568.0,"Hi, I just wanted to ask for some advice. I have a neighbour opposite us who basically started a little feud with us because they didn't like me asking them to stop blocking off my driveway, which they did numerous times for no reason other than to antagonise us.

We haven't continued anything as we just want peace, and they've stopped parking across our dropped kerb after they were spoken to by our local PCSO, yet I still find them staring at me randomly which im assuming is for some silly intimidation tactic, and my anxiety has become quite bad for it as I hate conflict, especially when it's prolonged and for no good reason. They don't know about my anxiety, so all they are seeing is me not giving a single shit about what they're doing, and I'm glad that they assume it doesn't affect me.

I wanted to ask what methods you have used/continue to use to avoid these people (in your mind, of course. I can't physically avoid them unless i lock myself away), or to calm your mind when you see them or think about them?

"If you're struggling with loneliness or depression this may help, or it did for me atleast.",1716134385.0,"So I'm going to say off the bat again this works for me. There's always more nuance to each case, but I just want to offer unsolicited advice. Some of it may be (and probably is) a bit flawed, but I still feel like posting it.

Firstly, I've found that the internet has been a HUGE cause of my past feelings of loneliness, depression, or otherwise just emotions that inhibit me to enjoy my life. All I ever heard was you need friends, you need people or you should logically just feel like shit. The thing I didn't understand until now is, it's all bullshit. 

Now this isn't to say we shouldn't feel lonely, but man we really just need distractions, we need focus, something to get completed honed in on that pulls us out of the neverending thinking-mode and makes life fun. We need to change our way of thinking of ourselves most of all, instead of thinking about every single tiny flaw we have, we need to think of ourselves much higher. Not like an inflated ego, but high self esteem. In order to feel good and be happy in your day to day life, you need to believe you have the capacity to do so first.

 Now of course, each person's case is entirely different. Some people have developed neural pathways and reactions to things that are just so ingrained that it simply not as easy as flipping a switch and presto, you're happy. That being said though, I do think this is the right path to feeling better honestly. 

And one of the most important things I've realized is your mind doesn't know anything, like at all. I mean we *know* things like leaves are green and pain hurts, but we can't predict the future, we can never have certainty, and to me personally this is a blessing more than a curse because it means we're not completely hopeless no matter how long a painful experience persists in our lives. This is not saying the same old ""it will get better"" because that would be hypocritical to what I just said, but it does propose the *possibility* of change, which is all I think we need to get moving. 

Other than that it comes down to discipline, and while we shouldn't take this too seriously to a fault where we return to scrutinizing our every action and it's mistakes, we should adhere to a certain set of habits we want to adopt highly enough that we learn overtime to say no to comfortable things. Say you want to lose weight for example, try eating later in the day and build that habit of taking control of your mind, that will get a bit easier each time as your mind gets used to not having it's fix.

This is just my two cents, maybe it'll help nobody and maybe some of it is a bit wrong but I felt like sharing it just cause. Hope whoever reads this has a good day.

How can I believe someone loves me,1716131620.0,"
I (26F) have been with my husband (30M) for nearly 4 years and got married at the beginning of this year. I’ve always been extremely insecure in our relationship and I felt like he was never over his ex (or basically anyone he had any kind of relationship with before me) and that he settled for me. Admittedly, in the very beginning of our relationship he had inadvertently compared me to his ex. I also read an old journal of his where he went on for pages about how much he loved her and all the things he loved about her. All these years later and being married, I still replay it and I’ve convinced myself he thinks about her and compares me all the time. 

We got into an argument this morning because I had a dream he was cheating on me with his ex, and I asked him if he regrets marrying me. He got very upset and now thinks I regret our marriage because I bring up how I think he doesn’t love me all the time. He says he can’t keep defending himself and I look for things to validate the narrative I created. 
I love him more than anything, but I have this intense fear it’s not reciprocated. He does nice things for me, treats me well, supports me, and the only issue we really have in our relationship is our communication skills (but honestly I know I’m more of the problem with that) so I have no true reason to feel like this, but I do. 

 I have been in therapy for nearly 3 years, but my first therapist never mentioned BPD, while my current therapist thinks I show traits but hasn’t formally diagnosed me yet.

I Feel Like Shit,1716130681.0,"Does anyone else’s therapist throw their clients feelings to the back burner? I.E.  Instead of acknowledging the feelings the therapist completely disregards them/is more focused in a solution. 

It is great for a therapist to not SOLELY focus on the emotions with NO SOLUTION or RESULT, but I thought that was one of the reason for therapy. 

Emotions drive the actions. 

I feel empty and BARE to the elements. I’ve told my therapist. However my therapist just seems to be focused on the physical results. (I.E. Get your own place, get a job, etc….). However when I bring up things that are actually plaguing me he makes it seems like it doesn’t matter. 

If being a pushover, someone that is easy to manipulate, a people pleaser, not being able to set boundaries is not important… WHAT IS? 

I’ve gotten the job and the place and the only think he could say is you’re doing better than when you came to me. Umm excuse me those things are what led to those problems.

advice on building a relationship with myself ,1716130056.0,"I am 22(f) and just finished my university degree. My whole life I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression ,  my teen years were especially tumultuous. I’m not going to trauma dump here but but I struggled a lot. I am taking this year of my life to try and create a healthy relationship with myself, and unlearn the destructive behavior I’ve made so normal in my everyday life. I have no self esteem. I am so ridiculously hard on myself, anything that goes slightly wrong in my life; whether it be relationships, friendships, work - I will always believe it’s something inherently wrong with me. I would really, really appreciate practical advice on how I can use this free year of my life to build a healthy, kind, forgiving relationship with myself because I honestly can’t keep living like this.

 My friend just cut ties with me.,1716129044.0,"Back in my college day, I have a friend who I will called “Peter” from now on. Peter has always been a guy who is my close friend and we basically a part of the same group when we hangout or go to any classes. One day, he seems to have a problem  or an argument with his family and now he lay it out on me, wanting me to console him, or maybe to do something that would help with the situation, but that problem is internal within his family, so I can only give advice and one of them was for him to think about the good life that he has in the past, to look at the friendship scrap books and old messages that he got from his friends back in the day so that he could take his mind off the problem. After we talked about the situation and I helped him set his mind off the thing, he says thanks to me and we say goodbye to each other, but a short time after that, he DM a Sticker to me, and that Sticker look sinister, like he held a grudge on me or about to do something sinister. I didn’t respond anything to that.

Some time after that, I started to have my own problem, too, can’t remember the exact detail, but I choose to call Peter and confide in him. I talked about my struggle and problem that is going on, and what he chose to say to me is unbelievable. Instead of helping with my problem, he started to talk about a random game which I have no interest in at that moment, going into detail about its lore and world building, about how interesting this game is, completely ignore my problem, then he ended the talk by saying that “I just did what you’ve done to me in the past”. At the moment I don’t know what to said and I can only think about the day I consoled him in the past. Maybe I did something wrong back then? I only told him that I will improve whatever he wanted me to do better. The thing is, what he did to me has hurt me so much and I won’t be able to forget it anytime soon.

Fast forward to two-ish years later, I decided to settle this problem once and for all. I always knew that whatever problem I have, I could just talk directly to him, so I decided to call him and explain how he did the “I did what you did” thing to me and how angry I become due to that behavior. He said that he can’t remember that thing, and then started suggesting that we should cut ties from each other, but that’s not what I want. I just want everything to be the same, and also to lay this problem out on him, to show him how uncomfortable that behavior is to me. He just seems to respond with normal stuff like “yeah”, “okay”, “alright”, so I didn’t really know whether he actually understands what I said. So I called him again a few days later, to asked him to explain the problem, and then apologize to that. He did that, but then he also state that he don’t want to be my friend anymore, like we should just end things here. It broke my heart how we have come to this point. I still want him to be his old self, cause before I call out this whole thing, he is actually improve a lot and there are no more things that I really have problem with, except that one “I did what you did to me” thing. After that, we go to eat dinner together cause we are in the same group, but the whole time that we are there, he didn’t say hello to me, or talk to me at all. It is just me trying to initiate conversation with him, and he only nod or say “yes”, something like that. He *really* not wanted to talk to me. After the dinner is finished, everyone go home and we have an argument again, and he still stand by his choice to cut all contact with me, but then he told me that he will reconsidered his choice. A few days later, he reached out to me, and long story shot, he still think the same as before. He will cut contact with me, and I convinced him to continue staying in the group. I still don’t know whether we will get to meet up next time my group gets together, but it sounds like a point of no return for our relationship.

I never thought that calling him out like that would lead to that kind of damage, both to our friendship and our emotion. I thought we can always talk things out and everything will return to normal. But I think it doesn’t matter anymore, what matters is that my feeling is going through a rollercoaster right now. Sometimes, I still got angry about the argument and how I could told him “this” or “that” to change his view, or to have a come back to the argument. Sometimes, I think about the good old day and how we used to talk to each other, confide in each other, and how we laugh to silly things together. Other times, I got scary about what he is about to do when we meet again next time, how he potentially could hurt my feeling. And there are also times that I thought about how things could go differently. What if I just stayed silent and buried my grudge forever. I really missed the good version of him, and wished that we could be the same like before (minus that “I did what you did to me” thing). Can someone tell me how to get through this? How to process all of this thing? I don’t have that many close friend and losing him really have an impact on my life.

The Man or Bear Trend is really starting to get to me.,1716128805.0,"I dont know if you know about this trend but Im gonna give you quick recap.

The Trend is about women having a choice to rather be stuck in a forest with men or a bear, and almost all of the woman choose the bear. Saying that the bear wont r\*pe her. 

For me I just cant understand it and I feel bad about this because in the comments women are not talking about r\*pists but man in general. Its not our fault that we have disgusting beings living in society. So why would anyone say that men in general are disgusting rapists? Its just a small fraction not everyone is sick. If women were stronger then women would be the bigger rap\*sts thats just how it is. If people are given power they are going to abuse it.

But this whole trend is getting into my head and making me feel guilt and worthlesness when its not even my fault.

I (f30) feel like my mental health issues are ruining my boyfriends (m39) life. ,1716125692.0,"I’ve been with my current partner for 2 years. We both fell really hard and fast for each other, and our relationship progressed quickly. I moved in with him after 5 months, and from the beginning, we had an internal knowing that we wanted to spend our lives together. 

After we moved in together, however, we went through an extremely rough period. We started fighting all of the time, and for about 9 months I was on edge because I was terrified to do or say the wrong thing. During this time, it seemed like I would offend him or upset him on a daily basis, and our fights would escalate to screaming matches that often involved me sleeping on the floor of our bathroom crying my eyes out. He’d often demand apologies for things I felt were small, and get really upset if I ever tried to explain behaviors or things that I did. I got in the habit of apologizing for EVERYTHING & blaming myself a lot & the apologies never seemed good enough for him. 

At the same time, I had a very traumatic upbringing with unstable parents, and don’t have a relationship with them as an adult. I was also in an abusive relationship a few years ago, and still have nightmares about my ex. My therapist says I have symptoms in line with cptsd. I have lots of friends, but getting close to others is extremely hard and scary for me. I’ve also had regular ups and downs in my mental health. 

During the rough period with my partner, I developed suicidal tendencies and started self-harming. I bounce between anger and guilt continually when I do something that hurts or upsets him, and I am terrified to talk about things that bother me because I’m afraid of arguments. My boyfriend also says that I have a distorted view on arguments, and experience our disagreements as a lot worse than they actually are. Things have improved immensely between us, but I’m still afraid to talk to him, the suicidal thoughts have ended but self harming persists.. I  am actively working on this with my therapist and life coach. I’m also looking into joining a DBT group. 

Fast forward to now and our arguments don’t get NEARLY as bad as they used to, but I’m still having self harm issues regularly because I get so scared to have tough conversations or when I upset him. At this point, we are able to recognize and stop when things escalate, but for some reason I still go between guilt and anger very quickly and end up hurting myself. I’ve broken my hand twice from hitting the wall, and I’ve bruised my face several times. He’s seen it happen and is very disturbed by it (rightfully so), but I can’t seem to stop. It’s like something snaps inside of me & I hurt myself.

I’m watching this take a serious toll on my partner, and I don’t know what to do about it. Part of me feels like I’m ruining his life and he would be better without me, and I live in constant guilt over it. Another part of me is hopeful things will get better, but at what cost to him and the relationship? I’m scared he will stop loving me, or that I’ll have these issues forever, or that I’m inherently broken. 

Can anyone relate or give some kind of advice on how to cope with this & proceed? 

TL;DR I developed self-harm issues after a rough time period with my boyfriend with lots of intense arguing. Our arguments have improved and gotten better, but the self-harm issues persist and deeply hurt my boyfriend. I don’t know what to do & would like advice on how to proceed.

Am I messed up? ,1716099041.0,"I’ve always been emotional - my therapist once confirmed that I’m a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP). My emotions go haywire whenever I feel overwhelmed - whether it’s anxiety, guilt, sadness, happiness or anger. Because I feel things so deeply, I can be very empathetic. I can feel compassion and sympathy for others very heavily. However, it can become too much. 

Sometimes, feeling so many emotions brewing at your core can be extremely overwhelming. It can get to the point where the brain decides that enough is enough, and begins to shut down those feelings. Eventually, you become numb and emotionless. You feel nothing. Feeling so strongly than other people can cause a lot of inner turmoil for people like me, it can be exhausting. 

But that’s not really my case anymore.

Let’s briefly delve into my childhood so we can hopefully get an insight of why i am the way I am:

I grew up in an unstable household - my mother is a narcissistic shallow woman who mostly relied on men for financial comfort. She was strict, judgmental and cold but she was gentle and caring when she wanted to be. Shes also childish, and sometimes acted like a bratty sister rather than a responsible, mature mother. She is beautiful, she knew that, so she used her looks as an advantage. She could be incredibly seductive when she wanted to be. I was once indirectly victimized by her tricks. When I was no younger than 5yo. 

I witnessed her having sex with a man she once dated. 

Though “witnessed”  isn’t enough to describe it. I FELT it. I laid on the same bed where they did it. I felt her naked, sweaty body rubbing against mine, I now realize that it was her bf rutting into her from behind. This disgusting, revolting and horrifying experience went on for hours. 

Though she is beautiful, she’s incredibly insecure. She always strived to “look” perfect. Shes obsessive about her weight and her looks and she made sure that I lived the same way. She scrutinized my diet, my clothes, my make up, my hair. Otherwise, she’d judge and criticize me, calling me “fat” and “plain”. 

She married my step-father who was her total opposite - he was kind, funny and incredibly loving. Their relationship was by no means a good one though. They often fought and argued due to my mother’s callousness. The fights took a toll on my step-father’s mental health, leading him to me. He was very lonely you see, and he thought that I was the only one that could understand him - his only anchor. He sought me out every night and crawl into my bed, seeking comfort in my embrace. He’d talk about how much he hated my mother and that she was destroying his and my little brother’s life. 

“Promise me,” he’d sob into my neck, “You’ll never leave my side. Let your mother be damned. She doesn’t matter to me anymore. Nothing else does. Just you. You and your brother are my whole world.” 

This was a nightly occurrence. Our little secret. It was not healthy, I later realized. My step-father was extremely emotionally dependent on me. It was almost incestuous, now that I thought about it. Despite not being related by blood, he was just as much of a father than my biological dad ever was. But the way he needed me felt kind of wrong. It felt too intimate. 

As sick as it felt, I didn’t mind it. Because I was just as lonely as he was. 

One thing that we need to establish here - I’m incredibly selfish. I tend to think of myself more and put myself above others. I’m inconsiderate, entitled and self-centered. I sometimes think of myself as superior than my peers and secretly regard them with contempt. I’m privileged, I come from a wealthy family and I’m spoiled with things that others would kill to have. I don’t go out of my way to be grandiose about it though - I’m very introverted and secluded. I like showing off QUIETLY. Worse thing is, I don’t even realize it. It’s as if it’s within my nature to consider myself more important than others. 

My family have known this fact about me for as long as I’ve lived, and they find it repulsing. You see, even though they’re rich and successful, they don’t take what they have for granted unlike me. They worked so hard, sacrificed a lot to get where they are now. They weren’t born rich, they earned their living. It makes sense that I’m spoiled because of them, I was born into the luxury they bled, cried and sweat for. They see me as a selfish, inconsiderate and an arrogant teen. I used to be extremely ashamed of myself. I thought I was a failure under their eyes. A burden. The black sheep. The weight of their shame was excruciating, it once made me suicidal. I self-harmed, overdosed twice, because I thought that my death would make their lives easier. 

But I’m quite fine with that now. 

I don’t care if I’m selfish anymore. It doesn’t matter to me, because I can’t really bring myself to care for my actions. In fact, I embrace it. Any sense of guilt, remorse and empathy that I would have been sick with before, is no longer my concern. Maybe, because I’m tired of feeling anything now. It feels nice to not care about anything. It feels freeing. Liberating. 

Though I am a nasty person at heart, I make sure not to let it be known. People outside of my family think I’m kind, considerate and friendly and that’s about it. Like I said, I’m reclusive. Closed off. I don’t socialize much. I never have because I’ve always found people quite boring and mundane. No one and nothing matters to me. 

Its a horrible trait to have. Because of boredom, I enjoy toying with people’s emotions for my own entertainment. For example, I absolutely LOVE helpless people. Especially men. Whenever I encounter such a person, I feel the immediate need to protect and cherish them, like a pet. I approach them like their savior would, their guardian angel - with kindness, compassion and tender care. But in doing so, I make sure to control, trap and isolate them because I want to ensure them that I’m the only thing that matters in their miserable lives. I want them to be needy, desperate and dependent, like a child to their parent. It makes me feel good. Strong. Powerful.  

I realized that every “I love you,” I’ve told every man, held no meaning at all. Every man I had a thing with, every friend, meant absolutely nothing to me. They were just… toys. Entertainments. Distractions. There was no spark between us. No thrill. 

Then I realized why. 

It’s because they led normal lives. They had friends, loving parents, jobs that they enjoyed. They were normal and because of that, they were emotionally and mentally secured, they didn’t need me in a way that I want to be needed. There was no love, and I don’t think there’ll ever be any love. I don’t know what that is. I don’t even know if I’m capable of forming a healthy romantic relationship with someone, because “healthy” is foreign to me. I want someone who’s desperate, helpless, someone’s who’s life is an absolute hell that they can’t control because then they’ll be easy to manipulate. My idea of “love” isn’t to treat them like an equal, but rather like a damsel in distress. I want them to be helpless without me, to not being able to live without me, to believe that I saved them. I’d shower them with so much attention, love and care, when really I’m trapping them, making them feel secure only in my presence. 

I would anything for such a person. Even kill. Because if I kill for them, it would just be an extra step to make them believe that I truly love them.

I'm confused and stuck,1716096943.0,"Lately I've been trying to remember my childhood (as young as 1 to 11) to try and figure out the reason why I'm the way I am.

From what I can barely/somewhat recall: I never told my parents about how I was doing in school (replying with the bare minimum) or about my emotions because of my older brother. My brother has torettes and had it really bad when we were young, I wasn't aware of it from being young but I knew my brother had problems so I made sure my parents would prioritize him by keeping things to myself.

This year I had come out to my parents as Trans and have been more open about my emotions and what I'm going through, as well as presenting symptoms for depression and possibly a neurological disorder. I've been put in for sessions in a youth health clinic. In my first session when I was asked to explain/talk about what I'm going through I found I was unable to truly explain it how I wanted to. It was like something was blocking me from talking about myself to the extent I wanted to.

I'm starting to wonder of the reason it's taken until I was teenager to present symptoms for a neurological disorder (because it's very common from my dad's side) was because of repressing and hiding things from my family as a kid.

Is that even possible?",vym1x,,False,1cvh1jk,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvh1jk/im_confused_and_stuck/
Was this abuse? ,1716096585.0,"I'm 42m.

I have never had close friends and have no family.  I try to think of why i turned out like this.  I grew up in a middle class home.  My dad made ok money but worked night shift my entire childhood, he rarely spoke to me or did things with me.  My mom was a stay at home mom until i was a teenager.  

I think most days my parents did not really interact with me except for essential things, so they gave me food and clothes, but doing things with them was very rare, like we went on vacations maybe 3 or 4 times during my childhood.  I never learned to ride a bike or to swim.  I think i learned to tie my shoes when i was 12, i taught myself.  I remember that i did not learn to use the bathroom until i was 3, and that also i taught myself, i didn't understand for a long time when i was at other peoples houses or my cousins houses why they had small toilets for the babies.  

I remember specific things that happened that stand out in my mind as being especially bad.  There are 3 that i can think of. 

When i was like 5 or so, i remember being in my room very cold.  I didn't understand at the time, but later i came to understand that our house was very drafty and cold in the winter because we had wooden windows and they should have been painted about once a year, they were not maintained and so did not shut all the way were always cracked open a small amount.  Also the furnace did not heat the whole house, it only heated it until the thermostat on the 1st floor reached it's preset point, so the upstairs was usualy 10 or more degrees colder.  My mom didn't think that we needed blankets (my sister and me, she is about 4 years older).  We had sheets on the bed and that was all.  I don't remember if it was my sisters idea, i think it was, we went into the hall closet at night to get more blankets and my mom caught us and yelled at us and made us put them back.  She said that the blanket i took was a wedding present and i didn't need it.  Years later i remember my sister as a teenager having several arguments with my mom about a comforter that she had bought herself.  When i moved out of the house i stole that same blanket that was still folded up in the closet never used.  Still have it.  

When i was 9 i got very sick.  My mom thought i  had some kind of flu.  I kept throwing up.  She did not take me to the doctor.  She always said how dumb it was how people took their kids to the doctor all the time just because they were sick. She kept giving me ice cream because she said that was good for throwing up and keeping energy up.  I was sick for i think more than a whole week, not sure if it went on for 2 or not.  Still didn't take me to a doctor, i kept throwing up.  Then one day i collapsed and they called an ambulance.  It turned out that i was diabetic and was throwing up because my blood sugar was too high.  

Later, i think i was 12 or 13.  I developed ingrown toenails.  My big toes would bleed and ooze every day.  When i came home from school they would be stained with blood and some yellow.  My mom would yell at me for this and scold me for not taking better care of my feet.  This went on for about 6 months.  My mom got a foot bath for me, and told me to soak my feet in warm water and gave me these sharp sticks to try to pry the nail out of the skin, but it didn't work.   Eventually she did take me to a doctor who performed the surgery to cut the toenails out.  

Other things that i remember, smaller things, were things like i asked to join the boy scouts at one point and my mother told me she didn't have to do that because she had already done that when my sister was in girl scouts, and i asked to learn to ride a bike at one point and my parents told me i was too old to go ride a bike with training wheels so i wasn't allowed.  I told my mom at one point that when i grew up i wanted to have a family with lots of kids, and she told me i couldn't have a family because of my diabetes, it was going to be too expensive.  

My parents never hit me, or denied me food, and when i got diabetes my mom would always track all of my sugar levels and how much insulin, she still has stacks and stacks of the monthly sheets for tracking everything the doctors office gave us.  But i don't remember ever playing with her or my dad, my dad didn't take me to football games, though he went with my grandma all the time, they had season tickets together.  My parents never told me i should join anything at school like sports or anything.   

The older i get, the more i think of these things, and look at how much i hate my life, and i blame them and get angrier at them, i hate them.  They are in their 70's now, they invite me over for dinner, on the weekends sometimes, i hate going over there, when ever they text me asking me to go i yell at my phone and i wish they would both die already.

I know they care a lot about me but sometimes its really hard to see that because i rarely see them in person and theyre very much of an ""in person"" kind of friend. 

Weve both helped each other so much but sometimes i feel like im really just talking to a wall or they dont care about me and its gotten to the point where whenever i dont hear from them for even just a day or two it REALLY impacts my mental health and then im just fine when they respond to me and i feel like im just being dramatic later until they stop responding to me again.

I'm trying to work on myself by not dwelling over the past. I know that I need to understand that people are all different and nobody is out to get me but, fuck.

I'm so scared of being hurt, and I stay with people who feel like they might hurt me because it's familiar. I can expect it.

But when it's someone new, someone who doesn't at all seen like they'd hurt me.. I'm terrified. Because, this means I can get too attached and blindsided.

"M31 - I just finished my time at a clinic, and was diagnosed with severe depression, as well as reoccuring depression and sociophobia",1716112981.0,"Hello ya'll

As my title reads i've been in a psychological clinic for some time, mostly for diagnosis reasons. I probably dont have to tell anyone how annoying, upsetting, etc. symptoms can be. It sucks if you cant get up, cant move, and cant get stuff done. It sucks to have self destructive thoughts, to struggle with the easiest things in life and the sheer lack of understanding from family and friends. It also sucks to suffer through the loniless caused by such symptoms.

One day i woke up, and i was just tired. Tired and angry to not live my life like a ""normal"" adult. And thus i decided to finally do something about it, because i dont wanna live the rest of my life alone. Alone in a grey, sad world.

I've lived like that for over 10 years, i have missed out on valuable expiriences and years we should have in our young adult phase.

Now, after a few months of therapy and clinical treatment, i am finally feeling better. I am on medication, which luckily did not turn me into a zombie, nor did it have any severe side effects.

Of course there are still many many dark days, but then there are also happy days. And those are the days i cling on to, while im walking the long road ahead to a new life. 

I'll never be fully cured, i can only learn to live with it. Learn tricks and skills to handle situations, which ultimately lead me to my goal. Hopefully i can one day just have a very normal and boring life with a partner. Thats all i need at this point.

I dont wanna belittle nor berate any of you, as i know what its like.

How to find the right psychologist/counselor,1716112965.0,"It can be really hard to find a psychologist or counselor who is the right fit for us, particularly when we are acutely unwell and are seeking instant relief and do not have somebody else to support us and advocate for us in this process. In some instances we may not have the option of choosing between a variety of different therapists.

I had to see many people who (at the time at least) I found unprofessional and unhelpful, which can be a demoralizing experience when we are in a vulnerable state and reaching out for help, until I eventually found someone I had rapport with and felt I could trust and had the skills to help me.

One thing I wish I knew then was the importance of getting to know and inquiring about the person, their experience and what they have been formally trained in before choosing to work with them and opening up about my mental health issues.

Struggling with fear of windows,1716111835.0,"Earlier this year I broke a window in my house and cut my wrist quite severely. The cut was completely accidental as a result of my hand going through the window (I was not trying to self harm). I required stitches and have a thick scar which still causes me some pain. When it happened I was the only adult present and had my young children with me. I was terrified because the cut looked horrific, right across my wrist and up  the palm of my hand and I had no idea if I was going to bleed out (which might not be rational but that was the thought going through my head).
When I had the window replaced I learned that the windows on my house are very thin (half the thickness of modern windows) and lack other safety components. 
The problem is I seem to have developed some sort of fear which results in physical reactions. I've never had a fear like this before. My young son likes to bang on windows and I'm so scared he's going to break one and get cut. Every time he leans against or smacks a window or glass door in my house I get absolutely terrified. My head fills with images of the glass falling on him and cutting him horrifically (almost in two). My heart speeds up, I freeze and all I can think about is stopping it immediately, I pull him away from the window as fast as I can and if I can't get to him immediately (because I'm physically restrained like on the toilet or in another room) I scream at him until either he stops or I get to him, whichever happens first. I also have a physical response when I hear glass breaking (real life or in a movie) but I can calm myself quite quickly when that happens.
I'm at my wit's end. I can't replace the windows because I rent and I can't move because I have nowhere else to go. I don't know what to do or how to handle this fear.",TerrariumKiller,,False,1cvklij,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvklij/struggling_with_fear_of_windows/

So I'm a male in his early 20s. I have a problem that has always been haunting me ever since I was young. Whenever I make new friends or whether its old friends, people start becoming hostile towards me all of a sudden for no reason. In the extreme cases, these groups of friends start banding together and treating me like an outcast and gossiping behind my back. I'm a very self conscious person and always treat everyone nicely and kindly. I've nvr done anything that is hostile to any of them or anything of the sorts. But one thing I've noticed is that whenever I've made friends with those people, after a month or two, they start to act hostile towards me, some subtle and some very obvious. I've tried asking myself so many times what's wrong with me, why they reacted the way they did and what to fix abt me and how to fix myself, but I've nvr found the answer. I even stopped reaching out to ppl to befriend because this has always happened to me all the time, I've pretty much become anti-social most of the time now. I'm at a lost on what to do. Honestly, I am kind of ashamed to go to a physical therapist or any sort of professional as I kind of fear they might judge me. Has anyone ever faced the same kind of troubles as I have? This is still ongoing till this day. Just the other day, a few of my friends with whom I have nvr had problems with have started to act distant and like hostile subtly towards me.

BP partner in depressive episode confessed his feelings to another woman,1716103286.0,"Hello, dear redditors. I have joined this subreddit to seek some support and advice. Hope you can help me to get some peace. This will be a long post, but I feel very hurt now, and need to vent, so forgive me that.

6 months ago I met a guy, 33 years old. I’m 27. It was unrolling slowly between us, but eventually we started to like each other and have frequent meetings. Be both agreed to exclusivity, and confessed that we enjoyed each others company, and that we are more than just friends. He always took lead and reached out for a contact with me, texted me first, and was quite engaging. At one point I started to realize I was falling for him.

3 months in I started to notice he suddenly got a little sadder. But I couldn’t figure out what was going on. This was slowly happening over the period of several weeks. He has always told me about his anxiety issues, and his sleep problems. One time he even broke out in tears in front of me, and I tried to support him and calm him down the way I could. We kept seeing each other, but I saw something was going on, his mood was always getting slightly lower with every upcoming week, which started to distress me. I asked many questions, trying to figure out the reason, but could never get to the point. I figured he was suffering from some sort of depression, probably.

One day we agreed to meet, but he suddenly cancelled, and said he does not want to see people right now, and does not want to be around anyone. I got confused and very anxious, I thought something happened. But he refused to see me or get my help.

over the next couple of weeks he was texting me a couple of messages a day, letting me know that he is in some sort of ‘comatose’, feeling very anxious, restless, and not able to sleep. This is where I started to google the symptoms, and confronted him. Turns out his is BP, and he was scared to tell me because of the stigma.

This episode lasts from the beginning of April. He finally decided to take medication. He was not unmedicated before, because he was scared. I tried my best to talk to him, and support him, as much as I could. It cost me a lot of stress, sleepless nights and tears, because I mainly could not figure out what is wrong with him.

He got very cold with me, he stopped calling me sweet names, be gentle with me, and complained about no libido, which is totally normal. He said he needed a friend more than anything now. He said he does not feel like he can be with anyone now, that he does not feel anything to anyone at this point of time. I knew I already liked him a lot, and I confronted him with this, but said that I will support him as much as I can now.

I knew he had a female friend, he knows for a long time. Yesterday he texted me that this friend is leaving to another country in a couple of months. He said he confronted her that he likes her, and she said the same back. According to him, he just realized that he has ‘feelings’ a week ago, when she told him she’s leaving. But he said he does not know, what exactly he feels to her. Whether because he is sad a friend is leaving, or he actually likes her, he doesn’t know.

but this hit me very hard. I hope it makes sense of that I explained here. I am very hurt and do not know what to do.

do bipolar people have mood/feeling switches like this? I feel like everything what happened before this depressive episode was a lie, and my feelings were misused.

Will therapy do anything for me?,1716100315.0,"Hi! Fair warning. I can’t articulate myself. So if you make it through this.. you deserve an award.

I’ve had a fucked life. Sexual abuse, parental violence, relationship violence, childhood poverty ect. 

I’m am aware that none of this is my fault. I’m aware I had no control over the worst of it. 

I had the strength to leave my first verbally/sexually abusive relationship. I had the strength to leave my marriage after my husband told me he wasn’t attracted to me anymore. I’m trying to make this as short as possible but giving enough details. 

I feel like therapy is for regrounding people, bringing them back from delusions created by others with malicious intent. I’m okay with the childhood sexual abuse. It doesn’t affect me as an adult. I’m okay with the parental abuse I witnessed because it taught me what a relationship ISNT. I’m okay with my adult sexual abuse and mental abuse because I learned again what a relationship ISNT. Childhood poverty taught me how to be good with money and I’m doing great on that aspect. That brings me to my divorce… 

I have always had bad self esteem, shocker with my history, but my ex brought me out of that. He was the first man to make me believe I was beautiful. Told me I could be a model. I was always tiny tiny cross country athletic. Covid hit and I eventually lost my job. I gained a lot of weight on my frame. I became 160lbs at 5’4”. It was a big change for me and I was down bad. But he loved it. On my frame it was not flattering. I no longer had the abs and tone and was pretty chubby. I’m sure many many women look incredible at that weight, but this is me specifically. I did not. I was devastated. 

I returned to work after Covid and the weight started dropping. I was so happy and felt so much better. 

One night my ex disappeared. I found him sobbing upstairs. Of course I panicked asking what was wrong. He said he was no longer attracted to me. He was piss drunk, so as devastated as I was, I put him to bed. Next day I confronted him and he reiterated that I lost weight and he isn’t attracted to me. I still was not at my original healthy weight. I tried to stay but over the next two years he repeated it over and over. Even grabbing certain areas of me saying “I liked when these got bigger”. It destroyed me.

I’m a small tiny girl with a decent body. Yeah B cups but a decent butt. Runner body. He fucked me up permanently and I don’t see how therapy can help. We had the relationship everyone was jealous of. We were the model for all of our friends perspective relationships and then this… 

I’m now dating someone far far far out of my league and it’s serious and I know we will be married. However, I can’t get out of fight or flight mode. I constantly ready to be let down. If the man I worshipped for 10 years did this to me… and not to be foul but my ex isn’t comparable to my current man in any way shape or form. This man is anyone’s dream. How am I good enough for this man when a man who is 1/100 of him told me I wasn’t good enough.

"What is the appropriate belief or alternative way of responding for someone with OCD about a fear of ""not knowing themselves perfectly"" ?",1716098305.0,"Basically, I'm confused what the healthy alternative would be (insteead of reassurance seeking by posting and asking opinions about how people see me/what I'm really like or compulsively researching/ ruminating/introspecting)

At it's core I think my obsession/ fear is basically about the possibility of not knowing myself (I'm afraid I'm actually morally bad/deluding myself/fooling everyone and if I don't figure out my flaws and see myself accurately it could be humiliating to be viewed as deluded and full of myself and also unsafe, like others can hurt me badly by pointing out character flaws I didn't know I had, and I'm actually a much different/ worse person than I thought)

But I feel like this is kind of a reasonable fear? It's actually very likely I don't know myself and others will end up pointing out flaws and other things about myself I don't know. That's how life works? So it's not like most OCD where you accept uncertainty but the likelihood of your fear happening is super low. My fear is quite possible and even plausible?!

Help with bipolar disorder diagnosis!,1716096939.0,"I am pretty sure my sister has bipolar disorder and some type of double personality and all family memebers including some extended family agree. It’s not officially diagnosed but she checks all of the boxes and we’ve known her to be like this all her life. However, it’s affecting her kids (she’s a single mom) and my mom the most. She has gone to therapy sessions for years and years and nothing helps her. If anything she’s worse. She’s a completely different person infront of some people including therapists and she can hide her problems pretty well. You wouldn’t think she is bipolar or see the “dark” side of her because she is able to switch to a different personality and camouflage pretty dang well. 

How can she get a proper diagnosis??? If she pretends to be someone else infront of a therapist and they think she’s completely fine? Do family members have to intervene and share about her personality and their own experience? She’s also refused anxiety medication from her primary because she says she is not crazy and doesn’t need it.

Breaking down and need clarity,1716095366.0,"\*\*Throwaway account due to personal nature.\*\*

I've been with my partner for over 20 years, and we have a 5-year-old child. I am the sole breadwinner and primary caregiver. My partner has worked less than a year in all the time we’ve been together.



We met in college and moved across the country for my first job. He also got a job but was unhappy and quit after seven months, citing depression. Initially, I urged him to find another job, but eventually, I stopped asking. My career was thriving, and we had a comfortable lifestyle without the added stress of pushing him to work.



He started drinking heavily to cope with his depression and refused to seek medical help, insisting that doctors and medications were ineffective. I stayed with him until his behavior became frightening. On two occasions, I left our apartment in the middle of the night, fearing for my safety. One night, he brandished a knife and threatened suicide. I locked myself in a room and called 911. He was arrested and received a misdemeanor charge. His parents intervened, sending him to rehab, followed by two months in a sober living environment (SLE). Despite being close to leaving him, he convinced me to stay, promising to change. I stayed, motivated by love, cultural conditioning against divorce, and my desire to have a child.



Since rehab, he hasn’t drunk alcohol. However, a year after the incident, he developed paranoid delusions, believing our neighbors and strangers were stalking him. These episodes of psychosis would come and go. I initially tried to reason with him, but I later realized that logic doesn’t work with psychosis. Unfortunately, his psychiatrist was also ineffective, using rational arguments rather than understanding his condition. We managed through these episodes, but it was exhausting.



Now, I am emotionally drained. He accuses me of lacking understanding and empathy, which may be true. I've spent most of my adult life with him, and the situation has conditioned me to rely solely on myself financially and mentally. After our child was born, I took on the majority of childcare, as he claimed his mental state prevented him from helping with night feedings. Outwardly, I appear competent and witty, but inside, I feel broken and alone.



I am scared. I fear for my child’s future with a psychotic father and feel sad about my own lack of happiness. I have no one to confide in; my close connections are either gone or unable to handle this drama. I could leave and take my son, likely gaining primary custody, but I struggle with guilt over leaving my partner without financial support. If I leave, he would have to move back in with his parents, as we live in a high-cost-of-living area. He insists that moving back would be the end of his life. I also worry about alimony, as I am the primary breadwinner and we’ve been together for a long time.



I don’t understand how I, an educated and smart professional, can be emotionally manipulated. I had chances to leave but was afraid of being alone. Now, with a child, I am still afraid. Why do I feel responsible for his well-being when he refuses to take care of himself? He makes excuses to avoid help and manipulates me into feeling responsible for him. I know I have made a lot of mistakes in this relationship, letting things slip. I am finally tired.

I am low energy all of the time. It's a very rare occurrence for me to be high energy in a way that is positive (i.e. not anxiety). Sometimes I get it after talking to coworkers, but that's more of a nervous energy.

But, one day I watched ""The Deer Hunter"". That movie has a slow first half and a much better second half. In the first half, there's a wedding scene. It's around 51 minutes long and it's just the characters at a wedding, nothing really happens. It is mind-numbingly boring and I wanted to pull my hair out. I watched it in it's entirety because I'm a completionist. What's weird is, after watching it, I had so much energy. It even lasted to the middle of the next day. I felt like I could bounce off walls. I watch a bunch of movies, some of them boring. I haven't had this happen since.

Getting over someone who is not good for you?,1716094113.0,"I ‘37F’ left my boyfriend ‘41M’ over a year ago. It was needed. He had zero respect for me after have our child and would lash out and blame everything that went wrong on me. I had been with him 14 years and realized everything was getting worse. 

Don’t get me wrong. I had some red flags about two years into the relationship. But I was dumb and thought love could be enough. 

Years later we went through a bad spot but got replaced what most women see as someone in pursuit of a goal. Then things leveled out and it was ok but not exactly where I wanted to be.

We hit some hard times before I got pregnant. It was an accident, not planned because I was thinking of leaving before then. Even started house hunting. Then found out I was pregnant and decided to try once more.

He literally had zero respect for me at that time and I was not ok continuing that role. No amount of trying to talk would lead to a discussion but more just him giving me the silent treatment. More my health and metal health I had to get away. 

Now he is dating, honestly I thought that would be better for me. A push for me to actually move on with my life. But I feel paralyzed. Sure in the end he was absolutely horrible to me. But it is hard to shake 14 years. Harder still for me to see him with another genuinely good woman. Like does he even deserve that. 

In the end I am upset and feel oh so played. How did I get so bamboozled. How do I even trust a guy is who they say they are after this. It took so damn long to see the true colors. I need to get over this person but it doesn’t help that I have to work with them for my son.

Something weird is happening with my emotions,1716092690.0,"So, my body kinda want to laugh when there is no need or when I can't laugh. I'll explain this.

I hate my parents, really hate, 100%. But I've been noticing from a few years now that when I see them or talk to them, sometimes (or often) my body wants to laugh. It's fucking annoying. It came to the point sometimes I kinda run to another room bc I can't hold my laugh. But well, I just thought I might be uncomfortable and that's it (they have done horrible things to me).

But, it seems this is starting to get worse. Today I was reading about a bad/sad thing, and my mind just thought the word ""ransacked"" was funny, but I didn't want to laugh at it.

Preface information: Gay 23 Year old male living in a rural/small town area diagnosed with Depression Anxiety Asthma and ADHD (ADHD was not diagnosed as a child)

Exactly as the titles says i just want to run away and start over but i can't. Is it healthy no but I just don't know what else to do at this point. Compared to most people probably has a decent life with a supportive family, but I am unhappy with all of it and haven't been happy since I was 16. 

I have been to multiple therapists but have yet to have a consistent one and currently my newest one I see maybe once a month due to high demand in my area. And we have not even begun to actually begin helping my issues. (Have been seeing her for 2 months now. I believe I am being properly medicated however I forget even with alarms set to take my meds (and lost my depression meds which yes I know is not helping). 

I just got hired for a 3rd shift job making decent pay and hopefully can start a decent saving so i can eventually move away. I also have a prior commitment working for someone during the day watching their storefront while they are out with a trailer at different places. This is not every day but more like every other weekend for now until summer when i am excreted to watch the store more frequently. This will have me working 10pm-6am and 11am-6pm some days which I know won't work. I need to tell the store owner I can't do it but I don't want them to get mad and screw them over as they won't be able to find someone to cover their store if I don't. (And yes that's their problem not mine but still)

I have aging grandparents and my mom/dad doesn't have the time to help them or spend a lot of time with them nor does my sister make an effort to most of the time either. My grandfather on my dad's side is more worse off than my grandmother on my mom's side due to his age and having a stroke (but not telling anyone he had one). He constantly answers obvious scam calls and orders stuff off the TV or elsewhere and when we try to help him he fights with us because he doesn't want to be the steotypical old person (which he is) my dad's brothers still live at home mooch off him and do not acknowledge his existence 99% of the time as well. 

I have tried to go to college twice couldn't get into the institution I wanted and flunked out both times due to the pressure, teachers insulting me, and my mental issues that were the colleges refused to acknowledge even with my attempting to give them the paperwork to do so through proper channels. This is to the point where I don't even know if it is worth going back as everyone I graduated with for the most part is either graduated already, have great careers, have kids, or just are overall very happy and content with their lives. 

One of my best friends also died in early 2022 and I could not attend the funeral as I was working and had moved away for college (or attempted to) and everyone back home completely forgot I even existed as a friend to him. I had to beg and plead to get something to remember him by (one of his deckboxes for card games) and I'm still not even over his death as he and I spent almost every night playing video games together and I can't even touch those games without being reminded of him. This also includes the card games I play too mainly Yu-Gi-Oh as he played that slong with my other best friend but it's just not the same. 

Most of my issues stemmed from high school where I feel my life just ended.  I was diagnosed with asthma at 16 after having a lot of issues with cross country and swimming and subsequently diagnosed with Depression and anxiety a couple of months later due to constantly bullying from teammates and one of the cross country coaches that I was either faking it or that asthma is not real. I was one of the star swimmers in our school until our original coach left and one of the cross country coaches took over. Because of my asthma my mental illness and non supportive coaching staff I just drifted to a point where I was basically one of the worst on the team and had no idea what I was doing with my life and still don't to this day. I was the gifted kid growing up but once I got to high school and asked for help I was told I would just figure it out like I always do I was a smart kid so my cries for help were always ignored. 

EDIT: almost forgot but I have 0 love life no one around me wants to date and I have very little options where I live one guy I went to school with moved to a big city close by and seems to have no trouble finding guys who actually want to date so I guess I'm just also jealous of that and want the same options he has. 


TLDR:  
I want to run away and start over because of
1. No consistent mental health
2. I don't like people depending on me
3. I have too many commitments and I don't know  to say no
4. Aging grandparents that expect me to be at their beck and call
5. Issues with School feeling left out/behind
6. Death of a close friend and not being able to get over it 
7. Issues stemming from High school where I feel my life ended.
8. Issues with lack of love life.

Im falling apart in my first semester,1716085085.0,"Hey everyone!



So I am currently a first-year Mechatronic Engineering student. Studying engineering has been a passion and dream for me my whole life, but this dream is slowly falling apart. I did pretty well in school, and things seemed to go really well at the start of this year too.



I’m doing really well in the majority of my modules: Programming, 3D Design, Physics, etc. But I have big problems with Calculus 1 and Digital Electronics. These two modules are slowly making me wonder if I chose the right career path.



I’m currently failing both those modules, and my final exams are coming up in about two weeks. Because of this, I’ve been in complete overdrive mode for the past three or four weeks. I haven’t left my house this whole time except for class, and I’m only attending the two problem modules at this point.



I’ve developed major sleeping issues, worse than usual, so sometimes I can only fall asleep every second day with maybe a short nap here and there. I felt okay mentally, but then I got multiple phone calls today from friends who were worried because they thought I had unalived myself since they hadn’t seen me in a while. This came as quite a shock, but after some reflection, I realized I have been acting differently around them. My brain is in complete hyperfocus mode, so I forget to reply to their messages. Now, I have so many unread messages that I’m too scared to reply. I’ve unintentionally cut off so many people in my life since I don’t reach out when they try to contact me. I also called my parents for the first time in probably a month, who were also very worried because I usually call once or twice a week.



So I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. If I’m already folding so much under pressure in my first semester, how do I expect to survive the rest of my time studying? I also can’t figure out why I’m struggling. In my friend group, I am the tutor for pretty much all our modules because I usually have a solid understanding of the topics. They admit they do well because of my help, but then I end up failing. Even though I’ve been grinding to catch up these past few weeks, I still feel like I know nothing.

And its not like I am stressing so much during a test that I blank out. I am usually super calm during and before tests.

My “passions” are all a falsity; I do them not out of self-enjoyment, but of the image it creates for me and the praise I get from those around me. I go to the gym not out of drive to make myself better in my eyes, but in the eyes of others. I talk to others to make them happy, and feel good, but I never get that same return myself. I feel so alone, yet am so surrounded by “friends” and family. I don’t think I’ve ever looked myself in the mirror and said “You look good today, Gabriel.” Or “I love myself.”  
I can’t love myself. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what I think about myself. All that matters, what truly matters, is who I am in the eyes of others. Image is everything, and will continue to be.  
  
I’ve been told by many I’m an attractive person. I don’t believe them. I never will, most likely. Again, it doesn’t matter what I believe, but it does matter what others do. I’m aware I shouldn’t speak of the matters of the heart, as I am young, so I may say things with a naiveté that others may find idiotic. Yet the one thing I crave, the thing that makes me happiest, or feel happiest, is the thought of a lover. The thought of a girl meant for me, that I can be everything for, and that can be my everything. That I care for deeply, and am cared for to the same lengths. A girl who can save me and pull me out of this dark, soul-shattering mess of loneliness, self-loathing, and depression, and say “ You’re enough for me. I am here for you. I’m not going anywhere.” I have extremely terrible attachment and abandonment issues, as I’m sure you, dear reader, can tell. I’ve tried everything possible to find this love of mine, to find this girl that’s meant for me. I’ve chased, and I’ve waited. I’ve cared not, and I’ve cared. And every time one gets close enough, gets even a little interested, it only takes a look, and a few words, and I’ve called head over heels. A few words that can be lied. A look that can be faked. Words that have been lied. Looks that have been faked. The second I show even a fraction of care, of affection, they run. They are drawn in by my looks, but as soon as they peel back my skin and I be myself, they run. I hate how much I loathe myself, how much I am starved of affection, that the second a different person shows love, I take it as a god-given sign that it is “meant to be”. It never is. It never has been. I’ve never had a relationship before, gotten to experience romantic love. And I want it so badly. I deserve it, I am told, by many people, yet am scorned time and time again. It is so easy for people to say “you’ll find someone”. They never say when. Or who. Or how. Because they don’t truly know. No girl wants to be with a boy who gets attached too easily, and becomes too scared that they’ll stop caring about them. Yet that is me, and that is being myself. Sixteen years without a lovers touch, a kiss, or even a word. And yet, the world moves on.  
  
My mother fears I’ll turn to drugs or substances as I’m falling ever deeper into the chasm of my emotions. She thinks I’m like every other blathering idiot teenager who thinks that it’s fine to vape, or do crack, pot, or heroin. I am not. However, I have started hurting myself. Nothing too serious. I’ve taken matches and burned them into myself, and the worst thing I’ve done is cut and bite myself. It matters not. I am told I’m attractive. I would not be told that if people saw what lies beneath my clothing. They would see burns. Cuts. Pain. They would see me as I see myself. And one day, they wouldn't see anything at all.  
  
My heart is shattered steel. Hardened, yet broken, like my body, and my mind. I crave the one thing that is always within reach, yet too far to grasp. I am not ungrateful for my fortunate life, but am not happy with it. I am depressed, lonely in the deepest sense, and will never achieve anything. Thank you, dear reader, for listening to an overly privileged teenage white boy cry like a whelp about his meaningless problems and empty existence. I bid thee adieu, and close the curtains on my performance for the day.

My sibling is depressed and I feel useless,1716083236.0,"My younger sibling and I were very close growing up. We’re only one year apart so it was easy to get along and play together. Despite getting along, we had very different personalities. I was the goody-two-shoes and they were the trouble maker. Whenever they would get scolded by teachers, our parents, other kids, etc., I always stood up for them. I love my sibling with all my heart. They are my best friend to this day and I would do anything for them. Now that we are older, both of us being in college, I understand that I can’t always fight their battles for them, but it is so rough seeing them struggle. They did very well in high school and got a full ride to a prestigious college, but it feels as if everything has been going downhill since. They have had a lot of bad experiences with people at the college and don’t really fit in. Their grades have decreased dramatically and they are often sick, whether it is a bad cold or throwing up randomly. I convinced them to talk to a counselor/therapist and they were diagnosed with bipolar disorder. They took meds for a while but they insist that none of it works. Right now, they are back home for summer break and we’ve had some time to talk. They don’t enjoy doing anything they usually did. They don’t like eating because they hate that they’ve gained weight. They told me that they hate their reflection and just don’t feel alive. They reassured me that they won’t do anything to endanger their life but I feel as if they are slipping through my fingers slowly. No amount of talking seems helpful, in fact, they seem more and more over it the more I talk to them. I keep having dreams that I lose them. Whenever they send a text I feel like it will be their last one because its so ominous. They just seem so dead inside and I don’t know what to do. My family is very conservative and religious, so my parents don’t believe in mental health illnesses. When my sibling went to counseling and got diagnosed, it was all behind my parents back because they would never allow it. Because of that, it would be almost impossible to convince them that my sibling needs meds and professional mental health help. I simply do not know what to do. I feel so hopeless and useless. I don’t want to lose them. I don’t think I can live in a universe without them. I don’t want to live without them, life would not be worth living. If I lose them, I’ll have no one.

Lost 125lbs and I'm still hideous ,1716083522.0,"I feel like shit.
I don't even know where to post this, so I'm posting it here. 
I've lost 125lbs and I hate it. People at the gym come up to me and say that I'm half the size I was before, that I'm doing so good. It's all bullshit and I hate it. I don't want to be known for losing weight. I can't wait to get these lose skins chopped off and move the fuck on with my life. I don't care how much weight I've lost, it doesn't matter, it's not enough.

I'm pissed. I work twice as hard as I possibly can and still look like shit. I know I'll never be skinny or pretty like every other chick you see in the gym or online. I wasnt even one of the fat pretty ones. Standing next to them when I weighed almost 300lbs I felt inhuman, like a giant disgusting monster. I know I'll never look like them, so I made it my mission to get as strong and as fit as humanly possible. Today I was able to dumbell chest press the 50s for a set of 8, then 7 and then 5. I can do 100 body weight pull ups, run a mile in 10 mins and 30 seconds (working to get it in under 10). My deadlift max is 280 (I weigh 154) shoulder press the 40s for 2-3 sets, etc. None of that fucking matters. Guys could care less... I'm ugly, so it's not impressive and it doesn't matter. Losing weight isn't even that big of an achievement, so many other people have done the same exact thing. I still feel inhuman.

Oh, and there's this dude that I see every single day that claims were just ""best friends with benefits"" yet acts like a boyfriend and gets mad when I say I'm going to spend time with someone else. He likes other chick's posts, so I share them and he doesnt like it when I share it and I don't understand why I'll never be good enough. I just want to look like every other chick my age (I'm 24) but I have to continue to hide in ugly baggy clothes, I don't like anything that I own. I won't buy anything that I like because I continue to lose body fat and will be having skin removal sugery asap ( Im at 21% the goal is anthing below 20% and then sugery. I dont care if thats low Im going to have abs. After sugery ill begin mma and cross fit). I see all of these posts and all these females look amazing after weight loss and don't have the skin (my stomach legit looks exactly the same as before weight loss) and here I am, still just as hideous, worthless...

The last time I felt this way I fell in love with the gym. Now there's nothing besides possibly returning to self harm, wich only helps temporarily anyways. I don't know what to do. I just want to look like and be able to do the things that everyone else my age is doing. I just want to matter to someone and be respected and not used. I'm getting so tired... again... I don't want to feel this way... again. If I can't enjoy my body and still strongly resemble Shrek then it's all been pointless.

"a part of me feels violated, a part of me feels i am to blame for consenting. i just know i can't stop thinking about it. i deeply regret partaking in a roleplay with an older woman when i was merely 20.",1716080755.0,"i am writing this on a throwaway as i have never told anyone this, and i don't actually know how to feel about it.

  
i was a depressed, self loathing and insecure newly independent individual and part of an online chat community at the time. a lot of those people were really close friends of mine even though we had never physically met.  
at the time i was 20, and at the center of this group was a woman in her early 30s dealing with her own issues, dating another woman in the group and for the most part it was a group where we talked about general interested and nerdy things. aka a normal chat group. however, at some point an nsfw channel was created as we had moved to discord from previous software.

  
at the time i was exploring my own situation, i had just recently moved from home and knew i was interested in bdsm. but i had nobody i knew or trusted to talk about it, growing up most people had outright stated disgust or called people who enjoyed bdsm things like 'freaks' whenever it came up in a discussion. dealing with my own trauma of bullying and alienation i kept it part of myself, feeling like it was another thing proving to the world that something was wrong with me.

  
at some point bdsm was mentioned in the nsfw group by the woman in question, at the point we were friends, so i carefully reached out mostly to ask questions, try to learn from someone who was also interested in the same thing. i had some serious issues with guilt and shame and i hoped to learn and get better from this. nothing happened at this point but we talked, including that i found out things about her and her girlfriends relationship.

  
as time went on, it was clear things were shifting until it outright lead to the creation of a seperate channel just for nsfw things in relation to one of the mods shutting down the nsfw channel as we had gotten an influx of younger people, it was quite a mixed group at that time. At the time I joined that wanting to still have an outlet to talk about things. But as I was mentally unwell so I would find out that she was aswell, but when I did stuff had deteriorated.

  
while she had a relationship she had always been open about the fact that she was poly, especially in relationship to the kink scene. and the nsfw channel quickly started devolving into her dragging people into that sort of thing, even if it was done slowly at first. in my own depression, and self loathing i had gotten convinced way earlier that nobody would ever want me, that there was no hope for me on the relationship front, especially not with bdsm.

  
she started to flirt with me, well knowing my interests.

  
at the time i was still establishing myself in a new town, i had few friends and generally felt lonely, i was careful at first but a part of me was drawn to play along which i did. and gradually it got more indepth, all of this was online, but it started to include real life roleplay and commands, i had known she was older than me, that i should have been careful but i was so desperate and getting a sort of attention i had never experienced before. i let my own desires start running ahead of me, usually leaving me feeling grossed out by myself. but i also felt like i couldn't stop, because i wanted the attention of someone, the notion that somebody cared.

  
while i did not know it at the time, she had started growing increasingly unwell herself, ending up in fights with her partner and becoming more engrossed in general, trying to make bdsm as big a part of her life as she could. roleplay had turned to photos from my end, it was one sided, and it was clear it wasn't a 'relationship' from her end but at the time i thought it was okay. at it's peak she gifted me a collar, which i did buy myself so it was never really a gift.

  
it became names, obligations and a roleplay that started affecting my life, i wish i had realized what was going on at the time but this was when things started falling apart. there was a huge fight between her and her partner, the community itself reeled and she became increasingly distant, from having led on and pushed me towards this for months she now retreated but still whenever we talked tried to keep the thing going. I at the time intentionally started to cut back a bit on it but I had come to rely on her in a way that i know is unhealthy, something she had both encouraged and pushed for that she now withheld. if we ever did anything, as i realized now it only went till she felt satisifed/done and usually ended with her ghosting me for prolonged periods of times before returning and repeating the same sort of kind, flirting into a session into ghosting. at the time i was too unwell to understand and she always ended up making me feel guilty. she called me demanding, a burden and that i was being selfish, i finally read her behaviour as a need to step back and did so but she would always come back, always try to start the same process again, encouraging and telling it's fine regardless of what i did. it didn't help that i was still young, and unwell and relied a bit on her validation and encouragement to deal with my own issues. it was never fair on my end.

  
and by the side things on her side went extremly bad, i hadn't realized it at the time but i wasn't the only one she kept repeating this process with, and outside of that including reasons for her fight with her partner was growing issues at home including self harm and suicidal ideation.  
I tried to help after a while, without bdsm, I still thought of her as a friend despite everything and for a while things seemed to improve, she had broken up with her partner at that point but seemed more stable. i generally tried to stay away and not not contact her too much, except she contacted me. at the time she had found a new partner and she tried to start again with, i wish i had been as i am now, more rational and should have stayed away but after a while we resumed, i thought it had stabilized, but quickly it resumed to the previous levels of ghosting, roleplay and eventually the comments of me being a burden. at least it was scarcer as she spent more time with her new partner. and while i was unwell at that point i made a choice and i told her that i can't keep doing this like this anymore.

  
i am not a person good at confrontations but i felt that i couldn't do this anymore.

  
shortly thereafter while she didn't contact me again, her partner did. he called me selfish and similarly a burden and that i needed to stop putting demands on her and be more considerate. at the time i mostly felt guilt, while she had been the initiator i knew i had been problematic and affected her negatively.

  
at the time i consented to all of this out of desperation, inexperience and self loathing. i am not claiming i am innocent, nor that this was some form of overstepping on her part but i have mixed feelings and a lot of regret about what happened. not to mention that following it my own guilt and shame over my own sexuality trippled, damaging real friendships and crushes i had and generally harmed my mental health the years thereafter including my own, albeit avoided suicide attempt at one point. Yet thanks to that and some other things I did recover, I did get better and it's been years both since this happened and since I got better but recently it's been on my mind a lot. a part of me feel violated, that our situation was too skewed and imbalanced. a part of me feels guilt, i feel like it was my fault for consenting to it in the first place and letting it happen. i tried to remember thing as well as i could but i am realizing my memory is foggy, some things have been mixed up and i am probably coming off too skewed against her as we were both in bad places..

I don’t know what to do or what the right answer is,1716083405.0,I’ve known my bf for 12 years we were best friends for 7 of those years. We’ve dated on and off for a while now but he tells me he only loves me. He is the only one to ever leave and even when we’re apart I stay loyal to him.

I never struggled with mental health up until these past years and I feel like I’m currently at my worst. I feel like nothing I do can ever be right and I think a big part of it is this relationship.

I know everyone says he isn’t good to me and I should leave but when he leaves me I am more sad than ever.

Miserable but too exhausted with life to do anything about it.,1716083397.0,"Some background...

11 year colon cancer survivor. Have fairly severe gastrointestinal issues from surgery that I CAN mostly manage but it requires revolving life around a very strict and encumbering routine that I was sick of and completely over YEARS ago. I struggle with immense anxiety that I would mostly say is caused by the amount of dread I have about being required to exist. Hope that makes sense. Every day is just such a monotonous slog that thinking about having to do it over and over makes me want to throw up.

I'm medicated with klonopin which helps with the ""omg I feel like I'm dying"" panic attacks but I still have a generally pervasive disdain for life and more or less everything that it asks of me. I have no patience or tolerance for people because I am constantly so miserable with myself that I have nothing positive to project. 

The problem is that I am the way that I am and have been doing it for so long that I am exhausted with life to the point where the concept of caring enough to do anything that might help is a foreign concept. I don't know what happy is. I haven't felt it in years and have no motivation to go on what I feel like is a unicorn hunt in order to find what I don't feel exists for me.

I don't work because I can't and am in the middle of a disability claim that will take 2 years and assuredly be denied so I'm broke all the time which helps the self worth thing a lot. I don't really know what the end game is when they deny that so there's a lot of stressful hopelessness on top of everything else.

I imagine this is where people who are capable of doing so end their life but I'm just not wired that way. The sense of obligation to the people who it would hurt has and will always keep me from doing that which kind of  makes my situation feel like a prison. 

I don't even know what I'm asking or what I'm searching for or hoping for someone to say.

Something's wrong with my brain,1716081329.0,I'm 16 and I think there is something wrong with my brain. It feels like I got so dumb and I can't put my thoughts into words. I'm even struggling with writing this. I zone out all the time having conversations in my head but I don't do it that much in public. When somebody talks to me I don't know what to say unless it's something simple. If I don't know what to say I just say something dumb without thinking or smile awkwardly. I can tell when somebody thinks I'm weird or is making fun of me but I don't know how to react. I don't know how to stand up for myself at all because I'm afraid of looking dumb. People also tell me I speak quiet and monotone. I forget what I was going to say or think about all the time too. When I do a presentation in school I have an anxiety attack or something and it's so embarrassing. I used to be smart but now I feel so dumb. I understand what I'm supposed to do in social situations but I can't do it. I'm also really awkward. The only times I didn't feel like this is when I ate an edible and when I took acid. When I ate the edible for some reason I got so much better at talking and I had way more energy and the same thing happened with the acid. I know it's bad to be doing that this young but I don't think that's what caused this because it's been happening before that. I also don't feel emotions that much and I can't get excited for anything. I just feel the same all the time but sometimes I feel sad and angry. The only time I'm happy is when I'm eating but I don't want to get fat. I literally can't have a normal conversation with anyone because my brain shuts off and I also  don't even know how to talk. I'm sorry if this is hard to read this was so hard to write because I know what I want to say in my head but I can't put it into words.,DetectiveDesperate22,,False,1cvcg9b,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvcg9b/somethings_wrong_with_my_brain/
Can you have compulsions without having OCD?,1716081328.0,"I was talking to my friend about some compulsive behaviors I have- specifically two. One is the need to stare at my alarms when I set them at night to make sure I set them correctly and double check after I put it down to make sure they didn’t accidentally get turned off, if I don’t I have a very hard time falling asleep because I’m worried that they weren’t set correctly so I do it every night. The other is centered around shopping, I’ve always had really bad spending habits in general and just buy things I like without thinking but in the last year or two I’ve noticed a lot of the times I’ll see something I want to buy and if I don’t, I will not be able to stop thinking about it and feel like I absolutely need to have it until I eventually buy it. This doesn’t happen all the time and I definitely have worked on it a lot to where it doesn’t happen as often as it did before. She told me it sounds like I have OCD but I told her that I don’t think that’s necessarily true, just that there are certain compulsions that come up but it’s not something impedes my ability to function. Also for context- I started seeing a psychiatrist about a month ago who diagnosed me with general anxiety disorder, an “unspecified mood disorder that sounds like bipolar 2”, and most likely ADHD but I still need to do an official screening. During the first appointment t where we did the overall screening when it came to the questions relating to OCD I scored very low.  I guess my question is do people have compulsions without having OCD?",nosrslythatsrlyhot,,False,1cvcg92,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvcg92/can_you_have_compulsions_without_having_ocd/
Stuck in the past (ruminating),1716080983.0,"hey so i am (F19) now in college, but the negative comments/experience I had had in high school sticks to me. I had moved around high school freshman - sophomore (covid for half of freshman and full year for sophomore)  year i stayed a new high school in a new district, moved again junior year to the old district in a new high school. I had known some people from elementary, tried to catch up, it was good for the first half of the year, but later on it went downhill. people (girls) were not that nice, I would say that I use positive reinforcement in a negative way. 

Some girls who I thought were my friends would sometimes say things and in the moment, I would feel for a second that it was hurtful, but because I like to protect myself, I painted it as maybe a joke, them being playful, and I did that for the rest of the school year. It was really the first time people ever really dug at me. I am not good at confrontation and I don't like to see the truth if I know that it will hurt me. 

It was the typical things, pretending to be your friends upfront, or making comments surrounding your body, backbiting, being judge mental, making comments surrounding my intelligence, (i would ditch, but i was really sad and I constantly looked for anything to make me happy) I know that from high school to older age, you do hit puberty again and I was a bit skinnier back then and sometimes their comments would revolve around my body and now that I have gained a few pounds I can feel the old comments being reinforced (in my head). Or some comments that I am not that pretty, and somethings I believe in those comments, even though i know they aren't true, I know a part of me believes it. It's hard to think that people who have done you wrong will live a peaceful life. 

We live around the same area so smths I fear (even when writing this) that they may see this post or see me and laugh. I have struggled with my sense of self esteem, since I have been little. I tend to cover it by trying to appear confidence, which backfires and I usually end up being cocky. I try to cover it with makeup or my hair, but I know that when I take it all of, it isn't me. 

I am obsessed with them and I can find myself ruminating with the idea. I have already talked with a counselor ( i went online for senior year to get mental health) and I fear when I see them (old classmates, not the girls in general) that they smths look at, some have asked, one followed me for a bit, and I know it is none of their business, but it still haunts me. 

I constantly feel the need to prove something to them even though they are no longer in my life, maybe my ego is hurt, but I tried talking to counselors and they seem frustrated that I'm stuck in the same situation, so I'm afraid. I want to be better and live free of them. 

How do I move forward, live in the present, not fear them anymore, and improve my self esteem. It seems I pretend to be confident ends up in being cocky and cry bcuz deep down I know I’m insecure 

  
please if any advice, whether hard truth or anything nice, I am open",kairi240,,False,1cvcc95,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvcc95/stuck_in_the_past_ruminating/
Advice requested ,1716080616.0,"This may be a bit of a rant as well but there’s so much going on in my head right now, I have no real direction. 

I never really thought I was neurodivergent until the last couple of years after I had my son. Started with depression due to my ex husband wanting a divorce and cheating on me while I was pregnant. My “symptoms” have exploded since then and continue to get worse. My PCP at the time didn’t think there was anything wrong and put me on sertraline to start. I weaned myself off and had been med free until this year when it would have been my 5 year wedding anniversary. i had found a drop of hope with my new job who effected housing and good pay for my experience in the field. I moved on site at the end of January 2024. I found a new pcp a month ago and she said I had to get evaluated by a specialist in order for her to prescribe medication, and she also put me on a new antidepressant: a Wellbutrin XL. Shortly after that visit I found out my health insurance was no longer valid. This past Monday, I was laid off my job and given a month to find new housing. My divorce/child possession decree stated I had to live in this county. No child support. I’m devastated. I don’t have any real family to help and nowhere to go. I feel like my brain has been rotting for the last couple of years. I get distracted super easily and it’s difficult for me to stay on task. With no official diagnosis, and I can’t afford to seek out a specialist, I’m feeling incredibly defeated and lost.

Does anyone have any advice on how to obtain any kind of assistance? Housing? Healthcare? 

How do those of you with adhd/autism cope without medications? What kind of jobs do you have? My only job experience has been in veterinary clinics/customer care. I have no degree or certifications. Are there any work from home options that would allow me to make my own schedule, since I cannot afford childcare?

I’ve already gotten distracted from this, so I’ll end it here. Thank you so much for any help you may have to offer. ",Nothebrightescrayon2,,False,1cvc82y,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cvc82y/advice_requested/
Why do we always say we are the problem?,1716079747.0,"Hi. I (32m) always wonder why we have to classify us as the problem in life. We deal with real issues on a daily basis, anxiety, depression, ptsd, etc, yet people look and treat us like we are problems to society, that we are the cause of all the pain to our families, our loved ones. I’ve struggled with issues my whole life! The feeling of being abandoned by friends and family, constant stress, depression, anxiety, ptsd. I’m just so tired of feeling like I’m the one who has the problems in all of my relationships. I am who I am, I CAN’T change who I am as a person. I have to learn to cope, to manage my problems to be a better version of myself. To all those people in my life who can’t accept me for who I am, than good riddance, I don’t need you in my life! I need real friends who will be there for me no matter what. Who will ask to be involved in my life, or try to be involved in my life. If all I’m good for is a work friend, or acquaintance, than you’re not a real friend that I need in life. For those of you who are struggling and need to vent off to someone or just need someone to be a real friend to listen to you, than hit me up. You are NOT alone in this world, don’t think that you don’t matter and that your issues don’t matter. You must love yourself before you can really open up and let other people in your life and when you get to that point of loving yourself, your true friends will appear and be there for you!

I want to get better but I have no clue how, nobody else is giving good, genuine advice so I'm here. I've been called a lost cause and I refuse to accept that. I want to be better.

A few things that may help when giving advice: I can not afford therapy or a antidepressants. I struggle with an ED that fluctuates (I'm fine at the moment, but at any given time I could snap and start hating my body/stop eating). I've attempted in the past and still struggle with these thoughts occasionally, not severely but they're still there. I struggle with bottling up emotions. I never learned proper self care. I have severe procrastination/motivation issues. I have been sexually assaulted multiple times and am a victim of incest/cosca, which impacts my life quite a bit. I am stuck in a failry constant state of dissosiation and jusy generally not feeling real/feeling too real.

I thought things would get better but they got... empty,1716078784.0,"Recently I went through some exams which I wasn't too worried about at the start, but due to technical difficulties, ended up being an absolute nightmare. The experience was probably some of the darkest times in my life so far. These exams are what decide whether I get to go to university or not, and lost work meant that they went wrong - really wrong. After being approved for extra time and multiple sequential sleepless nights filled with blood sweat and tears, I managed to recover my project and get it to a state where I was relatively happy with it. I thought that after the nightmare was over I could go back to feeling myself, the confidence I had before the experience. But I haven't.

The weekend after I finished I went back home to visit friends and had a wonderful few days with them. These are people I miss dearly since I moved, so seeing them is always a great way for me to decompress. I felt myself again and it was amazing. However when I came home I just began to spiral. I don't even find myself worrying about the exams specifically, I just feel lonely and empty. Physically, I feel run down. Mentally, I feel drained and alone. I had all these plans for personal projects to work on with my free time that I have been looking forward to for months but now that I have the time any attempts at working on them leave me feeling defeated. Even my own hobbies, things I usually do to relax, just bore me. I have no confidence, I have no life, I don't know what I can do to fix it.

This was supposed to be the light at the end of the tunnel, I'm supposed to be enjoying the summer. I feel like a fraud, nothing particularly bad is going on in my life right now but I still feel like this, why?

I have spent years trying to build my self back up from some dark times in my past, and I have felt fortunate enough to be able to say I am happy in recent times. But I feel like I'm slipping, in fact I feel worse than I ever have right now. The fact that merely a set of bad of exams was able to knock me so far makes me question whether I ever really made any progress in the first place.

My ex girlfriend might want to kill herself,1716061800.0,"Hello,


I have been together with my girlfriend for a year, long term distance relationship seeing each other every 2 ish weeks, sometimes every week, we spent quite a bit of time together in real life.

Her family is very muslim, I am very atheist. I told her 6 months ago I would fake-convert, I shouldn't have said that because later in the relationship when we talked about kids and everything I started to imagine what me fake converting would imply (e.g. what if the parents are visiting and my kids are there i have to be a fake muslim with my kids around, among other things).

If I don't convert her family would dissapprove greatly (she would go to hell and thus they are kind of dissaproving out of love) and she doesn't want to hurt her family so I would have to convert. Being atheist is kind of a core belief of mine. I am absolutely convinced organised religion is not true. We broke up, it seems like she blames me for not ""giving the religion a chance"", kind of. But I think she makes those arguments cause she's not thinking clearly and is just so distressed from losing me. She's crying all the time and she thinks about suicide a lot. Yesterday she crossed a busy road in traffic without looking. 

When we call she can seem normal and understanding at one point, and then blame me for not trying hard enough and never caring about her etc. I don't know what to do, I'm scared. I ask her to seek help in form of therapy or psychiatrist. Sometimes she's receptive of it but sometimes she blames me for just wanting her to not kill herself and that I just feel guilty for her feeling this way that's why I want her to get mental help.",No-Plastic-2286,,False,1cv5m99,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cv5m99/my_ex_girlfriend_might_want_to_kill_herself/
