My FP treats me poorly. Idk how to change this,1714506404.0,"My FP is a narcissistic man. He makes no attempt to hide the fact that he talks to other women. He can be very needy towards me and cruel. 

But I can’t ignore him. He’s the first person I think about when I wake up. He never leaves my mind. He tells me he loves me, typical love bombing (promises to marry me, wants me to have his babies) and even though I know better I fall for it every time. 

I think I must have no self respect. To love someone so much when they don’t feel the same. He is my favorite person and I’m not even a blip on his radar. He swears he loves me, misses me, we talk all the time. But he’s a player and I feel like a pawn. 

I’m struggling. It’s been bad lately. He told me he kissed another woman and I started splitting, I was enraged. I would rather he have just had sex with someone because kissing seems so much more intimate. 

I have nobody else to vent to about this. I need to talk. I need advice. ",Throwaway192722,,False,1ch1v62,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ch1v62/my_fp_treats_me_poorly_idk_how_to_change_this/

Person ive been dating for 2 months heard his first meltdown on the phone yesterday and im having such a BPD response to it,1624986438.0,"It happened. The one thing I was so scared of and he heard the whole thing. The crying, the scream, the muttering to myself to ""stop it"". He heard me punch the wall. He heard the hyperventilating whilst I was trying to calm down and pull myself together. He called me back after I hung up the phone because I couldn't keep myself contained and I was so embarrassed that he was having to deal with all the shit I was putting on him. He text me asking for me to talk to him when I didnt answer his 2 call attempts. He picked up when I called him back a few minutes later apologising for hanging up in the first place. He stayed on the phone through more crying, more hyperventilating, through the exasperated, pathetic attempts at explaining why this happens as if im just daring him to say that this ""isn't what he signed up for"" and walk away. Telling him just how humiliating it feels to have every fiber of yourself feel as though it is dependant on validation and reassurance from everyone just so I dont spiral. I had to explain how I start to feel all the urges of self harming and being self destructive were coming flooding back. Every pause, every break in my rambling, I felt the silence stab me in my gut. The knife twisting as I felt almost incapable of shutting up as my mouth poured out more and more stuff for him to use as excuses to leave this behind.

The phone call ended with me saying I had to prepare for a zoom recovery meeting in a couple of hours and had to get myself together. I felt humiliated, numb, empty, like all I wanted to do was just not have to be alive anymore. 

I messaged him later that day saying thank you for listening and for being patient with me and he said no worries. Aside from asking him where I could find something online and getting no reply until today, ive heard nothing and its driving my anxiety and abandonment issues through the fucking sky, let alone the ceiling. I messaged once more early this afternoon asking how he was doing today and nothing.

I'm trying all I can to remain calm and rationalise the facts to myself but with every passing hour its getting harder and harder to not give in to the assumption that, thats it. 
Fact 1, hes a stoner and I already know that it gets to his memory sometimes
Fact 2, he is notoriously bad at speedy replies and his friends have confirmed this for me as well

Please tell me I have nothing to worry about, I cant concentrate on anything as a distraction, I feel like im slipping in and out of dissociation, I didnt eat yesterday and am only now sitting down to try and eat a frozen pizza because I know my body needs something. How do I stop getting so dependant on other peoples validation because I cannot keep dating if I cant control this. I can handle the meltdowns, but this??

What should I do after a breakup from the most supportive and trusted relationship,1624242711.0,"I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago and thought that I couldn't stand it. Luckily for me, my ex-boyfriend was with me at that time. He was patient, took care of me, gave me hope and trust. It was a bad time for both of us and we passed it together. For the last 3 years, I think I have escaped from this syndrome and we were living a good life. I trusted him totally cause he's not only the man who be by my side when I'm at the worst point, he's also my friend for more than 10 years, I thought I knew everything about him. 

But last month, he suddenly broke up with me. It was a real shock cause we were still discussing marriage the day before and there's no warning sign for it. And now I'm feeling terrible. I'm feeling like I'm abandoned, thrown away like trash and I can't control my feeling anymore. Sometimes all the good memories turn back and I miss him so much, but right after that, I'll be reminded that he left me cruelly and I can just feel anger and hatred for him. Those feelings always fill in me and I can't focus on my work or anything else. I'm just miserable all the time, so many negative feeling, I don't know how to describe more detailly.

it's just kind of sad. i like the idea of being creative - writing songs, painting, drawing, making jewelry etc, but whenever i try to do something like that, i get frustrated because nothing ever turns out how i want it to, and i don't ever give myself space or time to learn, and then i go back to what i know (which is rewatching youtube vids while playing some dumb game on my phone).

Emotionally abusive and manipulative parents,1613153396.0,"I honestly always believe there is something wrong with me. Like i feel like i had to grow up too quick due to having parents that couldn't manage their emotions. And they are soooo emotionally and mentally abusive. I cannot tell them anything or show any emotion without them undermining mine or making fun of me. Its probably because they are hard people who probably never had their feelings/thoughts validated but it still stings every time. Many people talk about how abusive their ethnic parents are online and i hate how its just considered normal. Like why cant they solve their own issues before they become parents. Am I wrong for wanting to be away from them? My dad is the most rediculous person i know. About 3 years ago he got arrested for domestic abuse and had to leave my house. Due to this I only see him about 1 time every couple of weeks. He had the nerve to ask my siblings why i never reach out to him. I was shocked that he would even ask that considering he is the grown adult and i was a busy high school student at the time. To him, providing financially is all that matters and even if he could he barely kept his promises to help me learn to drive/buy me a car. I never press him to buy anything for me.

"I(25F) told my mum I want to talk tomorrow but I have no idea what I even want to say - Confront my emotional neglect or just go NC?? T.w. neglect, self harm, OD",1609810694.0,"Thanks in advance to anyone that reads and responds x 

Tl;dr - HAE confronted their parent/s about the damage they've caused, how did you do it and how did it go?? 

I know that this is probably going to be a fruitless exercise and I will more than likely walk away feeling x10 worse than I did going into it but something within me wants to try before I go back home to my flat the day after. 

Bit of backstory: I've been staying with my mum and stepdad since Dec. 19th and up until boxing day, things had been going pretty well. Since boxing day I've been totally ignored and all the feelings of emotional abuse and neglect that I've worked/still working so hard to overcome from childhood came rushing back with a vengeance. Ive spent several nights in tears, at least 2 evenings/nights wanting to self harm again, one night spent lightly self harming and ive reached the limit to what I am willing to put up with from her. 

Now I've tried several times to talk to my mum about the way I feel about how she acts and treats me, sometimes she seems to change for a few weeks before something inevitably angers her and she goes right back to her old narcissistic, emotionally immature ways. 

My older sister went non contact with her and moved away several years ago and I have been considering going non contact for the last couple years but something in me is holding onto hope that one day I will get through to her. 

I know many of you will say that it is pointless, that people like this dont change but I wouldn't forgive myself if I just went NC without trying one last time. The biggest problem I'm having though is that I have no frickin idea how on earth to begin this conversation. I know the gist of what I want to say to her but im scared she'll do the usual and just get defensive and angry for me essentially pointing out all the things she's done wrong as a parent. The inner child in me is screaming to be validated and to hear her say that she is sorry and if im honest, I am screaming at myself the same things. I understand that I need to be able to heal myself and shouldn't rely on her to do this in order for me to move on but no matter how hard I try (and I am really fucking trying) I cant seem to let the idea go. I'm pretty sure that this is because there are times when things between us are good and we can laugh together and talk like normal people without me feeling like im on edge just being in the same room as her. However, most of the time I feel like im either stuck in ""Freeze mode"" (the 4 F's) any time she talks to me, or one of the others (I can go into ""Fight mode"" very quickly because of my BPD which tend to just make any situation worse) 

Now, middle of last year I ended up in hospital a couple nights because of an OD and after that I feel like my mum started to take my mental health slightly more seriously because I told her that she was a lot to blame for how I had been feeling. I also recieved two diagnosis' last year of C-PTSD and BPD. This isn't something I feel my mum takes very seriously and this is one thing I know I want to talk to her about. 

Things my mum likes to do during these convos in the past include but aren't limited to:
- say I should move on and let things go
- gets angry/sarcastic/defensive
- starts playing the victim 

How do I tell my mum about all of these things without sounding preachy or nagging and just making her angry and defensive??",SingingWanderer1195,,False,kqnfuc,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/kqnfuc/i25f_told_my_mum_i_want_to_talk_tomorrow_but_i/
What triggers your Abandonment Fears,1607972066.0,"Simple question. 

What triggers your Abandonment Fears? What makes you fear your FP is going to leave?

For me, here are just a few.

1. Unanswered texts/calls for greater than 30ish min. Usually only affected when I don't have something else distracting me. 

2.  Angry/upset/distressed tone of voice. Often fixed by calming tone of voice/words of affirmation/reassurance. 

3. When your FP hangs out with someone other than you without you, even if its family or close friends. I've been able to be really self aware of this one and manage it internally for the most part, surprisingly but its still a trigger. 

4. Having disagreements/arguments/different opinions than your FP.

Splitt,1604201631.0,"Hey, could some of you describe to me what splitting is to you, like an example if you feel comfortable? I have yet to really get a good enough description of this, but I feel like it's a big problem for me and not one that I am very self aware of.  People often comment that I feel strongly about two opposing things, sometimes in the same sentence. 

I'm obviously more concerned about splitting in relationships, bc I don't like feeling like I fucking hate the people I like, but seems to be the case fairly often.  

Weird thing is, there are many of my relationships that are less/ not at all intense, just healthy and good, sometimes also when I am in those dirty-spirals of relationships (and yes, in those times of course I forget that these people exist and positively influence my life).   

I suppose there are some variables, but in theory shouldn't I split on those people too?

"Friend(25M) of my flatmate(27M and me(24F) keeps making advances and suggestions at being sexual with me, I came close to kicking him out several times.",1598959477.0,"OK so this weekend was Friend's chance to show that he could behave himself and he totally fucked up.

**Tl:dr - male friend going through relationship issues, alongside potential sex addiction, tries to make out with me/get sexual/convince me to follow suit giving excuses etc.**

A little history on first time (cliff notes): me, flatmate, Friend and GF have dinner together in my flat. Dinner/chatting/messing around and being silly moves onto some drinking and a game of spin the bottle. Dares started off too extreme and were mostly sexy or sexual in some way so as game progressed, things just got more and more out of control. There was a lot of tension between me and Friend (I admit I find him attractive but him being with GF vastly outweighs any notion of me disrupting that with malicious intent). Tension also between me and GF as we're both also Bi. So everyone was being touchy/cuddly with everyone. 
*important note to remember* ALL NIGHT at any time something sexual occurred between Friend or GF with either me or flatmate, consent was ALWAYS asked for and given before amything went ahead and if anyone didn't agree or feel comfortable, the idea was changed to suit.

Flatmate gets tired so me, Friend and GF go back to their house so as not to disturb the rest of the night. Back to their's, all still drunk and on some MDMA at this point. They both start on speed once at their house, whilst continuing to drink, I start to slow down, mainly smoking weed and having drinks more slowly, enjoying the night rounding off. Friend keeps being sexual and kissing me whenever GF isn't in the room, telling me to initiate/convince GF into a 3some. She seems to give consent for Friend to go ahead with me but doesn't want to get into things, becomes very off, wanders off, sees a couple of things me and Friend did at some point. I notice that she had disappeared to the bathroom roughly 20mins ago after saying she was going to the loo once returning from a walk. I go to check on her, discover her on bathroom floor, blood everywhere and slice across her wrist/hand.

Not seen spoken to either since getting dropped home after helping Friend keep her stable until medics arrived, took her to AnE, he followed some time after, not before making FURTHER advances on me after maybe 2 hours of his GF slicing her arm because he craves physical comfort and validation and his instinct is to get it sexually. Because of a history and mental health struggles of her own (obvs), GF doesnt have sex with Friend on a majority.

SO, as mentioned, this was his chance to make it right. It had been a weird evening all around, a lot had happened in under 12 hours and he has apologised several times. I was willing to move on. Flatmate had met him and other friends for some drinks, flatmate ended up being assisted home by Friend and someone else (lets call him Guy) so he could start to sober a bit but not have to stop socialising. Everything fine until, as suspected, Friend asks to speak to me privately to give me an update on GF (I am the only one other than couple of their family members that know what she did and all events) and their general relationship. Didnt mind this happening so we went into my room as this is the only place for privacy when guests are over. He starts talking, apologises again for our last interaction, although still making statements saying how he doesnt regret it, only the consequences that its caused. He goes to give me a hug which I allowed (im cuddly in general with friends), and he tries to kiss me again.

OK shameful confession, I kissed him back for about 1 maybe 2 seconds before pushing him away and telling him that was the last he was every gonna get, trying to play it off jokingly hoping he would leave it there and back off but he holds onto me and tries again and I have to actually push him and firmly tell him no, reminding him that he was in my house. He also asked, when i went to use my bathroom (i have an en suite), if he could watch, and then if he could listen after being told no (We're open when it come to talking about sexual things as a friend group, no kink shaming people). Leading to me running the tap during all other trips to the loo that night. IN MY OWN FLAT. 

Anyway, I made us move into the front room/kitchen to avoid further advances in a shared space. At some point I went to go an put some shorts on so I could show Guy the tattoos I have on my legs and friend took it that I was purposefully showing myself off, taunting him, eliciting looks from me telling him to fuck off. Further down the line all 5 of us were sat on the sofa, arms round each other, having a moment as you do with friends when you've had a drink and its nearing the end, Friends hand found my arm and kept rubbing it behind flatmates head, thankfully he noticed and, being fully aware of the situation, intervened to save me from awkwardly removing myself.

Several times throughout the night and morning I had to threaten him with him with being kicked out, each time he instantly apologises and backs off. I know he isnt an arsehole as a person but every time he gets drunk (and he was blackout drunk but on coke so holding it together and not staggering all over the place) any and all self control and will power he has vanishes. He isnt aggressive or loud, but he gets emotionally vulnerable and will seek out physical comfort and validation anywhere he can find it. Each time he tried something he would be trying to convince me, ""just one come one, i can feel this tension between us"", even went he left, i walked him to the door, he asked for a hug and i said no, i had to grab his hand as he reached to pull me in.

Flatmate works with Friend and has passed on the message that he is no longer allowed in the flat whenever he's had a drink or is on anything else, which he has openly agreed to. Im just so angry at him and I have told him that he needs to pick a day to come over so that I can have it out with him and he can apologise to me. No response, so i asked flatmate this morning to give him a subtle reminder at work today. I am not letting this go.

"Moving out soon, many questions",1598746957.0,"Posted this in one other group. Hoping posting in two, someone can help out:  Hello everyone. So there is obviously a big change in my life and by the title, I'm moving out soon w my bf. He is thank god very understanding of this condition, told him which type of EDS I have and we've of course made accommodations as to what I could do around the house to help out. I told him it's most likely that I won't be getting a job any time soon after I move out because of this, and also we (as in doctors/the us) won't know how long covid will last and because of me having a weak immune system from having surgery, I just don't trust anyone or anywhere to be safe for me to be going out, letting alone getting a job. There's this factor plus the fact that I did have a couple of jobs my junior year, one was what was supposed to be a trial run, the other an actual job. I managed to pass the interview but they only kept me for 3 days total. And while they paid me for those 3 days, the manager for my kennel crew, (it was a dog adoption place at the mall, really didn't think it was going to be bad, but thoughts were ofc otherwise,) and the kennel person told me that the manager of the store said my work was ""crappy and not good enough"" to be apart of the team so they let me go. And my mom and I figured that before I got hired it was prob best not to say anything about my hEDS or any of my other physical/mental health problems, but we've learned I prob should say something about it in the future. So there was this incident w jobs in the past the other one was supposed to be a trial one and this was in the beginning stages of my parents (mostly my mom and I) figuring out i had BPD (borderline personality disorder). So that disorder itself just makes your mood swings much much higher than everyone elses. For ex lets say the normal scale of everyone's negative moods, and this could be any neg mood, is 1=10, mines 100-1000 this sounds like an exaggeration, but if you've heard or read anything about BPD you would know this isn't because me and others like me experience all neg moods, even positive/happy moods in extreme. So because of this the day of my trial run for my first job, which once again I was even able to pass the interview, and I had just broken up w my first ever bf (now ex, but best friends currently) and because I knew this wasn't his fault for him leaving me (the gen reason was because it had to do w his ex pushing him to leave for him in order to see his son, which turns out later he found out wasn't his at all,) and because of this, devastated ofc, crying the whole day, crying all night before, was the latest i had ever stayed up at the time. And so because i was just so messed up the next day and the day before the trial run the manager of the kennel had me do a couple of things just to see how things were, my body was extremely sore, the most sore I had prob ever been since I had quit dance. Which was huge because I had quit dance in 2014, and this was the year in 2016. Anyways, because of this decided not to do the trial run, ofc I didn't explain too much of my situation. Told her was in bad pain from the day before both men/phys exhausted, (although this was true) and that I couldn't make it to the run. So w all this being said and I did explain every bit to my bf of what happened w my job history he said I could just do some things around the house. The biggest thing he said he would ask me to do was the laundry and then besides that I could just do small chores which I thought was very generous of him. Ofc being me, I felt bad at first that he was making all the money for the house and even though I had been explained by my mom and dad that many couples one works and the other stays at home doing small household chores and they turn out just fine, but I still felt bad. Later, which is present day I don't feel as bad, but I do wonder, w me having hEDS, and being in pain now what seems to be everyday some days ofc worse than others, but it's hard for me to even do things for myself. Is there anyone in this group (which I'm sure there is,) that has moved out recently, and has my type of EDS, my question being that what have you had to prepare for, what things have you had to adjust even after discussing w your partner (if moved in w someone,) and what are some tips or things I need to look out for?

Question about all this,1716397727.0,"I've been on the fence for a long time, being told I might have it but not really understanding what it is, someone told me once it was a blanket term when nothing else seemed to apply but I have a therapist now that specializes in it, hoping to get more insight from her. 

 But I'm curious about something, trying to understand.

This term, favorite person. Could I have one person in my life that would apply to, for years I said he was my only friend and I was fine with that. Absolutely had no one else I would call a friend, could or would talk to, depend on, would willingly spend all my time with. Now it's over, for me, I'm preparing to leave and I'm seriously considering ghosting him.  My last long term relationship was like this, he was my only friend for years but I had to leave him. I broke it off abruptly and pretty coldly.  I guess I'm wondering if anyone else experienced something like this. 10 years of them being the center of my universe but as soon as there's a trust issue(not that that should be taken lightly), I suppose, it's like they never were. I question if I ever really loved him but than I don't even really know myself, so, it's hard to say.

This is not a relationship advice sub. This is not a drama sub. This is not a sub intended for *anything* outside of BPD related advice and support. I understand why the lines blur from time to time, considering a trade mark characteristic of BPD is difficulty with relationships.

There are other subs available for surviving abusive relationships, airing out drama, and venting about your partner. If it doesn’t directly relate to BPD and the affects it has on life and relationships, please post in another sub.

I am not a monster,1716372167.0,"I am slipping away into a very dark place. I am so scared. \
Me and my partner have been together for nearly 2 years. I love him to death. He has his own mental issues and I have mine. We’ve both done wrong to each other and I’ve learned to admit mine and I apologize sincerely to him. \
I am trying to hard to improve, sorry if this post is all over the place I am a mess at the moment.\
So basically he told me he joined a reddit support group for loved ones with bpd. I was so happy to hear that because I thought he was trying to see the world trough my eyes and look for support. \
And then I looked up said subreddit and I cannot shake this panic. That place is not a support group, unless you are leaving/planing to leave someone in your life with bpd. \
Now that is what’s got me spiralling. I cannot lose him, he means the world to me and I just want to get better for myself, so I can do right by him. \
He hardly believes me and I am so scared he will finally ditch me after reading through that sub. \
Please, I need some support. I am not a monster, I don’t want to cause him pain. \
There’s so much more to it than I am able to write now I feel so detached from everything. I just want to be loved. I never wished to have this trauma inflicted upon me by my abusive parents, I just need to be loved. \
My thoughts are so warped I am so lost and so afraid of what I might do, I need him to see I am not a villain, I am sick, but I am seeking help. I cannot cope with this life any further if I lose this connection I have. \
I am so scared, he joined that sub with the best intentions and now I am terrified he will just accept his life is better without me and go through with a breakup. \
I know I am capable of so much more. I just need someone to stay, I am so alone, so tired of fighting to be loved and understood. I hate this illness so much, I don’t know what to do, I guess I am just looking for some support here. Thank you if you read through this.

(TW) Bpd x bpd relationship. Advice?,1716359833.0,"Hi. I never use reddit and just made this account like 10 mins ago so please excuse if I'm not really doing this right. And sorry for the length I've added a ""TLDR"" at the end (is that how you do it?)
TW Substance abuse, Institutions, Suicidal Ideation, Psychosis, Police Brutality, Eating Disorders (possible other tw I forgot to mention)
I am F20 dating someone with bpd M24. We have known each other a year now (started relationship April 2023 then both didnt talk for 3 months May 2023-Sep 2023 because we both went to rehab in different places) and honestly the way we met kinda.. will raise some red flags for some people but honestly I am not looking for anyone to comment on that aspect. We met in a psych ward in April 2023. Both at super low points. I was in a severe manic/psychotic episode as I also struggle with bipolar disorder. I had stayed up for 4 nights straight and maybe eaten 2 meals during that time. When I got there I weighed under 100 pounds. I was having delusions and convinced myself I had alters. I had no idea that the guy I was with was giving me weed that was laced with benzos. He also had laid hands on me and cheated during the relationship as well. I didnt even find out I tested positive for the benzos until a while later. The psychward I went to was absolutaly disgusting and also didn't tell me I had very abnormal blood levels and forced psych meds down my throat. I don't even think it was the right time to start those meds with my weight and health issues and substances in my body. It was pretty much medical abuse. And it was my second ever time, besides when I was 16, going to a mental hospital. My boyfriend, on the other hand, was considered a ""frequent flyer."" He struggled with lots of substance abuse and suicidal thoughts. I would find out later that he admitted himself this time because he was feeling awful about not having his old FP. When I first saw him, he mentioned having BPD in a group therapy and explaining how it was affecting him. My ears perked up listening to him. He was just a great talker, vulnerable, and accountable for himself. I don't remember a lot from when we first met because of all the different things going on with my brain, but I talked to him by passing him a note (I think the note may have been about the staff at the psych ward.) We both began talking the whole time we were there after that. There was absolutely no activities, the staff treated us like utter garbage, and we both were too restless to just sit around all day. We would talk ""walks"" down the hallways just talking. About everything. There was so much chemistry. He somehow knew how exactly to calm me down. We both knew how to make eachother laugh. He was optimistic, despite how awful different circumstances he had were. Way more optimistic than me. He pointed out a big photo on the wall of a colorful wave and said to pretend we were taking a walk on the beach together.  We also did have one activity room we would go in maybe once out of the whole week that had a piano and some playing cards. I played Heart and Soul as a duet with him. We somehow made that awful situation we were in into something enjoyable. As days passed, he started opening up about how he had a charge of battery on an officer. Basically, he was in the same mental hospital we were in at the time, and he was having an episode. He is a black man with tattoos, so everyone just treated him as if he was dangerous and aggressive before he even got to any point like that. I don't know exactly what happened, but they didn't attempt to deescalate at all. A police officer came over to slam him against the wall and tell him ""you'd be better off dead."" He then spit in the officers direction. And that's it. He didn't hit him or attempt to hit him.  Because of covid, that action he took is considered battery against a police officer, and he was looking at a minimum of 10 years in prison for it. The case is still ongoing as we speak. He's doing a mental health diversion to get the felony off his record, and he's trying to get the case dropped. If the case is dropped, he plans to sue. So basically, everything has been extremely stressful for both of us the entire time we have known each other. But we connect so well. I have never felt so much love and passion for someone. After the mental hospital, we hung out for weeks. We did smoke a lot of weed together and both of us started getting worse mentally. I got sent to psych 2 more times after the first time and then got transferred to residential on the 3rd time. The 3rd time I went was because I went to his house, had severe psychosis, and he had to call the police on me. We weren't really together for quite a few months and I even broke off talking to him because I needed to recover. Then, I reached out again in September. We both relapsed, and I would see him once a week so my use was weekly and his was daily. He lives with his mother who has a medical card and gives him free weed. Now, we both are over 2 weeks sober and plan to stay that way. But the relationship had gotten tense and strained. We don't use escapism for our feelings anymore. We even quit nicotine. We started eating healthy, exercising, and finding ourselves. But it's so hard. I know people say two sick people can't get better together, but I just want to prove them wrong. I want us to be healthy. So many things make us insecure. We are both terrified of losing each other. We both want to get out of our triggering households together. But we both struggle with things. I'm going back to regular talk therapy and he's about to start his therapy too. I even want to do couples therapy. But money is a huge issue. He couldn't work for the entire time we have been together. I've only had a part-time retail job that pays 13 an hour. He's been mad that I'm working way more and seeing him less. I'm trying to explain that I'm doing this for us. It hurts him because he wants to be a caretaker and he wants to be the breadwinner. But realistically, I'm the one who can work rn. And I'm even struggling with that as well because I got in a car accident in an Uber and my back is messed up. The pain is making me constantly irritated. Please. I know a lot of people might say this doesn't seem like it's possible it could work, but I want some optimism. Me and him both want it to work and are willing to do anything we possibly can to make it work. Any advice is so appreciated. Thank you.

I’m new here,1716352643.0,"My most recent psych doctor suggested I have BPD, and it honestly lines up with my symptoms. I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around it. I’ve always had the extreme mood changes, and the thing where if someone does something “against” me, I will think of them like an enemy, if that makes sense. I had pretty significant trauma in my childhood and I’ve heard that’s common for this diagnosis. I’m also in recovery from alcoholism and an eating disorder. One good thing about it, is that I switched to DBT in therapy which I like, and have tried new meds like a mood stabilizer in addition to an SSRI, which never worked alone. I’m not as suicidal, like I was for awhile. So there’s progress. I just, I have this overlaying feeling that to my core, I am damaged/broken/unworthy. Like there is something wrong with me. It gets worse when I have to interact with other people, and I feel so awkward and overthink everything. But when I don’t interact with other people, I isolate and the obsessive thoughts of unworthiness gets worse. I’m ranting, I know.

We are coded so anxiously like this that the only real effective way we can balance out our all or nothing, fight or flight nervous system to get even a little stable or actually secure enough to function like a “normal” person—is by actively doing the OPPOSITE of what we feel we need…Essentially we’ve been so badly damaged by our evironments early on (Needing touch but getting distance, needing kindness but getting threatened, etc.) that we have grown in reverse and will keep our needs based in the same flawed foundation until we just stop listening to our own inner voice because it’s stuck in always all light or all dark. We “need” what we can’t be needy for, and then we don’t even notice what we need just to be okay. How do we know what is a real need and what’s our brain just self sabatoging us and our relationships with a “need” that isn’t even real to them? The black and white wiring of our brain is not rational or realistic but it is valid because it’s a learned reflexive way of existing that we’re in, I understand and accept that part. But I’m saying that if we don’t naturally think the realistic way at all, then you mean we have to completely flip reverse our brains inside out just so our sense of self and detatchment and security and autonomy and trusting and caring for others and being an actual competent adult IS JUST THE OPPOSITE OF THE THOUGHTS OUR BRAIN MAKES THAT WE HAVE TO ESSENTIALLY DO TRIAL AND ERROR OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN THINKING VOICE JUST TO MAYBE FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS WITHOUT BEING LOST TO OUR DAMAGED SYSTEM THAT ALREADY SELF SABATOGES AGAINST THE GOOD BEHAVIORS WE GENUINELY TRY TO DO TO PREVENT MORE DAMAGE AND HURT TO US AND OUR LOVED ONES AND OUR EXISTENCE IN GENERAL?????

The relationship was ended but we still had contact and it was of course all ups and downs, BUT. My current issue seems to be more with what has already happened rather than what it is now.

I get what I can call ""flashbacks"" of what happened between us, how I felt, how my mind interpreted it at the time, and it just sets me back for the moment, feeling empty and terrifried and in so much pain, again. When I can center myself in the present moment I'm very much aware of the progress I've made, of how this person really doesn't have a place in the life I'm trying to maintain and while my thoughts and feelings aren't ""good"" or even close to normal, they're not unmanageable or terryfing.

When I get a ""flashback"", it feels like I fall into the abyss again and it hurts so bad it makes me bend over at moments. If I didn't know I had BPD, I'd think I was having a heart attack. All the feelings are back and I can't stop my mind from very rapidly producing the ""BPD thoughts"" that devalue myself and life itself to absurdity even though an hour ago I would be more or less stable and thinking in a more balanced way.

I'm supposed to move back to the city where I lived, where it all happened, and it would be a very good choice for me in all aspects of life, however - I'm terryfied of it. I panic when I think about having to go back. Because I know I'll have to pass the places related to all these events during my episode and it makes me feel like it's gonna be twisting the metaphorical knife in my chest that I can't seem to pull out.

What seems to be my problem is not suffering for this person in particular, I feel like what hurts me now is this whole series of events that had me breaking down and having the strongest psychiatric intervention of my life. This period of my life that lasted a few months feels like hell, like I've been sucked into another dimension where out of everything in my life ever, it's only the pain and fear that exists.

I don't even know what would be the right term for what I'm experiencing and have no clue what kind of help to seek for it.

Opinions needed on bpd split ,1716275664.0,My long term partner with bpd is currently splitting on me about something from 2017.

Suggestions from therapist,1716258244.0,"
So these past few years I’ve realized I have pretty much all symptoms of borderline & the first couple years in discovering this I was not bringing it up to therapists or NP’s because I wanted to be sure. Anyways my NP had brought it up to me after seeing me for awhile & I thought thank god I’m not crazy and other people see it too. Soon enough my therapist had brought it up to me (the medication management team and therapists communicate pretty well where I go) & this was probably about a year ago. As time has gone on and I’ve felt more comfy with her I’ve opened up and told her so much that I’m dealing with inside my head and how uncontrollable my emotions are and lately she’s been telling me she wants me to possibly read more into bpd (which I feel like I already have lol) or possibly talk to others that have bpd. I don’t know where it’s gonna get me or what is gonna help me. I honestly just want to be assessed and heard but I feel like I’m not getting that. I’ve been doing research and learning more and more about bpd , I’ve been to 4 different IOP programs, I’ve tried so much to make it “better” before getting an official diagnosis and I just feel crazy and stupid for even telling anyone that I’m dealing with all these symptoms. Honestly I feel like I need to off myself before I’m heard and actually taken seriously.

BPD rage / stonewalling ,1716254699.0,"I recently started talking again with a situationship I’ve known for about 2 years, we didn’t talk for a whole year because I had an ectopic pregnancy and instead of communicating about it he decided to ghost me instead which triggered me into a Bpd rage episode that I deeply regretted. 
Flash forward to a year later he comes back and we somewhat try again and things were going so well, we laughed, showered together, talked for hours. 
We were long distance. 
But then when I went to visit I accidentally went through his phone and found out he was talking to other women but didn’t say anything. 
Then we got into an argument about me putting something into the wrong trash can and he yelled at me then pratically stonewalled me the whole day. He watched me cry in the car and didn’t even say a word. 
When I got back home I sent a long paragraph confessing my feelings and he ignored me completely and just responded to cancel an upcoming trip we had planned. I was devastated and said something in return to hurt his feelings and he called me an “idiot” and a “dumb animal”.
I thought I could move past it but I got drunk one night and blew him up from different numbers because I was so hurt and upset and now I just feel awful for doing so. Has anyone ever been triggered by the silent treatment and stonewalling? How would you navigate your intense emotions?

Thoughts while traveling ,1716220996.0,"I am really looking forward to getting back home, spending some time with friends. 

Have you ever realized how exhausting it is to try and keep up with your favorite person. It’s like imagine if we gave all that love ourselves. I’m working on some DBT today and journaling. You ever think a lot of your relationships were cool because we were the fuel . Like the firey love we give was what kept everything going even though the others didn’t reciprocate in the same manner. 

I spoke with the nicest guy in a coffee shop today and just had the best conversation and it really solidifies that there are genuine and kind people in this world. I have been shutting everyone I know out and experiences with people who possibly truly can care about me as a person or help me a good support and it’s like you turn to yourself and say for what. Why am I setting myself on fire to keep this flame lit for people who are not conducive to long term happiness. 

Super excited for what is to come. It does get better. The right one will love you and not keep you in predator / prey mode. Cheating is not normal and you are good enough for the right person. The right person will want to talk to you, will want to do the things and will just all around be like nothing you have ever experienced before. 

Invest in those that invest in you. Give the time to those that want to be with you. Invest in true experiences.

Recovering BPD,1716181059.0,"
I’m new to this group, but I’m not sure if you all feel similarly. For me BPD takes form in many things but mostly separates into two versions of me: the Rational version and irrational version.

Rational me: wonderful person who is accountable, kind and caring.

Irrational me: impulsive to a fault, and doesn’t realize he’s speaking in mostly black and white thinking, mixed with suicidal, abusive and manipulative actions.

It feels like alone, I’m not as much as a burden but when I’m dating someone seriously for example my current partner of two years. I’ve managed to cause so much trauma to her.

I hate myself almost everyday. Why? I’ve essentially been exactly like how my father was to my mother despite having promised the younger me I’d never. While, I know it’s not my fault I didn’t learn the right coping mechanisms if at all any. I can’t help but feel like it’s me doing it so it’s my fault. I can be great for days and weeks but then an incident brings me back to square one. I always feel like I’m having to push the rock right back up the hill again for it to never reach the top.

Has anyone here had similar behaviours and how did you deal with consistent need for validation out of fear of abandonment. For example, I ask my partner if she’s loves me a ton less now because she’s almost on the verge of leaving and she can’t really tell me it because it’s drastically decreased.

It feels lonesome, I don’t know anyone with BPD and I wish I at least knew one who successfully treated their symptoms to give me hope.

Years of therapy and this year finally found a DBT therapist. Seen him a handful of times but still seems like I’m not fully getting better. I am trying to use my skills more frequently though.

Struggling to deal with dreams vs current reality.,1716150136.0,"For context, I’m in a very happy, very stable relationship with my fiancé and we have a lovely child together.
Sorry this is long but the context is vital to the problem.

However, before I was with my fiancé, I was in a very intense relationship with a friend, when the relationship ended we hung out a little for a couple months but then started a fwb type thing, I still very obviously at the time had feelings for him and we broke it off again, few months later and I was falling for my now fiancé but I was pretty mentally unstable and restarted the fwb arrangement with my ex (this time without feelings involved) after two weeks I realised that I was ready for a relationship and hey presto I’m here today. My ex and I hung out a couple more times after I got with my now fiancé but it dwindled and I haven’t seen him in well over 2 years now.


Now onto my actual problem, we were really good friends and I often find myself missing that bond, for example last night I had a dream we met up again and we shared a lovely hug. But every time I dream of him or think about him, it haunts me for the ENTIRE day and sometimes longer! 

I know that I’m probably just seeking that same sort of friendship and not just his friendship specifically but I’m honestly sick of basically dissociating every time he exists in my mind. 

When I’m like this I just want to sleep all the time and live in this ideal world where everything is nice and everyone gets along and even though I’ve got this lovely life, I sometimes just feel like it’s not real.

losing my bf only a day after being discharged from psych hospital ,1716063163.0,"I tried to kill myself last weekend and was hospitalized for a week I have an order to continue taking medication and go to all of my therapy and doctor visits for the next 90 days. The reason I tried to kill myself was from the overwhelming stress of my relationship with my partner we got into a fight after I found a bag full of womens stripper clothes and stripper heels in his car (we have been on and off for the past 4 months or so) after I found it we got into a physical altercation and his phone fell out of his pocket but he ran out of the house and said to just forget about it.

 I ended up trying to kill myself and the police were called they took my phone and his phone and put it in my property, after I was released I turned his phone on and looked through the messages I found a number from a girl so I texted her asking her how she knew him and sent her pictures of the backpack asking if it was hers, she called me yelling saying “this is your bitch?? Say hi to your girl! Speak up!” And it was my boyfriend’s voice who replied saying “that’s not my girl” he then proceeded to call me crying and out of breath telling me he really liked her and saw a future with her he said she was kind and funny and a genuinely good person he told me I sabotaged his life. I felt bad of course but what hurt me even more is knowing how much he cared about her and knowing he doesn’t care about me in that way at all. The girl messaged me saying they’re been having sex no protection and he’s been sleeping over at her house every night for weeks. 

That night he calls me saying he’s locked out of his house and he needs me to let him come over so I let him in. we talk for a little and he basically tells me he doesn’t want to be with me anymore he doesn’t care if I change or if I follow the 90 days to get help he said he doesn’t want to try or give us a chance or anything and that he’s done.

How can I help myself?,1715932579.0,"First I want to apologize for the long post that you're about to read but I'm really losing my sanity at this point.

I (f 21) was dating a guy (20) for about two months, he was a virgin and I was his first ever , everything was going so so well , we are very compatible and I really liked him a lot and still do like him , he also liked me a lot , until..

Before we had sex for the first and last time ever he had talked to me about STDs and I told him that he has nothing to worry about because I have never had an STD , so two weeks later we have unprotected sex , and it was really really good , ten days later he started experiencing some symptoms like a burning sensation when he pees , white or clear discharge, his penis was red and swollen, and he was going crazy and he was very very anxious and scared (rightfully so) he went to a doctor and the doctor told him that it's probably gonorrhea and he told him to start with the medication that he prescribed to him after he got a test , the test came back negative, and I also did all the STDs tests and all of them came back negative as well . (For the record we are syrians and we live in syria , so we are very tight on money and the whole process of going to doctors and taking all the std tests was very dangerous because any kind of sexual activity before marriage is not okay here) .

This guy is now convinced that I gave him something and he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore, and he keeps calling me reckless (which I know I am I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago but my parents refused to believe it and didn't get me medication or treatment) .

My problem is that I was also too ignorant to believe it (because mental health is not really a thing in Syria) and now I feel like I desperately want him to stay in my life because I didn't do anything wrong, and I feel like my world is collapsing, and I know that I need to go to therapy and get treatment but I don't have any money, therapy is very expensive here and I don't know how to cope anymore, I truly saw something in him , and I feel like shit for losing him as a friend and as a lover , I didn't want things to go that way at all , and I don't know what to do.",Unfair_Solution_2317,,False,1ctzrvj,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ctzrvj/how_can_i_help_myself/

I’ve struggled a lot and having my experiences be articulated has been really amazing, but it’s hard for me right now to feel hopeful. Everyday feels painful in some way. I start believing I’m destined to this kind of life, like it was already pre-determined for me and there’s nothing I can do about it. I hate that I can’t trust my relationships and that every time someone gets close to me I believe it will just end in pain and abandonment, especially romantically. I hate that EVERYTHING is so extreme, and if I’m not living in extremes, I’m disassociated. My diagnosis is very new, healing takes time. What I didn’t expect was the intense shame I felt upon diagnosis. I’ve worked the past two years in healing my shame and have genuinely done so through therapy, but when I found out I had bpd all I wanted to do was hide. I hate how people talk about those with bpd, like the kind of person I am is already determined for me. I feel looked down upon and put into a box that isn’t true. No one else around me has it that I know of, and my two closest friends do not. I’ve told them, and they’ve responded beautifully, but there’s a level of understanding they can’t have.

I subconsciously forgive the people who have hurt me ,1715866769.0,"I think this is mostly because my memory has gone to shit. But i don’t hold grudges, i can’t hold grudges even if i wanted to. My parents for example, the biggest thing my parents have done to hurt me is lie to me about my biological dad, created a whole fake scrapbook to keep up with the lies, with false dates and names. I would not have found out the truth if The biological father (who i don’t have in my life because i chose not to) hadn’t found me and told me the truth himself. My parents made this all about them, my mom made excuses for herself and my dad felt betrayed and ignored me for weeks when the truth came out, he expected an apology from me. I never had a good relationship with my dad, i thought i hated him he was always angry at everyone, he was verbally abusive and strict af, i couldnt breathe around him. My mom stopped defending me because he would just yell at her and then she would yell at me saying she would never defend me again. Every terrible argument i had with my parents ended with me telling myself “remember this feeling remember how hurt you are-remember their words dont forgive them for this” But i always forgive even without an apology. I moved out almost 2 years ago and i feel safer, im not used to arguing and being yelled at anymore, but now ive become more sensitive to everything, i still see my parents from time to time and when they yell or bicker with me in the slightest i cry and i kind of start to tweak out. They look at me like im crazy and tell me i dont know how to handle discipline i dont need to cry over everything. I dont want to fucking cry but i cant help it and knowing that im making a fool of myself just bawling my eyes out makes me more angry with myself and my reaction to things. My mom has put me in mental hospitals just because she didnt know what to do with me anymore. After my first and only attempt to take my life she became reliant on mental hospitals to just take me away whenever things got bad. And that brought more trauma, so mucb happened to me in those places and she swore it was meant to help me. Then i was in a residential treatment center for 2 months, i had to live there, i didnt see the outside world at all. Thats when i got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and thats when i started to hate myself more. 
Theres so much i could say this isnt even half, now all i will ever be is my trauma its made me into such a complex person and i cant deal with myself anymore. I dont feel a strong love for my parents, i could move to a city far away and never talk to my entire family ever again and i would be fine, except my little siblings ofc id miss them. No matter what i can forgive my parents which is without saying because they’re all i have. But even past boyfriends , past friends who have destroyed me i can still talk to them because i dont remember the hurt i felt only the action, and i do forget sometimes, so people take advantage of that, the people in my life know that they can walk all over me and i wont hold it against them for too long.

I left because of fear and love,1715843804.0,"I thought that I had recovered pretty well through therapy and medication but once I found myself having romantic feelings for someone again, I started to spiral and have outbursts. I just ended things after a year and a half because I’d rather end on good terms than burn everything to the ground. In no way did my partner deserve the kind of treatment I would give when I’d split or when the rage got the best of me. It’s breaking me apart to let go but I cannot keep going forward knowing that I am hurting my favorite human in the world, the person I’m supposed to cherish and protect. I was never physically abusive but I was dismissive and recently I had actually raised my voice, yelling at the poor person because I was drowning in my own emotions. I didn’t want to end things but I had to push them away to save them from me. I’d rather be alone than to keep hurting them and they would rather be alone than to keep being abused by me, which is entirely understandable because I know that my actions are in fact abusive. I love them so much but I feel like my love is volatile because the more I care, the worse I become. I just want to be able to love without poisoning the other person. I’ve tried so hard to do and be better but it seems fruitless. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just feel broken and like I’m meant to be alone because I’m too much for even me, so how is anyone else supposed to weather the storm? I’ve never been so well loved or taken care of and it’s almost everything I’ve wanted but I kept demanding more, kept finding things to be disgruntled about, and would be set off by the most insignificant things. We never had a defined relationship and that always stirred insecurities but my behavior didn’t help to create any confidence in the bond. I know they were trying so hard to meet my needs but my list kept growing or unresolved things kept coming up. I just want to be soft, to be loved, to feel safe but it seems like I am a poison to myself and everyone around me because I am filled with so much rage and grief. It has nowhere to go. I can’t keep doing this to people who try to love me and I’m so afraid of being alone forever but it doesn’t stop. I’m suffocating.

It helps knowing I'm not alone on here,1715806683.0,"Hello, I recently found the sub but I've never posted. 
     I have never been formally diagnosed with any personality or mood disorder but ive been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. 
    
Also from what I've found on those sub is that it might be really difficult getting diagnosed. 

I know myself to blow up at people when I feel ignored, inadequate or when I feel abandoned. I always end up blowing up at the wrong people, even people who love me like family. 

I don't know why I get so upset and enraged. I always know it's wrong and that I need to stop because I always say the worst possible disgusting things or do things I absolutely will regret later.  

Even when people are trying to help me or show me tough love I just always get unreasonably upset.  

I feel like I've always been too much for people or never enough which has caused me to do things like multiple one night stands, do extremely impulsive things like spend money irresponsible which has led me to sleeping on a friend's couch. 

The only way I've managed to not have an episode or blow up is to walk away from things. It's really difficult. 

It does make me feel less alone reading what other people have to say about their experience on here but it also makes me hopeless because I have to deal with the outcome of trauma which wasn't my fault.

How to identify how I feel towards someone,1715802944.0,"Context: went through a mutual/circumstantial break up of a healthy relationship in January. Moved back to my home state two weeks after. 

I immediately met someone I was fascinated by and from day one struggled to identify how I felt about them and if it was romantic/sexual at all. Met once more and was obsessed and had a crush for the first time in years. Next time we caught up we stayed together and hooked up but I was slightly uncomfortable because I didn’t verbalise physical boundaries properly. Went home obsessed with them. 

I had no reason to text them and spent days thinking of an excuse, but they take 3-7 business days to respond if at all and so waiting for communication left me feeling all types of ways and incredibly dysregulated. 

We saw each other again when I went to the city for first aid training and stayed at their house. I just can’t figure out what I think about them. 

On one hand I’m obsessed and totally fascinated by their way of being, and I ended up enjoying the sex and closeness this time. But I also can’t even decide if I think they’re attractive. I resent how anxious they make me as my need for routine and plans doesn’t fit with their go with the flow nature and I sort of hate them for their poetic arrogance. It might not be arrogance idk. I’m a rigid and practically thinking healthcare worker and they’re a psychotic artist seemingly living off mummy’s money. I don’t know what I want or what I am getting out of this relationship?

I went through my DBT handouts to try to name my emotions and as far as I can tell -
I feel happy about much of the interactions we have.
I feel disgust or contempt about something.
I feel anxious because of the lack of consistency I get from them both in person and with the fact they don’t value texting.

Ex-Girlfriend with BPD,1715741234.0,"Posting this here rather than other subreddits because I don't necessarily like their type of posts about hating on those with BPD.

TLDR: I'm trying to get my ex girlfriend back who has BPD, but shes ignoring me.

I'll cut to the main problem at hand;
My ex was seeing someone else (their ex from December-January) about a few months ago even though I told them I wanted to wait and process my past relationships that I had before being with them so I can be a better healed person for them. This broke my heart, and so here I am. 

For a while she was ignoring me but still had me in contact. One time she blocked me then unblocked me, which confused me. 

One time I noticed she was offline for the entire day so I decided to give her a call and she picked up, but she couldn't talk so she texted while I spoke. She asked if I was ""talking to any cute girls lately"" and as well she dropped a few complaints about her ex-now-boyfriend, saying she felt like he was purposely ignoring her. She told me she wished she knew me in person (LDR btw) and how she wanted a shoulder to cry on and she wanted me to hug her and hold her, as well as saying how she told her boyfriend she was sad and he didn't acknowledge it, showing a screenshot of the guy actually not saying anything about her being sad when she explicitly said ""im sad"" (what a fuckin prick.). She explained the block before was that she was hiding me from her ex-now-boyfriend and he didn't like how she would stay in contact with me. She wanted us to sleep in call together but eventually changed her mind saying how ""I deserve to be alone, its what he wants"". I didn't want to disrespect her decision and let her rest. We had a good weekend together but eventually her energy for me fizzled out and she stopped responding again for weeks. I tried calling her a few times one day and she ended up blocking me.

I contacted her on an alternative account and she ended up accepting my friend request and we talked. She asked me again if I had a girlfriend which I said no and asked why I was ""obsessed"" with her. I explained how I love her company, that I like her as a person, and how she's nice to be around, in which she replied with ""whatever"". So I asked if she would be comfortable staying in contact with me again in which she said no, and I asked if we could talk about it and she said ""not now"", so I gave her space.

Ex-now-ex-again and her broke up, and I tried to contact her about it telling her I would be there if she needed support. I wasn't pushing anything romantic on her but instead reinforcing the idea of comfort and support. I reached out saying ""Hey (name), can we talk for a minute? You don't have to if you'd like."" (added the second second to avoid applying pressure) in which she ended up blocking me again, and here we are.

What's going on with her? Do I still have a chance of getting her back?
I know how to handle this, I've known her for foir years now and so I'm prepared for her ups and downs with BPD, but what should I do now?

I've talked to an AI relationship coach (I can't afford one nor can I even buy one at the moment) and it suggested a ""two week rule""; where I give her space for two weeks and attempt to reach out again. If she doesn't respond or blocks me again, give her another two weeks. It says it will make her feel like I'm not abandoning her while giving her the space she needs. Is that effective?

Now that child has come back into her life suddenly as he is old enough and I feel super threatened. Like they’re saying how different holidays may be and how now they need a bigger house because he has kids so they are suddenly grandparents. My sister is one of my favorite people and I feel so happy for her finding her child and connecting but also scared that our relationship and everything about us will change. Like my BPD is so triggered that she will suddenly like me less and want less to do with me because they are back in her life and now she technically has grandkids. I’m moving in with her as my housing situation is changing and I’m scared she won’t want me to live there now so that there is an open room for the new family that’s in her life. Everything feels threatening now and half of me wants to disappear on her before she has a chance to abandon me. Our stable relationship feels shaky in my head as I don’t know how to let someone else in with this change. I’m not sure if I’m insane or if this is normal to feel. I just needed to vent but advice is also ok if anyone wants to provide it. ,Quick-Pomegranate256,,False,1csbz65,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1csbz65/perceived_abandonment/
How to cope with separation from fp and the sudden stop from taking medication (very venty but mainly seeking advice or support,1715728484.0,"Posting on a throwaway bc paranoia 

Me (M19) and my Fp (M20) have been in a serious romantic relationship for quite a while, we both have bpd and he’s being evaluated for possible schizophrenia, we’ve both been open about our mental health and since the beginning, we’ve been open about our mutual fps on each other and due to it, our separation anxiety. Due to recent events which I won’t go into specifics to in attempts to keep this post as short as possible, my Fp was sent to the psychward for about a week or so, he had to give up his phone just about two hours ago and I’ve been at a total loss, I don’t know what to do with myself and I can’t stop crying, I don’t know how he is, how he’s doing, what he’s doing, nothing. We are long distance due to college starting in a few months so I cannot visit him, he wrote down my number before they drove him to facility so he wouldn’t forget it but it’s likely they won’t let him call me anytime soon. I’m in contact with his mom but our conversations have been limited and I am at a total loss.

I’ve tried distracting myself but there’s nothing i can do, i have no friends to rely on, I have no enjoyment for anything anymore, watching videos and playing games leave me with nothing, I feel a sense of emptiness so deep that it’s crippling, I don’t know what to do. He’s my support system, he’s my everything and without him I have nothing and I am nothing, I have awful thoughts and memories that I try to fend away but i cannot, nothing helps and I’m hurting. I am an artist, I have art I owe that I must work on but I can’t get myself to do anything, my hands are hurting, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can’t think or I think too much, I still can’t tell.

The worst part of it all is that I was forced to stop taking my medication suddenly after taking it consistently everyday since April. For some context, i started having an allergic reaction yesterday, mainly just hives, I still don’t know what from, today the hives were still here even after I spent the day yesterday taking allergy relief and lathering myself up In anti itch shit that really didn’t help much. I went to the doctor today once they started to swell, initially I suspected my medication because I didn’t eat or do anything out of the ordinary (i don’t go outside) but after being seen by the doctor and had blood taken, he ruled it out and I fainted, had a panic attack, had some stuff injected in me and all that good shit. I called my psychiatrist right afterwards for good measure and she was unable to speak with me since she was with another patient but her receptionist contacted me after speaking with her and I was informed to stop taking my medication all together until we could speak. 

My next appointment was meant to be June 3rd but I am considering calling in tomorrow and arranging a sooner appointment or something because I feel like I’m losing my goddamn mind(

I just feel like I have no direction right now and I miss him so badly im hurting physically and I don’t know when illl be able to finally hear from him again, I only have him, I have no one else, if he’s gone, im done for.

TLDR; I was forced to suddenly stop taking my medication due a medical emergency and my fp is being sent to a psych ward for about a week, it’s been two hours and I can’t stop crying.",missingmyfp,,False,1cs661z,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1cs661z/how_to_cope_with_separation_from_fp_and_the/

I need constant re assurance and I trust nobody. I feel like a shell of a person walking around. Lately I don’t even feel like myself if that makes sense, I don’t even know who I am. I also struggle with maintaining my job, I manage but it’s so difficult. If someone says something even slightly rude at the wrong time I will lash out on them and not hold back. I feel like I’ve completely lost the person I used to be when I felt somewhat normal. I’m also just really scared to try and get help bc in my mind I think I’ll just be judged and belittled which will only make things worse.

Living with bpd,1715692145.0,"Ive come to terms with my illness and i try not to use it as an excuse for how i treat people, but i also dont know how else to explain myself. Finding the words for my emotions is so difficult, because i feel things so strongly but then they dont feel important enough to talk about. I want to say all the things i think but i feel like i would only sound stupid and id be misunderstood either way. Im living in a constant state of confusion, i dont know who i am and i have no desire for life or relationships. But i still pretend i do, i initiate love interest out of boredom but i know im not capable of loving anyone-because my self hatred runs so deep.  i know im not taking people seriously and i forget that im intentionally playing with other’s emotions, and for literally no reason- i dont know what to do with myself and i cant stop. Im lonely, i dont have close friends and i hate socializing, but i go on and on about wanting to be loved, wanting someone to talk to- but i dread leaving my home, i have comfort in solitude. Because when im in public all i can think about is how people perceive me, i feel like they think so negatively about me and that im hated or disliked by people who dont even know me, im so insecure it consumes me everyday. Even when talking to people all i can think about is how stupid i sound, how ugly i might look to them. And the stupid thing is, people are nice to me, ive never been bullied. Im the one who judges others, i dont even want to talk to anyone because although im insecure i feel smarter than everyone else, i dont think anyone could get on my level. My mind is always convincing me im terrible in every way, so why do i feel superior at the same time? I dont know. Everyday i think differently about myself, i seriously wear a different face everyday, and having body dysmorphia doesnt help. 
I hate humans so much, im angry all the time, angry at the world and never satisfied with anything. Im a hypocrite, i look down on people who remind me of me. I do the things i hate other people do. I feel so much more woke than most, i see the world for what it really is, and all that does is make me more miserable and self aware to the point i cant take being alone with my own thoughts. I take drugs just to feel something and feel immensely more depressed. But i convince myself its a better feeling than being numb. 
I feel like a faker in everything i do, i feel like my kindness is fake, i know im not all bad, theres good, people around me know i can be good, Why does my mind make me feel so evil, awful and unworthy of anything good. Why does nothing help, I’ve accepted that this is how ill always be, but i dont want to be me anymore i hate it so much, it hurts that i cant change myself.

Afraid I can’t understand myself before it’s too late.,1715636206.0,"I have recently done a lot of thinking about the way I behave and after a doing a lot of research I am very sure that I have bpd, and this has been incredibly stressful on me, I was already feeling estranged beforehand but now really having an answer in front of me for the way I act feels oddly horrible, like I’m not just kinda strange in the way I act  but there is something WRONG with me and that’s so scary.
But after discovering this I kinda stepped back and realized how damaging I was to me and my girlfriends relationship, and my heart just kind of shattered, I love this girl so much, and without really having a cause It was never so clear to me how poorly I was acting, and now I stupidly connected the dots.
Now that I realized all this, it seems like I’ve noticed a complete and total shift in her behaviour, it feels like I’m talking to a corpse of the girl I love, that I killed, and it hurts so badly, because it’s my fault.
I can hardly get a conversation out of her, I have sucked the life out of her and I never realized, all the small little fights and breakdowns and stress just never clicked with me, and now that I really understand and want to change it feels like I have totally sucked any compassion or care she had for me out of her, I want to change so I can make her happy again, even if it costs me a lot of myself.
I just only now figured out this part of me and I desperately just want to suppress it so she can be happy, no fusses no abrupt panicking no overbearing jealously, just give her the peace she deserves, but I don’t think she can make herself care anymore even if I change, even if try really hard for her, i hurt her so badly, I genuinely love her so much and I just want to make things better, I’m trying to be strong and not just break down infront of her again, it’ll only make things worse for her,

scared ive ruined the love of my life,1715633202.0,"hi, i’m seeking support and advice for my situation right now because i feel extremely lost and don’t know where to go from here

for about a year now i had been together with who i considered to be the love of my life. and i can tell it’s not just me being obsessed and idealistic like i usually am, i finally found someone who i can truly trust and love wholly and purely and they just feel like home. i admit that like all relationships there are things to work on, especially as we’re both just in our early 20’s, but i’ve noticed recently that even with the endless love and understanding they give me as well as absolutely no reason to not trust them, i am still extremely anxious and insecure and jealous to no end, and ironically it’s been getting worse the closer i feel to them

i’ve been realizing especially with how great things had been in our relationship that i really do need to work on my trauma, bpd, and similar mental health issues, and well the guilt from still feeling the way i do all came to a head recently and i ended up splitting on them bad one night, and it fully dawned on me that i just am not healed or stable enough to carry on like this.

so now i’m here, single again, and feeling awful because i had never been with such an amazing person in such a safe relationship. and while they promised they would wait for me to work on myself, i’m scared for my life that i’ve ruined my chances with them and i’ll never get to be with them again. i don’t know where to go from here and i don’t know how to deal with this fear of losing them forever, as well as now having to cope with the lack of contact and love and attention from them (contact is not on the table because it just makes me panic harder)

I got diagnosed with BPD in November 2023. I was lucky and able to access three months of outpatient treatment through the public hospital. (In Australia for context).

I have never owned property, always rented and now my minimum wage doesn’t cover rent (and I’m gracefully living with my elderly / ill father. I don’t know how long he’s got.)

I quit my job (3 weeks before BPD diagnosis) because of my abusive boss and his horrible daughter. They both made my life hell, I was working 12-14 hour days. He threatened all employees (not just me) but the threat of “we’re going to put you in a PIP and terminate you” was too much to bear. I am the extreme of sensitive and cry at the drop of a hat. It’s crap. It had some savings behind me, however, I was unemployed for months and they soon disappeared.

I was bullied as a kid for being poor. I was bullied in high school for being socially awkward / different / gay. I’ve never had a lot of “true” friends, and without my dad, i don’t really have someone to reach out to.

I used to be conventionally attractive and rather healthy in my teens. When I finished high school, I lost my first serious relationship where my BPD symptoms were all over the place. My fault 100%. I sometimes go back and write to apologise to them, but choose not to. It brings up too much.

In university I made many friends and for a good 10 or so years we connected, they were accepting of my quirks, life was ok.

Then COVID happened.

(We know how that panned out. Still panning out.)

I also lost friends because of different life paths and how that stuff goes. No one did any wrong, we just drifted apart.

Then when things got back to some sort of “normal”; I joined a queer affirming church (religion does play a part in my heart, however, I do not condone abuse, murder, exclusion, and extortion in the name of Religion.)

I’ve made some friends there. They all live rather far away and I haven’t been to church since my diagnosis.

I also got a new job in March and I am enjoying it. There are a few downsides, yet only one that irks me.

There is a woman I work with. She is approximately 10 years younger than me. She is one of those “sickly sweet types” (100% me issue, not her issue. I know this.)

So far she has stated:
- Her fiancé has bought her a 170,000 car
- She controls all finances and her fiancés money is put into her account. 
- She had her braces, current car, and all overseas travel paid for by her brother.
- She is about to marry a man who is about to inherit millions of dollars.

She’s definitely a bit of a BS artist; I think we all can be, as life is tough. However, ever since her arrival my BPD has flared up. I am poor. Always have been, always will be if I don’t change my life.

As DBT costs 21,000 AUD + and is often ran during the day (when I’m at work); I cannot access it. 

My executive disfunction is rife too.

I am not close to my siblings as they are generations older and have their own lives. My extended family isn’t close either; my mum was an only child and dad avoided his family due to trauma. I don’t have many friends and I can guarantee I am sh*t at being a friend.

I am so lonely, facing tough times because Australia is only for the rich; and I can’t move countries to try something different. I only work in admin and I suck at crafts (but enjoy them). I enjoy reading too.

If you’ve made it this far, you’re amazing! Thank you for reading my ranting.

Want to break up with my partner but not sure if it’s just splitting ,1715453994.0,"Hello, I have BPD and I’ve been dating my partner for seven months. We moved in together a month ago. Things have been very bleak since we’ve moved in together. I’m extremely depressed and struggling to get through the day doing basic life tasks due to the depression. We have had issues living together such as her not doing chores when I want her to and also communication. I also don’t feel attracted to her anymore and haven’t for months. I don’t know if the attraction will come back and it’s very scary. I often think of other people when I want to get sexual. I’m not sure if this is a result of splitting because I used to say she was the most attractive person I’ve ever been with. Some negative feelings for her started happening when she disappointed me or made me feel unseen-I have childhood abandonment trauma so this made me shut off positive feelings. I have lost so much hope for us. I feel so lost in life. We just moved in a month ago and I’ve thought about breaking up a lot. I don’t know what to do.

my gf sent cops to my house after an argument and when I got back home I did the same thing to her. ,1715448313.0,"For context me (f19) and her (f21) have been on and off since 2022. We really broke it off with each other from august 2023 to march 2024, she was the one who initiated it, she had her reasons which were valid. However, although they were valid that break up had broke me completely I was fighting the urge to relapse almost everyday, I couldn’t go outside or eat on campus, I couldn’t go to class without crying, I couldn’t even be on my college campus tbh, I would take the 3hour bus drive from my college campus to the city I live in so I could just be depressed at home. To help myself I ended up decided to go to college in my city and just commute so I can go through things in my home where i’m comfortable and made the decision to take anti depressants for a little bit. Basically, I’m just trying to paint the image of how bad of a time it was for me. 

For some odd reason, I’m not even sure as to why at this point, we decided to try again and get back together In March. I don’t even know why… it’s been complete shit. All we’ve done these 2 years of knowing each other is constantly break up with each other, argue, and then come back to experience euphoric happiness with each other it’s just so much craziness. She knows I have BPD, whenever we are arguing she’ll bring up BPD forums she’s read and will shame me for displaying the BPD behavior. She’ll make fun of me saying that I’m going to BPD discard her when I never ever wanna do that, she could probably throw a brick at my head and I would still wanna be with her as terrible as that sounds. 

So now I will get into what happened. Her and I were literally apologizing to each other for something that had happened the night before, or at least I was apologizing but she had explained to me she was walking to go play the guitar at this shop she goes to and because of that I had to wait for her apology. This triggered me and I started to split, I started spamming her phone just wanting her to pick up and talk to me but she was being weird putting her phone on DND, only texting me to say she’s deleting the conversation thread so she won’t be able to see what i’m typing out of anger. She even texted my dad, who is not a fan of her, screenshots of our argument and screenshotted the fact that she sent it to him to send it to me. I told her my dad is a grown man who will not get involved in our drama and she got really mad. I wanted her attention and didn’t know what to do. She would pick up the phone let me talk for like 2 seconds and hang up. In a moment of panic I told her if she didn’t stay on the phone with me I would jump off the roof in response she said she’s gonna call the police and I told her if she does that i’m just gonna go walk around so they won’t be able to find me. She hung up the phone and went back on DND as i continued to text her to pick up and just talk to me. I said no other suicidal shit. 

Although all this is going on in my head, I wasn’t physically panicking, I was in my bed just spamming her phone so she would pick up. Maybe I should’ve really went and took that walk because moments pass by NYPD and EMS are at my grandmas apartment door. She really sent the cops to my 75 year old grandmas door because we were arguing. They were saying because of how my partner had made the call sound and all the accusations she was making they had to follow protocol and take me to the hospital. My dad had to wake up out of his sleep to come defend my behalf telling them i don’t have to go, it was a very big and traumatizing commotion all in front of my poor grandma. As this was going on I was texting my partner videos of the huge commotion she had caused and her response was something along the lines of “good luck, this is to show you this is real life not middle school and i hope you get the help you need.” ???????????? She sent the cops to my grandmas house to prove a point???

I went to the hospital, was discharged in about 20 minutes. The whole time I was there I couldn’t help but to think how hypocritical my partner was, this is the same girl that told me she wanted to buy a gun for her birthday and shoot herself in the head, stab someone, other illegal shit , and run away from her family to me because we are long distance. MANNNNN my blood was boiling. So as soon as I got back I sent the cops to her house and told them about her suicidal ideation as well. I texted her and told her I hope everything works out with her and her family and that I hope she understands I was looking out for her the same way she was for me. She texted me something the next morning but unsent it. I asked her what did she send and it delivered but she hasn’t responded. 

All my friends are telling me she must really have some type of hate in her heart towards me to actually do that to me and my family and that she should know my mannerisms by now and know that calling the cops was an extreme that wasnt needed. I keep justifying it by saying to myself “well, I did it back to her we are even.” But of course I don’t even feel good about it, I should’ve never did it back because I feel like now she will be angry at me forever for airing out her business but that is something she has done to me as well so i don’t even know what to feel bad for. 

I feel bad because I think this is the end again, I don’t want it to be. I just got her back and this whole situation has made me feel like I haven’t tried enough for us. If i never split and just turned my phone off she would’ve never had a reason to call the cops and this wouldn’t have happened. I don’t wanna be without her again, she is my first girlfriend, first relationship, my best friend and she’s like a sister to me too. She is everything to me and I am so depressed things got so extreme so fast after all the talks we had about getting better for each other and our relationship and that we are going to be okay. We are everything but okay.

Blocking people doesn’t help,1715413079.0,"There has been this guy I’m talking to who I met online, he is quite a bit older then me and before I didn’t have much of a problem with it but recently I started feeling iffy. I told him our age gap makes me overthink and that I don’t think we should talk anymore, before blocking him on almost everything except discord, where I just unadded. He did try to @ me in a mutual server and add me back but then I blocked him on disc as well. Age wasn’t the only stressor, I didn’t mention all my reasons to him. The thing is I honestly really liked this guy, I don’t know why as It’s so obvious he was only using me for sexual purposes and there’s a lot of things pointing to the fact he is just not a great guy in general. Multiple of my friends told me the same thing, although I ignored them. I didn’t care about that for most of the time we were speaking because If im being honest I was slightly obsessed with this man, I was pretty much able to overlook everything. 

Now that I snapped into reality, I feel ashamed of a lot of the conversations we had, guided mostly by my recent hypersexual ‘episode.’ (Im not sure how to explain it.) I feel horrible even more so since he tried reaching out after and that we’ve talked about meeting up. I’ve debated unblocking and talking it out but I know that would be a bad idea, making things worse for me. I miss him already, I shouldn’t, I know.

Not excited about Mother’s Day ,1715405933.0,"I have a lot of trauma and emotional wounds surrounding my mom, some new and semi recent and some from childhood. And I always absolutely hated Mother’s Day. My mom and grandmother take it as days to make themselves martyrs and just make everything absolutely miserable. I hate the lead up to Mother’s Day trying to figure out what to get them that they will actually appreciate, and I hate the let down of just how awful it ends up being. How much I try and how much it doesn’t matter. But now I’m a mother myself and I just don’t even want anything to do with it. 

I had hoped I could like reshape Mother’s Day after I had become one too, but it just hurts even more. Last Mother’s Day was my first as an actual mother, and we didn’t have money and my baby was a newborn so I was attached to her all day and night and there was nothing anyone could do about that.

It’s ironic that at the same time this is perhaps the only factor preventing my suicide.

However, lately I have been very often exhausted and devastated and experiencing frustration... I have had such a state before and I know that a long stay in such a state clouds the mind and in such a state it is very easy to commit suicide because absolutely everything becomes indifferent!

I feel like two contradictions are fighting in me... part of me wants to live and is afraid of death, even natural, and causes panic, while the other part of me, exhausted and tired of everything, just thinks about ending the suffering earlier because after everything will no longer have any meaning.

And I'm constantly having nightmares and bad thoughts that she might have someone else in mind because we dont talk no more. We've been together almost 5 years and have known each other since we were little kids. It's literally the love of my life I couldn't ask for anything better. I'm 24 and we have 2 boys. They are under a year old (weren't trying to have two boys back to back lol) but once we had our second boy her mom forced her out my house and made her move back in with her. Her mom thinks im a bad person all because I got her pregnant back to back. I work my ass off, and all I do is take care of her daughter and my two boys. I've never done bad to my fiance, hell... I hate arguing with her. I wouldn't hurt a fly so I damn sure would never put my hands on her. I'm a good man.. and ever since she moved back in with her mom she just kind of stopped talking to me. I might hear from her once a day and we used to have a schedule going. For 5 years straight we facetimed every night to go to sleep with each other (we were madly in love, at least I still am lol...) and ever since she left we dont ft no more. We dont text no more. She's constantly telling me she loves me with all her heart and she's happy with me but I dont see how. She tells me she doesn't know what's wrong with her and is telling me to be patient and be there for her but how can I be there if she's just pushing me away?

My messy apartment has made my life debilitating ,1715213309.0,"Hello, I’ve been struggling severely with keeping my apartment clean and I’m in desperate need of help. I’m diagnosed ADD and BPD, I have one cat, a boyfriend who I moved in with a couple years ago which was right after I took a two shift job which I’m still working. Before we moved in to this apartment I lived by myself and found it much easier to keep my apartment clean, it was almost always spotless, I was studying at the time.

I think moving in together has changed this because I feel like my independence is gone but also working shift has made it impossible for me to have a routine which I’m very fond of having otherwise. 

I’m dying inside. My house smells bad from my cats litter box (a robot which you have to empty the trash once a week which I do but always too late)

My bathroom smells because I can’t keep it clean, my kitchen smells and all this is making my whole house stink and when I’m home I barricade myself in the bedroom which is the only place where it smells normal and I can exist.

My boyfriend only cleans the kitchen sometimes and rarely anything else unless I ask, it’s still better effort than myself.

It’s so debilitating and I feel ashamed. It has made me so depressed that I don’t know what to do with myself. I’ve even lied to people around me about how often I keep it clean when it comes up in daily chitchat so I feel like a fraud.

Boyfriend came after vasectomy without me ,1715176483.0,"My bf got a vasectomy this last week. Everyday I was asking him for updates, if it hurt, level of pain everything. We purposely avoided hanging out until last night because I know myself well enough to know that if we hung out and didn’t have sex for whatever reason it would do me a lot of harm because no sex= I’m ugly, he doesn’t want me, he doesn’t love me. Well he comes over last night we eat dinner we’re laughing and playing and then we finally fuck. I say finally because the entire time we’ve been together we’ve never gone more than 3 days without sex. So a week and some change felt like ages. After he was so calm and that’s normal but I was under the impression that was his first time cumming since the vasectomy because he never mentioned cumming in all the days I was asking him how he was doing and to date his pain level. So I was asking him how it felt and like how he felt after and he answered so nonchalantly that it hit me that this wasn’t his first time since the surgery. So I obviously started crying and asked him if he’d already cum and he was like yeah I think yesterday. Yeah yesterday. I was like oh I just thought this was your first time because you didn’t mention that at all. I can’t help but feel like he purposely didn’t tell me and now I feel like he’s a liar and I can’t trust anything he says or does. I even hate him. So much.

My boyfriend broke up with because I kept having episodes and I know it’s my fault. ,1715131834.0,"Me and my (ex)boyfriend have been together on and off for about a year now. We’ve had amazing times together and I’ve been working (not so hard) on my mental health.

Well when we got back to my parents house (we don’t live together but that’s a whole other story) my mom had given me the garage code so o could go inside and relax as I had work the next morning (I ended up calling off due to the emotional state I was in) but it didn’t work. No matter what code I tried, how hard or soft I pushed- nothing worked. At this point I was so frustrated I couldn’t take it anymore and started going into an episode. I called my mom and started crying saying it wasn’t working then getting very angry and wanting to leave.

Casual dating and BPD,1715081852.0,"Hi folks, I wonder if any of you date casually and how is it going for you?

A little bit of background info: I recently broke up with my partner of 3+ years and decided to date without serious committment, mainly looking for FWB and casual dating. So far I've met two people, we had a really good time and I had sex with both of them. I was kinda sex deprived in said relationship and now want to explore my sexuality more. The problem, however, occurs after the date - if they don't text soon and show interest in me, I get anxious and think they don't want to see me anymore. Also, I accidentally told one of the dates I have BPD and haven't seen them since (2 weeks), they don't text me either (I texted them asking if they want to meet again and got the reply that they're busy at work) - which I ***naturally*** interpret as them thinking I'm crazy and should be steered clear of. I'm super scared of getting clingy and fcking things up.

Do you have any tips on how to handle this anxiety and how to actually **enjoy** casual dating?

Thank you in advance :)

Undeserving of Love,1715069465.0,"I know it is in my neurotic nature to view things a little negatively, & I try to not let thoughts like these win.
 
I am 21 years old and I have gone through more trauma than most, not all, but most of anybody that I know.

I was molested as a child for five years by a trusted family member who was related to my childhood best friend. I was also molested by said childhood best friend.

I had seen somebody very important to me shoot themselves in the face, and had to force myself to be resilient enough to process that as a young girl still in middle school.

I had to lie to CPS at 15 out of fear of being separated from my little sister. I have three siblings in total, but we do not speak: None of them are borderlines. Just me. I am the black sheep. 

My father was a dead beat, who I had only met a handful of times. My step father wasn’t any better - a violent man who my mother only married and obeyed for her own security.

My mother was a diagnosed narcissist. A strict & controlling Jehovah’s Witness. I can’t remember the last time my mother hugged or complimented me. She usually expressed her “love” towards me with materialistic items such as steak dinners or cruises. 

That sounds nice, right? Sure.

But she was an alcoholic, too. She’s choked me against the wall by her arm and told me she’s wished I was dead. She was so controlling when I was a child - I didn’t have a touch phone until I graduated high school. Wasn’t allowed to drive, wasn’t allowed to close my bedroom or bathroom door, wasn’t allowed to have social media. I only had a flip phone that my mother controlled VIA her Verizon account which would flag her if I ever tried to text a phone number that wasn’t hers. She would email my teachers and ask them who I sat next to in class, who I walked with, and then eventually she applied to work at my school herself. 

I wasn’t allowed to date, have friends, go to the mall, go to the movies, go to football games or school dances.

She isolated me and constantly told me I had to represent her. Perfect, blonde, ladylike, and a daughter of God.

She would destroy my bedroom and take my little sister out for breakfast while I cleaned her mess up as punishments. She’d rip up homework assignments if I used her printer without permission and she’d take away my right to wearing winter coats at the bus stop.

She’d make me late for school to hover behind me as I covered bruises and cuts with makeup. Black eyes, busted open lips, bruised ribs and bruised legs. Her fingerprints bruised into my arms.

She’d tell me nobody would ever marry me and I would look ugly in a wedding dress. My parents have told me their love for me is conditional and my mother stole the first car I bought myself as a teenager to sell to my older sister. 

She even destroyed a piggy bank my great grandmother painted for me and in doing so said “she never loved you anyways.”

I was just 14. 

I also remember her sitting on my head with her hands and knees, pushing all of her weight into my skull. I was also 14. I remember laying on the bathroom floor just waiting for her to crush my head and kill me. 

I remember all the nights my mom never came to pick me up from work as a teenager, and I remember us fist fighting until my hands were covered in blood. I remember the boiling rage I felt when she’d pull me into a hug a few moments after, saying to me “You know nobody loves you more than I do.”

She’d force me to sleep with her sometimes, too. Not sexually. More like she would be drunk and would beg me to soothe her through the night. I fucking hated doing it, I didn’t want to soothe this fucking monster. This rotten woman…

But I did it anyways. Because she was my mommy, & I loved her. 

I did EVERYTHING for her. I existed for her.

I left home the day I turned 18 & fell into the hands of a lot of people who targeted girls like me. But I didn’t know this at the time - I idolized  people and believed they could commit no evil. 

Moved in with a boyfriend when I had no car, no job, no phone. He stabbed me in my arm with a knife once, water boarded me, raped me OVER and OVER and OVER. Eventually left me homeless.

The boyfriend before him cheated on me and ended up marrying the girl. He was my first Favorite Person & also a diagnosed sociopath. He told me he never wanted a family but had a baby with her so quickly..

I have a lot of issues from all of this, clearly. 

I developed severe OCD, eating disorders, PTSD, major depressive disorder, but the most difficult is BPD.

I remember when I was a little girl I would cry at my window for Peter Pan to save me. All that I wanted was to be a wife and a mother, I told myself that if I didn’t kill my self and just kept holding on, I’d be safe and protected by somebody who loves me. I’ll never be hit or punched or scratched or screamed at or gaslit or manipulated or brainwashed ever again. I held on tightly to that hope as I left home and ran straight to the nearest man that LOVED how fucked up I was. Naive and young and completely alone.

Did you spend your 18th hanging out with friends? I spent mine sobbing on my boyfriend’s doorsteps as I tried to quickly come up with a way to survive. I remember walking to work until my heels bled, I remember teaching my own self how to pump gas or write a check, I remember having ABSOLUTELY NOOOOOOBOOOOOOOOODY except for me.

I’ve realized now I probably am never going to get that happy family picture I always dreamed of. My life is way too complicated for the average person to comprehend and handle. I think I have been a fool for thinking my past traumas did not matter and that I could live my life unscathed.

People love me at first - they become obsessed over me. I’m the “different” girl, the “mysterious” girl. I’m a character to them but to me this is MY real life. Once they realize that my dark runs just as deep as my light, it’s over. I think people find me alluring because I am attractive and I am socially intelligent enough to morph myself into a reflection of your own interests. 

But once I let someone in, they feel blind sided. They can’t grasp how so much depth exists within one person. They do not understand how trauma forever changes brain chemistry during key developmental stages. They do not understand how hard I TRY.


I’ve tried so many different angles. But none of them work.

I think I am meant for a life of solitude. I used to think maybe I could only date another borderline, or a therapist. Someone who really really understood.

I don’t want to be a statistic. A lot of people are usually surprised to learn I have a cluster B personality type because I am just so good at playing the social games everyone is so easy to understand, so easy to see, and so easy for me to predict. 

I have a hard time meeting others who are the same as I am. Sometimes I even wish I was with a narcissist again. 

I don’t know. I just think, with assisted dying being an option for those with BPD & all, I just think we should not even fucking be here. Even the professionals know that. Clearly.


Nobody is ever as emotionally intelligent as I am, and no it isn’t the grandiosity speaking. But I feel like if I have spent the time to learn about myself and my triggers and my emotions, why can’t others do the same to themselves and also to me? I thought that is how it worked? 

It is because they LOVE me. But they don’t love ME.

Worst comes to worst if I am not married by 40 I will just adopt. Perhaps I was meant to be a therapist… & only that. I wanted to be a licensed clinical social worker, I wanted to write books about the brain, I wanted to conduct my own  research on psychology.

I wanted to do this alongside someone, as their wife and their child’s mother.

I’ve never cheated before. I’ve never hit someone I was with. I’ve never called a partner a bad name, I’ve never left them to cry alone.

I loved people until I got to the point to where I have realized I am simply, plainly, unlovable. 

I have a good brain that could be put to work, so I suppose I should stop trying to love people so much and just focus on what I know I can excel at instead. Just bluntly accept the fact that I am indeed wired wayyy differently than the rest of these people, and begin to live accordingly.

I do not think I was meant to be loved. My chances at that were destroyed as soon as I was born. Before that, even, stress in the womb from my father knocking her up and then running away.

All I want is love.

PMDD and BPD (Depo??) (SI),1715046125.0,"So I recently got a PMDD diagnosis and man. My doctor is making me feel like there's no hope. I have had a hormonal IUD in for over 2 years now.

Which means I only have a like a week and a half free from PMSing. 
Having PMDD and BPD feels so painful. I genuinely can't handle the breakdowns. I talked to my doctor and asked for support and he said ""you've been on every medication under the sun"" then gave me the depo shot (on top of the hormonal IUD). Had something weird happen with my heart like a day after which might be a silent heart attack but at this point I don't even want to find out. Almost 2 weeks later and I am PMSing again.

How to tell between splitting/senseless anger vs anger that makes total sense?,1715016112.0,"Idk if I'm wording this right, English isn't my first language so bear with me.

So for context, me and my partner are both diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, so we have a hard time admitting our faults when we fight, or just being patient with each other. We both have abusive traits in the relationship and I'm not proud of that.

But I got ZERO mental health knowledge, so I don't really know how to tell when I'm wrong for screaming, contradicting, ignoring, being angry at my partner and when I'm right for doing so (as in: he did something that will spite an angry response in ANYONE). 

Yesterday, his sister brought us some chinese fried rice since its my favorite food with some fries. We're Costarrican, so this isn't everyday food btw, this shits special.
As it was cold, and my boyfriend didn't show any interest in it since it ""looked weird"", I started cleaning HIS familys house, doing some leftover dishes, wiping the tables, cleaning the floors a little... so I could peacefully sit and eat the fried rice. I mean, I'm getting a little treat from his sister, might as well treat her by cleaning their house.
I was finishing everything up, I even air fried the fries separately so they wouldnt taste like microwave... and surprise, my boyfriend is now besides me, looking at the food with hungry eyes...... I thought to myself: ""Nah, he wouldn't eat the fries, he just ate a bunch of food..."". I washed a last dish and I turn and boom, one fry left on the plate. I caught him red handed.
I would've broken up with him for this. Like, dissapeared forever, for a bunch of fries... 

I was so angry, I wanted to scream, I felt a pressure in my chest, my eyes were crying before i even processed whatever happened... I wanted to die over some fries. And this happens all. the. time. over a thousand other things... 
I ended up angry for an hour or two until I stopped being mad and I asked him to say sorry to me because he clearly saw how much it hurt me... but its such a stupid thing, why am I even treating someone poorly over these stupid reasons???? What can I do?? How do I tell when I should be mad or when not to be mad, especially when I'm angry with my partner over past things that genuinely matter and hurt me? Even if i supposedly forgave him, I still bring those thoughts forth when we fight!!

Would anyone ever be up to chat? ,1714966151.0,"Hi everyone, I'm 26. I love photography, eating healthy and Ive always been an extrovert. I love hearing people's stories and getting to know people. 

What I've been interested in lately is maybe getting to know someone else with BPD. It would be great to get another person's perspective on it and how it impacts their life.

I have quiet bpd. I have issues with internalizing/ and catastrophizing the things that happen in my life. I don't get mad or self harm, I just hide from the things I feel hurt by. 

I completely understand the amount of emotional pain that comes with this problem, I understand the social misunderstandings and the never ending shame. The social intensity, I get it.

I know what it's like to be one second happy and then the next second devastated over the most trivial things.

I've been doing my best with trying to understand my limitations, to learn from the past and hopefully take less rides on the never ending rollercoaster. 

If anyone is open to sharing their story and what's going on with their life, my dms are open.

Favorite person ,1714856481.0,"For individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), a 'favorite person' can play a central role in their lives and significantly impact their emotional well-being. The term 'favorite person' refers to an individual, often a friend, family member, or partner, whom someone with BPD considers their primary source of support, validation, and stability.

The relationship with the favorite person is often intense and complex, characterized by strong emotional bonds and profound dependence. For individuals with BPD, the favorite person can serve as an emotional lifeline, someone they rely on to help them cope with intense emotions, mood swings, and identity issues.

However, it's important to note that fixation on the favorite person can also be a significant challenge. Individuals with BPD may become excessively fixated on their favorite person, experiencing intense anxiety and fear of abandonment if they perceive any loss of support or connection. This fixation can lead to disruptive behaviors such as outbursts of anger or self-harm.

Acknowledging and understanding the dynamics of the relationship with the favorite person is crucial for providing effective support to individuals with BPD. Therapy and support focused on developing healthy coping mechanisms and strengthening emotional regulation skills can make a difference in the lives of those affected by BPD and their loved ones.

Additionally, it's worth noting that for some individuals, such as myself, the fixation on the favorite person can be particularly severe. In my case, my previous psychologist was my favorite person, and I have not been able to move on from this fixation, causing significant distress and difficulty in managing my emotions. 

Are there others here who experience this as well? If so, who is your favorite person? And how do you cope with it?",thisborderline,,False,1ckaf90,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ckaf90/favorite_person/
How to talk about a FP to other loved ones? ,1714851351.0,"How to talk about a FP to other loved ones? 

I (27f) have been in a relationship with my gf (27f) for almost 2.5 years. After the first 1/1.5 years or so I slowly started losing touch with more and more friends as well as my family. It had multiple reasons and it was definitely not just on me (I won’t bore you with the whole story and all the reasons), but a big thing was definitely that my relationship started being very codependent. I was not doing good at the time at ALL and living with my gf in a city where I had no one else, I leaned on her a lot. In the meantime though, I have always felt incredibly ashamed and guilty for losing all of these people. Especially because I was always known as such a loyal and good friend, daughter and sister, and I felt like I changed. There were many reasons I didn’t manage to mend things (yet), but I guess a big one was the fact that I did not know what to say about how my relationship played a part in it — both because I never wanted to be the person who chose a relationship/partner over everything and everyone ALL the time, but also because I felt like I was blaming my gf when she did nothing wrong. I did not want other people to perceive her as the problem, nor did I want her to feel like that.

Fast forward to two weeks ago, I finally got diagnosed with BPD (with probable underlying ADHD/autism) and everything started to make more sense. It’s so clear that I have developed a strong FP attachment to my gf and that leads me to neglect other people and other things. I hate it, but it also gave me some peace knowing it as I can understand myself more now.

Now for my actual question, does anyone have any tips on how to communicate with others that I have this FP attachment? And what that means and does? 

I really want to take accountability for my shortcomings but I also want to be understood. I especially want to talk to my 2 (ex?) best friends as well as my parents + sister. There were other reasons that I went no contact with my parents for a while (to protect myself after years and years of intensity and toxicity), but I do believe I would’ve dealt with this different/faster if I didn’t have this FP attachment. My gf opened my eyes more to how my parents (mainly my mom) really treat me and I’m thankful she helped me stand up for myself, but I’d still like to work on this relationship and my parents do deserve an explanation on the things that make that more difficult for me.

Not sure how to navigate,1714665354.0,"This is my first time posting in here, kinda nervous ngl. Sorry in advance that this is so long..

I (f28) met my person (f23) almost a year & a half ago. I’m diagnosed & unmedicated severe BPD for the past 6ish years. When we first met, we both communicated very well about how we were & what we feel our ups/downs are. About 6mos in, I started having symptoms of a BPD split bc of a situation in which I attempted to let her in on my grief (something I guard ferociously) & it wasn’t perceived. At that time, it seemed as if she didn’t care about me the way I’d been believing she did up until then. That initiated my split & to be completely honest, I cannot even begin to list or explain the things that I was feeling. I just was feeling as though she was completely against me & didn’t understand why she stayed around. I was drowning in the moment that caused the split & got stuck in that spiral. While she, on the other hand, was pushing & pushing for me to meet her needs in the present moments. (Theres things & moments that I’m leaving out for the sake of trying not to make this post way longer). In December (2 days before her birthday), I was told something that was along the lines of her cheating on me that dated back to the summer. This set me off even more & when I brought it to her attention, she seemed as though it wasn’t important enough to take upon herself to rectify. That made me feel like there’s some truth to the information, which I still haven’t been able to let go of. In January she moved out & back with her family in an attempt to put space so we can get better. In my opinion, it was working up until mid-Feb when she came to me about a personal medical situation that threw me for a loop especially seeing how we’d been intimate & I was being made aware of it just over a month after she moved. I was feeling very much so like just as we were going to be able to close the door on one thing, another door of bs opens up. I started feeling overwhelmed again & I didn’t feel like I had any support from her because she was worried about why I wasn’t giving her what she wanted/needed from me in the moment. I tried explaining that I was having a hard time processing everything (I process from the past to the present, not the present to the past so it’s basically like everything in the present is on pause while I go thru the past to identify different things). At the end of February/beginning of March, I reached out to an ex due to the fact that I’d noticed similarities between that relationship & this one that I wanted to correctly identify so I could change it in the present. That led to her & I spending about a week or so together with her spending the nights here. On the day that the ex was leaving, my person came in & saw her standing in my room while I was in bed freshly showered & had just taken my robe off to lay down (so it looked way worse than it was). That led to a long night of me explaining the BPD split, the reason I reached out to my ex in the first place, as well as the lies I’d told to keep it from being found out. I admitted it was super impulsive & I didn’t think at all before doing it, as well as not taking into account how it’d look or be perceived by anyone else. I told her it could be fixed & we could get better but it’d take a lot of work to do so simply bc I’m now in a space where I realize I let my BPD get way out of control. I was in my own shit storm for 8mos at that point & I have a lot of work to do to repair this relationship that’s been broken for about 5 of those 8. The next couple of weeks was kinda hard, there were some uncomfortable conversations but I did my best & explained as much as I could. I started changing my behavior as well. Last week there was a night she’d come over to spend time with me & asked to see the text messages between my ex & I, in which I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that due to the sensitivity of the conversations (they were majorly centered around my grief & my feelings/emotions during the first two years of it prior to the breakup). It’s not that I don’t want her to know now, I just feel like there’s steps that need to be taken before that due to the fact that up until this moment, the only time my grief has been brought up is during an argument about something else. She never asks me about it, and to me it doesn’t make sense to allow her into that part of myself without her ever even trying to talk about it with me. She’s now said to me that she started seeing someone, and is done trying to pressure me to open up to her. I’ve been doing CBT/DBT, as well as the BPD workbook by Dr. Fox all on my own to be able to get better for myself as well as the betterment of our relationship. I’m stuck feeling like I’m not being given a chance to actually open myself completely up to expose myself to the person that I want nothing less than forever with. I texted her this morning asking if we could talk in person because I need to be able to convey this to her. I’m just not sure how to go about it at all - what do I say or not say, what options there are to hold myself to, and more importantly if she can be the support I need to get us on the same page again so we can move forward. Does anyone have any suggestions on what things to touch on and what to leave alone? I really want us to seek couples therapy to bridge the gap that we’ve wedged.

My ex is my forever FP 🤡 but man is it complicated,1714580310.0,"I (F25) met my ex (M25) before I was diagnosed and unmedicated. I can take responsibility for the ways in which I sabotaged the relationship even before we got together. I refused to be exclusive and was dating around. But when I finally realised what was infront of me. I cut the shit. I was dedicated, head over heels but the damage was done, the resentment in him just grew until everything became so toxic I had to end things. The problem is, this is my forever FP. For whatever reason we can’t stay away from each other. The last 2 almost 3 years broken up we’ve both (mostly him) broken no contact. Tried to get back together atleast 4 times and failed. We are fwb right now but rarely see each other because I moved 8 months after our break up. I have every reason to not want him in my life, he dated his best friend he always told me not to worry about, he’s said some god awful things when he resented me & he’s sworn off love and relationships. I should walk away but he’s the only person that truly gets me. Even at my very worst, he’s there. I feel my most myself around him. I’m not sure where I end and he begins. I’ve had other FPs. They burned just as hot (burning me in the process) and just as fast as a shooting star. No one….but him, ever cares to stick around. But ofc he doesn’t want to be with me. I mean, I’m a shitshow, who would??? but I can tell my heart is still holding on to this kind of hope. Maybe I’ll be good enough, maybe he’ll fall for me again. Maybe the next  time it’ll work and we will be the phenomenal love we once had or better. I’ll be honest, before things got bad and toxic, the relationship was straight out of a fairytale. I to this day don’t know how I could be loved or love someone that much. But we did and everyday was a promise for it to grow a little more. Really cause why else in 3ish years have we not learnt how to move on or accept no longer being in each other’s lives? Maybe I should get a dog and I won’t feel so so dependent and searching for signs. Thats so random I know but trust me, it makes sense in my head.

Sacred to break up with FP,1714566946.0,"Scared *

In desperate need of advice. 

My boyfriend and I have been on and off for nearly 2 years now. From 15 to nearly 18. I struggled with intense mental health issues my whole life (bpd, autism, adhd, extreme anxiety etc) and I felt for the first time in my life, in his arms, my mind went quiet. He is my first boyfriend, first love, took my virginity and gave me a lot of new life experiences. He became my FP very quickly and I developed an intense and unhealthy attachment to him. Almost like a parental attachment as I never got much affection from my own parents. He became my only source of safety from my own mind. 

Some backstory on our relationship 

Even just the start of our relationship was very rocky and caused a lot of pain for me. He was unable to commit and date multiple months but would still treat me like his girlfriend (going on road trips with his family, having sleepovers for weeks etc, having dinner at his grandparents house, calling me honey and baby and so much more) He would sleep with girls, occasionally sending photos to me with them, telling me, when asked where he was, “you don’t want to know”. Only to then come stay at mine for nights on end. Repeat. The pain this inflicted was unbearable but I didn’t care when I was in his arms. Even when he was hurting me the most it was him who I wanted to run and cry to. This happened maybe 4-5 times until I told him I was done. He then decided that very day he was ready to commit and was in love with me, while also maintaining that his behaviour wasn’t wrong. Maybe I was too naive, maybe he was testing the waters to see just how much he could walk all over me. 

Our relationship was so intense. Almost a spiritual experience. I brought a lot of my own insecurities mixed with the ones I created during the first few months. We had broken up numerous times, 5 out of 6 being by him. Every break up was just as intense as the last. I begged him to stay, I promised to change, I promise it was a turning point etc. The hardest breakup lasted 4 months and I was distraught. We broke up about 30 minutes before my birthday. I spent my birthday trying to hold it together, until that night he posted a photo with the girl/ at the girls house he told me not to worry about. I was intensely suicidal unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. I couldn’t cope. I would cry until I vomited everyday for months. I couldn’t sleep in my own bed for a while as it reminded me of him. I couldn’t be present in anything, I neglected all my responsibilities. I turned to drugs, alcohol, flings, constantly stalking his social media, asking around to find out what he was doing, you name it. The pain was genuinely unbearable and I couldn’t see myself getting through it. I genuinely for the first time thought I was going to end things. 

Then I get a message. It didn’t come as a complete shock as a mutual friend was almost speaking to each other, for us. We are both incredibly stubborn and he refused to reach out unless he knew I would reply. Of course I did. This led to talking non stop, to hanging out, to being in a relationship all probably within the span of a week. I was ecstatic. I knew it was a terrible idea but I didn’t care, he loved me!!! He wanted me!!! 

Reality hit not long after, old habits became present quickly. I continued to have issues when it came to his habits of lying, not trusting him in the slightest, not being able to let go of the hurtful things, not feeling cared for or appreciated etc. I struggle immensely to know if these feelings are caused by BPD or are a reality. Lots of people around me see the way he treats me as wrong, but are they just saying that? He’s ingrained into my mind that I am the problem the whole relationship, which could be true but a lot of the hurtful things he’s done I can’t understand how they could be considered okay. 

Now where I need advice

He’s making a lot of progress in his career, which might entail him to move overseas. He’s been telling me this for a while but I didn’t accept it as a reality. But slowly, it’s gotten more real and I fear he will be moving soon. When the possibility of long distance was brought up he immediately shut it down. Saying he would not do it. I was shattered. I would do anything to be with him. I bargained, cried, pleaded. He said he would try and make things work if he was only going for small periods but has also made it clear he mightn’t like it and will end things. So many things go through my mind, does he want to be able to have sex with random girls again? Does he not love me? Is he not as committed as I am? He currently has no set timeframe on when he’s going or how long for. He told me he understands if I need to end things and left it upto me. It almost felt as if he was advocating for breaking up. Like he didn’t care, wasn’t fussed either way, like he expected I was going to. This caused me an intense panic attack. I’m terrified to go through the pain again out of fear that I literally won’t survive. I genuinely feel as if my life depends on this relationship, which is definitely unfair on him and I would never tell him that. 

I told him I would make it work while we still could and there was no sense of relief from him in the slightest. No excitement, nothing. All he said was “yea that’s what I’ve been saying” and went to sleep as I cried all night. 


Do I stay with him until he needs to go, given the possibility he might come back soon etc, even though he seems checked out and careless either way? Do I stay and try and make myself stronger so when the time comes I don’t fear my life? 

Or do I end things now, rip the bandaid off, induce potential years of pain and regret if he doesn’t move? 

I’m terrified of the pain I feel due to my BPD and I’m so conflicted in my mind of what is the best decision. Any help means the absolute world.

"Very confused about my sexuality, and emotions in general/",1714461625.0,"I really need like advice or help. I don't think I'm overthinking it but since I struggle with alexithymia cause of my bpd, and the fact I struggle with like sense of self, I'm left very confused about myself. (Swear I'm not a real person) So basically, quite recently I've been really confused about my sexuality. I think I'm bisexual or biromantic but something have been throwing me off. My friends recently made a joke about how they cant see me with a man (despite the fact I have a boyfriend) and I could understand why. I don't generally like men, not to be sexist, but everytime I've been in a conversation with one or like around them in general I feel bad, its painful. I had it when I first met my boyfriend too but like I got to know them and it went away for them specifically. I noticed that most of the men I get along with are usually queer and autistic (both at the same time, never either or). I always like say I love women but I never actually got to date a woman. I realized my sexuality while I was friends with my current bf so its kind of too late to try to date one. I cant really tell what my emotions are towards dating women, and sometimes it feels like I have imposter syndrome when it comes to it.  I've only ever dated men, but men online, who never showed their face or spoke in vc (till this day but my boyfriend has like a valid reason ngl). Sometimes I think I'm cursed tho, like I'm not meant to have normal relationships. I also think I'm asexual despite my hypersexuality (its bad it consumes my thoughts sometimes but I never really show that.) I know for sure I MIGHT Be asexual but I DONT know I love men or women, I THINK honestly it just depends on the person. But tbh if things don't work out with my current bf, I would rather bury myself alive then date another man, especially online. Its too conflicting with my bpd. Im scared I think I'm only into men because that's what society has pushed on me since I was young, and that I only date men for like some kind of validation. Im mostly only comfortable around women. Its all so confusing cause I truly don't know what I feel even if I try to put into words or pinpoint the cause of whatever I'm feeling.

Could the lack of identity be linked to my parents,1714452232.0,"Since I was little I have always, and I mean ALWAYS been compared to my parents by both of them. The constant ""you're like your mom, you look like your mom, you sound like your mom,"" from my dad and family members (including my exhusband) and the ""you look like your dad, you act like your dad, you're like your dad"" I hear from my mom.
It bothers me greatly, I'm 32 and not once have I heard ""YA that's a **** thing"" or ""that's just **** being ****."" It's always ""gosh, you know that thing your mom does, well..."" or ""wow, you sound like your mom on the phone I thought you were her."" Or ""god you're like your dad, not happy unless you're miserable""
I'm just my mom and my dad combined, biologically and identity. There is no me, only them and it makes me so fucking sad.
I don't even know what my identity would be if I wasn't constantly compared to them. I'm having a hard night my mom showed me a photo if my exes cat and I was in the background and I just couldn't stand looking at myself, she also pointed out we look the same.

Should I stay in my messy relationship?,1714374244.0,"I've been diagnosed with BPD since I was 17 (I'm 24 now) and I've done a lot of different therapies for it. I thought I was getting better for the longest time because I thought I had my emotions and everything under control, especially in relationships. I've been seeing my boyfriend for roughly 2 years and I've noticed I've completely went off the rails. Any sense of emotional stability I've had before has completed disappeared. 2 years ago I was holding down a stable and really good paying job for 3 years and I think they liked me considering they trained me in every department and would always complement my work. I also had lots of friends and was very social, I even had friends that I was friends with for 9 years (there would be a few years in between where we wouldn't talk because of them moving or just different life pathways but always found our way back to each other). I also was in university and bought a car from the dealership and my credit score was really amazing too. I really felt like my life has direction at that point. That was until my dad got his second DUI and went into rehab and came out of rehab doing meth and completely flipping out. That's when I met my boyfriend. It was such a a rough time for me, I had to talk to the cops a lot and get a restraining order against my dad for awhile. My boyfriend was unlike anyone else I dated, he didn't try and force me to have sex and I waited awhile before hooking up with him, and even before we had hooked up he was there to support me through everything! I was so appreciative and really fell in love because I thought he was so compassionate. He had recently went through a break up so I had a sneaking suspicion I was a rebound and I just wanted to know where he and him stood. He promised me I wasn't a rebound and he hadn't talked to his ex for a few months. My BPD started flairing up and I went through his phone (I'm sorry I know it's bad but I developed this bad habit from my last ex being with him for a whole year and trusting him but seeing millions of girls messaging him till I finally had a hunch and checked and was mortified, I just didn't want to waste my time again) I found text messages between his friend and him saying that if he hooked up with me he'd basically be tunnel brothers with all his buddies (which is far from true, he thought I hooked up with both his friends but I only hooked up with his one other friend once when I was blackout at a party and I didn't even really want it to happen) it hurt my feelings to feel like he was talking about me like that to his friends and kinda made me feel like a whore. I ended up flipping and waking him up with a garbage bag full of his stuff and sent him home. We ended up talking it out and we started hanging again. But then whenever he got drunk, he'd call me his ex's name, and he called her and said he loved her and missed her. I was devastated once again, but now I felt like an easy rebound whore. So we once again fought and he convinced me it wasn't that way, just to go and hook up with her the one night I asked for space (he is extremely codependent). I was pissed and tried to convince myself I was done with him. But I'm stupid so I forgave him, I think I only did that because of all the trauma I was going through with my dad, I really wanted someone to be there for me and hold me and tell me everything was okay. He was back at my place again for awhile and then he disappeared to his ex's place for a whole week and swore on his life he didn't hook up with her and was just there to support her through a rough time (he only recently told me they did actually hook up). I spent the whole week crying at work and just being miserable. He begged me to stay with him and I did, which is something I've never done before. I've never ever ever let someone disrespect me like this before, but I felt so low and vulnerable. We were together for awhile after all that and it was so hard for me to not want to abandon him at any fight we had. We fought a lot and were pretty miserable together. I was really trying to break things off but he kept claiming he really wanted to be with me. He hooked up with a new girl he met and was hanging with secretly behind my back at his friends place for a month or two. What made me really mad is I would let him drive my car over there while I was at work and I bought an Xbox for him to use at my place and he was playing games with her while I was at work. Anyways he hooks up with her and she has BPD too. So off the hop she started tracking his location and everything, so he came clean to me about it and told me she was crazy and regrets doing it. I told him that he should just be with her and just leave me alone. She ended up needing help and he convinced me to go pick her up and help her get drugs. She ends up getting me and him into doing those drugs (we've done it before and were completely sober, just have a hard time saying no when it's right in front of me). We all ended up going on a 7 day bender and by the end of it I was all alone and the most mentally fucked I've ever been. They ended up dating. For a whole month he kept pressuring me to come over and give me drugs to drive them around and he even pressured me into a threesome. I only did it because I'm stupid and just did kinda want to be high and see him. They were absolutely vile to me while I was there and I finally got the back bone to block them and sober up. She would make millions of tiktoks about how she fucked him in the bed beside me to put me in my place and how she wants to beat me up now that I didn't want to be their bitch. She even threatened to send a whole gang of people to my house if I didn't send her money at one point. I was nothing but nice to her, swear on my life! She wanted to put me in my place because I warned her that he can be cheaty and to watch out! And she claimed I was trying to break them up. She still to this day posts about me and it's been a year since him and her were last together. Anyways, I was dating someone and doing shitty but alright. Sober, university drop out, bluey watching, chain smoking, loser on medical leave from work. My ex got me up and I dropped everything to meet up with him and to hear how shit his life was without me (hopefully) and it was. He GOT HER PREGNANT!!! And was absolutely MISERABLE! I was rolling. I wanted to laugh in his face and go back to eating cupcakes and watching bluey buuuutttt I self sabotaged my life and decided I wanted revenge on the girl for being a dick to me so I broke up with my boyfriend ( I held him back anyways, he deserves way better then a dumpster fire like me) and I hooked up with him while she was pregnant and behind her back and threw it in her face and then laughed at the tiktoks of her balling her eyes. I know I'm horrible, I really wasn't thinking right, I was kinda off the rails and sick of feeling like everyone gets to shit on me and have no repercussions, if I could go back in time I would have never met up with him. I didn't want to get back together but I ended up hooking up with him long enough that we did (the sex is the best I've ever had for some reason and he really makes me feel safe because of being there for the stuff with my dad). Getting back together with him made all my friends drop me, they were already mad at me for being too depressed and reclused for awhile.I was an ass to him though, constantly mad about him even being with a girl that was so cruel to other girls like that (even though I kinda was cruel to her by taking him back for revenge for all the shit she did to me). We were once again miserable together but I had quite my other job and now we were miserable and broke. my mom got us a job together and we started to work and save up for an apartment (I'm good at saving, he blew my money and his). I ended up having to borrow the money from my grandma for first and last ($3000, which I still have to pay her back for) I was also the only one allowed on the lease because of my good credit score and before we moved in, while I was working over time, he was looking at the girls onlyfans. Turns out he used his first paycheck to subscribe and look at her shit. It was a big blow up fight and he told me he only wanted to see if she was posting their videos they made together. We already had the apartment lined up so I forgave him and told him to just be honest with me and to never do it again. By that point I was so angry and resentful towards him, I was miserable everyday. He refused to cuddle with me or be affectionate with me at all or even have sex with me. I started becoming an angry violent alcoholic and we started to go at each other. I fucked his teeth up and he left me all bruised up. Our apartment was disgusting, he never helped me clean or cook or do laundry, he just played videogames and ignored me. He also brought his dog that he got with him and that girl together to our apartment and it wasn't house trained so it peed on everything. The dog peed on the couch I bought so much that I had to pay to throw it out. It peed on my Tv remote, laptop, bed and pillows, like literally everything. I dislike dogs because my parents would get aggressive rescues when I was a child that would attack me and I grew up to find them loud, obnoxious, and gross. I was the only one cleaning up after his dog. I found him on onlyfans again buying a bunch of girls content when he couldn't pay his phone bill that was in my name since he had no credit to get a new phone ( I got him a brand new phone and a phone plan), and he was even short on rent most of the time. He literally would beg them to meet up and everything. I was officially numb and done. I tried for a whole week to break up with him sobbing and begging for me not too, he begged me to give him one more month and I agreed. But then his dad died. I was such a a cunt to him though when his dad was dying because of the onlyfans stuff and I dislike dogs and his mom has 13 dogs and her house is covered in piss, shit, dirt, and dog hair. The dogs literally pee on everything. So I tried to support him from a distance, even though I drove him to the hospital and made sure to buy his dad blanket and slippers and soup when he couldn't eat the hospital food. But when it came time for us to wait out his death at his mom's place, I really didn't want to be there for him. I wanted to be able to come during the day but then spend the night at my parents place which was 10 minutes away. But he made me stay and we fought a lot. After his dad past, since we took so much time to take care of him we ended up losing our jobs. I instantly applied for welfare to make sure we could still pay rent, he on the other hand didn't. So I had to borrow money from my mom to pay his half of the rent. I also had to start going to the food bank and he refused to come with me even though I was anxious. I had to make him apply for welfare to help me because he refused to let me have my friends move in for us to be able to pay rent. Eventually I had enough and broke up with him and instantly hopped into a new relationship. I spent the whole month away from him anxious and feeling like shit, he was absolutely miserable and missed me and called me crying everyday. I ended up finding out I was pregnant with his kid (break up sex 🙄) and so I got back together with him and ended up  misscarry on Valentine's day, which was not my worst Valentines day lmao. But since getting back together he's made major improvements and swears on his life he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and I hates himself everyday for what he did to me. He has made major improvements but now I'm so broken and fucked up, I've become just like him when he was treating me like garbage. We had to move into his mom's place since my dad started doing meth again and I have another restraining order against my dad. I just feel triggered constantly at his mom's place. So should I even bother staying with him at this point? He has changed a lot, but now I'm extremely toxic and miserable. I don't know anymore if I'm dumb for believing him still and if I should just get a backbone and leave for good?",constellationcapra,,False,1cfsqxh,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1cfsqxh/should_i_stay_in_my_messy_relationship/
Ghosted. Posting to process. 👻 😞,1714363376.0,"I think this ex of mine may be ghosting me and it’s making my stomach churn. We dated a couple years ago. He’s a good person and we left things on decent terms other than that he really pushed my boundaries when I needed space to a point that felt intrusive. I really needed an indefinite pause because feeling pressured to be more available than I had capacity for made me feel super frustrated and guilty. I didn’t want to be temperamental.
Recently I reached back out. I took a really long time to do that, in part because I wanted to be sure I had healed enough to be a good friend to him and hopefully not end up in a similar holding pattern.
He was happy to hear from me and we talked for awhile and had coffee. It seemed like a genuinely kind connection still. He is doing better in life overall, making more $$, seeing someone new and it’s going well.
I am genuinely happy for him and also felt like maybe that would make it easier to be friends again too, since the boundaries are clear. He said not being in contact had weighed on him and that it felt really nice and relieving to be back in touch. 
Anyhow long story short, last we texted he was going to give me some eclipse glasses, and we were planning to have another coffee when he returned from a weekend trip to see the full eclipse. And weeks passed with no word.
I texted this morning and basically just said hi. The message was delivered but no reply.
It’s got me feeling super anxious and anguished & weird, like it was wrong or foolish of me to try and stay friends.
A couple years ago, he had professed such deep care for me and had said (sort of jokingly but sincere) I am going to stay part of his life whether I liked it or not.
I guess I believed that & it’s why I took the risk of reconnecting. I am thinking it’s maybe not true anymore that he wants to stay friends.
Honestly if I was in his position I might have a hard time if an ex popped back up two years later.
I didn’t think he was the type to ghost ever, or I might have been less open with him when we met. I shared good things in my life and also was honest about some recent traumas and that I haven’t really wanted to date much, that when I’ve tried it hasn’t been fun.
Anyhow, I’m feeling sad at another loss. Gratefully I have some beautiful core friends that I’ve stayed fairly close with for decades. It helps me keep in light that I’m a good solid friend to a number of people who don’t think I’m “too much.” 
But the amount of connections that meant something real and then disappear or end painfully — it really warps my brain. I’m feeling so anxious and foolish and like a failure: 
I know it’s not true but I thought I’d vent here instead of just sitting here feeling stuck and bad.
I think I’m stressed about a lot of things and that my brain is snagging on this.
I’d love support, reassurance or relatedness, though I’m definitely not looking for advice.

what is he thinkng? Is he bpd?,1714326496.0,"I've been through a really fucked up situation lately with my ex-boyfriend and I really need to figure out what he might be thinking. I know there's no point but this is what I need so anyone who wants to tell me how I'm better off without him just please skip this post cause I don't need any advice. I just need an analysis of his behaviour cause I need to think this through for my better well-being.

  
So here's the story:  
I met this guy on tinder - M, after deciding I'm moving to other continent and bought tinder plus. We started texting back in September. Back then I did my stalking and noticed how he's following many girls from tinder so I was keeping my distance. He was very sweet and kept telling me how he's waiting on me but then when I arrived to the city in November, he forgot about out date. I already cared about him and as a pwBPD I was hurt that he forgot and decided to go on another date and it ended up in hooking up with this other guy. But M kept apologizing so I decded to give him a chance and see how it goes in real life.  
When we met he was nice but kept complimenting me way too much which made me feel like he's only interested in me cause I'm pretty. I went to restroom and on my way back I saw him texting another girl but I didn't do anything about it. Then he wanted me to go home with him but I didn't want to go with him cause I cared for him in a more serious way. He was drunk and really disappointed and after getting home he texted me sth like ""200 dollars and not even a kiss"" which was a huge red flag and I told him I don't ever want to see him again. But when he got sober he apologized, said he lost control and he wanted to make up for this so I gave him another chance.

  
On our second date he was perfect. Very respectful, not pushing me at all, we had this long ass conversation throughout whole night and I just went home early in the morning. After this we started seeing each other almost everyday and after I guess 3 dates we eventually had sex. Everything felt like heaven, I felt so comfortable with him and we startd seeing each other every single day, After 3 weeks we started being a couple officially and everything was perfect until I got sick. I was bleeding heavily and didn't know why and eventually get checked for std and it turned out I had chlamydia. I didn't know how I caught it so I told him the truth that I slept with another guy before dating him. He got absolutely crazy after finding out. He wanted to break up but I explained to him that it was irrelevant because we weren't even dating at that time. So we continued our relationship but he startd being very controling forbiding me from seeing everyone else but him. At the same time he wanted to go out with his boys, which I allowed to cause I didn't want to be crazy controling girlfriend  
He started being extremely obsessive, one time he was convinced that my bedsheets smell like other man and started crying cause of that. Of course it was just a delusion and I tried to comfort him and reassure that he was the only man in my life and i didn't want anybody else. He also started being oversensitive with my lack of affecton (backstory: i was in abusive relationship back in my home country and then started being less affectionate out of fear, which I informed him about before and he was okay with that), but I cared about him and told him I would try to fix it for him. Eventually we broke up cause he felt like I didn't love him and he was scared I was cheating on him. But I did love him and I was fighting for him and tried to explain that it's fucked up to break up if we both love each other and want to be together only because he's insecure. So we got back together and both were extremely happy about it.  


And then there was a final fight.  
This night we were absolutely in love, talking how we're going to move together and making all the plans for the future. But I found out that he was actually dating a girl that I saw him texting with on out first date and I wanted to talk things through and I said sth like ""I feel quite unfair that you're so upset about me sleeping with a guy before dating you when you were dating other girl"". And this just switched him on. He burst out telling me how stupid I am for bringing this up and ruining our happy time. But I said it only because it bothered me that he was dating other girl while texting me how happy he was to see me. He ordered an uber home, but I said that I think it would be better to talk this through instead of making a fuss so he canceled and stayed. But instead of talking this through he started blaming me how stupid I am and that he doesn't want a girlfriend who does things like this. I tried to stay calm and told him that I don't want to fight 15x in a row while covering my ears but he just wouldn't stop. So after provoking me for 20 min straight I finally spoke back to him. He said sotmehing like : did you enjoy it"" and in emotions i said ""yeah he had a huge fucking dick"". After that he said that i'm never gonna see him again. And I panicked. He wanted to leave my apartment and I was trying to stop him. So he pushed me against the wall, but my abandonment issues were triggered so I got up and still was trying to stop him and he grabbed my shoulders and threw me on the floor. I was panicking he would leave so I grabbed his back and went to balcony and threatened him I would throw it. Then he came and we started pushing around until I finally lost control and slapped his cheek. He slapped mine in return. And I slapped him again.. And he slapped me again but this time it was so hard that I fell to the floor and I lost my hearing. But still I was panicking he would leave so I grabbed his bag again and wanted to throw it out the balcony. He went after me and threw me into glass which caused wounds on my feet, and then he started to choke me with his forearm. I couldn't breathe and after maybe 30 sec he stopped and I got panic attack and started to hyperventilate. I think that's when he realised what he was doing and he wanted to calm me down but I was so panicked I started to run away from him. Then he went to living room and I stayed in bedroom and both of us had huge hysteria in different rooms.  
I was thinking back then how fucked up this situation is but I thought to myself that I'm scared of losing him and I can't tell anyone about it cause then I would have to leave him. And then I started yelling at him to clean up the glass that he threw me into. He was crying and cleaning and after he finished he just left.  
Next day I texted him that I need money for the doctor cause i was still deaf on my left ear but he was shameless and said sth like ""i had this before, don't you worry, you'll be fine soon"". And I told him that I would call the police if he doesn't help me. He didn't acknowledge all the harm he caused and I started feeling extremely suicidal and was begging him to help me. But he said he couldn't help me and that he didn't know what to do so next day when I woke up and kept feeling suicidal I called the police. I told them that I lost hearing and I just need money from my boyfriend. But they came into my apartment and I broke down and told them the whole story. They said he would be charged and (this part is ridiculous) as I'm not native english speaker I thought being charged means that he would have to pay fine. So I testified against him and police took me to hospital due to my suicidal mental state. Later on I foun out he was arrested and charged with criminal offence. He stopped replying to me and I went completely fucking crazy being ghosted.  
At first I wanted him to have the wort punishment but my love for him was stronger than hate so I started thinking of a plan how to get the charges dismissed. I told him about it but he would't answer so after one month of trying I eventually got so frustrated with being ghosted that I started texting girlf from recommendations on his profile. And guess what ;) One girl that I texted admitted to sleeping with him while we were together. So not only he violated me beacuse I mentioned another guy, he also cheated on me while being terrified I would do this to him.

  
I texted him that I found out and I would fuck him up in court and then he blocked me.  
After that I stopped eating and I was vomitting out of stress. I prepared a ""goodbye gif"" for him, writing 3 different letters, printing out our happy in love pictures and then pictures of broken glass and me in hospital, I printed out a book of screenshots of our conversations to show him how much he hurt me.  
When we were still texting I told him that I don't want to date a guy that any girl can have, I told him about my traumas, about my bpd, everything. He was respectful and assuring me that he would be good to me. And while relationship lasted he was. He cared a lot about me, he was obsessed way more than I was, his friends were mocking him how much of a simp he is. We were seeing each other every single day, for one month we lived together in both of our places 24/7 and both of us admitted that it's weird spending this much time with one person and not getting tired. He introduced me to his family. I was using google translate to eavedrop on his converstaion with his father and he was telling him how happy he is to be with me. He was buying me everything, texting me 24/7 telling me he loves me all the time and telling me that he has never met agirl like me before and how special I am. And I he felt it, it wasn't just words, you could see it in his eyes.  
So when I found out he cheated I wasn't even jealous. Of course it broke my heart that he betrayed me, but I know he did it only because he was insecure and needed to get validation.

  
I was thinking if he's a narcissist but i'm 100% sure he's not. He has a lot of narcissist traits though. He is avoiding accountability. He is capable of empathy cause he proved it before but he just switched his empathy off. He told me that he was a motherfucker before but with me he's different. His bodycount is around 50 but he never wanted to know mine cause he was just too jealous. This part is not healthy and I shouldn't be proud of it but I know I was his tropy, a 10/10 girl that he was proud to be with and wanted to show off. But it wasn't just this superficial. We spent everyday together and had a deep connection but his insecurity was destroying it. He was cheated on before by his ex with his best friend which is very traumatizing and he said that except her noone has ever hurt him like e. But I didn't hurt him, I was loyal always caring about his emotions. It was his unhealed mind playing tricks on him and sabotaging himself.

  
But my question is: what is he feeling?  
I know I was the most important for him and that he planned his future with me as much as I did. But he just cut me off without a word and started sleeping with other gils right away. And I keep missing him everyday and can't look at any other man. I know he loved me, maybe not in a mature healthy way, but I know I was his whole world. How can he move on so fast? If he really felt that I'm so special will he miss me when other girls are not as unique to him as me?  
Is he in denial because he was already insecure before, and facing how much he hurt me would only make him feel shittier about himself so he prefers to blame me and tries to run away?  
I need an analysis of his behaviour, I know I fucked up with giving him so much trust, but I don't need advice. Can someone just please think this through and think how he might feel?

I feel like i'm going insane everytime I talk to my FP???,1714271442.0,"I know that when your FP finally replies to you, you're supposed to feel relieved, like a weight just got lifted off your shoulders, etc. And don't get me wrong, most of the time I do feel relieved when she replies but.. sometimes I don't? 

When she replies after not replying for a few hours I initially feel happy to talk to her. I'm excited to talk to her about the things i've been thinking about/memes i've screenshotted to talk to her about, but then when I actually start to reply, I just feel horrible. It's like a cloud of doom engulfs me. My mood instantly switches from happy to depressed.

 I start regretting ever venting to her about my issues, I feel like a terrible person for having her as my FP, I feel like I don't belong here on this world, I feel uncomfortable in my own skin, I reply very dryly, I hate everything she does in the moment which causes her to be upset, I ultimately feel like i'm going INSANE.

After this little ""episode"" passes, I instead start feeling terrible about being so dry and rude to her. I don't understand why I would act like that which makes me hate myself more than words can explain. 

I want to know why exactly I feel like this. Is it because I perceive her not replying as abandonment? But why do I feel happy when she replies at other times?

How do I date as a girl with BPD?,1714255585.0,"I am a 23(f) dealing with relationship anxiety. I dont know how to date and Im scared i might end up alone because I feel like I’m broken and mentally unstable. For context, I was diagnosed with BPD and CPTSD at an early age due to r*pe and physical and psychological trauma inflicted on me by my parents. Due to this, i developed an anxiety attachment style which has been destructive for my mental health. I have tried going to therapy but I’ve been turned down because they dont believe my story and I honestly dont blame them.

And because I’m curvy built, a lot of men are attracted to me physically but never have I met a guy who was willing to get to know me on a personal level. It got so bad that I hated any guy who complimented me with sexual annotations like “hey s*xy” or “hey curvy” and just generally hated anything to do with s*x. It always broke me whenever they left. Now currently I’m seeing a guy 27(M) who seems genuinely interested in me. But my stupid brain keeps telling me he is gonna leave me eventually. I have communicated how I felt like about the whole situation and he seemed to have understood my situation.

No where to turn,1714251087.0,"
No one needs to comment or read. I don't know where to type or go. 

My SO of 6 years told me to turn to reddit to ""vent"" instead of SM or friends. So I did. He wasn't happy with that. I have therapy 1 hour once a week. No one really knows how dark my mind is, even when I was ""venting"" in general.  We both have bad trust issues, we came out of bad marriages, we have done things to each other we regret. 
He's been reading things online and books that he knows are bad, but is sure I'm a typical BPD horrible person now. At first he didnt , i thought he knew better. We feel 10x more than neurotypical people, so sure, we react different than them.
This past month+  has been more than horrible. My dad passed when we weren't really expecting it (my mom passed in 2017 as well, that was truly unexpected). His dad passed in October which is bringing up emotions from that. He confessed something about 1.5 weeks ago and I'm trying to process that as well and I feel shattered from that too. I have a lot of emotions going on. It's like he thinks I should be over everything by now and be just fine. I'm TRYING to hold it together and I can't. I'm lucky to be alive if we're being honest. My depression is at an all time high, I'm anxiety predominant so this is odd for me. Yes. I've seen psych 2 weeks in a row emergent and will next week again for my regular visit which will male 3 weeks in a row (not including therapy.) 

It's constant tit-for-tat. Who can get who worse. He's no better than me but he seems to think he is bc he doesn't have the horrible bpd diagnosis.
 
At the same time there's so much good found in him and we can be amazing together. When it's good, it's great. He's the best to my kids. He treats me like a princess. He saw my dad the day before he went into the hospital when he went to get stuff from my brother and dad and dad and my SO talked abt marriage. He spent time at the hospital with him when I couldn't. He was with us when he took his last breath. It means so much to me. I cannot imagine life without him. 
My chest has been hurting since he made his confession. Not normal costochondritis muscle pain. I can't take another heartbreak. My marriage wasn't a heartbreak, that was a good riddance. This. I won't survive. I already feel it. 

With his dad, i helped make his transition as easy as i could on his family even it was just by being there (it was a long, heartbreaking decline.) I was strong for him until his dads funeral. My dad wasn't the best (I reminded him too much of my mom, so our relationship was strained, and other factors including his lady friend til they broke up) so his dad was a great father figure to me. I cherished every moment with his dad even more. 

 No relationship is flawless. I saw my parents go thru hell and swore they were going to divorce but they got thru whatever it was. We know we love eachother. 

He just started iop this week on his own and honestly I'm nervous bc I've been inpatient 7 times, in IOP for a while. I hear how they talk about bpd and know they're going to tell him to leave me fast especially when he tells them what's going on. I'm sure he's going to not tell them what he's done. It's human nature to save face. WHY is the person with bpd acting so erratic? There's a reason. 
He needs therapy for sure. Group therapy is just nerve wrecking with his situation overall (I don't want to tell all of his business.)

We're going to start couples therapy as well, if he still wants to do it. It would be nice if my therapist did couples but gotta be married. Idk when we can do it btwn everything going on. 

I wish I didn't feel. I wish I didn't care. 

I'm terrified. I can't leave my kids. I already tried once and nearly succeeded.

I obviously didn't follow through with it but the days I had planned to do it my bf for some reason planned to spend more time with me and by the time it was the night he was cuddled up to me asleep so I just ended up falling asleep.

"idk what’s wrong w me lately, advice? ",1714239396.0,"soooo back story ish, i kinda fucked up my mg of my mood stabilizers a few weeks ago, i want to say around 3. i was taking 100mg of topamax for a year, and then my psych wanted me to take an extra 50 in the morning but i ended up not liking it so i THOUGHT. i got rid of the 50mg tablets and kept using the 100mg tablets, but i got rid of the 100s and kept using the 50s. 

so i was on half my dosage for like a month, that sucked, but i finally read the bottle and figured it out and started the right dose again. 

however its been the 3 weeks of taking the 100 again, i know meds take a second to get into your system, but i dont think its working the same? the topamax was REALLY helping me lose weight before. suppressing my appetite, i was pooping all the time, i had hella energy, i lost abt 5 pounds a month give or take and it was intentional, ive been on a weight loss journey for abt a year as well. i also have felt incredible for the last year, stable, happy, just normalish with occasional depression or anxiety yk? 

now taking it feels like nothing, it feels like my meds just aren’t working. i usually can watch like stupid takes on tiktok and be unaffected and like not comment an insult or argue on twitter and not be like,,, affected irl but lately ive been getting that feeling in my brain during those things of like.. i need to punch smth or scream or im going to pass out like its BAD. i haven’t felt that in SO LONG. i also have been so, so mean to my boyfriend and i know i have. i adore him, but it feels like i have no feelings for him anymore at times. it isn’t the truth, i absolutely do, but some days i literally don’t want to hear him speak. i miss him. i just lash out at things id brush off or entirely ignore before. do i just need a higher dose, do i wait it out, do i hate my bf, like what do i DO? even just some words of affirmation if you don’t have experience with this would be awesome 🥲 love u guys, hope ur well🩷

coping strategies / wondering those with similar experiences ,1714209786.0,"One of my biggest struggles when I get very emotional (crying and feeling a lot of things intensely), is I tend to word vomit and say what comes to my mind to my fp, a lot of times I later regret.

I can be accusatory, mean, angry, disrespectful, and can cross her boundaries in these instances which is not okay at all, and I cry more about later.

Am I really that bad?,1714172380.0,"This has been the week from hell and all because of my shitty job.

 For reference, I am an introvert and pretty quiet—even my BPD is quiet. I usually only speak when I'm spoken to.  I don't have any particular interests in striking up conversations with other people because I find it physically and mentally exhausting. Furthermore, I don't think I'd have much in common with others.

 I sense that my boss dislikes my personality.  During a meeting she said— in front of everyone—that I have a ""dark aura"". It made me feel uneasy. I didn't think I bothered people by simply not talking a lot. 

She even questioned my coworker and asked if we speak and what they think of me; she says I'm a ""gloomy person.""

i had an abusive relationship since i was 19. he was diagnosed with adhd and was super bubbly and fun. i immediately fell in love as he was love bombing me hard. we met online when i was in psych ward (too depressed to live) and he traveled 6 hours just to see me for a couple hours and then went back home (another 6 hours). i was released like a week after we saw each other, so he slept at my place most of the time because of the distance. he dropped out of school because of that. after 5 weeks we went to see my friend and her bf as well, we planned on staying there for the weekend. we all got drunk and he slept with her. i was just in the other room with her bf talking about life and the meaning of it. i didn't realize, but 2 hours passed and i really needed to smoke (im addicted to nicotine haha) but my smokes were in that room, so i went there. the doors were kinda like see-trough, stained glass? hope you get it. well and i saw it. i was in immediate shock. i didn't even cry or was mad i just went straight to dissociation. i still knocked, cuz i was determined to get my nicotine right 🙄 well and they stopped and she rushed out of the room crying and apologizing to me. i didn't really care, i took my cigarettes, then after i was done smoking i took my sleeping pills and told them im going to bed. i was still trembling a lot. no emotions. just pure shock. before i fell asleep i heard them all fight. my boyfriend didn't really do anything, he didn't say anything to me. he was shouting at my friend - the girl, that he doesn't care if it will break our relationship because it was so so good. that was my last straw. i couldn't take it anymore. i was just staring into nothing and then my pills kicked in and i fell asleep. in the morning i found him sleeping besides me like nothing happened. i pretended like nothing happened as well because i was so confused by what happened. i got up, took some random knife and went to bathroom to SH. i was okay then. we still stayed the night and we all pretended like everything is okay. after we left, he stayed at my place and i went trough his phone. i found messages, photos, videos of him cheating on me. with men. he was outside when i found out (forgot to mention that he's an alcoholic, so he went to shop for some alcohol). im not proud of this, but i destroyed his notebook. just washed it in the sink with water and then i poured sirup over it so i knew it's done done. he came back and was shocked. he didn't really care about the PC tho. he knew he fucked up and wanted to apologize so bad. we were fighting for hours. i wanted to leave him but he just didn't let me. so i stayed. i stayed in this relationship for more than 2 years. there's many instances of him cheating on me. only with men tho. he also never had a job. after like a year and a half i broke up with him (again, i didn't count it anymore) and we didn't talk for like a month. i came back. he told me he's working. i was didn't believe him but i was also naive and still bonded to him. he had money, kinda a lot for not having any education. so i started to think that he does some kind of sex work with men. turned out i was right, he came clean after 2 weeks. every time i knew something but didn't have proof i felt crazy. but when i actually found out i was right, i couldn't believe it. i didn't want to believe it. we saw each other just to talk like friends (i wanted him to beg me to be with him, i missed the chasing. i knew it's toxic, but i needed him. after that it's just the same thing again and again. one time we went to a festival together and he had an idea to play my gay friend and get some free drinks from men. we did that and i started talking to some guys, they seemed polite and we had a good conversation. then they told us they're married. my heart sank and i wanted to get away. i was also starting to be drunk a lot so i told my boyfriend that i wanted to go home. the two men told us they will take us there and we agreed. or more like he agreed. i couldn't even talk. when we were in the car, i realized that its taking too long. we lived like 15 minutes from the festival. found out they're taking us to THEIR house. i had a panic attack. they took me out, to their house, gave me diazepam or some kind of that medication and put me to their guest room. i fell asleep right away. in the morning i woke up, alone. i went to look for my boyfriend, i found him lying naked on a sofa in their living room. it was all messy and there were tissues from c*m and yk, they didn't clean themselves before an*l so... yea. i woke him up and said i needed to go home. i didn't have my medications. he knew damn well i take them regularly and he still took me with them so he could have a threesome and just didn't care. i called my mum to pick me up, i told her what happened and he was supposed to go home with me, but i told him this was it, that i cannot do it anymore and that he has to pack his stuff and leave. so he didn't go with me and stayed at their house for like 2 more days. i packed all his stuff home and then when he came back he was pleading and begging me to take him back. well that's just for this moment. there was also lot of physical abuse when he got drunk and thought i was cheating on him (i couldn't, he checked my phone religiously and if he got mad he broke the phone - happened twice. he found a conversation with a friend that i knew for 7 years. there was nothing.) but after all this, i still took him back. we were together for like 3 months and he did it again - checked my phone and that was it for me. i had prepared box of pills 2 weeks prior to this that i wanted to take. i took them that day and told him im going to sleep. i feel asleep pretty quickly, i don't remember much after that. i just know he and my little brother found me and thought that im drunk, then when they tried to make me vomit and then nothing. they took me to the hospital and they did what they do to all the people that overdose with pills - pumped my stomach, i was unconscious so that's good, then put me to CCU but my heart was giving up and i stared to stop breathing so they moved me to intensive care and i was on life support machines. i woke up after 3 days. was sent to psych ward and we can skin that part. i took him back. he promised to go to rehab. he actually went there. but he quit after 10 days. that was it. we broke up. but then guess what? we got together again. it was very private tho. my family couldn't know because they would kill me (i don't blame them) and my only friend would too. oh yea he once attacked him too. and well here we are. i found a new boyfriend after like 2 months, we knew each other for a long time, but i couldn't really be his friend because of my ex. he was very friendly but then i kinda started to like him (i was just looking for rebound, but i didn't realize that yet) and we were so so in love for like a month. then i splitted on him. (bpd took over) i hated everything about him. i was very mean to him because he wasn't mean to me. i didn't know how to accept love. but after he broke up with me i got some clarity and apologized, he took me back and we were happy. well not really, i just felt like im trying so hard to like him, to love him, but i just couldn't. i didn't like anything about him. i wanted to break up but when i tried he was very sad so i just stayed. he broke up with me after few months tho. we were okay, but he said that he cannot handle me. which is understandable. i blocked him on everything so i won't destroy his life even more. well and guess what i did? exactly. i reached out to that abusive ex boyfriend. we are kinda dating right now?? i don't know. i hate him but i love him so much as well. he's on medication that is used for alcoholics - he cannot drink at all. he's sober for almost 6 months, he found an actual job, but he's still talking to gay men. not even sexually sometimes, i only saw one time he was talking to a guy he cheated on me with before but he deleted the chat before i had the chance to see. also all of his coworkers are women but mostly just gay men. i don't know what to do anymore. i feel like he's the only one that can handle me. that i deserve only him and no one else. he can manipulate me a lot and im aware, but i kinda got addicted to it. i cannot get out. i don't have any friends- only person that i talk to is my classmate, but he doesn't know about any of this because i don't want anyone to know. i know im doing something wrong but i just don't know what to do. so yea. im sorry that this is long but if you read all of it, or at least some of it, i would be glad for some realistic advice. not just leave him and go to therapy - the thing is, im on a waiting list for a whole year. theres no place for me and i have no money for private therapist.

I wish my friends could share more of my interests but none of them seem that interested, or even want to hear me rant about any of it. My partner rarely listens to my rants about my interest or even care about it. Actually usually I'm told by him to not talk about whatever it is I want to talk about, for WHATEVER reason. I've been socially inept or awkward my whole life, communicating normally was never my forte. I rarely know how to word the things I mean to say and that alienates me from my peers. Everyone seems like more conscious than I am about things. I'm trying my best to be a person and its just not working. Like recently Ive been more affectionate to my bf and they've kind of been affectionate back but today it felt really weird. Like it felt like they were avoiding me today, and I'm guessing I've been overbearing with the affection which the idea of that hurts a lot. I was never really allowed to properly display my emotions and it seems like I'm still not. I just want to be held and told I'll be alright. I want to feel welcomed, loved, appreciated by someone. I want someone to want me fully, whole. Im so scared to be myself around the people I know nowadays because of that weird silence that fills the air whenever I say anything.

We’ve had a very distant relationship due to my mother, which I’m realizing she’s the reason why us kids are so fucked up an mentally unstable. But when my brother was here he started confessing to me all these horrible things he has done, and one being that he used to poison my mom when he was younger cause she was so mean to him he says but he also mentioned that he used to hurt little animals so that way the animals would rely on him to fix them, he is 42 years old but has this petty mentality and if you do him wrong, he’s gonna get his revenge but make it more spicier than it should be. But I’m having a hard time with accepting the treatment I went through as a child the treatment I endured growing up, it’s not so much anything I did or have done where the guilt or shame is stemming from but it’s the way I was brought up, it’s the other peoples shame and guilt that has been stowed upon me from my own family. The people that were supposed to be close to me. After getting this bpd diagnosis I am finally having clarity over my life but I’m realizing that I need to let of things in the past, I need to build a relationship with myself, I want to fall in love with myself before I bring anyone else into my life, this diagnosis doesn’t define but it gives me a answer to why I am the way I am, but how I can help myself and build myself up to be that person I want be around, to be the change that I want to see in this world. Just because you have bpd it doesn’t mean you have to continue on with behaviors that you don’t like about yourself.

Is this a triggered reaction ?,1713727815.0,"Hi everyone :) there's gonna be some context to get through really fast but you can skip to the bottom if it's not ur cup of tea. 

So, I was previously in an abusive relationship with my ex fiance - we finally broke it off a year ago (nearly to the date) and I moved cross country and I'm finally becoming comfortable enough with being with another partner. 

My good good friend (I'll call him Link) and I expressed interest in each other throughout the years of our friendship but obviously nothing happened bc I was with my ex. I am now pursuing a relationship with Link, and he feels the same, we've talked about our feelings but are just taking it at our own pace and not rushing into things. 

Yesterday when link was driving home from my house after dropping me off (super late like 4AM - We also are both second/third shift workers so nothing out of the ordinary) he hit a raccoon. 

Link calls me and tells me and is super worried because the car seems to be pretty banged up but ! (TW for drug/substance use) we were both off some blow and I wasn't the most helpful over the phone. Of course I asked him to stay on the phone until he pulled over to check it out or got home and so he pulled over, I heard him get out and look at it, he said something I couldn't catch and than hung up.  

I text him after that asking for pictures and to see how bad it was, and made sure he got home safe (we share locations) and the only thing he texted back was ""it's bad"" so I asked the obvious question first if he was okay physically and mentally, and then said no matter how bad the car ended up being I was just glad he got home safe. 

Idk how (bc of the blow) but I ended up falling asleep for a few hours after he got home and he had texted back pics and a video. It looked pretty banged up for sure but I was a little relived because it didn't look totaled or anything- just fucked up. 

I texted that I was glad it didn't look too expensive or anything, reiterated that I was just glad he got home and I was sure his dad (his roommates dad- it's a bit complicated) would agree but that I understood how much it sucked that it happened, I apologized for having him out driving me home so late and that it all happened. 

He didn't text back and also hasn't text on other social media. It's 2PM the next day and he also was supposed to go to work today and didnt and I'm feeling so awful because my brain is stuck on how I wasn't the most helpful on that phonecall and how he's not gonna text me back because I wasn't a good friend or partner and that he is so upset with how unhelpful I was. I want to text him and apologize for not being the best support while I was on the comedown and also be there for him because I just know he's having a really hard time right now but I also don't want to double/triple/quadruple text and annoy him if he IS upset at me. 

Ive been doing a lot of work on triggered responses towards people I'm romantically interested in, and logically I know that he is probably just so upset at the situation and how it happened. He doesn't have the money to spare to fix the car, Link had to let his dad know and I'm sure he didn't respond the best. 

I just want to be here for him right now but I'm so stuck on feeling like he's mad and would text me back if he wanted support from me. I'm not sure if that's a valid thing to base my feelings off of and I'm not sure if that's just a triggered response to the entire situation. 

(TL;DR) The guy I'm recently seeing hit a raccoon on the way home from my house last night and it fucked up his car - we were both on some shit- after making sure he got home safe he stopped responding and idk if it's because he's overall upset or upset at me. Im worried to text again because I don't want to be annoying or upsetting if he is frustrated at me.

having trouble differentiating mania from euphoria,1713689496.0,"hi! so basically i am a 22yo nonbinary person (they/he) and i started testosterone about 4 months ago. I have been feeling super gender euphoric because of the changes happening with my hair, voice, bottom growth, and then just my mood in general has elevated. My problem is i also have been previously diagnosed with bipolar and tried all the meds for it, but my psychiatrist and i kinda came to the conclusion i have more bpd symptoms than bipolar. At the time, i also hadn’t had a manic or extreme depressive episode in over two years. Since starting T, tho, I’ve been feeling so good about myself and so I’ve been having a hard time figuring out if it’s because I’m manic or because I’m just starting to feel more comfortable in my body??

I just ruined my relationship of 10 years and I lost my home.,1713665850.0,"I want to start by saying I was diagnosed with BPD in 2017. It's been a problem for years and after having a manic episode in 2018 because of losing my job and moving, I've been working on myself non-stop and the whole time my partner who I love with all my heart and soul was there. But this year has been a nightmare, family members passing, employment issues, and the kicker, our ceiling caving in and our landlord having to redo the roof and ceilings.
These stressers have trigger another manic episode. O moved into my friends place because I was getting sick from the mold in the house then My friend and I started about moving in together without my partner knowing, then we started talking to them, then I turned it into a ""you don't tell me how you feel"" and they responded with ""I'm scared of making you mad"" then we started couples therapy.
I started looking for signs of what I should do, like mystic spiritual stuff, and I took somethings as signs to leave. My friend and my mother supported it, they (mostly if not only my mother) had been pushing me to leave for years.
Last Sunday I finally did it. I left my husband and I decided to move out, but now I'm in a situation of whether or not I myself wanted this or was it just me being heavily influenced.
I'm miserable, I've been crying off and on since I did this and I don't know what to do. I know I don't want my partner taking me back, I've put them through so much, but I want to go home.

BPD vs RAD,1713649446.0,"I have BPD (current diagnosis) and was treated for reactive attachment disorder at a “troubled teen home”. 

I’m 21/F and was misdiagnosed with RAD (reactive attachment disorder) as a teen after I came out as gay to my parents. They blamed my “unhealthy attachment to women” as “mommy issues for being adopted” and claimed that I acted out and had behavioral issues. While I did have severe attachment issues, RAD is usually given to kids who are violent, constantly rebelling, and have no attachments at all. I never once was violent towards my parents or even threatened them, and my “acting out” was me texting my girlfriend at the time behind their back because I knew the consequences if they found out. My parents were also heavily involved in the church. I had good grades in school, never had issues with other kids besides typical teenage drama, never used any substances until I graduated (good ol’ MJ but nothing more). I did struggle with SH and my entire mood would be dictated around my girlfriend at the time, and I did feel as if I would pass away without her. However, those feelings never manifested through anger outwardly. 

 I was sent to the institute for attachment and  child development in Colorado, who’s notoriously known for mistreating and even taking the life of children. Just look up Candance Newmarker for reference, she was a victim to the same administration under a different name. The results of the treatment left me with years of trauma and it wasn’t until I was an adult when I got the BPD diagnosis and started doing therapy for it when I finally started healing. Therapy/meds for bpd has truly changed my life for the better, while therapy and meds from the RAD places made me even worse than I already was. 

I can’t seem to find any solid research on the differences between BPD and RAD and how detrimental it is to treat someone with BPD (who doesn’t have RAD) as if they had RAD.

Hyper fixed on BPD and panicking if I have it ):,1713562594.0,"I’ve struggled with mental health my whole life. Depression, and anxiety and self esteem issues. I’ve also always been a sensitive person. I grew up with an emotionally absent dad, who neglected me with basic affection and love aside from providing for me physically, and an emotionally unstable mother who would rarely get physical and throw things, get angry and triggered easily. My parents caught CONSTANTLY. That is all I know. Anyways, I tend to Google things, especially lately because I’ve really been struggling with my mental health the past 4 years. I’ve heard of BPD (borderline personality disorder). I know the symptoms / traits, and so as you can imagined while googling, and watching videos, I notice that I line up with a lot. I’m emotional, I can get triggered easily, when I am in a relationship, I always need reassurance, and am scared they’ll ending leave me, etc. but doesn’t everyone not want their partner leaving them? I can definitely be emotional - like I said, I’ve always been sensitive, am hard on myself, am insecure and scared of judgment, anxious all of the time, struggle with handling a lot of stressors, I have self esteem issues, and I overthink like NON OTHER in general. Im just always in my head is how I can describe it. Im VERY self aware at least. Anyways - the fact that I see traits lining up, scares the absolute SHIT out of me. If I have it, I feel like I will end up being alone for the rest of my life, and be so doomed because people with BPD struggle in marriages / relationships, I’m so scared if I have kids, it would be passed down to them, and I would have negative effects on them, what if I’m not taken seriously, people are scared of me, I turn into my mother, etc etc. what if what if what if is just running through my mind.

how do i have a normal relationship?,1713339248.0,"So sorry this is a bit long but if anyone can give me any advice I'd appreciate it!
For some context - I have BPD and my boyfriend does not. He has some other mental health struggles but they infrequently cause any tension or issues in our relationship and none are personality disorders.
I started dating my boyfriend about 8 months ago and this is the healthiest/most stable partner I've ever had. 
In all of my previous relationships, conflict was always resolved in unhealthy ways like screaming or ghosting, and the relationships tended to be very intense and short-lived. Unfortunately, a lot of those behaviors and tendencies are still hardwired in me.
In this relationship, almost all the issues we have are caused or worsened by me escalating things out of instinct/habit.
I tend to get insecure about his feelings towards me, usually triggered by small things like a shift in tone or a perceived lack of interest, and I vaguely ask for constant reassurance (things like “Do you still want to be with me, do you still love me” etc). When his answer isn't perceived as “good enough” to me I lash out and accuse him of not caring about or loving me.
I’ve gotten him to the point where he feels like nothing he can say is good enough for me and as a result, he’s stopped putting as much effort into his reassurance, unintentionally worsening the situation.
I don’t know how to stop needing so much reassurance, or lashing out when I don’t get it. Asking as frequently as I do is coming off as accusatory and the last thing I want to do is lead him to believe he’s doing something wrong when I ask to be reassured, it’s nothing he’s done it's just my own thought process freaking me out. 
I’m currently in DBT therapy but it’s an incredibly slow process and I’m worried that he won’t be able to put up with the way I act for much longer. He’s always relatively calm, patient, and forgiving with me but I pull the same thing over and over and I feel like I'm pushing him farther away each time when all I want is to make sure we’re still close.",Weird-Pepper8335,,False,1c63vle,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1c63vle/how_do_i_have_a_normal_relationship/

Communicating boundaries as someone’s FP,1713139003.0,"Hi everyone! I would love any advice in terms of enforcing no contact boundaries with someone as an old FP. I don’t want to go into too many details, but we were good friends for 3 years until our friend group found out they had been lying about and making up things that were definitely substantial. When we had disagreements, they’ve also come to my house and knocked on my door repeatedly refusing to leave. There was also a situation of them taking advantage of someone who was under the influence. After exhausting every option (trying to get them help, talking to family) there was a big falling out involving Title 9 that ended with them getting expelled from school. This was about three years ago. 

We haven’t spoken since then but I still see that they view my Tiktok profile often. They’ve requested to follow and also liked pictures of people in my immediate circle. They also requested to share locations with me out of the blue last week, even though we haven’t spoken in more than 3 years. Today, they texted me saying just “wyd”. It seems like not responding isn’t working, and I’m not sure why they’re trying to be casual with me when we haven’t talked about anything that happened or what they’ve done to me.

Help :( I know it’s wrong but I am attracted to my therapist,1713125849.0,"I am 25 F and my therapist is about 32M. For context I have abandonment issues relating to men/my dad.

I have been in solid private therapy for nearly a year. It hasn’t been until recently I started properly opening up with my therapist and delving into the deep stuff and doing image rescripting.

Since I met him, I have been attracted to him in / physical way. I recognised he’s a good looking man’s in his early 30’s. He has a really kind and empathetic nature (duh he’s a therapist) and he has a really raspy deep soothing lovely voice. He listens and validates all of my feelings 

He made boundaries clear at the beginning of therapy and I remember being upset by his sentence “you will never know me in real life outside these four walls” - it made me feel grief after only having been to see him a few times. I know that’s insane, and he was setting a very normal and practical boundary. But I felt like I’d been kicked in the throat so I have been attached to him since very early on 

I can’t help that a part of me is just absolutely infatuated by him. He is tall, dresses casual-smart, has cool tattoos, looks after himself, is interested in art, healthy, likes good music, likes same TV shows as me and he is honestly just a really nice guy. 

I know I don’t actually know him but I really want to. I can’t stop thinking about him all the time and I replay and fantasise about moments when he’s been super nice and kind to me. I want to bump into him in public, I want to ‘accidentally see him’ 

He has complimented me a few times but has always backed it up with him saying “I mean this in a professional manner” etc. 

I kind of want to talk to him about this crush but I’m also putting it off because it’s nice to have something to be excited about like I haven’t in a really long time. I realistically know him making any move would be horrible because he is a professional and I don’t want to get him into trouble. 

I honestly want to seduce him, and I want to lose weight and become prettier to appeal to him. I would actually do anything to be with him and it’s crazy because I know I’m just acting crazy. 

I have read about transference but I just don’t know how to get over it or how to actually tell him. I keep thinking about him and it’s all consuming literally I haven’t felt this way about someone in so long

"How do I stop an addiction to a toxic person without breaking down entirely again?
",1713095104.0,"
I've always had relationships that made me go ""insane"", awfully high highs and low lows and never understood why am I like that, until I was finally diagnosed a few months ago.

However I'm still waiting for therapy and can't seem to manage myself properly.

I had a toxic relationship as always and it seemed to give me the highest highs so far - what he says, the sex we had, just overall his energy, it was all a huge fixation for me and the source of euphoria. When it went downhill I hit the lowest lows in my life and that's a big thing considering that I've been mentally ill since childhood and have other diagnoses as well.

I was usually good at not expressing my reactions towards other people, they just ruin me. So in this situation I have someone who's hurt me deeply and who has been  for the past months a source of basically anguish I would say.

However now he's back and acting all nice and I'm all euphoric again. Life makes sense and I feel alive and everything feels so good and easy. When he was gone it was all just dark and I felt either  like I don't exist or shouldn't exist.

I know it can't last and I'm gonna crash down so hard again. But I can't afford to have that happen again. My uni and work has suffered because of the breakdown I had over the first breakup and if that happens again I'm so so screwed. I don't have access to my psychiatrist as I'm in a foreign land and I'm waiting still for online therapy. I'm alone here and if I crash down I'm just alone in the void.

I'm so happy now but in the back of my mind  I know im doomed.

How do I untangle this without being on rock bottom again? I know we don't have a future I'm just hopelessly addicted.

Partner Split With Me Over Lack of Orgasms,1712995752.0,"I met my pwBPD four months ago online. She’s married, but is in a consensual non-monogamous arrangement and was looking for sex outside of marriage. We very quickly establish a very strong connection. And over the next few months, we tried every single iteration of a relationship. We were friends with benefits, and then dating, and then exclusive boyfriend and girlfriend (plus her husband…). 

We had always had great sex. But recently, she split on me and has become irate with me about sex—specifically, that she was not having an orgasm. She did not like me to use my tongue or my fingers, which obviously made my job more difficult. But I was allegedly at fault because I could not figure out how to hold the vibrator just right.

She then proceeded to go back online and sleep with other guys.

I’m embarrassed and devastated that she wasn’t more happy sexually with me and that we weren’t able to communicate through this problem. I’ve never had any sexual complaints in the past, but every woman is different.

Currently she is stating that my lack of effort is so poor that it’s disrespectful to her. So disrespectful in fact that she resents me and does not even know if she can be friends with me. 

If we never have sex again, she has given me a big sexual complex. And if we do have sex again, I think there’s now so much tension around this whole issue that I doubt she would be able to achieve the big O.

Even before any sexual issues, I always felt very insecure throughout our relationship as I was not her primary partner – – she was married. So I don’t even know if I was ever her FP…

Will she ever not resent me and come back to me?  Any advice or insight would be much appreciated.",FrameIll5451,,False,1c2wvmw,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1c2wvmw/partner_split_with_me_over_lack_of_orgasms/
I feel like someone killed my soul tonight BPD spiral not coping well PLEASE HEAR ME,1712980493.0,"I just need someone to tell me I simply matter to this world. That love and real bonds are real and people won’t just see me as a body or a placeholder for their hurt one day. Tonight the love of my life and someone I truly truly thought deep down would never ever betray me to this level… did. I was with my boyfriend for a little over a year and had never in my life met someone I swore would always at the very least care about me. Someone who would always stay a friend at the end of the day no matter what. I thought our bond was so strong and special that it would never break. Tonight it did. The woman he swore I would never need to worry about? His ex wife he swore he would never even call a friend. Tonight he is in a hotel with her and their children at the beach and the deed has most likely already been done. I have been diagnosed bpd and have NEVER trusted someone so much. We have been broken up now since December but lately it’s seemed just too easy for him and last night it was confirmed why. I thought I was going to grow old with this man. My children asked to call him dad. I loved him children so immensely. He swore and swore he would never entertain her in any way and here I am spending all day and night non stop puking from panic attack after panic attack and crying since 5am yesterday. I have children but I can’t function. I also have ocd and I usually go to cutting when I feel this much pain inside of me but I’m been working so hard to quit. Tonight broke me apart. I have zero will or want to live other than my children now. I pictured them holding each other in their hotel room all day and night. And when the sun went down I lost it. I lost all of what I had left to love of myself inside of me. I have his poetry tattood on my shoulder where he used to kiss me when we made love. I had never felt safe and loved during sex before him. All night tonight knowing they were in a hotel together I pictured them making love over and over and so detailed I swore I could hear it. I lost my mind and blew him up so much begging for him to please make it stop for me, that he told me a restraining order has been set in stone. He’s made me begging and voicing my complete betrayal and hurt of him ending up in her arms and having sex with her of all people, just me being utterly insane and unsafe. He’s turned into someone who acts like he never even loved me once. Was never my best fucking friend. Was never so in love with me we could take the world on and feel so good. You guys I feel like since I could not take my life tonight as I so wish I could have, it hurt that much, that I lost all ounce of self worth, dignity, hope, love for myself and just all sense of wanting to carry on for good. I swear I felt the pain get so intense tonight that I felt myself leave my damn body. I’ve never cried this much in my life. I’ve never hurt so much in my whole god damn  much. The amount of betrayal if you guys even knew… it’s all too much overwhelming and all consuming. I was literally screaming out in pain for god to please make the pain stop. That is so anything. He said I need help tonight and he’s right. He hasn’t once acknowledged or even cared about how much this has broken me apart. The only thing he’s done has been to make me feel even shttiwr than myself. I can’t do this. I have zero coping skills and apparently now I’m not a safe person and there’s a restraining order placed against me by someone I swore would be there for me ni matter what. I don’t know where to go from here, I can’t contemplate this is really happening to me and I just have this overwhelming want to rip this tattoo straight off my skin. I know I’m insane. I know I’m worth putting a restraining order on because I’ll blow someone up with texts when I’m hurting. I know I’m completely unlovable but to do this to me? To break me to this point of no return and only make it worse for me? How?! How can he just be ok with doing this to me?! Help me to cope with this please SOMEONE PLEASE HEAR THIS PAIN.

Meet new psychiatrist today - trying to re-diagnose me?,1712604343.0,"So I met a new psychiatrist (they are a psychiatric NP) today and honestly they were pretty rude to start. I had to politely let them know that I’m here for help not to be judged. He was going on about how on my intake form I stated I struggled with “relationships” and questioned how exactly I expect medication to fix my relationship issues when relationships take effort not just pills. I had to literally shut him down and say I need direct access to DBT and medication to stay stable while I work through my problems. So rude !!! All I need is lithium for a mood stabilizer. Geez. 

Anyways, after briefly describing my trauma from childhood-23 he decides I’m not BPD and that I have bipolar? Which is insane to me because I’ve know this man for 40 mins? It took my previous psychiatrist (DNP) and therapist (LCSW) 2 YEARS to diagnose me! And it’s taking him 40 mins? He said it doesn’t seem to him I have it based off the, mind you, limited check-list he used to determine my diagnosis.

My whole world is spinning and I don’t know what to do. I told him I would get my records from my previous psychiatrist and he was like “oh that won’t be necessary” what do you mean that’s not necessary?

Help me cope with dating a guy who has tons of friends,1712546816.0,"Hello 

I (23 f) am dating this super nice and smart guy (22,m) and we have been on and off for the four months we have known each other (my fault - I pushed him away initially given the permanency I felt when he asked me in one month to be his gf, so we decided to wait longer)

Anyways, he lives about an hour away, in a college town, is in college , has plenty of friends etc , and plenty of ex’s and past history with people who he routinely faces and sees. This was always an issue 

He texts his f/m friends privately, he has posts w them on instagram, he is very respectful and platonic but touchy but I kid you not- I hate these ppl, and I want them to suffer uncontrollably 

I cannot stop being so fucking hateful to his friend group, a huge mix of jealously/fomo/ anger at what my life could have looked like if I was normal/ anger bc I can’t be there, and he won’t stop his life to feel exactly how I feel, etc 

I get so fucking angry when I see him getting texts from girls in his group, I feel sick to my stomach . I want terrible things to happen to them all. I know it’s not fair or right. I can realize those are inappropriate thoughts

Last night he went to a party and I just couldn’t go. He said this girl had a crush on him and it was her bday party, and it would be inappropriate if I go. (Edit: he said, you aren’t my gf. We aren’t together in that way. So I’m not taking you, because I don’t want to ruin this girls bday party bringing u)

Plus he went with a friend, who doesn’t like me , and who I have sort of gotten into a fight (with the  friend.. yikes) about him talking about me to people, so it is awkward (I basically said mind ur business but I’m planning to apologize  !)

Given the nature of me rejecting his title as BF , and plus the turmoil I’m in and out all the time  and how I have been really unsure, he basically said, you either stop being so angry about this party or I just can’t do this anymore

Naturally I toughened up, I went home and cried profusely all night , turned off my phone and just felt hopeless .

In the morning I told him it really disturbed me he would go even tho I wasn’t allowed. He said, oh you could have gone , it probably wouldn’t have been weird. I didn’t do much. But you can’t tell me or expect me not to go

Clearly this didn’t help anything. All I could think was , he put this random girl’s feelings before mine. 

 I broke his heart and had a weird on and off with him. I crawled back begging him to realize I am ready to date after feeling suffocated (all of this was 3 months total) he has his guard up with me now and he doesn’t trust me near his friends after the mean things I’ve said about them. 

However I am just so so sad about this party. I need help. I can’t even tell anymore if I’m thinking clearly. I can’t tell if I’m wrong ",Ohgreatsights,,False,1bynsn2,8,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bynsn2/help_me_cope_with_dating_a_guy_who_has_tons_of/
Chaos,1712535842.0,"(Tw: talk of suicide attempts, assault and breakups)

Hey everyone so I posted about a week and a half ago on some of these subreddits about my polyamorous relationship and had been looking for advice, I appreciated all the comments but I thought I should update on the events that played out.

So Friday of one of the weeks (my timelines a little blurry) I was laying in bed with my live in partner and he hyped me up to go on an adventure with him and despite having been fine laying in bed all day I got excited and started to get ready for our adventure.. midway through he told me that our two partners who had been having complaints about me needed him there by 5 pm (2.5 hours away from the current time but he had agreed to hang out til 9 pm) I expressed my disappointment and how uncomfortable it made me feeling left out and feeling abandoned.. (I added this part in because I'm trying to get everything in and forgot to add this part it was also part of why I wanted to talk written below)

I communicated my discomfort with my live in partner about the polycule and explained how I didn't feel like 2 of the others really understood me so I explained that I'd like all 5 of us to sit down and have a conversation (for the benefit of this story we have partner A and B that live together, Partner C that lives with me and partner D that lives alone but is best friends as well with partner B) 

C explained to A and B that I was uncomfortable and would like to have a sit down to talk about things because as it stood I felt unheard, judged and uncomfortable in our situation and I had spoke to him that night about it on the phone and I thought I was finally getting through to some extent..

I met up with C the next day and found out that he slept with B that night (this was the first time and he had also kissed her) this hurt my feelings a lot because I felt so unheard and disrespected so I needed to take a whole step back from the situation so I left our groups for the time being, blocked both A and B and I had a panic attack where I called my best friend because he told me out in public so I was literally sobbing and hyperventilating in public.. I had no problem with the fact that they slept together but just how disrespectful it was as I did my best to communicate my feelings.. I asked C to tell A and B I needed space and just couldn't right now.

After spending most of the night in a conversation with C where I was having a break down and my best friend sat there to be a bystander to make sure neither of us did anything dumb C ended up getting A and B to pick him up and breaking up with me.

The next day when I woke up and had calmed down and had been communicating lots with D between then and the morning both D and C told me I shouldn't message A and B but I felt bad for abruptly leaving and wanted to express I was sorry and explain my side of the story.. 

A mostly kept quiet and just sent me a link to a mental health place but said he didn't want to talk to me which was fine I respected that and I did not reply afterwards.

B however went off on a huge rant about how I apparently have been abusing C for 4 years and he has Stockholm and all this stuff and then told me to disappear.. for that day it really really got in my head and I found everything unbearable my brain hyper fixated so I shut off my location on everything and went to get medication and I wrote a note with no ill will or hard feelings to anyone inside just letting people know I always loved them and that I was sorry I had to do this.. I had blocked B on some social media but then she started going off texting me unprompted making it go into my head harder..

I had been messaging D all day and he could tell I was not alright and I took a lot of medication after a while and asked if he was scared to die.. I felt extremely alone.. word got out to everyone and my best friend rushed to my house and C got A and B to drive him to my house.

B came into my house and tried to lunge at me, I had to slam the door to separate us as I'm a passafist and don't like conflict and I was very confused why she was trying to attack me after telling me to disappear and telling me I had no redeeming qualities..

Once she left the house I came out and realized my phone was gone so I went upstairs and opened the front door to ask C if he had my phone and B was closed by and lunged at me again, again I made a barrier by slamming the door and things are a blur but I think I hit her with the door because I remember once I opened it again A got in my face but he didn't touch me so I can at least respect that.. 

C did have my phone so I had went outside to get it from him and I was standing near him and like balling my eyes out and my best friend showed up, B attacked me again but this time I had no wall to put between us she was grabbing and pulling me but a cop had shown up and saw it and he shoved her away from me and told her to go to her car.. I was urged to press charges but I have chose not to do this because I just want peace not violence.. I'm exahusted..

Once in the hospital they went through the normal steps of poison control and all that I won't go into too much detail but my best friend stayed with me til really late at night (she has a child and her brother isn't old enough to watch him for too long) 

The next day I spoke to the psychologist who deemed me not a threat to myself and let me leave but she has put me on a waiting list for a DBT program and I was already waiting on a counselling appointment on the 10th so she was happy with that. She told me she believes I did my best by stepping back from a situation that had triggered a lot of emotions so I didn't blow up and that I also made the steps to resolve the issue afterwards and she told me that I can't control how others react to what I say.. she's right but it's still hard..

Since then I have had 0 contact with A and B, C has visited a couple of times and I've been doing my best.. D and I message every single day and he's visited over night once and has also had a long phone call with me.. he's been my biggest support and every time I see or talk to C it feels suffocating.. I can feel his disinterest and it hurts.. anyways I just guess I wanted to give an update so I didn't leave anyone hanging since I know there's replies I hadn't gotten to because everything happened so fast.. anyways I'm single now and trying to find some kind of motivation to live..

Friends who put a time limit on plans,1712403850.0,"Hey guys,

I have a question. Do you guys find it necessary for a friend to constantly put anyone limit on how long you will be hanging out? For ex: making plans for Friday and saying they can hangout for a few hours? This is a recurring thing. My friend and I are busy and don't s e eachother much but she always does this. Like sure we aren't going to hangout 24 hours, but why do you need to explicitly say how long we are going to hangout for? I would just leave after a few hours lol... The fact she has to let me know how much of her time she can give to me beforehand signals to me that she doesn't want to hangout that bad even though she will say how she can't wait to see me. When I hangout with others they don't do this, they just leave once they feel like it or if they have an actual plan or something they have to get to after like work or something they will let me know. But the fact this friend has to make sure I know we are only hanging out for a few hours on Friday evening bothers me and makes me not even want to go, delete my fb and just stop talking to ppl all together. She knows I have no healthy friends besides her right now and I don't understand why she has to go out of her way to make me feel like I'm only good enough to be around for a few hours. Like she's the fucking queen or something. I'm just sick of it and I feel like it's a way for her to be better than me because she has a family and a spouse and is busy busy and I have school, depression and trauma... I think I've mentioned this to her before idk how I worded it but she continues to do it and I don't even Wana go now but she's my only healthy friend ATM that's on a good career path etc like I am.

How would you express your BPF in photographs? TW ideations,1712401573.0,"Hi all!

I’m a photographer and recently diagnosed with BPD. My therapist calls it “quiet BPD” because it’s all internal aggression.

I want to collaborate with another photographer and really express how I’m feeling inside. 

My two biggest most crippling symptoms are fear of abandonment, and suicidal ideations.

For the ideations I’m thinking I’d like to be dressed up laying in like a meadow of flowers with a really serene look on my face and a (fake) gun to my head. This I think would accurately describe how comforted I feel about the idea of suicide and how I’ve spent so much time looking normal on the outside.

For fear of abandonment I’m not sure. I’m an incredibly clingy person but I’ve learners over the years to tone it down and act like I don’t care.

She says that, for her, it's useless, since everyone can have behaviors that might not suit the partner in the future.

Advice! How do you self motivate to keep your space clean??,1712088985.0,"TLDR: I need help on how to self motivate to keep my space clean and actively make myself get up and do cleaning tasks!

Hey all! I’m reaching out for help and advice! My partner and I are running into an issue that is 100% my fault. I’m owning this and I need help on how to fix it. 
He feels as though he has to treat me like a child/ I treat him like a parent. Specifically in the areas of cleaning and house work. I have zero motivation to do any of it. I don’t get dopamine from cleaning, or from having a clean space. It doesn’t matter to me. Like at all.
But it matters to my partner. And it matters to most people, and I know that logically. But when I’m home and I know that I could sweep or mop or do the dishes, I just don’t. I don’t have the motivation to get up and do it, because it doesn’t make me happy. I don’t get joy from finishing a task or completing something. I don’t feel satisfied when I put effort into something, especially something that doesn’t bring me joy.
But he’s put his foot down. Last straw kind of scenario. We want to move out together on our own. And he doesn’t want to do that with me if he has to do all the cleaning. And that is completely valid, and understandable. And I’m not upset with him. I’m more upset with myself that I can’t bring myself to do what he’s asking.

i feel trapped ,1711890224.0,"‼‼PLEASE READ‼‼I have BPD and the person i'm in a situationship with also has BPD and we are sort of heading into a relationship with exclusivity but we haven't labelled it yet, but we argue frequently over small stuff and it's so mentally draining. Anyways what i wanted to say is, my ex was/is abusive and she was able to hide it so so well (even to this day i'm still not convinced she abused me but most of my closest friends in my life have been trying to drill it into my head), i'm just seeing a bit of a pattern with my current 'partner' and i feel trapped. I'm 18 and a lesbian so there's a lot of stuff that makes me feel giddy inside like how we have a shared playlist on spotify etc. I understand BPD but i don't think that can excuse their behaviour towards me, i keep saying that since i don't react that way then why do they react that way but of course we are all individual with our own opinions and feelings, i just feel like me having BPD also gets pushed under the rug and when their friends (who are also my friends now) come to me about something that happened with them and how i need to communicate and stuff, they are always a lot harsher to me but seem to step on egg shells around them. They have broken the one boundary i set (i have no boundaries or standards due to being a very passive and forgiving person) which was to not kiss my friends (lesbian circle is insane) and they did just that last month... 3 times (same person), the first time was okay ish since i didn't specifically set that boundary but the second time they split on me and did it in front of me (this was when i set the boundary clearly) and then the third time they did it and their excuse was to get back at me because they thought i was also kissing other people but i wasn't and the person they kissed was on pingers (supposed love drug) i'm still slowly forgiving them for it. Whenever we do argue, i always end up apologising for reacting (even when i rightfully reacted how a normal person would) and they only seem to apologise when it makes them look like a good person. I'm just worried about looking like the bad guy when i am friends with their friends and i have gotten closer to them and vice versa. Im scared if i end things i will lose the friendships i got from being with his person. I also don't think i can leave since i am so emotionally attached it really freaks me out. Also when we argue, it's never been me starting (except for the time they kissed my friend), it's always been them getting defensive and then it ends up becoming an argument. Ah i don't know i really like this person but it feels embarrassing that i would be getting into my next relationship with a potential abuser/narcissist AGAIN. Now i'm stressing that maybe i'm the problem. I think i have been able to tame my BPD but i don't think my 'partner' has and it is just so draining, because they are SO nice and sweet in person, it's just over text and it really freaks me out. For example (i could keep talking about this) today/yesterday they left me on opened on instagram, which isn't objectively a big deal but because of my BPD i get scared that if they don't like my message or respond then that means they are mad at me, so i said to them in a jokey way ""MATE STOP AIRING ME ON HERE ARGH LIKE THE MESSAGE OR SMTH PLZ 😭"" they respond ""BRUH I DIDNT NOTICE"" I respond ""🤓 you've done it so many times STOP IT"" they respond ""what the fuck it literally doesn't matter"" in response i did leave them on read/open. They also continue to dismiss my feelings on something. I really need advice. Im not sure if i can cut them off completely because we also have shared friends and i just worry that they will be on my 'partners' side and not mine (im not trying to imply there are sides but since they are closer to my 'partner' they would probably have that bias) and i don't want their friends to message me about it. Also needed to add when i say that they did something that hurt my feelings they straight away get defensive rather than thinking about my feelings and how to comfort me and reassure me. AND they were the one who told me my ex was abusing me (this was before we got into a situationship and were still just friends) kinda funny how that is.",nanamisbreedingkink,,False,1bs9y14,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bs9y14/i_feel_trapped/

Introducing Myself ,1711819777.0,"Hi, everyone. 
You can call me Rowdy. I was added as a mod today so I thought I would introduce myself. 

26(f) 
I was diagnosed at 24 with BPD and OCD. A few months ago I was diagnosed with ADHD. I’m also a divorced mom of 3 with some ✨ trauma ✨ Im a full time employee at a pellet mill. We make bio fuel. I operate big equipment and I can run the plant from a computer screen. Avid lover of hermit crabs and dogs. 

I am very passionate about supporting others with BPD since I have not had much support dealing with this illness. This illness is very stigmatized and misunderstood. There is a lot of misinformation that circulates around social media platforms. I really understand how hard it can be for us to get the help and support we need. 

So guys, I’m here. I’m going to be as active as possible between parenting and working. I’ll be taking time to familiarize myself with the mod responsibilities. 

Thank you all for finding this group and trusting each other with your struggles and victories. I’d like to work together to keep this group open and active.

I’ve Been So Much Happier Lately,1711810098.0,"I’ve spent most of my life coping and making poor decisions for myself. I’ve spent so many years wanting to, ya know, end my suffering. 

I was diagnosed with BPD/OCD 2 years ago. I was devastated with the BPD diagnosis due to the low chances of being able to get help. Therapists are hard for us to find. Some of us are medication resistant. Truly, I’ve never had a medication or therapist that could help me. 

Then I met my current psychiatrist. After meeting me a few times she asked me if I had ever also considered an ADHD diagnosis on top of the OCD/BPD. I told her I had thought about it considering my son, my mother, and my youngest sister have been diagnosed with ADHD. She evaluated me. And low 
and behold, we added that to the list of things “wrong” with me. 

So, she started me on medication. Life changing is an understatement. I know my symptoms are unique to others due to the multiple complex disorders I have. So, this will not be everyone’s experience. But the medication has not just alleviated adhd specific symptoms, but my BPD/OCD symptoms have greatly subsided. I don’t wake up every day wishing I didn’t. 

My impulse control is better. I’m a happier, more attentive mother and partner. I handle my stressful life situations better without my brain automatically going straight to “must die.” 

Guys, I don’t really have many people to talk to that would understand what a relief this has been. I know you guys live with the constant pain and recklessness so you understand what a dark, hopeless mindset we tend to stay in. 

Today, the weather is beautiful. I’m feeling good inside my body. I feel beautiful again. I feel human. I appreciate the oxygen in the air and the blue of the sky. I applied my self tan. I’m shopping for Easter baskets for the kids (not Christian, just for fun). I’m finishing projects. I’m moving up at work. I have debt and bills and serious life stress and trauma. But I’m grateful for the moment. 

I hope everyone here can find a way to feel peace. I’m sending everyone vibes of healing and abundance and peace. If you read this far, thank you for allowing me to safely post my moment of brightness in my life. Ive never felt pure happiness before now. I’m grateful for this.

1am wake up thoughts,1711762129.0,"F 25. Just woke up and I have been uncontrollably crying. I was diagnosed with BPD around a year ago and have been in therapy since. Various shitty things in life have happened to me, but my first trauma came from my dad (shock!) when he abandoned myself (8 at the time) my older sister and mum for a 21 year old woman. This absolutely broke my mum, she was severely depressed and from this age until I was 15/16 I was always scared she might end her life. My sister became rebellious due to trauma, but I went the other way and hid everything else going on in my life to try and protect my mum from feeling guilty as I don’t blame her at all and she did her best. The issue is that this trauma response of hiding things that I’m going through has made further issues with things that have happened to me e.g. I didn’t tell anyone when I was being bullied at school because I didn’t want them to worry, I didn’t tell them I was self harming at 13 etc and it was never noticed, being groomed online, covered up that my partner was abusing me for 5 years. My mum says to me that she thinks I have BPD due to my abusive relationship. I wish I could tell her everything else but I worry she would blame herself, when the person I blame is my dad for leaving us and not giving a shit, to then have another child and he is a good dad to him. Why did I never get that ? Since then I have had a strained relationship with my dad. We currently speak only about once a month though. When I was in my abusive relationship (ages 18 to 23) my dad cut me off unless I ended it and this also created a lot of trauma for me. I’m now in a situation where I feel that maybe I should say something to them. Or just my dad. Or I don’t know. I don’t want to keep carrying this pain alone. I just want my dad to be sorry and take responsibility for the trauma he gave me. Not sure if even attempting to see if he will do this will just give me more issues.

I'm not sure if this is going to make any sense, but maybe it will. Whenever I have a bpd flare up with someone else involved - typically someone who I believe is mad at me and hates me - I tend to disappear for awhile and wallow in self pity, and it's weirdly comforting? And while I'm just sitting there hating myself and trying to distance myself from the person who I'm convinced is disgusted with me, they will eventually come back and say they're sorry for something they did that hurt my feelings, but I'll kind of ""milk it out"" so to speak, and get this strange satisfaction or high from being upset and having strong mental and physical feelings? There's also a part of me that milks this out to make the other person feel bad which I know is probably very manipulative, but it's satisfying in a way.

How do I get better?,1711516417.0,"I (20f) have been in a poly relationship for the past one and a half years with my partners 21f and 22f. For the majority of the relationship I have been completely okay, of course there have been ups and downs- my BPD has been what doctors have called ""quiet"" the majority of the time. This entire relationship has been consensual and for the majority of the time long distance with me living in the south, 21f living around 12 hours west of me, and 22f residing in Europe. 

I only started to feel insecure and unwanted in the relationship last July when I moved back go my home town to continue with my post graduate degree (yay full ride). When I moved it was fine for a few weeks, then when I started working again it seemed like I just stopped existing to 21f, she started to ignore me and act as if every time I went into work it was a direct attack to her- since I had less time to talk to her. Since I didn't want to hurt her, and to prevent me getting angry, I cut my hours and moved back in to my aunts home. Yet even after I cut my hours it was like I just ruined everything by having a life (she's physically disabled and had been out of work). We used to talk every single day but it went down to once a week, and I contemplated ending the relationship every day but I felt like if I left I'd just be compared to their abusive ex from like 3 years ago. So I stayed.

Nothing got better but I tried, I told them how I felt I tried every method therapy gave me, I bought them things they wanted, I spoiled them for their birthday but it didn't get better. Then my birthday passed, I was so excited and all I wanted was to watch a movie with them, but instead I got a long message about how awful their birthday was and how their parents did nothing for them and how jealous they were that I got gifts from my aunt (my parents are not in the picture). I was so ready to dump them that day but 22f convinced me not to- she was my rock during that time we talked constantly on call , constantly messaging yk? 

It got better with time, we were back to the before by September. But then I was talking about driving to 21f and she said no, she said she was too sick for me to come to her and that her doctor didn't want her to get sick. I understood since i am also immunocompromised- this was right after I got out of the hospital with covid and the flu. 

Not even a week later I got a message from both of them saying that 21f was going to be flying to Europe to be staying a month with 22f. I felt lied to, no matter how I looked at either of them it didn't get better. I told them so, I told them that it was their decision but that it was unfair how they treated me. I tried so hard to be calm and nice but all they said was that it wasn't their fault that I couldn't afford to fly to Europe. 

Despite the advice from my therapist I stayed, both of them telling me that my bpd was getting in the way of their happiness. I watched as they planned and Ultimately executed this plan this February. I woke up every day knowing that they were together in bed, I wasn't jealous of that I was mad. I was mad the entire month and was told over and over to calm down because clearly it was just my bpd overreacting. I listened, I thought I was the issue, I got angrier and angrier to the point that I was NV for almost two weeks straight, I couldn't talk- I could barely do anything (im also autistic). 

When 21f went back home I tried so hard to be calm, to forget but I can't. I'll never forget what they did to me. I feel so angry at both of them and objectively I know I'm the doormat for what I let them do to me but I just didn't want my bpd to affect them more than it already has with them being my fps. But now? I don't not love them but I still hate both of them. They both lied to me and then gaslighted me. I spent months in limbo hearing all their plans without me. 

I want to leave and I know it's dumb cause we're mostly long distance, but I feel so trapped. 21f has a tendency of always being a victim and every single fight that's ever happened always has to be my fault. Her ex also had bpd and she tells me at times she thinks I'm like him, despite knowing how much effort I put into not being like him its like a triumph card they use to try to make me a villain. They let things grow until they can't anymore and then blame me, its my fault they can't express boundaries, it's my fault they don't talk to me about issues (just because I don't know how to respond how they want me to). They expect me to always be their shoulder to lean on, and then when I can't I'm all of a sudden an awful subhuman who can't do anything right. 

I've been threatened with breaking up so many times by 21f its almost like a game, I can never be up to her standards. I'm like a broken record, I crawl back every time no matter how hurt I am and I just want an out. I'm not allowed to have friends I'm not allowed to go out, I'm just in a limbo.

About me:
I’ve been diagnosed with BPD, major depressive disorder, OCD, panic disorder, anxiety, PTSD. Suicide attempt in June and just have been progressively getting worse. I had a horrible inpatient experience after my attempt where I was mistreated and ignored by doctors.
Looking for:
Individual therapy ideally 5 days a week
Trauma treatment and EMDR
I have a lot of physical health issues that I have mostly learned to manage but my concern is being able to accommodate food allergies.
Would like a program that doesn’t just bandaid with medication but incorporates overall wellness habits that can be integrated post treatment.
I am 18 so I would prefer a young adult residential program, but it’s not 100% necessary.
I am from the NJ/NY area, again not 100% necessary since I’m prioritizing quality of the program over location.

About a year ago, I dated a guy named Tim. It was a rocky relationship and I cannot claim that I was the only victim. We weren’t good for each other and I am willing to acknowledge my fault.

On the other hand, every few months or so Tim will contact me again after he dumped me. The first time he messaged me for me to delete a photo of us on my facebook. Which I had ignored due to the fact he is posting terrible things about me online calling me all sorts of names, etc. I eventually deleted it after he berated and dmed me some more just so I could keep the peace. The second time he dmed me, it was apologizing for everything he has done and asking for reconciliation. I wasn’t moved on and was thrilled he asked for a redo. A week later he had suddenly went cold, after I thought everything was alright. There were no arguments. He continued to spread rumors about me and ruin my reputation at the school we went to together, and I had made the decision to continue online.
It’s been about a half a year since then and we have been no contact. Recently, Tim had gotten expelled from school due to trafficking. Today, I had gotten a strange text saying “I miss you”. I assumed it was my friend playing a joke so I resumed saying it back, and so forth. I asked who it was and he said “You know who. do you still think of me?”. I had decided to not respond for a while and continue to say “why did you do everything you did?”. He replied with “I thought it was the right thing to do. I'll be better this time. I wasnt ok mentally. I'm really really sorry beautiful.”

I am constantly overthinking and panicking and worrying and being indecisive and stressing out and I work 2 part time jobs so i never had be time to truly relax or have a proper day off. One of my jobs is something I’ve been wanting to do for years so I am so grateful for the opportunity but I am really struggling with the workload/time organisation and it’s making me work into the early hours of the morning 

My partner is getting really frustrated with me because I am always stressed and while I understand I just feel like he’s angry at me for feeling my feelings. When I try to talk about it he gets annoyed at me and tells me I need to do something about it and I agree but it’s so much easier said than done. 

I don’t really have any friends and I’ve not had time for social / fun stuff in a while (basically this year so far) and I feel like I have nobody. I don’t speak to most of my family and the ones that I do have are also busy. My mum is also sick right now (she just had an operation and we’re waiting to hear if she has cancer) and my dog is also old and sick and I’ve been looking after everyone.

I would love to just take a break from everything and get away by myself, I honestly can’t stand my life the way it is and i feel like I just annoy everyone around me because of my anxiety.

Please help me with my best friend,1711292419.0,"Hello! First off I’d like to say thank you for any assistance or advice you’re able to give me. 
I am sorry but this is going to be a little long, I’m a yapper and I try to give as much context as possible. 

My (M22) best friend (F20) has BPD, she’s always been fairly good about handling the symptoms and is high functioning even with it. For well over a year I was her only real friend and also her only support as she was in a nearly abusive relationship, and due to her BPD and other reasons she was unable to leave until very recently. We hung out and talked every single day and spent a lot of time together, we were really close. Well, shortly after her relationship ended her and I got closer and we ended up in a stage for about two months where we were basically dating. It wasn’t anything we planned for and it just ended up happening. We were both happy like this though, and I think we were both excited to see how things would work out. Obviously we both knew it could lead nowhere and we’d just go back to being friends and that was fine. Now the issue is that very recently she seems to have experienced a severe splitting episode. We went from basically dating to hardly speaking and she tells me that it makes her feel anxious to be around me. We’ve had long discussions about how she’s feeling and we don’t know what the conclusion to it all is. She tells me that she feels anxious and as if she owes me something. I have tried helping her in every way I can and speaking to her about how she feels and what steps we should take to try and resolve this. Nothing major happened to instigate this feeling in her and we are both just trying to figure out what’s wrong. She says that this is a new feeling she’s never felt before, not like normal splitting episodes. She does not want to feel the way that she’s feeling but she cannot help it. I’ve read up on BPD in the past so that I could better understand her and mostly what I’ve learned has helped up until now. What can I do to get my best friend back? I am fine if the relationship never happens, I do love her a lot and I’d do anything for her, but I just want her to be comfortable around me like she used to be. I am worried that us dating for those two months may have permanently ruined our friendship. She’s the best person I’ve ever met and I wanna find a way to help us both feel better in the situation that we’re in.

I am falling dangerously behind on my rent and utilities due to not being able to get hired anywhere. I have had interview after interview but all employers see is gaps in my employment no matter how I jazz up my resume. Those gaps are due to me having mental health emergencies and dark times in my life. I need an employer to give me a chance. The area I live in changed the emergency rental assistance to a lottery system so all the catholic charities and Salvation Army and everything in this area put all their funding into that. I have applied every single month I have tried calling places and everyone says the same thing. Just keep applying to the lottery system.

sick and tired of being so attached ,1711204441.0,"idk i feel like im more attached to everyone, more than they are to me. lately, i’ve been understanding more and more about why i even have bpd (relationship with parents). i feel like i’m there for my friends way more than they are there for me (be it closeness or being in a relationship).

my best friend is in a LDR with this guy she met on discord like 3 years ago and they’re 2 years strong. personally, i feel like they are not suitable for each other. when i met her, they used to fight and she even self-harmed herself MANY times, of which i was there through it all. it feels like she only seeks me when he’s not there and im always going to be the 2nd choice in her life, or even the 3rd or 4th. it’s honestly anxiety inducing because i sacrifice my time, my energy and so much to be there for her and understand what she’s going through. she has body dysmorphic disorder & clinical depression. it just sucks cause every time im going through something, she’s “too busy” for me. but i literally carve out time for her when she needs me. 

honestly, that makes me crave a relationship but im not in a position where i can go out and meet guys to date either. i have a really busy year ahead and i know i can’t afford to date anyone. also, i don’t know why but typically im super attached to whoever im in a relationship with but after some time, their flaws become too prominent for me and i leave. 

i don’t know, im just so confused… im going to university next year so maybe i should date someone then? there’s better opportunities then i guess?

Also I have an issue where I believe myself to be emotionally abusing my partner but I’m not sure.. I feel like I make him feel everything’s his own fault when really it’s mine.

How can i stop obsessing over people?,1710941945.0,"I met this guy at a concert last year and over the past two weeks we’ve been talking a lot more frequently and started getting along really well (From UK and USA, we don’t talk in person). 
We’ve discussed lots of personal stuff and I can feel myself getting obsessed with him and I hate it it’s destroying me, if he doesn’t message me back, leaves me on seen etc. I start spiralling and I cant focus on anything else. 
Im also really trying to break out of old habits and identify that this isn’t me falling in love with him - Im simply just developing another obsession with someone, but every time he mentions being with someone else it sets me off really really badly too.
I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to stop talking to him but I know this isn’t healthy for me at all, I’ve managed not to feel like this about someone in years and it’s making me feel awful. 
I really don’t want him to become a FP, last time that happened it was the lowest point of my life and I don’t want to have to completely stop talking to him. 
Any help or kind words are appreciated.

(even if she's five minutes late it still causes me to have an episode and this has ben caused from abuse from my mum when I was growing up) today she was going out and swore she'd be back for 8:30, no later and even with my worries she reassured me she'd be back on time. when it got to 8:10 I texted her as I was getting stressed she wouldn't be back in time bc she hadn't said anything about being on her way home, and then she didn't get back until 9. I was by then in a really bad episode I couldn't stop crying I felt like I didn't want to be here anymore and was sh ing. but this is when I don't know what to do, because in my mind she doesn't care about me, because if she did she would make sure she was back in time as she knows that this is what happens if she isn't and if she truly does love and care surely shed just stick to what she said about being back at 8:30? but then I see it from her point, and I think god this is so much for her to deal with, like she has to deal with all  my triggers and all my episodes, this isn't fair for her. but then my brain switches sides again and I think, she's choosing to be with me, she knew I had bpd before with got together,  ive gave her so many outs in our relationship as I know its a lot to deal with, and every time she tells me she wants to be with me and wants to deal with my triggers and will do anything to help even though she doesn't stick to it.

I lost myself,1710851964.0,"I used to have such a strong identity in high school. I was sure of my self, probably a bit thick skulled- but I was a person. 

I still had issues, but I managed them much better. 

Then as I went into adulthood and started facing isolation, rejection, career rejection, toxic relationships, breakups, homelessness, domestic violence, hospitalization, more and more hardship on my own and often stacked on top of each other, my sense of self eroded into nothing. 

After my last break up my brain went blank. I moved back in with my mother and had to give up everything that once gave me joy and identity. 

That was almost two years ago. 

Trying to be myself hurt me so deeply and set me back a great deal. 

Now I wake up everyday wishing someone could tell me who to be so my life can work out. 

I don’t have any real hobbies, a job, money, friends, a relationship, I have nothing going for me at all. 

I can’t afford therapy to help myself.

Does it get better?,1710773558.0,If there’s anyone out there who’s doing a lot better and like learned good ways with how to cope and are living very healthily with bpd how does it work? What does your life and relationships look like? ,Ilovew4ffles,,False,1bhsmuf,5,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bhsmuf/does_it_get_better/
help?,1710762488.0,"i know you guys aren’t qualified to diagnose me. but from your experience of living with bpd, could you please tell me if i’d meet the criteria for a diagnosis as i list my experiences and examples with the criteria standards. 

i also want to point out that i am currently isolated because i feel more comfortable within myself when i don’t have people in my life. 

1. Consistent feelings of emptiness- i don’t feel like a human being, i feel like an alien who is just existing most of the time. there is a sense of just feeling numb and nothing almost. if i could explain it, it just feels like there is a black hole inside of me and i don’t feel anything. 

2. Persistent and unstable self-image
i have never known who i am because of how often my mind changes. sometimes if i make up my mind about something, but i see someone arguing against my opinion, i’ll kind of rethink my opinion and side with them and tell myself i was wrong and they’re right. i feel like all i am is components of people’s personality and styles that i’ve stolen. for example, my career choices change a lot and very drastically. one minute i want to go into law and the next i see someone who works in the medical field and i begin to research the steps i’d need to take in order to do the same job as them. mind you, this would be a person online who i don’t even know, but i just like their content and i want their life. i also struggle with my own dress styles, for example; my ex had a sister who wore a lot of jewellery, so i went and bought the same jewellery and eventually adopted the same style as her, i would copy her music tastes and listen to the artists i knew she listened to and i could never understand why i did this. but since reading about bpd, i have acknowledged that i struggle have no sense of self. I will also mimick characters and their traits after watching a show, for example, i started to watch killing eve and then i would speak in a russian accent like Villanelle. I mimick Lorelai Gilmore a lot in terms of her humour and talking pace. 

3. Intensely unstable relationships
this is the first time i’ve been alone. i hate feeling lonely but love to be alone nowadays. i have been dating since 13 and i’ve been totally single with no male attention for almost a year. every relationship has been chaotic and i’ve been described as ‘unpredictable’ because my moods do not stay the same rarely ever, especially in romantic relationships, in terms of the constant arguments, being totally unable to believe what people say and trusting them, constant breakups, paranoid and anxious thoughts, such as believing they are cheating on me. i even go as far as stalking their social media accounts and creating a false story in my head about my partner and someone who they have on social media, and of course i believe the story although i don’t really have strong evidence to prove my case, and my behaviour shifts completely, i go from talking normally to my partner to being blunt and sarcastic which causes an argument. i also struggle with how i think about my partner and in all of my relationships, i have often ‘fallen in love’and felt like a happy little child with them, and feeling like this is a fairytale kind of love, to randomly hating them and wanting nothing to do with them. and the cycle continues. 

4. Repetitive suicidal thoughts, threats, gestures, or behaviors
i have always been attached to suicide. it never leaves my mind. i’ve been this way for so long. i constantly have the thought of killing
myself in my mind, but i do not want to die. i catch myself saying ‘i wanna die’ all the time and most times its for a silly reason, like me dropping my drink and it spilling everywhere. i have come close to suicide only twice. the first one i couldn’t find any pills to OD on, and the second time it was as if my reality became distorted. i had just finished arguing with my partner and was extremely upset by it and everything stopped and felt like a movie as i stepped past the yellow warning line near the train tracks. and suddenly it was as if everyone’s voice came swooning back in and it felt like i was back into reality. its not like i want to die, but i do at the same time. i plan my suicide and think about executing it at least twice a day. 

5. Energetic effort to avoid abandonment (imaginary or real)
in relationships yes. i have always tried to catch my partner out ‘cheating’ (ie. stalking their social media frequently checking for potential girls they could be speaking too and then piecing together a story that seems factual) so i can anticipate and prepare ahead. I have begged partners to stay, even if they’ve cheated, because i don’t want them to leave and i’d rather be in pain with them than without them. I continued to go back to my abuser because the thought of not having him broke my heart because i didn’t know who i was without him or what my life would be like. i have even let my abuser sexually assault me out of fear that he’d leave. i have stood in front of door ways to enable my partner to leave after telling him i wanted him to go, but i didn’t really want him to. 

6. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling temperament
my anger has always been bad. i was an angry child and i was kicked out of school for fighting. now that im isolated, i don’t get angry a lot. i just struggle with the irritable feelings and anything can irritate me so fast, like the sound of people breathing or chewing sounds. sometimes when i hear my family speak i just get super irritated and can feel my body temp raising. 
in relationships, when something they do or say triggers me i get angry and i say things i don’t mean, throw things at them, and have tried to fight and had to be restrained. but attempts to fight is a rare occurrence. when i failed one of my exams, i was very upset and angry about it and i started to say things very irrational, i wouldn’t like to repeat what i said because i am still feeling guilty about it 

7. Sudden mood swings and emotional instability that can last hours or days
i’m very emotional and unpredictable. i will be in a pool of my own tears and ill cry for hours for no reason and then after i just won’t feel anything, but as soon as i see my siblings, i feel okay and somewhat happy? 
in relationships, i would be out with a partner feeling happy and suddenly i was irritated and just wanted to go home and not see them again. 
in relationships, i have found that i have had many conversations with a partner, normal conversations where i would basically treat them better than royalty and would do absolutely anything for them to suddenly feeling as if id be better off without them and how they don’t deserve me and i hate them and never want anything to do with them again, eventually to snapping out of it and feeling like i love them again.
 i was in college and had a meltdown in the bathrooms because i didn’t feel like i fit in. throughout college, i would just get outbursts where i had to cry uncontrollably, but afterwards i would feel okay. 
i find it quite hard to pin point my emotions so i guess i should start keeping a mood journal? 

8. Severe dissociative symptoms and paranoid delusions related to temporary stressors
When stressed, i isolate and withdraw from life itself. i dont attend education, dont speak to anyone and dont eat because i am too overwhelmed with the stress to deal with people. i just sleep. but when i am stressed and attempt to go outside, it is chaos. i just want to die and everyone that even looks at me i believe is going to follow me or harm me so i must move away otherwise its going to happen. my latest stress was caused by me spending money and not having enough to pay for the things that really matter, so i became stressed and tried to attend uni to ‘get some air’ but i didn’t attend my lectures i just sat in my toilets and cried for an hour and found myself in the middle of london walking around like a lost child. i do not remember how i got there. i just was. 
and when stressed and anxious about things like my cats, i feel the need to stay up all night monitoring my cats because i felt something was wrong with them so i had to be awake ‘just incase.’ i slept when i knew other members in my home were awake. 
when im stressed or upset and im outside, i feel like nothing is real and im almost unaware of my surroundings, and id just stare into thin air. people have seen me do this before and have told me it was as if i wasn’t present.   

9. At least 2 impulsive behaviors (for example: reckless driving, overeating, overspending, substance abuse, or sex)
Only overspending. 

I have been experiencing all of this since i was around 14/15. I am 20 now. 

For those who have this disorder, could you please help me because i am confused and don’t know whether i would qualify for a diagnosis or if it is just depression and unhealed trauma. I am planning on booking a doctors appointment soon 
but i am currently trying to battle the nerves because my mind is telling me im probably making it all up.",Previous_Ad_7926,,False,1bhorrm,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bhorrm/help/

I just dont care about school even though I want to.,1710614110.0,"Im a 16 year old high school student in New York City, and the only reason I come to school is just for the social stimulation. I have high expectations for myself. I have no idea what I want to be, hell I dont even feel like wanting a job. My parents say they dont care what college I go to or what job I get, that they will always be there to support me. They prefer that I be a doctor, so thats what Im aiming for, but I put very bare minimum effort in my school works. I come to school and I just dont care about my academics and I feel bad. I dont care about deadlines, nor low grades, or anything. I dont have terrible grades Im higher than most but also lower than most.

I mainly care about pursuing my romantic interests, staring at crushes, seeking attention from people, and hanging out friends. Most people in school get weirded out by me, they say Im too overwhelming and intense that I exhibit autistic behavior. They do the exact same bs acting dumb, making weird noises and all that, but for some unknown reason they do better socially than me. I have no idea what Im doing wrong. Why do I push everyone away from me. I have quiet BPD and its really easy to contain my true emotions. I let people walk all over me and disrespect me as I do nothing. Im feel extreme rage all the time, sometimes I wish I got into a fight and visciously beat someone up so everyone would fear me, and then I could demand respect. Romantic interests, well you know how this goes, Ive never had one and never got close. Ive been rejected 15 times. I know this is unhealthy but I just cant stop thinking about it. I DONT WANT TO WORK OR DO ANY SHITTY ASSIGNMENT, I JUST WANT TO BE FREE TO DO WHATEVER I WANT. I have fantasies of me getting superpowers and hanging out fictional characters, putting people in fictional worlds, and just making my own world where I rule and nothing goes wrong.

Borderline Personality Disorder; 
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder;

Body dysmorphia;
ADHD.

Treating the ADHD with medication, helped alleviate some of the other symptoms from the other stuff, which is honestly a relief. Especially the BPD symptoms that left me scrambling for a dopamine hit just to FEEL something other than dead inside all of the time. I’ve been feeling so much more positive minded since starting meds for ADHD. I’m scared it won’t last. I don’t want to go back to the spiral of bad behavior and out bursts and craving alcohol and suicidal ideations. Just all the stuff. It’s not perfect all of the time, but this last month I’ve been medicated, I’ve just felt a bit of relief from it all and it’s been nice.

I’m so embarrassed ,1710419522.0,"I ruined a relationship and then tried to explain myself by telling him I have BPD. I told him so he wouldn’t think it was his fault, etc. 

I don’t know if he is messing with my head or if he is just genuinely hurt/stressed but he won’t reply to anything I’ve actually said. He just gives vague answers that never actually address anything. This is kind of what drove me crazy in the first place (not his fault). 

The only reason I’m still in contact with him is because he said he still wants to be a part of my life and do foodie stuff like go eat interesting food and see art shows, just as friends. And he said he wants me to meet his family (????). But he says those things and then completely ignores me and cancels plans with me. 

Obviously he wants to keep me on a line but not actually interact with me but I’m just finding it really hard to swallow. I know he is not interested but I wish he would just SAY that instead of giving me the run around. I need him to actually say it and give me closure because I’ve made it clear that I have strong feelings for him and he won’t acknowledge it. He treats me like an irritating fly buzzing around his face. 

Now I have basically just told him I am crazy and anything I say to him after this will be disregarded and undermined. I’m so embarrassed that I told him and I wish I could go back in time and un-tell him.

Can anyone help me understand? I know I'm gay I just don't understand how my life has gone this way. ,1710362978.0,"So I have recently been diagnosed with bpd and there are some things I am struggling with regarding my sexuality and how I've got here and I know it sounds completely far fetched but I just need to know if theres anyone out there with a similar experience. I have recently discovered that I am a lesbian but I had only been with men before my girlfriend (who was also just diagnosed with bpd today) and she's really struggling to see how I could possibly be gay which I understand but I just know that I am on the feelings and looking back through my life.

When I was 13/14 my mum went into my school because I was being called an 'anorexic lesbian'. I was very skinny hence anorexic and I liked to hold my female  friends hands. I also used to look at my female friends bodies when they were changing (I know this isn't OK but I just didn't think anything of it). 

When I was 16 I went to my mum and I told her that I thought I was gay because of a specific girl in my school because I really fancied her and wanted to be with her but she told me that 'I wasn't gay but if I was it would be OK' and that 'everyone has those thoughts and feelings about women'. I feel like in that moment she normalised having feelings for women and made it seem like that's what heterosexual women felt. In that moment I felt really disappointed that I wouldn't be able to be with women. 

My mum also used to turn off TV programmes with two women in a relationship in then them and I always really wanted to watch them and have remembered the scenes that I saw from them so clearly throughout my life. 

I then fell down a horrible hole of chasing validation through sex with men because I thought that that would get me love. I created a character that I thought men would want because I wanted to be loved so badly and I thought they wanted sex so I became a 'sweet, cool girl who just wanted sex'. Even though I actually was never attracted to men in anyway. 

Everytime I had sex with men I dissociated to my school hallway and pushed my feelings away. My counsellor said that I was trying to escape to somewhere safer but unfortunately my school experience wasn't positive and therefore I was self sabotaging and punishing myself. I always felt anxious and wrong with men but I ignored my feelings and kept striving to be the perfect character.

I found myself looking at my female friends and their bodies and imagining myself being with them. But it was always like I couldn't be. I knew that I was never attracted to men and I have been attracted to women but because I 'wasn't gay' I managed to get to pansexuality because I knew I wasn't attracted to men but I didn't look far enough to know that actually I was attracted to women and therefore gay.

When I was younger a girl kissed me in a club but I was drunk and she got lipstick all over my mouth and at this point in my life I feel like i was just so far into the character that I was so fixated on being the perfect woman for men so that I would be loved because it was my only option because i 'wasn't gay' because of what was said when I was 16.

I have found myself fantasing about women throughout my life but it was like I wasn't able to be with them and men were my only option for love and I wanted to be loved so badly. 

When I went to my psychiatrist to get my diagnosis he said that because my mum was my primary care giver her telling me that I wasn't gay was a massive part in my life and that I wanted to please her and therefore became characters so that I could be loved and used sex as a currency to achieve this because I thought it's what men wanted.

I will also say that both of my parents are suspected narcissists and my step mum is suspected bpd also. 

When I met my girlfriend everything was different, I thought that she was the most beautiful thing that I had ever seen and everything with her feels so natural and right. And when we had sex for the first time I looked at her and said 'oh my goodness I'm not thinking about anything else.' because that was so new to me, I was actually there and thinking about her and her body and touching her and not just trying to escape in my head. 

When I actually think about what I want I know that it's women and that I'm a lesbian but I'm just so confused how this could be my life and how I could have done these things when I know they're wrong for me. I just need some answers and want to know if there's anyone who has any? 

Basically I just want to know if anyone has had a similar experience as me? Because when I look at my life I know that the feelings with my girlfriend are so different than anything I've ever felt before. And when I look back I can see that I have fancied women but that I pushed all my emotions and feelings away to create this character because I wanted to be loved so badly.

I didn't even like him that much, but after the exclusion, you know, I couldn't understand how someone could be so cruel. I tried for time and time to talk to him, and when I tried in person I got dumped, from then on I was ignored and ignored.

He told me terrible things, the last conversation I had in July after my mother died was a sincere thing, I tried, you know, to explain why I wanted to be on good terms with him so much, I even talked about my disorder and He seemed understanding at the time, but then he sent me an audio saying terrible things, that I was very clingy and in short, I suffered so much... I always wanted his attention, his apologies, I created a trauma from that, I couldn't stand having to see him and at the same time I could see him from afar anywhere in the school.

How can I help myself and my relationship? Advice needed! 💭Seeking Support & Advice,1710219877.0,"How can I help myself and my relationship? Advice needed!  
  
What I expect from this post: advice  
  
Initially, I'd like to clarify that my English isn't my first language, so if there're any mistakes do not mind me. I also know that I am wrong, and I am expecting some guidance.  
  
\- I am a 23 year old female, and 2 months ago I got into a long distance relationship with a 25 year old man whom I love a lot. We met on Discord. We both are Egyptian but we live in different cities. I know he loves me, but I recently displayed a few behaviours and I believe they quite affected our relationship. The most significant was when I split but failed to recognize I was splitting until after shit already went down. I know I am very flawed because I tend to be over obsessive as a response to my fear of him leaving me. 1 week ago I thought I wasn't very important, he doesn't love me, and that he won't care if he \*lost\* me. I understand that no one should identify my self-worth except for me, but what I did left me regretful until this very moment. I had told him ''we're over'' then quickly took it back, but little did I know how much this affected him. I was fully honest and told him I said this out of fear that you'll leave me or that you do not find me interesting/ won't fear losing me. He emphasized that what I said hurt him, and that he doesn't love me any less after what I said but our relationship will be kind of rocky and it will need time to mend and heal. I also do something that annoys him , and I can't blame him which is "" excessive reassurance seeking"". I understand seeking assurance from time to time is healthy but asking every day or multiple times a day can be draining for him, so I also need to know how can I reassure myself so I stop asking him every 2 business seconds. I want to know how do I stop freaking out over a slight change in the way he texts, because we ALL have our ups and downs and poor man needs some rest. Also, he tells me to not excessively bring up an issue we have already closed/stopped talking about because this does nothing but ruins our mood and slows the relationship's progress. ( Please forgive me my thoughts are all over the place so I am trying to type all of what I can remember). Nowadays he is acting distant and I know its because he is afraid of another argument (because basically every time I excessively ask for reassurance it turns into an argument) , so I also want to know how do I not make him afraid of conducting a conversation with me because I genuinely do not wish to argue or do anything that upsets him again. Also another point, me and him haven't voice called yet, because of two things: 1- he is insecure about his voice, 2- his family is always around so they're strict about him being on phone with girls ( its a culture thing so dont mind it), and his friend told me that whenever his family aren't in the house he be wanting to ask me to VC but then some argument happens from my side that makes him want to go offline for 2 days, so how do I fix that as well?

I don’t know if I can live like this ,1710215252.0,"When I got my diagnosis I was still living with an emotionally abusive mother and my ex was living with us as well. My ex was also emotionally and physically abusive. So I had two abusive situations going on at once and it went on for years. I had absolutely no issues with my mental health up until that point in my life. 

I ended up so broken down and brainwashed. I eventually tried to take my own life and had to be sectioned, and that’s when I was diagnosed. The problem is that when I went to the psych ward my mother and my ex were very involved in my “care” and they told a lot of lies about me. 

My mother told them I had beaten her up before and my ex said I had multiple personalities. None of that is true. I have never hit anyone in my life before and I do not have multiple personalities. They told those lies to cover up their abuse. That way if I said anything nobody would believe me and they would just think I was being manipulative. My ex also told them that I broke his hand. That’s not true. He punched a wall and broke his hand and then my mother blamed me because he did it because he was angry with me, so therefore it must be my fault. He was angry with me for going to the gym. 

Anyway, all of that is on my record and there’s nothing I can do about it. According to my mental health record I am violent, abusive and manipulative. Nobody is ever going to believe me that those things aren’t true if I go and get help, especially because after hearing about their lies I got so distraught, angry and upset at the injustice of it all that I behaved in ways that probably proved their point. I was so angry about the lies and in complete disbelief about the way they pretended to be so concerned and care about me so much. I had a panic attack and it was during the panic attack when I told the inpatient therapist that they were lying. Of course I was not believed. I was the mental patient after all, not them. 

The only saving grace I have is that my father experienced similar abuse from my mother and she lied about him to cover it up as well. But even if he comes with me to appointments I still feel like they will never believe us because the story is so bizarre. 

Now I am stuck in a situation where I need help and nobody is ever going to believe me about what really happened and I will never be treated correctly. I can feel myself becoming everything they said I was, and it was just never fucking true in the first place. 

I feel like the narrative of my life and who I am has been written for me and there’s nothing I can do to fix it. I can’t get any real help and I don’t even know if this diagnosis is accurate because a lot of it was based on lies. A lot of it was based on my reaction to a fucking horrible situation. 

I’ve been raw dogging life all this time with no therapy and no medication because I am too scared to go to a therapist and have them think those things about me. I’ve been reading self help books and trying to “self-therapise” and I was doing great. All it took was one more bad relationship and I’m right back where I started. All of those feelings I had back then have smacked me in the face and I’m here brainwashed again, thinking I am to blame. I am the problem. Of course I am.

And there’s no help because NOBODY IS EVER GOING TO FUCKING BELIEVE ME. If hadn’t experienced this myself and somebody told me this story, I wouldn’t believe them. The only reason I’m still here is because of my dad. If I didn’t have that one person in my life who believes me I think I would probably have unalived myself already, not that I never tried. Another thing that stops me is the thought of actually being dead and nobody knowing the true story of what really happened. My mother could say anything and get everyone’s sympathy. She would be the poor innocent mother grieving her abusive, mentally ill daughter. I wouldn’t be around to defend myself anymore. 

I just feel like there’s no good option. I was born and had to endure all this pain and now I can’t even opt out? Because that might cause other people pain? My pain matters and I wish it would be acknowledged instead of being twisted into something it’s not. I wish somebody would actually *see me* instead of seeing the ugly version of me that they fabricated. 

I can’t fucking live like this with no help, but they won’t believe me. ",,,False,1bcnoej,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bcnoej/i_dont_know_if_i_can_live_like_this/

During the trip, it’s been difficult to keep in regular contact with my husband, as he’s constantly at the beck and call of his boss.

Most of our conversations, when they do happen, consist of “I’m going to have to go in a minute, because I’m having breakfast/lunch/dinner/coffee/drinks in the rooftop bar/going out to see the local sights with (the boss)”.

It is tearing me apart.

My husband says that I have nothing to worry about, and that it’s just two guys on a business trip - but he saw his boss using Grindr, and the thought of these two horny gay guys spending all of this time, alone, together, getting to know all about one another, and sharing their life stories is killing me. And that’s without the mega-intrusive, vivid nightmare thoughts about the sexual situations I imagine them in.

Every brief conversation now involves me interrogating him relentlessly and aggressively about why he hasn’t replied to my messages, or where he’s been, or why he sounds guilty - so, every conversation becomes a huge argument.

I’m riven with jealousy, paranoia, distrust, and doubt and, at the same time, terrified that my irrational, over the top behaviour is just pushing him into the warm bed of his boss.

How do I cope with this? Help me, please!!

BPD rage is ruining my life,1710067641.0,"I really struggle to calm down when I split. It’s getting really bad to the point where my relationship is at a point of us both breaking up, because my words just hurt. Im tired of it and my partner is. I try my best to communicate, but as soon as I feel invalidated about my feelings I just go off. My partner tends to just counter my feelings with how he feels and thats generally where we clash, because we are both not really listening to each other. I do take accountability for what I do, but it tends to be after the damage is done. I really want to change that. My partner also sometimes does not acknowledge the fact I take accountability, this generally is another way my rage comes back up and attacks again. It makes me come across like I’m not sorry for my actions as I go back into it all again. However, there’s only so many times I can apologise and try to fix things. I just don’t know what to do.

 I’m not currently in any form of therapy, but I’m with a mental health team (primary care). Though, they’re showing to be useless as they continue to cancel my appointments. So I don’t really have any experience with CBT or DBT methods, nor am I on meds - just a psychiatric suggestion of fluoxetine and citalopram.

I just want some advice and just have others personal experience with dealing with rage, and advice on how my partner can approach the situation also. I want it to work for both of us, because there’s definitely things we both should work on. ",,,False,1bb7ke3,8,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bb7ke3/bpd_rage_is_ruining_my_life/

That I was loved and truly safe and supported. I read him that letter. I found strength in him.

I don’t understand why he’s still in my life,1709738587.0,"I made a throwaway because this is really shameful for me and I don’t want it associated with my main account. 

I was single for 5 years after getting out of an abusive relationship (him the abuser that time). I was healing and after 5 years I really had my symptoms under control. Everything in my life was going so well that I started to believe that I either never had BPD in the first place or that I had managed to recover for the most part. I attributed my improvement to being out of that abusive environment I was in when I was diagnosed. 

And then I met somebody I really liked. We started dating about 4 months ago and I really thought we were working towards a relationship. He was taking me out for romantic dinners, calling me every day before work and spending hours on the phone with me in the evenings. He was saying romantic things like “I miss you” and stuff like that… so I don’t think my assumption was unfounded. 

About 2 months in he told me that he is unable to have a relationship due to life circumstances and he had known that the entire time. He has PTSD, he doesn’t have his own place and he has never been able to fall in love. Those are his reasons. I respect that because I have trauma too and I understand that it can make relationships difficult. I was also grateful that he told me he wasn’t able to fall in love because at least I am aware, but I just wish he had told me sooner. I felt stupid because I felt like he put on act and I fell for it. 

At that point I was already attached to him and I was heartbroken because I really thought we had something and nobody had ever treated me so kindly before. He was still a great support and we have a strong intellectual connection so I really wanted  to keep him in my life and I tried really hard to be okay with everything. I *know* this is the point where I should have walked away but the mistake has already been made so I guess I’ve learned my lesson. 

Ever since then I have completely spiralled. I repeatedly slept with him and then days later I would break down because I felt used. I slept with him because I thought he would leave if I didn’t. I thought I would never see him again so I did what I thought I had to do to keep him in my life even though I knew it was harming me emotionally. He kept acting the same with the romantic dinners and phone calls and romantic words.

I just got so confused. I felt like my heart was breaking over and over again. It was like he was my boyfriend….but wasn’t. I started drinking heavily at home by myself because I couldn’t take the pain and everything started pouring out when I was drinking. I was sending him long messages expressing my discontent about the situation. I was telling him I didn’t want to see him again. Every time I would regret it in the morning and call him to beg for forgiveness. He, understandably, started getting more and more distant. 

Eventually it progressed to trauma dumping and accusations of him manipulating me. I realised I was being abusive. I thought I had healed from my past but apparently I have become the abuser instead. So after one very bad episode, I called him the next morning and I took accountability for everything. I owned up to being abusive and told him we shouldn’t see each other anymore. I told him it’s not his fault, it’s my fault, and I am sorry. I said he should block my number because I am a toxic abuser. That’s what I am and I need to get help. 

I didn’t hear from him for a few days and I thought that was that. I called a hotline and got some information on where I can get help for my abusive behaviour. And then he called me again a few days ago. He said he wants to remain in my life and we should see each other maybe once a month. Suddenly he wants me to meet his family, “to give me a family away from my family”. He said that he’s probably the only person who can put up with my behaviour, so he wants to remain constant in my life to give me a sense of stability. 

I’m starting to feel desperate and trapped. I have such mixed feelings. I caved the other night and told him I miss him, via text. His response was simply “Ok…”, so I apologised for saying that. I just don’t really understand what’s happening. I feel guilty for thinking this but I can’t help but feel like there is some ulterior motive he has for wanting me in his life, which makes me want to attack him again. 

I don’t have anyone to talk to…other than him. But I honestly feel like he doesn’t actually like me and he is just staying in my life out of pity. I also think I should stay away from him for obvious reasons. I really care about him and I know that’s hard to believe considering how I have behaved. This is so shameful for me and I’m so scared of being judged. I’m on a waiting list to see a therapist. They told me about 8 weeks. A lot can happen in 8 weeks….

Can anyone give me any perspective on this? What do you think I should do? ",,,False,1b82dhx,4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1b82dhx/i_dont_understand_why_hes_still_in_my_life/

OH MY GOD I JUST REALIZED I WAS ALSO HIGH AF SO MAYBE THATS WHY IT WAS SO CONFUSING. Sorry for yelling but idk how I did not think of that sooner. I get REALLY dumb when I poke the smot.

Spent 4 hours of my night 03/04/24  fighting w my boyfriend. It really was all a bunch of misinterpretations and misunderstanding. Very frustrating. We were also both moderately intoxicated. Throughout the entire fight I must’ve said “what did I deserve for you to be unkind to me recently?” “what can I do so that this is resolved?” DOZENS of times and I never got a clear answer.

Anyway after I thought it was resolved, we participated in the spicy tango. I went to adjust the hanging chair that was above us and told him “watch out” because it gets in the way sometimes and he just loses it “you don’t think I know it’s there? It’s MY room, I know it’s there. I’m not stupid.” And then we continued the fight as if it wasn’t resolved.

I ended up telling him I kinda felt used because he gave me the impression we were good and that’s why I agreed to do it. But he clearly had more on his mind and just wanted to f*ck (a few minutes before the fight “resolved” he had mentioned “oh yeah, we haven’t had sex in a while and we definitely need it”). It had been a week.

Anyway after I told him this he got upset. He just kept insisting that he didn’t use me because I c@me and he didn’t (if he goes too long he gets in his head and can’t finish, it was like 30-ish minutes). He said before going to sleep that he can’t trust me anymore after I said that.

It’s not fair. Why is HE allowed to freak out but when I do, I’m being irrational or “having an episode”. He even got upset with me for the one time I raised my voice when he had done a significantly larger amount of increased-volume moments. WTF??

Today comes around and it started pretty terrible. We were both quiet and I cried a lot throughout the first half of the day. He ignored me. We ran some errands and I could not keep myself together. It came to a point where I (kinda forcibly) hugged him and said “I don’t f*cking care. I’m sorry, I’m not doing this to just make things good between us or to make you feel bad, I just really need a hug and I have no one right now.” I was full-on SOBBING into his gd shoulder in a public parking lot. Took a few seconds but he hugged me back really tight. I let go after prob a solid 2 minutes and just go back to the car in silence. The day got better after that I guess. Within a few hours we were laughing and joking as if nothing happened. He brought me to work as usual, we said “I love you” and kissed like usual.

I’m so confused. Up until now, he was basically smitten, always telling me how good I am to him because I literally do everything for him. Make him food, clean his room, do his laundry on top of my own plus folding and putting it away (exactly how he likes it because he gave me hell for not putting his clothes in the right place once), give him reassurance when he needs it, etc. I guess that changed? He’s my fp. I don’t want to lose him. These types of fights rarely happen (if at all).

Breaking up is not an option. I really don’t want suggestions like that. I can’t do it. Basically if this relationship ends it’s because he’s decided that I’m not worth it anymore 🤷🏻‍♀️ I just need someone to listen. I have 2 friends and they’re both in different states and I only really talk to one of them on a regular basis.

I also recorded the last like half hour of the fight before spicy time. Listened to it today and still can’t figure out wtf even happened. Like I reassure him when he tells me how he interprets what I say and I admitted I was wrong several times for assuming what he meant or for misinterpreting what he said…",astroslut3000,,False,1b7v98j,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1b7v98j/kinda_confusing_situation_idk/

So basically I have BPD, ADHD, and some other things. I am not medicated for the ADHD due to my psychiatrist being a piece of shit. Today I looked at my grades (I’m in college) and I’m failing two of my classes because I’m unable to focus and get work done, I procrastinate a lot and I put my boyfriend above everything because he’s my ‘favorite person’. I am so fed up with being misunderstood and not listened to by my psychiatrist and I’m feeling incredibly impulsive, like criminally impulsive if you get what I’m getting at. I am so angry. I blew up on my mom and boyfriend and I’m at work right now so they are not with me but I was spamming them with texts and calls telling them I’m going to do something impulsive or hurt myself. My boyfriend is now mad at me and won’t talk to me because I scared him which is totally reasonable. I know I’m a bad person sometimes. But I am just so angry that they won’t put me on a stimulant to help me. I had anorexia but I’ve been in recovery for a year now and my eating disorder therapist cleared me for a stimulant but my psychiatrist won’t talk to her and she keeps putting me on diff meds like lithium and qelbree. I never took the lithium because I’ve been on too many mood stabilizers and anti psychotics and I don’t wanna turn into a zombie again. I’m not taking the qelbree because it’s not a stimulant. I’ve taken adderal before, and it helped so much. I would only take it on school days though because I like being frenzied when I’m sewing or working on my creative stuff. I don’t know what to do anymore, it feels like my world is crashing down around me and I’m starting to get those minor hallucinations and my mom said that I’m acting deranged right now.

I don’t think I’m asking “too much”,1709591383.0,"I have bpd in a monogamous relationship. Last year, my partner did some things that tested boundaries and I felt Rocky/insecure ever since. what my therapist says is that I am looking for “preventative care”, my partner to reassure me that things like that won’t occur again. I thought I was extremely jealous, turns out jealousy comes unprovoked, and all of these occurrences were “provoked”. What I was ACTUALLY feeling disrespected and unheard NOT jealousy. I said something along the lines to my partner of I don’t know how far things will go, what’s the expectations? Where are the lines? My partner was confuse so I went with an example. “what if we’re in public and some person of the opposite sex wants to add you on social media? What would you do?” (Friends partner or a friend of a friend situation) he tells me he would add them and then let me know later. (the last time boundaries were pushed what partner told me is that they would ask before doing anything with opposite sex NOT so I can say no or control them but so they are making me and my emotions the priority. It’s to inform what’s about to occur.) after talking about the part in parentheses, partner says it feels like they’re being chastised or controlled. Why can’t I wait until later? …. because I don’t want to sit in an uncomfortable feeling when it could be a compromise and easily resolved AT THE TIME. Why is it more important to make a STRANGER feel comfortable than your partner is where my head goes. I understand I may have a completely different view point to you but I don’t think I’m asking anything that’s too extensive….. I wasn’t even the one that had the “original solution”. What I was left with is “ fine I give up we will do it your way” from partner. Why is it wrong for a partner to inform before they do some thing that could emotionally harm a partner? If you disagree please be kind I’m sensitive about this. I have to respect me and my feelings too.

"Wedding got cancelled.
",1709576774.0,"I know this post is very long but please take the time to read, I really need ur opinions and help on this one🥺🙏🙏

I (20f) and my partner (26m) have been waiting to get married for 6months now, we have been together for 4 years now, engaged for 1. I struggle with bpd but we found this out during the relationship. During our whole relationship it has been rough, when I met him I was very young and had just came out of a very abusive relationship (when I say just it was probably nearly a year later) and was still recovering, he knew this and we made it work anyway. It was great for a while, I started really feeling better with my mental health. Then I got assaulted by one of his friends. ( It's a long story but I won't get into it now) Obviously my mental health degraded after that and I was in and out of hospital and that is when they figured out I had bpd. It was a horrible time in my life and to me felt like forever. Right when all of this was happening COVID hit, my bf lost his house bc his roommates left unexpectedly bc of COVID and he couldn't afford it anymore. So I was still living with my parents at the time and I was SOOO ill that my parents agreed to my bf moving in with us as he was helping so much with my mental health. The plan was always to leave and move in with eachother but life sucks as you all may know. We saved enough money to leave together and work on the other side of world with his dad, we were there for 3 months but to put it short his dad fucked us over and then Brexit happened ( I'm British) so I was not allowed to work basically anywhere and had to leave. So we came back to my parents and decided to get married as we had previously been engaged for a year anyway so we could build the life together that we wanted. So that would have been 6 months since we came back and decided to do all of this, I spent a lot of money on paperwork and got very stressed about it. In this period of time our relationship was under a lot of stress and pressure and let's just say that my bf ""cracked"", I am very patient with him given how patient he was with me and how much he helped me with everything, but I can only put up with so much. He has been shouting at me and calling me names every day for maybe 8 months. So eventually we got to a point where we could finally get married and go away together but because of his behaviour I am not well enough to go now, I had to quit my job due to panic attacks coming back. Had a trip to the hospital and now back on meds and I am physically ill from my anxiety (vomiting, nauseous, not sleeping) We had a very long chat and for obvious reasons have cancelled the marriage because I am not well enough to leave yet and because of how toxic everything has become, he says that he behaved this way because of stress and is very sorry about the whole situation. He wants to stay here for a few months (I don't know how comfortable I am with that) and save up money so that he can leave on his own ( he hadn't been working since we came back which really bugs me) and I have to stay with my parents where they can look after me and I can get the help I need with the psychologist bc where we want to go I will have no insurance or right to it and I NEED it right now. His plan is to work and study at the same time while he is there and then go to uni and after uni come and get me. Which to me seems like a silly plan, I can make a year work but not 4 years. Also I feel like after everything happened it's not really the same anymore between us (I really do love him but it's all a bit too much) I just feel a bit in shock with all of this bc it all happened very fast and suddenly I am now trying to figure out my life. I am 20 with very little work experience and little to no education (I am very intelligent but could not do these things due to panic disorder) I have 0 friends, I only have my mum and dad and we have very little money. I want to move away but it seems nearly impossible on my own and I just feel a bit defeated by this whole situation. Obviously I think being on my own and focusing on my mental health and getting a job that works for me would be the best thing for me rn, but obviously bc of my bpd I am terrified of being alone and it's already hard as it is bc I have no social life apart from him and it been like that for so long that I don't really know where to start. I just don't really know what to do in this situation, he seems to think that if he leaves and does all of this he can make it work between us, but I am not so sure.

I thought to myself, she’s busy and preparing for her flight, packing etc. However, I just went on my instagram and saw that she looked at my post from last night. Like wtf? So, she’s not busy then and why can’t she respond to my message if she has time to be going on my instagram story. I feel sooo pissed off with her, but I also feel A LOT of anxiety and my mind is searching for a reason she hasn’t responded to my message. I feel anxious that she may be upset with me for some reason.

I actually stopped looking at who views my posts as it would trigger feelings of anxiousness, but I was feeling a bit tired of not knowing who was viewing my posts. So, I had a look, which I kind of regret now.

Still I have a lot of things to work on. I can see myself splitting on people now, I now know better but my brain just wants to be mad at other people. Especially if I love them. 

It would be much easier in the moment to give into the anger but I'll never have fulfilling relationships if I do that. I ruined some really good relationships that way. I miss my ex's so much sometimes.

I gave up weed, drinking heavily and I'm working on cutting out online dating. Trying to eat healthier and include exercise into my routine. Unfortunately I've been binge eating again - I'll try to do better tomorrow. I'm low contact with my family now. It's all so much work. I'm so sad. 

All of this is so exhausting. If I wasn't so traumatized I would have been fixed by now but I have so much fucking baggage I have to crawl uphill for years. I'm so tired and I'm so lonely

Can someone please tell me this will pay off? That I'm not giving up all my comfort in the world for nothing?

Whenever it felt like he would leave or suddenly started ignoring me I wasn’t able to leave it and would call/text him non stop asking him to explain why and how. Or tbh, just as an excuse to talk to him. I did the same three days ago. He has expressed multiple times that he doesn’t like it when I do this but I have also communicated with him since the beginning that I just want him to communicate with me whenever something bothers him. If he’s busy or even when he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. Because I hate doubting myself and overthinking. He has never done this. But somehow makes me feel guilty when I overreact or get angry. And calls me crazy and insane. So he suddenly blocked me everywhere three days ago. And my first reaction is to call and text him, so that’s what I did. He picked up eventually and started cussing me out. Calling me crazy, ugly, a sl*t and many more things. I was crying on the phone asking him why he did that and he told me he’s sick of my behaviour and never wants to speak to me again. He even said he would come to my house and speak to my family.

And then he suddenly pulls back and leaves me in the cold. 

I know it’s not okay to bother someone after they blocked you or told you to leave them alone. My question is, is it really all my fault? I feel so guilty. I really want to get over him and forget about him.

Ignored my gut feeling for years and now destroyed my FP relationship. Seeking advice on how to move on.,1708688946.0,"TLDR: FP relationship is irreparably broken (by me), how to move on? 

⚠️ Long Text Post Warning ⚠️ 

My (23F) FP (24F) for a while now has been my (former) best friend. There was always a bit if mistrust and creeping doubt throughout the duration of the friendship, it had its flareups but we usually always sorted it out. We were friends for about 5 years total. 

Maybe a month ago now, I did something kinda stupid. Not really bad, but stupid for sure. My FP has a younger sister (22F) who is your textbook entitled SJW brat. 
I have had several terrible interactions with her and usually try and avoid any conversation about her with my FP. She would still give me the occasional update though. Most recently, it was  that she dropped out of her fifth university to pursue jewellery making at home. While on the surface, this doesn’t seem like anything crazy, I (personally) don’t find her jewelry making to be creative or viable enough to replace the high standard of education she was about to receive. 

I know that it is none of my business, but seeing my FP post and repost her jewellery with the most over the top complimentary comments made me roll my eyes in irritation, and eventually anger. I recognized that this was a weird reaction to have about something that had nothing to do with me, so I took a few screenshots of my FP’s repost and asked a mutual friend was what she felt about it. She semi agreed with me that it was stupid for the sister to drop out (yet again), but that I was being a hater for no reason and we left it at that.

A few days later, on a random FaceTime call, I was sharing my screen and my FP happened to see the screenshots of her posts in my gallery. She asked me what it was about and I was upfront and told her that I took the screenshots to ask our mutual friend about it because I personally thought it was a bad use of her time. She told me it was none of my business, I agreed, and said that’s why I never shared it with you or with the sister, and it was more for me to process why I was feeling that way. It was a short call we snapped at each other and hung up.

About a month and a half went by in relative silence after this (and this is weird for us because we have spoken nearly every day for the last year or so). I told her maybe three days ago, that she can process things her way but, that I was not going to wait around indefinitely for an answer (time management was a huge pain point in our friendship). She said will try and talk this week and that was it. 
I asked her the next day if she knows what the conversation is going to be about, i.e., if she is approaching the conversation to end or mend the relationship. 
She then blew up at me and said that was too much pressure and it was unfair of me to ask that from her, etc. etc. essentially avoiding the yes or no question. 
I reiterated multiple times that it is OK if she does not want to be friends, she just has to say that so I can process it as well before we have a face-to-face conversation. The conversation seemed cool down for a bit and she said “I’m going to take my time and consider what it is I want” (which I knew is code, for we’re not gonna be friends).

Maybe 45 minutes pass since the last group of texts and she sends me these nine huge walls of text, explaining how I am un-empathetic and unkind and uncaring, and that she has waited all these years to see me grow only very marginally, and it is not fair for her to keep waiting to see if I could be better.  

I saw these texts, three or four hours after they were sent, and in reality, I would have responded in an amicable way to end the friendship on good terms, but I saw that her sister had DM’d me maybe an hour after my FP had sent those nine walls of text, calling me names, and saying a bunch of dumb shit that was honestly more hilarious than anything else. 

Seeing those DMs from the sister, solidified the end of the friendship for me, and I sent a huge “FUCK YOU” message to my FP, describing all the things I disliked about her and didn’t believe her about during the years of our friendship. 
I ended it by saying “fuck you and lose my number”. 
She just responded back. “yikes thanks for clarifying. Take care.” 

I really thought I would be sobbing and gasping for air and be sent into a panic attack if something like this ever happened, because I always thought it was among my worst fears ever. But I had close to no reaction. I felt a strange sense of calm wash over me & I just blocked and removed her off of everything. 

I do regret sending that huge “fuck you” message at the end, but I think I purposely blew up the relationship on my way out because the resentment I had for all these years had bubbled over and I dont want even the vaguest option of going back to her to be present. 

I dont know if Im just in shock or what, but I’d like advice on how to properly move on with my life and leave this in my past. 
I have other really good friends as well that know what I am going through. Tbh this is the first major friendship Ive ever really lost. I still am friends with people from kindergarten and 2nd grade, so I know for a fact that I am not the uncaring monster she said I was. I am afraid she will drag some of our mutual friends into this and will truly isolate me. I don’t think she will, but only time will tell I guess.

We have lived together for almost a year, and I’ve adored every single bit of it.

End friendship bc my ex-bff didn't feel like she could be open to me because of my reactivity,1708398323.0,"I just had nearly 15 year long former best friend say she only wants to keep in touch via social media. 

I kept asking questions trying to understand the why and part of it came down to her feeling the friendship was one-sided (which I would give ANYTHING for her to have talked to me about before she made up her mind that she was done with the friendship). 

She spoke of not feeling close anymore. (Which seems crazy considering I just spent the money to come out to TX and spend a week with her and her fiancée last May. Trip ended on a good note everyone generally was happy. I even texted back and forth about TSwift with her fiancée for weeks after the trip. So cleaely I didn't make some sort of horrible impression) But like you had me stay in your home? But we aren't close?Seems like such a flip up. 

Anyways, I asked her about why she felt less close to me because she felt she couldn't confide in me becauae of my emotional stability (she is generally a Very emotionally stable person who had a very good supported structured childhood for reference). 

She replied as follows: ""I see how you react strongly to things, and it makes me feel on guard in the things I talk about with you. I have felt in the past like when I have different ways of seeing things from you, you have shut the conversation down, which makes me wary of being honest, but also doesn't feel fair to just listen and support your perspective. So when you talk about how our relationship seems like it would be superficial going forward, that is something that I have felt for a while already on my side.""

I'm devastated. I'm worried other people won't confide in me and will then resent me and end friendships with me because I can get flooded and be ""extremely passionate"" as my therapist puts it.... 😪💔💔


Her and I have been friends since 1st period German class in 7th grade. Even when she switched schools partway through high school my effort was enough for us to remain best friends until college. 

But I was really sick at the time everyone else went off to college and had to take time off which meant staying home with my abusive parents . Guys I thought turning 18 would protect me from their abuse but all it did was make them bolder. It was awful I ran away and stayed on the street for about 4 years off/on. Hannah was the only person who stayed my friend throughout that period everyone else was ""too busy"" or just couldn't take it. 

Now obviously my emotional regulation has been shit since then. And I obviously have PTSD and if I get triggered and flooded I have trouble staying in control (I'm also autistic so voice colume control is just an issue in general 😅)

I have come a long long way though since getting housing and especially since finding my current therapist 1.5 yrs ago who does EMDR. 

I feel like I wasn't given a fair chance because while the me of 5 years ago would split pretty often, me today generally has fotten pretty good at walking the middle path. I also was raised where disagreement always led to interjecting to shut down the other person. Plus one of my OCD themes is morality & political correctness so people saying things that don't line up with my brain's rules would create massive anxiety and I would feel the need to correct them. None of that obviously invalidates her emotions but I just feel like I wasn't given a chance to show my growth because she never raised the issue with me until I quesrioned her after she already made an immovable decision to basically all but cut contact. 

BPDers who have managed to have friends for long periods of time, how do you keep the give & take even and how do you make sure your friends feel safe xonfiding in you and having deep conversations??

Splitting with favourite person and intense emotions.,1708330088.0,"Hello to anyone reading this.
I was diagnosed with BPD and depression in 2021.
My dad passed away in 2013 and he was physically and verbally abusive to my mum but was very loving and caring towards me.
I was in a relationship with a guy who turned out to be physically and abusive to me as well so I had broken up and got into another relationship in 2022.
With this new guy, I felt much better mentally and started gaining weight. Everything was ok but I cheated on him after 18days of being in a relationship so I felt very guilty and bad about myself and confessed after 6 months to open up and be honest. It was once and I regretted and repented a lot and never did anything like that again.
But I found out that he cheated on me too after 3 months I confessed to him. He had a fake account too where he was sexting and complimenting girls anonymously.
Long story short, I forgave him and tried to move on with everything and accept whatever it is and stay happy with him because I really love him.

Things have been hard for me because I split a lot and I wish I was different, thought differently.
I live with a single mum and I have been trying my best to do well in my studies and so far my studies are going good but I am so tensed because of the things that have been happening in my life rn.
I miss my dad too cause I never spoke to him due to anxiety.
I regret a lot of things and wish things were different.

Its hard for me not to look for love from others and I don’t feel good when I feel like I am going to be abandoned.

Everything is so Faint,1708248095.0,"Lately, like for the past 3 months, my emotions have been very faint to me. Other than humor and boredom, everything else isn't as strong as it used to be. Like usually when something happens that usually triggers my bpd, I'd feel it strongly in my palms or chest, but now it's like i dont feel the emotion but i still have the thought process (Which I've been learned to ignore and process what happens to me in different ways.)   
For example, recently I've been having the thought process of like feeling unloved and bad, but i dont feel that emotion in my chest or palms, and more so is just thinking about it. My boyfriend was basically confessed too on valentines day (Something we've never really done) and instead of letting them know they have girlfriend, he says to me ""Im gonna play dumb""  
This triggered bpd induced dreams, where i literally dream hes cheating on me, its like haunting me. When I vented to them about it, it wasn't even coherent and they didnt really comfort me.   
I lost my mind in my head but I didn't feel anything at the time. I also went to a mitski concert recently, and realized that I can ONLY process my emotions if im listening to music (which is a semi recent thing), but I texted my boyfriend something heartfelt and they didn't even reply. They just said ""I"" and moved on. I know i should communicate some of these things but i fear its not even worth it, I just have to move on too.  
That on top of dealing with racists at my job, college anxiety and general world problems, I feel myself like becoming numb. I had like a coping mechanism which wasnt THAT healthy but it worked (it wasnt drugs) but nowadays im finding it boring, im finding games boring, and all I find myself wanting to do is eat and sleep. I think me feeling numb stems from my childhood to now honestly. I've never in my entire life experienced any kind of healthy relationship, whether friends or family, or romantic. My moms relationships in the past were horrible, and her trust issues grew onto me. My family is so broken its beyond even trying to repair, I mostly just wanna stay in touch with my sister and my mom. As a kid whenever bad shit would happen to me or in general I would force myself to not feel anything, like numb my emotions (it was proly based off something I saw online but it was always my go to) and I was always using escapism, like maladaptive daydreaming or hyperfixiating on books (the hyperfixiating was literally unhealthy too I would just not move)   
So now in present time, having to continue dealing with bullshit in different fonts, I kind of reverted back to some of my old habits unconciously. Like I can't daydream that much anymore, but I defintely numbed my emotions, cause everything just feels so faint. Granted it could be depression, but i usually feel that intense sadness or pain, which I don't really feel. It's definetly there but its not physically hurting me, I'm just thinking about it. Nowadays I've truly only found comfort in my sister, since we've been hanging out alot more and theyve been opening up to me more. But I can't hangout with my sister all the time, nor do i want to be reliant on her since im the older sister, and i want to be the one to help her instead.

Should I feel concerned or is this just a normal thing friends do? Should I bring up that it feels sort of weird to me?

Everything just ends up being the wrong decision, everything is just a spiral, one after the other. I have started understanding my emotions and dealing with everything better, for the moment.

Meeting new people is one of them. I always worry, even tho it’s under control my big feelings will push them away. I understand it’s never linear with healing and getting yourself right. But it’s to the point I start hyperventilating, shaking and damn near crying. There will be nothing negative about the interactions either.

How to regain my trust for fp?,1707571947.0,"My partner, who is also my FP, in the recent two days broke my trust by going behind my my back, they’ve not owned up to it and while I don’t blame them (as they also have mental issues and I know they will talk to me about it when they are ready) but It’s caused me to spiral a lot, split a lot more often and I can’t help but fairly obsessively check their socials and whatnot to make sure they are telling the truth, tho even with picture evidence i don’t know how well I believe them.

Is there anything I can do to help aid the process myself? What should I tell them that they should do?

"Dating Among BPD, The End....",1707527191.0,"[Prev Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/s/GH7IUvIApk)


So i started dating someone with BPD, me also being diagnosed with BPD.

How it started : we longed for each other, we understood each other. Felt like we were made for eachother.

How it was : her trauma dumping on me and being the therapist for her after she promising me she won't abandon me and this is gonna last. I did promise the same thing.

How it ended : i got latched on to her, she was my FP, she splitted, i begged her to stay, she just abandoned me......

The confrontation and the explanation of my emotions during the end: the tail end of explanation to a messy short lived love story.

----‐-------------

I couldn't understand that she was having a splitting episode, cuz i couldn't understand what was going on.... i loved her too much that i made her my FP, and when she split on me, it made me really miserable. I used to go in and out of panic attacks, some lasting for about hours to recover back and get back to working. Lasted till yesterday, untill i figured out what happened, and explored those emotions.

So what i feel like happened :  I had a traumatizing event when i went out for drunk, the friend i went with got bruises and concussions and was hospitalized, i was in shock, cuz i was the one who saw the whole thing and took him to the hospital. She wanted my attention even though i told her i was in shock, i gave it to her, supported her even though i was in shock, i wanted an distraction at the moment, i told her my traumatized event, she just moved away from the conversation. After a while she splitted on me saying i wasn't attentive enough. Did not know what was happening. I went with it. Tried being supportive didn't work. I begged her to stay and not abandon me, as i was fucking miserable. I tried to reconcile, cuz i accepted her as a FP, after a long time. Nah, she didn't want me anymore, i thought she would understand me and stuff, nah she just wanted to use me and make me feel like shit. To be noted, i was hesitant in the relationship. She is the one who convinced me to be in the relationship. My abandonment issues are at its max now.

So after everything i saw a post on my recommendation, where i saw someone splitting on thier loved ones, the fucking texts were literally the same. Damn i felt scammed.........

So after figuring out my emotions , and realising this was already over, i confronted her. She was still hostile towards me. When i told her she had splitted and alsked her to read upon some resources, she fucking told me, if she started reading upon BPD, she is gonna become more of a BPD person.

WTF!!!!!

Damn, that was the final red flag i needed, i actually thought she was working on herself and stuff, she then started accusing me of having BPD and how the hell would i be able to help her. This was a moment of enlightenment,  damn, i became so fucking happy and void of feelings for her, after being so miserable for a while. I did have a feeling that i was the one who pushed her away and i was the reason for abandonment, i kinda felt different after . Nah, she was the biggest redflag i had ever dated.

The happy part is this made me understand, the difference between the people who try to be better and the one's who use narcissism to deal with their issue.i have splitted with my partners, but not like this, never hurt them. If ur in this sub, its most likely that u r dealing with ur issues, and not being a narcissistic ass. This makes u a good person.

A relationship ended and I still feel she’s my FP.,1707406566.0,"Hey there! 

I recently quit my relationship for the reason of me being not able to handle both my borderline and my GF’s one. I used to be the ‘less sick’ one, and I had to keep myself together, but also her. 

I’ve been selfish and maybe I’ve been also naughty. But I couldn’t carry that emotional burden of two BPDs both on my neck. 

It used to be awful. 

Nonetheless, I am trying my best to keep on going and maintaining a good relationship with her, even if not a romantic one. I have been working on communication and acceptance, but it’s not easy. 

She is still my FP and I’m trying not to split on her. I don’t want to start to see her as the villan of my story. I’d like to be friends. Still, I’m definitely starting to split on her. Day by day, I’m getting convinced that she is not the sweet little angle I used to love, but a terrible person who’s manipulating and plot against me. I don’t want that.

Is the damage reversable,1707322711.0,"I spend most of my time alone. Literally. I either go to work (graveyard shift) and either go tanning or go home..I don't have any strong bonds with anyone in my family. *Not a mother or anything, can't have kids, but my born into family*

For a little backstory, my parents got divorced when I was 6 months old, and my mom is the one who raised me... My first 10 years my dad lived in the same state as me and did the whole every other weekend thing. I have one sister that shares both same mom and same dad with me, but from the age of 10 on, we were raised separately. Separate homes, separate parents, separate states.. there would be years between visits. My mom was one of those who also let it be known that she had a favorite (me). My whole upbringing I was told my dad was an alcoholic who beat her and that's why they got divorced and since I barely knew my dad I didn't know it to be any different. Not only was I kept away from them, but for some reason I never had a relationship with her side of the family either.. 

Over the last 4 or 5 years I have finally started to realize just how messed up my childhood was and how many lies I was told... My relationship with my mom has changed a lot because I used to almost let her control my life, mainly thru manipulation tactics. One example, in 2019 I went to visit my dad, sister, and 16 year old niece in North Dakota (first time I was going to see him since 2009 btw) and she did everything in her power to try and prevent this. All the way up until my plane was about to take off. She would send me texts saying that she had ""cancer""  and it was flaring up and she couldn't believe after she was there for me my entire life that I would betray her like this. One message even said something that said she don't know why I would even want to go see my sister anyway cuz I hated her, and she even sent her away when I was 10 because of it... She said she sent one child away because they didn't get a long? My sister is 6 years older than me and my babysitter most days, of course I didn't like her at the time. My mom made it very obvious that she didn't like her either which is wrong. She would talk bad about her a lot while I was growing up. Things such as how she is a lot of drama, or just likes to argue.. nothing too Too horrible. 

I was raised with one of those parents who thought that as long as I was fed, sheltered, clothed, and my NEEDS were taken care of then she was a good parent, but she was one of those that smoked a lot of weed and desperate to hide from her whole family so she spent almost all her time locked in her room... when I was in high school I had such severe depression that I was suicidal and even a cutter..when my mom found out, did I get therapy of any sort? No, I would instead be strip searched once a week to make sure I had no marks, and lost my bedroom door.. I was only allowed certain friends (she had to know their parents ontop of like the friend). Did I mention that I was living in the country, like on a farm type country, I showed cows and pigs in the 4-h fair country so couldnt sneak out if I wanted to. 

Worst thing I did in my high school years was smoke weed one time and smoked cigarettes after I was allowed to start working.. don't get me wrong my mother would never allow me to do either, so I had to hide it very well... I think work is what gave me and of the social skills I actually do have now as an adult... I was so isolated growing up that I am able to live for days inside my head if needed.. learned this when I was in that hole for a week when I was in jail..

I'm really wanting to have some form of relationship with family because I really do have none.... However over the last 4-5 years while I was on this truth path I did become very close with one of my uncles, on her side of the family, who helped me thru everything. He was the one I was able to share what happens in my life without me feeling like a burden...He passed away 1-16-24...I have one uncle I am close with kinda mainly cuz we do drugs together, other an that I really just have a bunch of strangers that I share dna with.. they all have their own families and lives going on and I just have me... So I know I value almost all relationships in my life more than the other parties usually..

Flash to current self and her is how life is and how my brain is... I am a 34 years old drug addict to both hard drugs and weed (still maintaining a full time job tho),  barely any friends but I almost prefer to be alone. I know if I was able to have children and make a family of my own things would be a lot different and I doubt I would value the toxic family relationship I do have.. I want a different life but don't know how to start or who to get to help me (communication verbally is one of my worst skills, I always word things wrong)

On top of that when they start telling me to do this and do that, its fine but when it's the other way, I am irritating them by repeating the same thing again and again. I miss them so much, its not like we see each other everyday and then I am still asking them to be on phone with me, parents, therapists, helplines, all are so damned useless. I am totally burned out. I cannot do this anymore. Its a hell, I see no way out of. I try my best to keep myself calm, focus on other things but every morning it's waking up heavy hearted.

So we started ghosting each other, she pushed me to the extreme end. I was head over heels after meeting her, enough to trigger my selfless personality. I did all i could to support her cuz i knew how hard it is. I tried.

A few days ago i had a traumatic experience and was shocked for almost two days, she wasn't ready to hear it out or anything, even though i mentioned it. Since she didn't want to hear it, i didn't talk much, but told her i needed time. She then called me saying she's having stomach cramps cuz of constipation. Stayed with her over call and calmed her and did everything i could, made sure she is ok. And took some time off from texting her, cuz i had to heal. She knew abt all of this. And i thought she understood.

The next day she called me and told me all this happened again, she had pain and stuff, i consoled her and told her I'm here and we will figure this out together. She went off at that. She started yelling at me, saying u can't be there for me, u just run away and so on. And told me just mind ur business and she knows how to solve her issues. I got triggered, and asked her when did i run away, and told her that i was in shock the other day, and i tried my best. Also told her if she can't tell me how i can be of help u can't expect me to help. She didn't tell me any of the further stuff, because i wasn't comstantly texting her.

She started going off and yelling that u can't blame for stuff, i don't like people blaming me and if u blame me again I'm gonna block you. Then she texted ur fucking with my mind. I couldn't process any of this and was completely shattered. I tried my best to overcome my issues to be selfless and texted her wtf are u doing with my mind. Don't know why i kept thinking of this situation, and it triggered me enough to try and stop feeling anything for her and hate her. But i still keep thinking about her. And its fucking with my mind.

How to cope with my friend not talking to me,1707070053.0,"I’m a 26/F and I recently went on holiday with a group of young women for my friend’s 27th birthday to Amsterdam. The trip was extremely hard for me as I really struggled to manage my BPD during the trip and I have PMDD and I was on my period during the trip. I struggled to manage my BPD as I felt really bored due to being the only non-smoker on the trip and all they wanted to do was smoke weed for the whole time and they weren’t interested in doing any tourist stuff.

The first day was extremely difficult as I took an edible and it led me to having panic attacks as I began to hallucinate and I felt disconnected from my surroundings. I was also hearing extremely scary stuff and I’ve never felt so afraid in my life. My friend whose birthday it was didn’t even ask if I was okay and was extremely uncaring. My friends told me the next day that she was actually on her phone ordering food, whilst I was having panic attacks. This happened the day before her birthday and one of our mutual friends stayed with me at the hotel, whilst the rest of those on the trip went to a pre-booked museum.

On the last day of the trip, which was the day after my friend’s birthday, myself and my friend got into a minor disagreement as the waiter overcharged me for my food at the restaurant and the waiter recommended that she transfers me the money as she still needed to pay for her food. She said she didn’t want to as she didn’t want to pay an extra £6 that was remaining on the bill (even though I paid over £300 to go to Amsterdam for her birthday). She was hesitating to send me the money and her friends started being cold to me and saying “she said she’s going to give you the money”. Her and her friends left the restaurant and I broke down crying and said to our mutual friends, who were with me, that I really want to go home.

I really didn’t want to go on the trip as mutual friends have travelled with her and it has damaged their relationship due to her character, but she booked the trip on her credit card without our consent and we had to pay her back for each of our trip. So, I felt like I had no choice, but to go. 

When we were travelling back, we spoke on the plane and she offered to shared a cab home with me, but I got a train to save money. I didn’t speak to her for a week as I needed time to recover from the trip and I had a flu. A week later, I asked if she wants to go to the gym and she said she was sleeping and didn’t see my message and said she might go the next day. The next day, I asked if she wants to go to the gym and called her. She didn’t respond to my message or call me back. I thought she was going through something unrelated to me, and I told our mutual friend and she said that my friend is upset with me because I was crying on her trip and they missed the museum because of when I was having panic attacks and because of the disagreement at the meal.

I felt annoyed as I found her very inconsiderate as she knows I have BPD and PMDD, but as we have mutual friends, I decided to message her to apologise about how I was on her birthday trip and I explained that I was struggling with my mental health during the trip. She said she’s out and will respond the next day, which she didn’t. So, I went to her house to talk to her, but she wasn’t in. The day after (yesterday) I went to her house again to talk, but she wasn’t in again. I messaged her this time and told her I went to her house to talk, but she wasn’t in and asked if she is free to talk today. It’s been almost 24 hours and she hasn’t responded. So, I decided to just leave it now, but I’m feeling really anxious as I HATE upsetting people as it makes me feel rejected and really anxious.

Finally found the perfect partner but....,1706935473.0,"So I'm in the what I can already tell is going to be the best relationship I've ever been in. We are both 27 years old, (gay) and we both have never connected with anyone else like this. He know about my bpd, is INCREDIBLY supportive, and we know we don't need ver want to leave each other. We have been doing the long distance thing, only separated by a 2ish hour drive from each other, and see each other every weekend because of our schedules. The distance has been teaching me patience, and has only made the times when we see each other more valuable to the both of us. For the first time in years, maybe even my life, I have found someone who pushes me to be my best self, and wants what's best for me. Let me reiterate: we have no interest in looking for anyone else, we both have found all of the puzzle pieces that we were both missing in our lives. And for me, I finally feel emotionally and mentally mature enough in my journey with BPD to feel this is what we want. 

I've been doing really good so far, no sabotage, no mood swings, and no arguments. Of course I expect these issues in time, as no relationship is perfect without fighting and misunderstanding. That's not exactly the problem. My anxiety is over the roof, because I started making changes in my life that were for the better (and those started before and after I met him) but they are good changws. I quit smoking nicotine, pot, been going to the gym, eating healthy, and fixing my finances. Really good changes have been made. And a lot of it is because we dream of a future together. I've never been with someone who has been this intensely supportive, it was the one thing I was missing in all previous relationships.

With that being said, I feel some of the old symptoms I felt like I've overcome creep again. I'm very clingy, and the distance can make that hard. Sometimes I don't hear back from him for a while (he works graves, and goes to school). I know he's not cheating, and to be honest that's not what stresses me, it's just that I don't hear from him like we first did in the relationship. The honeymoon phase is probably ending, so things aren't probably as climactic like they were in the beginning. I understand all this, yet I feel overwhelmed that I'm going ruin things because of my extreme anxiety, and over analyzation of the small things. I know he's not going anywhere, and I'm not going anywhere.

I guess what I'm asking for is some advice. Who else has hard times not always hearing back from their partner? Does anyone else have issues when you don't hear things back in the times you usually do? What do you guys do to cope or calm yourselves down from irrational thinking? It's seriously becoming the death of me, even when I know things are just fine and peachy, I can t help but overthink and miss him all the time.

Also, is this something that I can safely try to explain to him? He wants me to always feel comfortable talking to him about anything, and I feel I'd find some comfort on letting him know that I need lots of reassurance, but obviously I don't want to push him to hard or scare him. I really feel like I've found my forever partner, and I just want to take this the smart and safe way to a successful relationship.",BodybuilderLoose9437,,False,1ahnvwl,7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ahnvwl/finally_found_the_perfect_partner_but/

i was confused - i asked my friend if she too has disorganised mind, like thoughts might be non linear, shaped as other stuff, basically i have a mess in my head and thoughts only start to make sense when i am telling them, without preparation. she said no. 
I've researched and found out that BPD was morphed with Schizotypal PD some decades ago, they were intertwined, and some people with BPD  might or might not have symptoms of schizotypal. 
i guess my core problem is due to this. i am losing feelings. i still can rage, or argue, or feel hypomaniac, but its all flat. when i am not triggered i feel like i have no emotions at all. i lost ability to feel love, romantic feelings, i just don't feel anything even if the person i try it with is meeting all of my criteria for a cool bf.

But if they were negative or I had an issue or made a boundary he'd say "" Oh that's just you BPD buddy"" en brush off my concerns. Which I stated outright as each thing I had an issue with occurred.

So we started dating, and this is an emotional rollercoaster. She is kinda immature, eventhough she was diagnosed, she doesn't go for therapy. Most of our days are filled with issues and nights with immense longing and intense emotions. We almost fight and breakup in the morning and reconcile with like an super toxic couple. I try to help her with her issues, it doesn't work. I always have to be the mature person in the relationship and help her deal with the anxiety attacks of arguments and ghosting she fucking does. 

Its hard, but still fucking stimulating enough to make me focus on this more than anything else in this world. Its fucking with my brain and also for a first time making me feel like immensely loved by someone who understands me finally ( most of the time, we are still working on understanding emotions and dealing with it ).

Idk, if its gonna last, even if it's gonna develop into something beutiful or toxic. Still exploring that. Rgt now i just understood that this is a risk I'm willing to take. Also i don't know why, i seem to assosciate our relationship to the one in You season 2.

Im sick and tired of feeling every emotion at 2000% and especially during a BPD episode feeling so powerful & bulletproof, yet being terrified of myself but not having any sort of control or awareness of this till i reach my ""emotional comedown"" and then have to feel the shame, regret and self hatred over what i said or did  only for the other person who unfortunately was either the trigger or just was in wrong place and time to feel so damn hurt in my words and actions they want nothing to do with me going forward :-(   
  
Im starting to understand the 1 in 10 statistic of us suffers choosing to unalive ourselves - because eventually hurting those closest to us, eventually chips away at the last fragment of our very soul. I am lucky that my greatest fear is death, so personally im safe from that easy route out because if i could i would at this point - my last episode made me lash out hard against my best friend to the point they arent speaking to me currently - whether thats for good - who knows at this point.  
  
And yes before anyone asks - im currently in DBT and are up to the part where both opposites of things arent always left or right but rather they can exist at the same time.

Need someone to talk to,1706439534.0,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",Actual_Pepper8815,,False,1ad08fd,5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ad08fd/need_someone_to_talk_to/

My abandonment anxiety has been spiking LONG,1706407627.0,"Tw: SA
Also no kink shaming please. 


We’re two girls in a super loving relationship. It’s not been too long since we started dating — two years and few months — but after spending my twenties and thirties in one terrible relationship after another and trying to repair trauma through meaningless self destructive sex this is the most loved I’ve ever been. She respects and loves me a lot.


Sometimes it’s just hard to believe that. I was part of a kink lifestyle when we met and we went to a couple of meets because she was curious. And she loved them. More than I did. When we agreed to be exclusive we agreed on monogamy with the occasional threesome or event. 


I had a traumatic near fatal accident last year, and for whatever reason, she didn’t help me immediately. She was busy but she could’ve made the
trip and it would have been late.

After that I just, idk. I realized how much I want to be with just her and not have this brutal fear of abandonment and just have a more conventionally monogamous relationship, where it’s just us.

My years of polyamory were years of dissociation and memories I’d rather skip because I never felt loved or prioritized. The sex parties were..:I never had fun there. I was just recovering from SA and just wanted to be obliterated. My partner knows that now but she still wants to go these parties whether or not her going hurts me. 

And I know it’s like my own BPD but each time she talks about how damn hot someone in that kink space is and keeps talking about it in a tone she usually reserves for me, I just…feel like the most inadequate bitch on this planet. She knows that the whole scene just causes me terrible memories and it was a bad time of me basically prostituing myself to anyone I know. And like…I just wish she’d understand that instead of talking about how she’s now determined to go to the parties with or without me, no matter how I feel. 

I feel terrible about reneging on what I told her when we got together about still attending parties but like…I almost died. And that changes you. 

I’ve never been in a really loving relationship before and my girlfriend is so fucking awesome and she’s like my favorite person on this planet — she’s super smart, super kind, super loving, super caring, super beautiful; everything I’ve ever looked for in anyone. I’m grateful for her every day. But just sometimes when she talks about how hot someone is in a tone of 🥵🫦🍆💦 I…don’t feel prioritized and all these girls she talks about are vastly prettier than I am. She says this relationship is the most important thing to her but sometimes when she’s like “idc if you come to the party because I intend to go” I just feel  cold and empty. 

I know like me she’s allowed to change but I just…feel like it’s a matter of time before she decides she wants that lifestyle and hotter girls before me.

Mindfulness Meditation: Taking a few minutes to focus on your breath can help ground you in the present moment and reduce anxiety.
Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and emotions can provide a valuable outlet for self-expression and self-reflection.
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Techniques: DBT skills, such as emotion regulation and distress tolerance, can be powerful tools for managing intense emotions.
Engage in a Hobby: Find activities you enjoy that allow you to express yourself creatively or provide a sense of accomplishment.
Reach Out for Support: Connect with friends, family, or support groups who understand or are willing to learn about BPD. Sharing your feelings can be therapeutic.

I just don’t get it why people treat you like shit if you’re being nice to them,1705944470.0,"There’s a guy I’ve been talking to for a while now. What he does is just disrespectful and made me block him but after like 4 months we started talking again cause I missed him. 

What he does is that he can ignore me for weeks or stop replying in the middle of a conversation, or leave me on read - which pisses me off. 

I never did the same to him. I never doit to anyone because it’s just bad tone. 

But when I don’t reply to him right away he gets mad at me. 

In the past he would make “jokes” about “training me” or “punishing” me for not giving him enough attention just because I was on the phone with someone but he wanted to call me right then and there. 

I just don’t f* get it. How ridiculous is this?

This time he texted me at 2AM and got pissed off that I didn’t reply - ignored me for a week hitting me up with “hey baby” today. I asked him what I did wrong and he said “what are you talking about” then he said he was upset that I didn’t reply to him that day and that it was a week ago and he is beyond that. I told him once again that I was drunk it was 2AM I didn’t see his message and I went to bed soon after. I told him that I never ignored him yet he is the one that could disappear for weeks yet he gets pissed off if I don’t reply to him right away. Guess what he did? He left me on read once again and now I’m just furious. 
 
Another guy that I used to be very close with started doing the same thing to me just cause he got pissed off i didn’t wish him a happy birthday. He never did that before. And it pisses me off. He’s been doing it for months now. 

Why is it that when you treat people well they start treating you like trash?

Do I gotta start acting the same way just to be respected? What am I doing wrong? Why does everyone treat me like this? Am I too nice of a person?

I’m sorry if this post comes off as if I’m just putting my problems on all of you but really I just don’t know what to do and I’m actually really scared 

I feel as if I’m a bad person because of my mental illness, its like I can feel it getting worse and worse I’m very self aware of my thoughts and emotions but there so Intense.

Anger is like rage 
Sadness is like grief 
Joy is like being on cloud 9 

But all of that can just change in matters of seconds and it’s so scary, my gf the woman I know is the love of my life she’s so amazing and great she tries her best but why dose my heart and brain feel so betrayed and hurt like she’s gonna leave me or she’s cheating on me or just has the worst intentions ever I sometimes ask her if she’s gonna do these things and she says no with a very concerned tone. tbh I don’t know if I believe if she is or not she says she’s not and that she never will but…I don’t believe a word she says which isn’t good at all.


I’ve been manipulated and assaulted by friends and family and the memories of that are tattooed on me (metaphorically)as a constant reminder that they happened, I’m always negative even when I try to be positive it’s like I can never see the light of things always the dark. I can tell how someone is by the way they act and there body language, my gf also has bipolar and OCD and I’m a big help In Comforting her and giving her solutions to her compulsions and rapid thoughts or if she just has a bad day.  

But when I need comfort she kinda just stares at me and doesn’t say anything and I get so angry at that like I just wish she can just help me and make the feelings and intense emotional thoughts just go away. But that’s not her job and Ik she doesn’t have the power to do that she once told me I was kinda negative and it affects her because she’s so positive and upbeat and I’m not I’m just realistic and I think that’s valid. lately I haven’t been telling her how I feel or what’s been happening, I have a bad struggle with eating I used to weight about 298 when I graduated high school in 2022 I lost 100 pounds since then but because I would starve myself constantly I never actually put any work into it. I weight 220 3 weeks ago now I weigh 198 today she’s been noticing how sick I look and how exhausted I am but I tell her not to worry but she always dose, I don’t deserve her before I met her I was a nobody that didn’t care about themselves or others but when I met her I was so motivated to go to therapy and finally try to fight and try, she’s so smart and she’s gonna do great things but I feel as if I’m getting the way of that. I read about BPD And saw peoples that had partners with it and the things they said about them and the things the person did. I don’t wanna be like that and I don’t want to treat her like that either I would rather die.

I’m sorry if most of this doesn’t make sense I have a very hard time putting how I feel into words especially if I have to type it out 

Sometimes at night I’ll be in my room and just think about everything I’ve been through or whatever my thoughts are telling me in that moment, I sometimes wanna say them out loud to people idk ig cause I hate the fact that I’m the only that knows about it and want some comfort and understanding that sounds terrible when I say out loud, it’s really lonely and sometimes madding. I’m not violent I’ve never gotten into a fight or purposely wanted to hurt someone whenever me and my gf get into a fight I wanna talk about it and work it through, sometimes I slip up and am just a total asshole and my hypersexual tendencies make it so hard to just feel calm. sometimes she’s not in the mood and I just wanna touch or snuggle and she loves the attention from me but I can tell it can be too much and I just hate and feel so disgusted with myself I don’t wanna feel that and it’s made me hate sex and my body even more, I’m not In control and I wake up every morning into a panic attack it really hurts some mornings but ig take it day by day right.

Last relationship ended the same reason as all my failed relationships: me lashing out, devaluing them, centering the entire relationship around my emotions & not caring about theirs etc. I would say I’m quite self aware of my abusive & toxic behaviors, and I carry deep shame and self loathing for it. Yet I still re-enact the same dysfunctional dynamic over and over in different relationships with new people.

They have been the best 5 months of my life, he even saved me from my childhood home which was abusive and filled with trauma.

I need tips,1705378052.0,"So I (25f) have been with my partner for the past two years. I was upfront and honest about my mental illnesses (Obviously BPD being one) from the beginning and about the fact that I had been in therapy most of my life. I've done a lot of work to try to get to a point to where I could somewhat control my emotions, ourbursts, as well as maintaining a job, my hygiene, friendships, etc.


Things changed when a few things happened that really hurt the trust in our relationship. I'd not been in love with someone for a few years before him, and when I fell, obviously I fell hard. I was extremely secure before it happened. So when this trust was broken, I began a course of losing control daily.


I began doing the things. Constantly asking if he still loved me. If he was cheating on me. If he fancied other women. I started getting so deeply obsessed with trying to find connections that may or may not have been there. Some of it is still hazy to me. I started taking care of myself less and less. Snapping at him and immediately registering any shift in his mood as his declaration of calling it quits for us. Granted some things I ended up being right about, but they maybe they really were not THAT big of issues?


Anyways, obviously this has put a huge strain on our relationship. I want to give him credit where it's due and say he has tried here and there to reassure me, especially when things initially went down, and somewhat tried to rebuild that trust. But finally admitted how hard it is to want to rebuild that trust, and give that reassurance, when I myself am constantly overthinking and constantly needing reassurance multiple times a day, for days at a time. 


This post isn't to complain about him, or get an opinion on whether or not either of us are treating the other fairly. We have had multiple conversations with great communication confirming we both want to make things work in the end, so I am also not wanting people to decide whether we should stay together or not. I will not speak for him, but I will say I truly want to do at least everything I can as my part in making it work as I know how frustrating and exhausting it is to live with this inside my own mind, and can't imagine how frustrating and exhausting it must be for a partner.


Anyway, my main goal in writing this is to ask if anyone at all has any advice to help snap me out of when I am ""splitting"". How to get back to reasoning with myself before reacting. How to think critically, rather than overthink every word or action. I've been able to overcome my lack of personal hygiene and have gotten back into taking care of myself physically.

(BPD) TW Abuse mention,1705054020.0,"Hey guys, I’m reaching out in hopes that I could get another perspective from a third party.Brutal honesty is welcomed. I (26x/him) have had a few situations with my partner (27x) where I feel like I am unable to express my concern in the relationship without it creating issues. Rob (a fake name that I have created to protect my partners identity), has said that they are allowed to be moody and snippy towards me if they are having a bad day. I think that while they have the ability to express their emotions that the way that they express them towards me matters. I feel like I shouldn’t have to take the sass if I haven’t done anything to warrant it. They however, feel that they are not responsible for how I take their emotions and that they should be free to express whatever emotions that they want towards me with no reaction. I will say that I have handled these situations poorly.. I tend to not use I feel statements when I call this behavior out. It usually sounds like “Hey, you were snippy with me back there, have I don’t something?”. This is what I understand to be ‘accusatory speaking’. I guess what I’m asking is, what is acceptable then? If they are allowed to be snippy and sassy towards me (something that their friends and even a close mutual friend has said is completely normal), what is the correct way to go about this type of situation. I do have BPD, so frequently, I feel emotions rather intensely. That being said, when this originally happened, I walked away to self regulate. That action wasn’t taken lightly by them because they thought that I was upset and just stormed off. I constantly get told to just walk away when I need to think something through and when I do it’s never taken well. I guess what I’m asking is, am I abusive? This is what I’ve been told now because they think that I’m trying to control their emotions. I honestly just don’t want them to take their emotions out on me.. thoughts? I honestly just want to be able to work through these situations better.

Edit: I do understand that I can be toxic. It just feels like when I am trying to initiate actual conversation, it turns into a huge argument. I know that I don’t always say the right things and I myself can be extremely petty if the situation goes on for a while. I just feel like I’m never able to express when I’m bothered by something they may have done unintentionally.

I will preface this by saying that I am in no way trying to offend anyone in this group. I know I am not diagnosed, but I am almost 100% certain that this is what I'm living with. I haven't been to a doctor since I was a child - let alone a specialized one - besides involuntary suicide-watch nights at my local hospital and the occasional urgent care for the flu.

--‐-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not really sure how to come out and say this, but here I am. I believe I have BPD +ADHD. I hope you're not offended by my self-diagnosing. I can assure you that I am not saying these things because I *want* to have these personality disorders. I have lived without doctor interference for my entire life, but I can't continue to do that, so I started looking into my symptoms and what they might present. 

Upon extensive research, I display most of the symptoms in the DSM 5. At first I believed it might be CPTSd, but I more resemble BPD+ADHD. This has caused my relationships with employers, family, and friends to plummet. It has been severely impacting my life and I need help before it's too late. It's taken me a few years to seek help because I thought that it would buffer itself out - but it hasn't. 

I have had an extremely traumatic life, beginning as a child and ongoing to today.
I feel like it would be a huge burden to unload all of my trauma on somebody - and I don't want to re-live any of the trauma myself - so this has caused me to stay dormant and struggle by myself. 

I understand that I need to get an actual psychological evaluation and I am in no way trying to negate that fact. I know I am no professional. I am just stating what I believe is true so that I can find somebody qualified to help me. 

The best way to reach me is through E-mail or a scheduled phone call.

I just realized how my maniac episodes are nowadays when I thought i didn't have any for a long time,1704433772.0,"I've been diagnosed with BPD about 5 years ago and tbh the medication, therapy and working my self-control issues helped me get a lot better, but today I realized that every time I start talking about stupid or crazy things that I am aware that I am not going to do, but I portrait them to the people around me as if they were an actual possibility (like today when I was telling my brother how I could form a cult without a problem at 25) is that I am actually having a manic episode (like I went on and on for like 3 hours straight of how I would be able to form a fucking cult/my own nation, yeah super delulu ik) and on one hand I am afraid to tell my psychiatrist and worry him, making him medicate me even more (or worse, lock me) but on the other hand I'm relieved to know that my BPD manifests my manic episodes in this way instead of in a violent or really self-destructive way, I mean I know it's not right but it's better that it just me bluffing about doing crazy shit while being 100% aware that I'm not talking seriously than actually believing that as a reality or having any kind of reaction that hurts people or myself in any way. Although, what satisfies my ""craving for chaos"" is making people think that I am dead serious, I am aware that it is actually a joke, but it amuses me to see the reaction of the others. Is it wrong? Should I talk to my psychiatrist, even if I'm afraid of the consequences this may cause? If I'm not doing real harm to anyone, maybe there's no need to talk about it. Like, on one side I want to tell people that I don't really think like that and that it's just my way of coping so they don't worry but that would take away the whole point of it/ what's satisfying this internal urgency that I have and in the other side, perhaps by not having this coping mechanism I may develop another one that is really harmful/problematic/self-destructive. But at the same time I don't want them to worry but that reaction is what makes this coping mechanism work and cover whatever it has to cover, so that it fulfills its function. 

Like i want to talk about it with someone but I'm afraid that this will change the way they perceive me (in case it's a friend)/ it will no longer generate that reaction that ""entertains"" my need for chaos (in case it's my brother or family)/ leads me to have a more severe diagnosis or one that generates consequences when trying to fix something that, in the end, doesn't harm anyone (if I tell my psychiatrist) or generates a new coping mechanism that does lead me to do something bad to satisfy my need for ""adrenaline"" (in case my psychiatrist cures this one somehow).

I don't like ""living in peace"", I don't know how to do it, it bores me, and for now this is the healthiest way I can maintain a normal life and not do something stupid just to feel some rush.

Should I keep it to myself or talk about it with someone?

Letting Go of an ex,1704368455.0,"The past month I have been battling with my heart and brain. My ex and I whom been living together since we broke up back in October. Well two weeks ago I kicked her out finally, one for a peace of mind while I deal with the loss of a parent. Two because in order for me to focus on myself and if I want to fix what she had broken. I needed to focus on that by myself not with her there.  
  
Well the past week she has been more distant than normal. I am building myself up for her to move on. Side note I have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) which is a struggle all in itself because I can't seem to let go of the ex, no matter how unhealthy the relationship with her is.  
  
Backstory she cheated on me a week before our anniversary, add she emotionally cheated on me several times throughout our relationship. Now that I am trying to let all the past BS go I can't. Which is a good thing.  
  
Back on track here; I may have no right to be jealous or upset because she is moving on. However she claims she wants to fix this. Yet I seen a text she received being asked by the girl she has been staying with the past two weeks about the ""bdsm"" Ropes I have. So I asked her earlier in the day when she came over to hang out about if she had slept with this girl. She stated ""No but it is getting close to that."" this was before I seen that text.  
  
Now again we talked about what the future may hold. I have no solid answers, I told her if she really wants us to work she needs to show effort. No more ghosting, try and communicate, no more dishonesty. Now I feel that whole conversation was a lie to avoid not having a place to live. She kept bringing up when can I move back in or come back? I told her I was not ready to let that happen, it will lead to fights, and resentments.  
  
I am just trying to figure out the best way to approach this situation on just coming to terms she will never change and tell her I can not let her back in. Regardless of how much it hurts to lose a friend, and also knowing this may leave her in a homeless state. I just can't live with myself knowing she is lying to me, and still has this side piece the whole time we were to be working on fixing this relationship. She is one using this girl, and has used me. It is not right.  
  
She also likes to remind me she was there with me when I had to deal with my mom passing two weeks ago. Which in a way yes she was. However she still had that girl at MY home while I was out of state with my dying mother, she had that girl in MY bed. Yes she was on phone with me when I needed that support, she was the one I would go cry to when I found out about my mother... that was because I felt safe around her. I know this thread is like an A.D.H.D rant. However I am just stuck on what I should do.... Should I talk with her about all the issues I have that she is doing? Try and fix this?  
  
Or should I just accept that she is toxic for me and move on with my life allowing this person to be completely gone out of my life... which is very difficult for me to do with my BPD and already feeling such loss in my life at this time.",Shaybgay,,False,18yb6b5,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/18yb6b5/letting_go_of_an_ex/

Disclaimer: Long Post <3,1704221673.0,"⚠️PSA:⚠️
There’s no such thing as being behind in life or being behind in society…the only things along those lines that are real are social constructs, societal bias and comformity, generational trauma, closed-mindedness, desperation for validation from other people, the illusion of superiority in the form of unnecessary, unwanted, and unasked for judgement, the fear the government specifically designs to control the people to get more money and power, peer pressure, and unhealthy perfectionism. Don’t be a sheep, allow yourself to be a unique, beautifully imperfect human…life has no set schedule or manual, so stop comparing yourself to others. Don’t be afraid to be different or go against the societal/social norm. Learn to be okay with being controversial, and unlearn society’s unrealistic standards. You’re uniquely you. It’s not your job to keep everyone else happy. However it is your job to keep your peace and to do what’s best for your life, your plans, and your mental health…even if it upsets people. You’re worth it. Stop caring about what other people think of you and other people’s opinions…they’re just that, opinions. It’s time to stop fearing other people, they’re only human, just like you, with their own flaws and challenges and personal hells to go through. If something doesn’t affect you, just shut up about it and don’t butt into other people’s business. It’s not your life, it’s theirs, and you’re not them. And to incorrectly assume you know exactly what someone might be going through or what it’ll take to cut them into one of society’s boring, sheep, conformist cookies, is just so wrong and sad and pathetic on so many levels. Again, you’re not them, you’re not in their mind, you’re not in their situation, so shut up about things you know nothing about, doesn’t matter if they’re friends or family. It’ll just make things worse if you judge and assume. And things you say literally have the ability to stick with people and rewire their brains and change their brain chemistry, so don’t be the reason people start thinking that they’re not enough or even the reason they start considering unaliving themself. Be the opposite. Perfection doesn’t and will never exist, no matter what society says. Fuck society and their unrealistic, engineered standards. Don’t add to society’s toxicity, half of them don’t deserve the time of day. Your imperfections are beautiful. Additonally, always try to spread love, positivity, understanding, unconditional support, and empathy wherever and whenever you can, you never know what someone else might be going through and you could even be the person to restore their faith in humanity 💖

I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself too, even for the baby steps. Some progress is better than no progress at all, ignore the haters and don’t let them put you back to square one…and don’t let them make you even think that you’re back at square one when they’re not you and don’t have your mind or your experiences, it’s not their life, and they have no right to judge your progress, especially when I know half of your progress most people are too blind to see…I see your progress, and you’re doing absolutely amazing 😊

BPD w/ SUD,1704106415.0,"1. I was diagnosed with BPD back in 2021 at the age of 32.
2. Tried to join a 52 week program on dialectical behavior therapy. The program was twice a week once for group & once for individual therapy. However, you had to be accepted into the program and at that time due to substance abuse, they felt the money spent (self pay) and active SUD I would not be a good candidate for their program. 
3. After that I found myself thinking well if I can’t even makes it into DBP then how the heck will their be any improvements. So fuck it! 
4. I have found been self isolating since given the news and not really put much into place with the expedition of medication management and meet with my psychiatrist once a month. 
5. I have not found self isolating to be such a bad thing till recently. Also, at the time mid Covid pandemic, and I submerged myself into continuing to grow my real estate brokerage. Business has been great! However, self love self care and therapy went to the back burner. In the meantime SUD has progressed. 
6. I am looking for a treatment center that has a detox and residential program that offers more of a deep dive into DBT but also allows for an hour or so each day before or after group to use my phone and computer. Dropping off the face of the earth when you are a small business owner is nearly impossible. Who is going to pay for the health insurance to stay in treatment? Often times the treatment is out of network or self pay so money needs to still come in. I have employees that are counting on me and their families.

My apartment is disgusting and I don’t know where to start,1704060699.0,"This is literally my first post on Reddit because I don’t know where to turn. I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago and I didn’t even know what it was until I got the diagnosis and it does make a lot of sense. Ive been in therapy a lot and gotten psychiatric care as well. 

I’ve always been a pretty messy person. Not in a disgusting way or unsanitary but recently it’s gotten bad. I had kept my studio somewhat decent until my now ex girlfriend and I broke up two weeks ago and I’ve spiraled ever since. With the holidays, my mental health goes in the trash and my apartment was starting to get messy but I just let it build because I couldn’t muster up the energy to clean it. I worked and if I wasn’t working, I was sleeping or binge drinking. Now, I have fruit flies all over the place and it was kind of my wake up call to start cleaning. I have dominos boxes everywhere, McDonald’s bags, clothes and I haven’t done dishes in over two months. Random trash and there’s barely places to walk. I know it’s disgusting and I really want to change things for myself. I know the task is going to be daunting and I have no idea where to start. Even doing dishes takes me awhile because my sink doesn’t have a disposal and I don’t have a dishwasher. So I guess I’m looking for tips on how to get all this done. 

How do I get rid of fruit flies besides obviously throwing away everything attracting them? Do they go away on their own, are traps enough after the house is clean, or do I need a professional? What’s a good way to build a healthy habit of actually keeping the place clean? It’s so bad that I don’t even have people over because of how embarrassed I am. I think the fruit flies have probably been here for two weeks and I’ve been drinking to get through the days and haven’t paid much attention to them, but I’ve been getting sober and more aware of the state I’m living in and desperate to change things. I also cannot afford professional cleaning, they quoted me $480 after a phone call.

What to do when you've lost a support group?,1703864567.0,"Bit of a brief post here, on an alt, I hope that's okay.

Recently lost a few partners (polyamorous) and an entire, mutual friendgroup to a really hard month - I'm not going to mince words, I was really unpleasant and paranoid during said month and we had anxious, hours-long discussions about every little change. At the time I thought I was just exercising good communication, but now I realize I was simply exhausting everyone around me ...  


Most of them are gone. Most are NC. I feel like I don't have a safe space to go back to anymore and it's making the thought of continuing on with therapy, my workbooks, and everything else a lot harder than it used to be. I really felt like I was getting somewhere until I destroyed everything ...  


So my question is, what do I do when I really don't have anywhere to go? I have a few friends I can talk to sporadically, but as far as having a 'safe' place to fall back to goes, I'm completely on my own right now. I really need to find a new place to feel comfortable, but I don't want to do it in such a way that just repeats the mistakes of the past.

People are so awful and mean,1703867035.0,"Yesterday I was at r/BPD and I saw a post about a teenage girl around 16 telling how she had a major self harming problem for 3 years and to fill the void of neglect she had started to go as far as cutting herself in front of her mother to feel seen. 

When that happened, the girl’s parent just cursed her out, took a blanket and covered herself to go to sleep while her daughter was cutting her own leg a few feet away. Apparently previously her mom had displayed no sympathy towards her for even needing stitches for self harm or care towards any of her self harm.  

Now this girl was asking “what should she do” in terms of making her mother care for her. Nearly the top comments were all filled with people bashing her for being “manipulative and an abusive teenager” and that her mother is probably sick of her guilt tripping antics that’s why she didn’t care whether she cuts herself or not. Saying that she was entitled etc. “It’s your fault for bringing this misery upon yourself.”

I felt so heartbroken because a child going as far as cutting in front of parent isn’t a “manipulative cunning technique.” This isn’t a situation where your abusive narcissistic ex cuts themselves in front of you to make you to stay. This is a child cutting themselves for a parent. This kind of situation usually occurs in heavily disfunctional families. It reminds me of that one proverb, “a child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel it’s warmth.” I’m not defending that behavior but I was shocked by the lack of sympathy from the comments for a child.",Fickle_Plan5419,,False,18tqww6,15,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/18tqww6/people_are_so_awful_and_mean/

I cancelled new years eve plans and my gf is still going - I'm sad and mad,1703850596.0,"I always hated new years eve, I always spent it alone because I had no friends or on the few occasions I did I cancelled last minute, idk why. I have been with my gf for 2 years and I have spent the last 2 new years eve with her and her friends, and we were supposed to be spending this one as well toghether. 
As soon as New Year's eve was mentioned, I told her that I was really hoping to not go away and celebrate it in our city, but her friends (which I spent also a lot of one on one time with) said that they were thinking about going to the lake house, which is quite far away to get to by train. I mumbled and truly didn't want to go and I asked my gf if we could even hint at staying in genoa, She said it was already all decided and so I didn't even get to express the fact that it was going to be difficult for me be there. So I just followed along the plans, which ultimately became too much for the same exact reason that I told her in the beginning: I have wayyy too many exams and I am stressed because it implies going away for many days rather than spending just one night. So I told her I couldn't go anymore and we initially left it all there, she truly apologised and asked if she could try to talk her friends into doing it here, but ultimalty I said it was already too late, she should have thought of that way earlier, as we had been talking about new years eve for more than a month. I wasn't too angry at first, I was much rather disappointed that she still wanted to go even though I do understand that it is probably her last New years eve with her friends since they are all graduating med school and going different pathways, still I felt like the main priority for her was to spend it with her friends rather than me when presented with the need to spend it with one or the other. This really upset me as I feel like I have been hurt twice - first of all by her not saying anything to her friends when I mentioned it would have been a problem for me still I passively agreed because as soon as I feel someone shutting me down, I am not going to ask again ( I truly don't think she did it maliciously she never asks her friends for anything even if she needs something and I do believe she didn't want to cause any problems), and by her going even though I have decided I can't anymore and I blame it on her since she didn't say anything, that might not have changed the original plan, but could have least let me be honest about my struggle rather than swiping it down the rug. We have been fighting a lot, I am so mad, I am trying not to insult her anymore since the last year it was a fucking mess as she was studying abroad, and this discussion reminded her so much of all the discussions we had while she was away( she wanted do to something i made her feel guilty for not making me enough of a priority and it ended up being a nightmare for her, since she cut off contact with all her friends to try and salvage our relationship, and even though i regret it so much, this doesnt seem to help me change or act better, the only thing that's changed is that i dont verbally abuse her anymore calling all sort of disgusting names.
I don't know what to do or how to cope these days. I feel as I always do this thing where when we have a sort of big plan which involves going on holiday/moving from our city, I tend to not want to go, as a sort of provocation? To test her to see if she would chouse me? Obviously she always fails because people cannot be tested on these things, still my rational brain and emotional brain seem to be 2 separate entities and there is no mediation that lasts long enough for us to stay peaceful. She is now saying she isn't gonna go if we don't find a way to even discuss this in person because she won't go if going away means starting the new year angry and resentful.

Will I never be good enough for someone to love me for the way I am?,1703822713.0,"I got involved with a guy before I came to know he had a girlfriend and they are in long distance relationship and they are planning to even get married. First he said, he doesn't talk to her or spend time with her, then it became that they talk sometimes and 2 days ago it became that they talk regularly. He needs me when he wants to f u c k around, when he wants to vent. When I call he is in a hurry most of the time, to keep the call but if he has some issues I have to sit through and listen and if I try to say something I want to say, he cuts in between and won't allow me to say or will simply ask me to shut up. Yesterday his girlfriend came back to hometown , I have no idea how their relationship will progress, I feel like completely useless piece of trash. Yesterday he said he wants to start working and become independent so that he can settle down with his girlfriend. I don't know what to even think, I feel so numb inside, I don't know if I am sad or in shock, it's hurting but not a single drop of tear. I thought he cared, I thought I mattered, now it's like everything was inside my head all this time. With much difficulty my s uicidal and self harm urges were under control for the last 1-1.5 weeks, now I am back on it. The urge to harm myself is skyrocketing. I cannot believe that for the last 3 months I loved, I cared, I devoted my time and affection, I put my trust  in someone, only to be moved aside one day, when their girlfriend came back, I was just something to fill the empty space while their girlfriend was far for the time being.

"Lack off effort for me, but everyone else gets it. Makes me feel worthless.",1703780447.0,"Hi all, im in a bit of a downward spiral atm and theres no1 i can talk to about it. Had a minor tiff with my partner and its sent me spiralling about unrelated stuff. Its things that have been bothering me but i could brush it off, until today. The thing with my partner is, hes still doing some of the same things that made me want to end the relationship. He chilled and was nice for about 5 days (5 days ago i ended it but he thinks we can sort it, yet did a watered down version of the same thing today). 1st spiral was, i slept with him 2 days ago, i feel like i was tricked in order to give him sex so it feels a bit rapey to me. Thats got me goin, but this other one feels worse and its breaking me. Its gonna sound silly to some of you, but im really torn up about this so please dont be nasty to me about it. So for xmas, my 10 year old (hes very mature, more like 14) ordered some stuff online for himself from temu. Used his own bday money, just little gamer trinkets and some one piece anime stuff. He saw something for my partner and bought it for xmas. Some south park figures, my partner loves south park. I waited until december and reminded my son several times that nobody else has anything from him and he should look for somethijg for the people in his life that care enough to get him things (he had £400 of bday money left, given to him by the people im referring too. The gift he bought my oartner was £3 and everyone else would appreciate something, despite how cheap) he still didnt do it, so i had too. Ive just lost my job and need to not be spending money that wasnt necessary. All these people had gifts off me, but now i had to buy them a little something off my son aswell. In total it came to about £9. The gift for myself literally being only 90p, that i chose myself amd my son was even surprised when i opened it on xmas and thanked him. Now before you all say thats a big responsibility for a child....he bought the first gift. He showed effort and thought for his step dad. I think if hes gonna show effort it should be for everyone, or no1. I felt like i wasnt importsnt enough, or thought about or worth the effort and its been bothering me for weeks. My mum.and step dad have no idea that their gifts were really for me. My step dad in particular got loads for xmas but said his gift from my son is by far the best and his fav. My partner LOVED his gift off my son. But seeing as i bought mine myself (along with others) i feel hurt that he bought for my partner and didnt bother at all for me. I do everything for him, if i dont cook, he doesnt eat. I stop whatever im doing if he wants to hang out with me, my partner says 'im finishing this 1st then il play with you' (something that takes hours). Yet he gets effort and i dont? Why am i not worth it? Why am i not thought of? I did ask my son why he only bought my partner a gift and nobody else, he lied to me and said he couldnt find anything, i know for a fact he didnt even bother looking because i see his internet history and he doesnt know how to erase that. Plus, im the easiest person to buy for as im collecting about 7 different genres of things and theyre all cheap as hell, ive bought things for those off temu myself (one was the 90p thing i bought myself) 
I cant help but wonder why the shittest person in the house gets effort and i dont. (My partner xan be shit. He invalidates things people are upset about because he doesnt think they should be upset about them, he gets snappy on random days. Throws a hissy fit if people dont wanna hang out with him, but when people do he says 'wait til ive done this, which could take 2 hours' etc. ) i dont think this is about my son trying to win my partner over coz tbh my partner loves my son more than he loves me. Everyone knows it (im not complaining). My son even made home made sweet treats for his school friends.....but he couldnt buy me a 90p gift himself? I feel so unimportant.

As an example, our first session: At the end of the meeting, she said that she usually closes with a hug but I don’t have to if it crosses my boundaries. Well I told her I love hugs and so we did. My mental health has slowly been on the decline as of late and I’ve been splitting a lot on my boyfriend. I’m really in need of support and have therapy every Tuesday at 3pm. Well these past couple sessions, while we normally meet in person, she’s told me she’s had to travel for meetings, so we will have to do telehealth, which is okay and I’m willing to do that. She just sent me an email, granted it’s enough time for me to shift around my plans, to let me know that she isn’t going to be able to make our meeting but we can reschedule for later on in the week or for three weeks out, because she had to change her travel plans. Then she summated by saying “I wasn’t sure about my decision but I’m so glad I made it.” I’m not sure why but that sounded incredibly selfish to me and made me really upset. I did not have a good holiday, I had a long day of dysregulation, splitting and sleeping to cope with deeply embedded feelings from complex ptsd.

Me and my ex dated about 3 months back in 2022. We’ve been sleeping together this entire year and I’m honestly still in love with him.

He called me last night and we stayed on the phone til around 3am. I only answered cus I was excited and thought he wanted to see me. Especially since we just had sex the other day.

Well it was the exact opposite. He called me to tell me since we saw each other so much this year he doesn’t want to do that next year. Basically that after the new year comes he doesn’t want to see me for a few months and every time we see each other wait a few months again.

It’s embarrassing but this entire time I’ve been holding on to some small piece of hope that maybe he’d realize we’re soulmates and something would come of it. But I was wrong.

I don’t understand how I’m so in love with someone that doesn’t love me. He’s told me several times that he never was in love with me. Just that he cares for me and “has love for me”

I told him I want to work on myself with someone by my side to love and support me throughout the process. He told me that it’s selfish to “dump all my problems onto somebody” which is not at all what I would ever want to do to someone. I thought the point of a relationship was to love each other unconditionally. All I ever want from a partner is to support me and be there for me and tell me they love me and I’m beautiful and it’s okay because I have them. I don’t see why that’s too much to ask. 

He told me we can’t keep having sex because it messes with my emotions and I don’t deserve that. And he wouldn’t stop saying how I need to find some new guy and how I should ask my friends to find me some new guy. How fucking embarrassing is that?? The person you’re in love with and want to be with telling you to go find someone else.

The phone call ended because he said I should be happy I have my own apartment. How am I supposed to be happy that I’m going in to debt over bills I can barely afford for no reason. My friends hardly never come visit. He’s the only person that ever spent the night. I’ve never had a party or a kickback here. And I hate being alone. The whole reason I moved out was to do those things because I couldn’t do that at my family’s house. Here I am paying bills to sit home alone when I could’ve done that for free at my family’s house. I made a joke saying at least i’d have a roommate at the homeless shelter and he got mad and hung up.

He even told me that the experience with me makes him not want to date at all anymore. And that hurt pretty badly.

I relapsed in self harming after we got off the phone last night. I feel ashamed of myself. There’s so much more we discussed but I’m too depressed to put it into words right now.

I don’t understand what’s so wrong with me nobody ever wants to take the time to repair the relationship and work on it TOGETHER. They would rather just dump me and leave me miserable without a care in the world.

Setting boundaries and not fucking everyone or anyone,1703284925.0,"Im a female and in the past year have set hard boundaries on having sex with people.
-wear a condom, I am not on birth control.
-when was your last STD test?
-are you currently sleeping with other people or would someone else be upset if you were here right now?

During my 20's and beginning of my 30's, I have fucked anyone that gave me attention or I thought that that is what I needed to do to get someone to love me and to stay in my life.

Now, I just fuck myself more rather than sleeping with people, because I don't trust them, people are fleeting and more often than not will just leave you after they got/took what they wanted from you.

Oh bless my abandoned heart. 

Recently, I have decided that when I talk with or start to hang out with gentleman callers, I tell them to not assume anything and don't have any expectations about sleeping together. Don't even except me to suck your dick or even let them go down on me.
I just want nothing to do with it. 

Why is it so hard for people to understand that I am setting these boundaries for myself because I am trying to love myself.. for once. 
I don't understand why I feel like the bad person or like a fucking prude when I tell them, hey yeah, we can hangout, but don't think this is gonna be a Netflix and chill situation or that we are going to hook up. Their faces just look shocked and appalled at the fact that I am setting boundaries and don't want to have sex with someone who is only temporary.

Am I wrong for wanting to not be like everyone else and to not fuck someone who I barely know?
Am I wrong for once in my life setting boundaries and choosing to just not sleep with people or even entertain the idea of someone because I am so done with being left alone.. so done with people who just want to fuck and want nothing more.. like I am just some box to check..fuck that. 

I just feel that my BPD has been unchecked and have held no boundaries for myself my entire life in regards to my body and my autonomy.  Why do I feel like a social pariah for choosing to get to know someone before I sleep with them? 

My abandonment attachment issues are clearly me trying to protect myself, but also sometimes I feel like I am just pushing myself away from any real possibility of a healthy relationship or I am just giving in, once again because I don't want to be alone and do I even fucking like the person?

Hello, 
I guess I need to vent because I know I messed up and I don’t really know what to do. I don’t know how to leave toxic situations and honestly I believe I bring them on myself or deserve them. 

Backstory: 
I have been married for 6 years, my husband has a pornography addiction and pays for OF and Snapchat behind my back, he’s very secretive and has made attempts to meet with these women, I believe he may have followed through. 
Through this time I’ve participated in my share of sexting and inappropriate behaviors.

Story: 
I have hit a depressive episode, unfortunately for the reasons above, it may be obvious why my husband isn’t my FP. I have recently gotten in touch with a childhood friend and we decided to meet up. Meeting up lead to sex. I am a bit disgusted with myself because I don’t feel guilty about what I did with my husband, I’ve convinced myself that since he is so addicted to other women, this is the kind of relationship he wants but he doesn’t want me to behave the same way. It’s very one sided (please take note, I do not know how to civilly walk away and children are involved) 

I’ve noticed a change in FP’s demeanor and I think it ruined our friendship entirely. He says all is well and he enjoyed it, but the way he’s acting says otherwise. I told him I don’t think that’s something that should EVER happen again, quite possibly even in the event we were both single because that’s how bad this distance is bothering me because I know this was a huge mistake.",_Birdie_97,,False,18oj8i1,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/18oj8i1/favorite_person/

A year and a half ago I moved to another base to be an instructor so I have been home for longer than I have ever been during my entire marriage. It’s now completely falling apart and heading to divorce very soon if it doesn’t get fixed and fixed fast. If I’m being honest I don’t think it can be fixed.

So I started off thinking I was a narcissist which sparked me to go to a professional to fix myself. Turns out I’m not a narcissist. But she said I’m a anxious avoidant. So that lead me down a path of my therapist trying to get me to improve my self esteem. My wife on the other hand has narcissistic tendencies and will not hear me out and consistently I am the one apologizing for my feelings. At which point I get cold and then she is upset that I’m cold so I fake affection and care and force myself to be a “good husband” completely disregarding my needs and boundaries which makes it worse until a big blowup where she half assed comforts me and I know she isn’t going to abandon me. All of the major figures in my childhood chose someone over me mom dad brother sister. 

In this search for a solution so I can regain control I have opened up some very upsetting things about myself. I have realized I have given every person I have ever met a fake me so if they were to discard me it wouldn’t be the real me and I would be able to live with that. 

I am now realizing the source of my feelings of worthlessness come from my life of people pleasing to avoid abandonment (true abandonment) and I’m now sitting realizing I have been manipulating and lying to my wife for ten years had two kids hurt them by not ending the relationship and pleasing her by having kids. Which is now reinforcing my feelings of worthlessness because I can’t hide behind the “good guy” facade and it turns out the people that did leave was because I’m worthless and I actually am. 

I’ve been manipulating this woman and lying to her for ten years and even had kids to please her and I don’t know how to live with that or myself.

I used to have substance abuse problems now I cope with healthier looking things (the gym) but I have even abused that to the point of injuring myself and I’m starting to desperately seek external validation and on the brink of relapse into my old habits of self destruction.

Im in more emotional pain than I have ever felt and am fighting back bursts of tears at the slightest reminder of the real me which is actually worthless and should be abandoned

I regret opening up,1703031457.0,"This is a long one sorry i just felt i had to explain everything and give full context.

To start off, ive been very open with my work (bosses and colleagues) that i do have mental health issues the main issue being bpd. 
However, at work ive always seemed to act fine as i mirror happier peoples emotions to appear more approachable as i work in the health sector with patients.
My issue started 4 days ago on Saturday night, my works Christmas party. Weeks if not months before hand 7 of us agreed to meet at work before we headed out as we was closed for the weekend as it would be cheaper fo us to share the cost of a mini bus than to all buy taxis individually, and all agreed to meet at 5.
 Whilst getting ready 2 pulled out, 1 saying she wasnt coming to the entire event  1 decided she wanted to meet us there. Then, minutes later 2 more said they was going to be extremely late and may or may not meet us there  leaving me and 2 others to meet at work. Which was fine the 3 of us ordered food and had 1 drink while hyping ourselves us to meet up with the 2 other practices my bosses own for the joint Christmas party. 7 pm rolls around and the 2 extremely late colleages turn up and we all head out 30 minutes to our destination. 
The 5 of us walk in, our bosses their wives and the other practices staff was already there who we all where very unfamiliar with. Most of us instantly got weird vibes from them and we tried not to let this ruin out night. 
After a few pre drinks at this bar, we all head across the road for our meal and evening entertainment. We sat down at our table and all most instantly, i felt a complete shift in my mood and i was almost instantly in a state of paranoia and anger.
Over the course of the meal 2 of my closes work friends (the ones who met me at work) knew something was wrong and pulled me aside multiple times but i couldn't explain how i was feeling as at the time i didnt quite understand. After trying to have this conversation for atleast 30 minutes we head back to our table have a drink and try and mingle with some of our other work colleges from other pratices. During this, a women from my pratice asked me a questions (which i cant disclose as its even longer than this to explain) and that sent me into deeper paranoia and anger and im having to try hold face the entire night. I leave about an hour after.
The next 2 day i still in this ""episode"" and now having awful panic attacks but wrap my head around what it was that i was feeling. 
Then tuesdsy (today) if my first fay back to work after this. I go in even through i really didnt want to. I hold face i mirror emotions and im doing okay. I start work and im working with my bosses wife and she also saw that i was 'not myself' Saturday and asked if i was feeling better. I explained to her that i was suffering with my mental health quite badly and im unsure what triggered it but im trying to work through it. She asked me if i wanted to talk about it. I wanted to explain my thoughts to her as she is my bosses wife, senior member of staff and thought she would be one of the best people to speak to.
So i told her how i felt.
I told her that i felt as if someone had walked into the restaurant, set off a bomb and i was the only person that survived, but in top of that i was still able to see and speak to everyone who died. I said it was a mixture of scared an paranoid that we was going to die,  the shock, anger and greif that everyone had just died infront of me ( the restaurant was packed had easily 200/300 other people in there) and confusion to why i could see and talk to everyone as if nothing happened. That i was walking and licing in some sort of daze that every negative emotion wass heighten, that i was scared for my life and i felt like i had to watch everyones move because i couldnt trust anyone as they could be the killer.
The look on her face, i knew instantly then that i regretted even opening my mouth. She looked confused but also as if i was a monster.
I dont know if i will ever live past this day and forget that look i got.
Am i a monster?
Am i juat unwell?
I dont know how i feel on top of all this.
Am i over reacting?
Am i still in a state of paranoia?",AdditionalArcher4756,,False,18mguqh,8,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/18mguqh/i_regret_opening_up/

On the way there they decided to mention to me that they had an appointment back home the next day so we had to be back by a certain time. I was in no rush whatsoever but I was upset that my time was cut short, but she was my friend so I didn’t mind at the time. I had to cancel the hotel I booked as the website wouldn’t accept my card, so I asked her to find one for us as I was driving. She offered to pay for it, so I agreed. When we checked in, I told her I was a bit disappointed about not staying a while, then she told me I have to let her know whether I want to stay or not because she wouldn’t have came if that was the case. But she didn’t tell me that, and she agreed to come? I then said okay I will drive you back home in the morning so I’ll rest early. Then I found out she left at 4:30am to go catch a flight home, after she had just yelled at me about not wanting to catch a flight. When I woke up, she messaged me asking to pay back for the hotel because she didn’t have any money to help her boyfriend in the hospital, and I switched. I said “Why did you leave and not even say anything to me and then just ask me for money? That I don’t even owe you? You said you were covering everything, I said thank you for everything, I will repay you by getting us massages and pedicures, etc.”
 She then said I didn’t even say thank you when we checked in and how I’m a shit friend, now she knows why I have no friends because of how I treat them. But honestly I have been so stressed lately, my husband and I were recently in a dangerous situation and so was my friend but the whole entire trip that’s what she was talking about. I asked her if she could leave it until we go back home as the reason why I was going on a road trip was to destress. My husband ended up meeting us on the trip, and I splitted on him in front of her which I feel terrible about. But now she’s put that against me, and also said I treated and talked to her like shit which I don’t remember but I also wouldn’t know if I did or not and that’s what I hate… I don’t know how to explain all of this to her I feel really guilty but I also know I felt so disrespected by her and she already knows I’m going through a tough time.

I can’t be intimate with my boyfriend.,1702612937.0,"I (21F) have some very bad insecurities some related to my BPD and some are their own thing. One of these is my boyfriend’s (25M) porn usage. 
When we first started dating I was fine with it. As we have been together for longer it has become more and more of an issue for me. It’s like something that always lingers in the back of my mind that I just can’t get over. I know I can be obsessive. I’ve been open and honest on how it makes me uncomfortable which is very hard for me generally because I am bad about opening up about those things. I already have body image issues and have had a few eating disorders that I had mostly worked through with a therapist before we started dating. I found out he doesn’t only watch women and does watch men which was a big blow for me.My ex was always on gay dating sites and did cheat on me with a man more than once. I have a strict policy for myself which is I do not touch his phone. I avoid it like the plague because if I go through it I’m certain I will hurt my own feelings. Also it’s his business. We have a shared laptop that’s how I found out about the porn. I told him as long as he is watching porn I will not be intimate with him and he had a breakdown. He admits he does have a big porn addiction and relies on it when he is stressed. I told him I am not asking him to stop watching porn but I literally cannot have enjoyable sex with him while I know he is viewing that I will break down in the middle of it crying. I’ve been told I’m being vindictive manipulative and childish by cutting him off like that and that I have given him an unfair ultimatum. I feel awful like a very bad girlfriend for not just being able to get over it or look past it. We still cuddle/kiss and lay together just nothing more and he told me this is cruel. I have diagnosed BPD as well as PTSD so it is hard to see if I am actually overreacting because I always feel like I am and he says I am having an episode and blowing it way out of proportion “like usual”.

disclosing bpd to partners has always backfired,1702567986.0,"I know my bpd can make me a difficult partner, but I feel like I am extremely aware of my triggers, the reasoning behind them, and what I need when I have episodes. The past 3 relationships I've been in I made a point of disclosing this in a very clear and straightforward way when I sensed things were getting serious, because I want my partner to understand me, and be prepared to navigate conflict in a way that doesn't lead to escalation. I always try to communicate and be receptive to their responses, and together come up with ""protocol"" for tackling hurdles in a way that meets both of our abilities and needs. We essentially collaborated to make a manual for supporting each other and navigating conflict. It takes so much emotional labor and vulnerability to do this and I had such high hopes about the application and outcome. I regret it so much. Instead of following through with our compromises, each partner, on almost every occasion, not only ignored what I shared with them and what they agreed to do, but instead done everything I confided in them triggered me and played into the roots of it that I shared. I can't think of a single instance where I recieved the support they agreed to when it got to the point of me breaking down. I feel like I gave them a manual on how to abuse and manipulate me when all I was trying to do was understand their needs and explain mine, and have a plan we could both follow through on. What hurts the most is that despite bpd making it an active internal battle, I always have tried as hard as I can to fulfill my side of our plans and remind them of what I need. I feel like I've reached a point where disclosing my needs feels unsafe, and only tells people how badly they can get away with treating me. It hurts so bad. Those of us with bpd need so desperately to be treated kindly and gently and it makes me feel so unworthy when instead the exact abuse is perpetuated and I am shamed when I break down exactly the way I told them I do when they do they exact behavior I told them triggers me instead of the alternative approach they agreed on. 
Has anyone else experienced this?

The pain of picking myself up time and again,1702062184.0,"This is a rant and I'd also appreciate some support. Yet another failed relationship, life is throwing the same lessons until I learn to prioritise myself and know my self worth. Even after a year of what I thought I was doing, which was working on myself. I repeated the same mistakes, blurred my boundaries, gave in too quickly, trusted easily. 

Words are so effortless, promises are broken, I am afriad I'll go back into my shell. How much ever I try, I end up having to start all over again. Although with help from therapy and awareness of my weakness, I am able to handle it better, for now. 

Is it me? I constantly ask others, just checking if I've missed anything, or am I the one over thinking. It's difficult to know, because I completely lost faith in my instincts. 

If people who come are constantly going to test how far they can push you, how much they can get away with bad behaviour, and my reaction is valid, then why is the pain unfair. Why do I have to suffer more? 

It's so difficult to keep on picking myself up, it takes days months or even years to get over. How is that fair? I feel I'm gaslighting myself by not giving up, trying again and again. Are the lies I tell myself worse than the actual ways I've been treated? I do not know. 

I've reached a point where I feel it's better if I don't say anything, don't go out anywhere, don't meet anyone, don't do anything. The moment I move, I'm going to get hurt. 

Trust me I tried this time, and I'm sure I'll try again sometime. I'm good at being hopeful and optimistic, thinking if i only work on myself a bit more, and follow all these rules .. I'll have people that care for me and I get to care for them too.

Looking for reason(s) to live,1701456396.0,"Hi, 38F here. I was diagnosed with quiet BPD last year, also have a history of OCD, PTSD, generalized anxiety, and depression. I’m high functioning but have been going through a major bout of depression for about the past month. Feelings of emptiness and desire to die are pervasive and began around age 4-5. I go to therapy weekly and treat my symptoms with daily MMJ and occasional psilocybin.

In my latest therapy session, it was suggested that I need to find motivation to live based on “permanence”. My therapist and I both recognize that, while the structure of daily activities gets me through the day most times, I still lack an overall goal/reason to prevent me from ending my life prematurely. When asked what type of reason I might find, she said that it is up to me to discover that and I am experiencing a mental block to finding out what my purpose is, for lack of a better word. Have any of you out there been able to find a real reason to live beyond career goals, raising a family, or financial milestones? I want to learn to cope with this better but I’m really at a loss here. 

For reference, I’m financially secure, have a supportive family and plenty of friends, no desire to have children, and a complicated situationship that admittedly causes most of my acute issues with BPD.

I left my fp behind,1701299972.0,"Hello everyone!
first of all I'm sorry for my grammar and poor vocabulary since english isn't my first language (but I'm trying my best)

So I recently moved out of a rehab in which I lived for 2 years. It wasn't like a hospital, more like a home for disabled adults. Every client (like me) had a person to talk to, like a social worker or a therapist. And over the 2 years my person (x) became my favorite person. They helped me through a lot and I don't think I would've accomplished half of the things I did without them. x was my support and my shoulder to cry on. They were by my side on my healing journey and made a huge difference in my daily life.

I moved into my new apartment a month ago and I'm kinda proud and happy with where my life is going rn

But there is one thing that has been so hard and overwhelming that I can't even share it with my loved ones. I left my fp behind. It's not that my loved ones (like family, bestie and boyfriend) don't know about this, but I'm afraid to share how much it actually hurts. I've been looking forward to my ""new life"" for so long and I really didn't think that the first time would be easy but i never would've expected it to be THAT hard. 

When I'm alone in my apartment, I'm crying all the time. I'm hurting. I miss x so much and I just want to talk to them. I want them to reassure me that everything will be alright. I don't want this reassurance from my loved ones. And I don't wanna have to pretend like it would change anything. Because it wouldn't. 

The worst part is that my boyfriend still lives in that rehab and gets to speak to x like 5 days a week. Except for the weekends when he stays at my place. 

Also x has called me like 1 or 2 times since I moved out and someday he wants to visit me and have a coffee. 

I don't really know what kind of support I'm looking for, I don't really know what to do, I don't really know what else to say, I just don't know anymore 

I'm genuinely thankful for everyone who's reading this. It's the first time I'm sharing this and I kinda just want to be seen.

BPD and meds (Quetiapine),1701227895.0,"Hi, recently I got diagnosed with bpd.
I’ve been struggling for a long time, and there were suspicions for BPD but now it is confirmed. To be honest it’s not that much of a surprise, I somehow knew I had it but was still hoping it’s not true.
My symptoms became more severe ever since I got into a relationship, including agressive outbursts, jealousy and a constant feeling of uneasiness. Blaming my partner constantly and feeling left out started to kill my relationship, and I didn’t want it to happen at all. Luckily my partner is patient and we somehow stayed together. I went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed and now I am on Brintellixn(vortioxetine) and Quetiapine.
Already after a few days I can feel my moods are more stable, but quetiapine does make me sleepy and very hard to wake up in the morning. At this moment I am only taking 25 mg of quetiapine at night but I am supposed to up the dose to 50mg a day (25 in the morning, 25 at night).
As I have never experienced this drug I have my reservations and I am a bit scared of it’s sideffects (losing all emotion, drowsiness, weight gain, unable to concetrate)

Me and m were friends since we were 7 years old. He was my best friend my everything. We got together when we were 18,19 things fell off after covid and I didn't know how to actually break it off bc I had an Attachment to him, he was my favorite person for a while. So more content me and him both dealt with abuse in different way but we were there for each other almost everyday when we were in grade school. About a year and a half ago I fell off and started doing drugs bc I started realize maybe m wasn't the best person for me and that really hurt bc he was everything why wasn't this relationship everything to me anymore. I got distance, started hanging with the wrong crowd of ppl and I really hurt him. I Snorted drugs in front of him and would tell him to fuck off or to just leave if he didn't like it. It got to the point where I was just verbally abusive to him, I hated myself doing that to him. I then broke up with him but still would have sex with him bc I needed to get off, I knew he loved me still and wanted us to work but I didn't care, I only cared about myself. then about a year ago I started messing around with my current bf, we made it official, but when my current bf left out of town, I texted m and fucked him while my current bf was gone. My current bf still doesn't know this happened but I told m everything he was hurt and blocked me on everything. I can't blame him I hurt him so bad probably worse then anyone has ever hurt him before. I then didn't text him for about a year but we have a Mutual friend that I just saw this Thanksgiving and he brought up the fact that me and m were so amazing as friends, it made me remember how much I missed him, I texted his sister to tell her how sorry I was and that I wasn't in my right mind from the drugs and now that I'm clean I would like to try to be friends or at least Acquaintances. Long story short that's prob never going to happen. Which Is totally okay I completely understand but I can't stop thinking about all the horrible things I did, the years I lost with someone all bc I couldn't just tell him I couldn't be with him anymore. There is a lot more to the story but this is already long as fuck.

How best to handle partner with potential BPD considering self harm.,1700893489.0,"My boyfriend was diagnosed with BPD years ago, but will often flip between possible explanations for why the diagnosis is wrong. I'm not going to challenge his view of this, but I need help.

Its a complicated situation we're in, but the pertinent details are that he will occasionally enter a severely depressive state and will seriously discuss ending his own life. He is normally a very talkative and outgoing person, but completely shuts for 1 - 3 days or so when these moods hit.

I suffer from depression and even attempted end my own life once, so I'm highly empathetic when he gets like this, but that was a long time and years of therapy ago. It's gotten a lot better as our relationship has progressed, turning from week long severe meltdowns to short depressive moments as he's gotten to be more comfortable living in the safe environment I've tried to create for him.

We're in a polyamorous throuple, and our other partner that lives with us is highly supportive as well, we often switch off trying to take care of our boyfriend when it gets too much for one of us.

Today's episode has been pretty bad though, it was triggered by not being able to find the clothes he needed, and was exasperated when I tried to help. He blew up pretty bad, storming around the house until he tired himself out and has been nonverbal ever since, only piping up to say he wants to die.

I just found out my FP was lying to me for almost a year. My worst nightmare came true.,1700783952.0,"Tw: mentions of suicide, self harm and eating disorders.

It has been two days now, and I feel so empty. 

Two days ago, my FP told me that during the past year, he has been lying to me. Every time he said ‘i love you’ and ‘i care about you’, he didn’t actually mean it. His words were all hollow and meaningless. He’s been holding back a lot of resentment he had for me because of my breakdowns and switches. He has been apologising for things he doesn’t mean because he just wants to get the conversation over with. He’s been doing all this because he doesn’t want me to hurt or kill myself, and by saying these words he thought i would feel better. 

Well, by telling me all this, especially the part where he didn’t actually care about or love me, I was the closest I ever was to killing myself. I already bought everything i needed, but I just couldn’t open the gas tank. It feels like my heart is being ripped apart. Every single good moment I had with him is just tainted with a dirty stain. 

I really want to end it all, because the pain is too much. Because I now have severe trust issues. Because I can’t see a future of any one loving me. And also another stupid reason, i want to kill myself to make him feel guilty for all the lies he told me and hurt him deeply for one. last.time. 

It feels like the worst nightmare i had for the whole year has came true. My FP has been lying to me the whole time. He doesn’t actually love me. I remember the times i would say ‘I know you don’t actually love me.’ And he would lie through his teeth saying ‘I do.’ Everything makes sense now. His ghosting, his low initiative to do anything with me at all, his constant empty apologies. 

I don’t know how im going to get back from this. Now everytime someone tells me that they love me, i feel like i would never believe them. My FP told me that he wouldn’t lie anymore, that he would always be honest with me. He hasn’t been talking to me. 

I feel so utterly alone. I don’t know if i can just move on from how much pain and betrayal he made me feel, and start to trust him again. My eating disorder is making a comeback again. I went from 47kg to 44kg. And I don’t feel scared about it. In fact, I want to continue shrinking smaller and smaller until I disappear out of existence, because I’m a terrible monster who no one loves. 

How do I move on from this? I desperately need this advice, otherwise i feel like my life would really be over. Your words of encouragement and support will really be appreciated. 

I apologise for the long message.

(His parents were addicts) I  told him good because I can’t enter a relationship with you if you’re newly sober, using etc. I’m not stable enough on my own sobriety journey to do so. (I explained more in depth but it’s a very touchy and trigger subject for me to talk about) Well. Fast forward. We’re now newly weds and he comes to me with a confession. That he lied to me and was in fact only 2 weeks sober when we met. He told me he didn’t tell me because he didn’t want to lose me. But at the time of the conversation we had only just met, we hadn’t even began dating yet. There have been multiple situations in our relationship where I felt like he may be doing drugs. But because he said he’s never touched them. I ignored my gut feelings and moved past them. This feels catastrophic to me. Like it’s the end of the relationship. There are other factors as well. But being lied to is always been my biggest problem when it comes to people. Once I’ve been lied to. I cut ties. But it isn’t that simple as we’ve just gotten married.. I feel very trapped and hurt. It feels like he’s intentionally waited until we got married to drop this on me. Especially bc he’s become so open about it all as if he’s been that way the whole relationship. I’m constantly having to tell him I’m not comfortable with the conversation as it is very triggering. But he just doesn’t seem to get it. Ultimately I feel like my choice was taken from me. If I had known I would’ve gladly remained in his life as his friend. But I wouldn’t have dated him. Let alone married him.  Which makes me feel like a horrible person for saying. But I expressed that to him when we met and he chose to withhold the fact he’s recovering from me as a response. He said he didn’t know how to tell me after I said I wouldn’t date him and that he didn’t want to lose me either and just be friends. I feel like I don’t know him anymore. Especially with everything else that has happened leading up to this ",Witchy_hippie5,,False,181e9u2,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/181e9u2/struggling_with_being_lied_to/

Realistically it’s bc I have no type and I pick up the first guy that shows me attention , regardless of his personality or looks and how compatible they are to mine. Recently I met a guy who’s a dream he’s literally a person I can actually see myself with beyond the lens of my obsessive mental illness. He does things for me that nobody ever has b4, his sense of humor is amazing he’s hot , I don’t rlly need to explain it . Point is he’s intent on not being exclusive (taxi cab theory anybody?) and I feel like a dickhead waiting around for him.  I’ve tried to distance myself bc I know I’m unhealthily obsessed with him but he just won’t let me, he’s a “talk it out” type of person . I had ONE rule , ONE FUCKING RULE and it’s so shockingly easy: Don’t sleep with my friends. And guess what? He tried to fuck my friend , THEN invited me to HER party ?? Said she was SOOOOO cool. Worst part? I may b a bit off but I have amazing pattern recognition so he chose the girl that I KNEW he would out of all my friends :)) All this in combo with the fact he always shows up with new hickeys or scratches that IK I didn’t do. I know I have BPD and I know I’m not well but that’s messed up right? Like fucking my friend to my face when u know it would upset me and telling me you’re talking to her regularly when you said I was the only one you talk to like this .  I should cut it off but it feels harsh to him bc it’s very new but he doesn’t understand that I’m not entirely doing it out of rage- he really doesn’t wanna be with me even if he thinks he does bc I’m not gonna be a good gf now that I don’t trust him . I think I should make a list of my real type like what I actually want, get off the dating apps and start learning how to be single and happy. How do I stop putting myself in these situations??

Block & Unblock with Splitting,1700349512.0,"What would you do if your BPD partner had the constant block unblock going on when they are stressed?

Context: My girlfriend has BPD. When there’s a situation that completely goes south, she blames me somehow and throws her anger at me, giving up on everything, blocking me everywhere, stopping location share, etc. If we can’t afford laundry because she needs a ride to work and back home, she ends up not wanting to go to work anymore. She leaves her house key in the Uber(again) and completely gives up everything and hangs up on me again and again and blocks me then goes into hysteria and etc. 

What do I do? I do not want to break up, I want her to keep this job because otherwise I have to keep paying for everything(which I have been doing all along with no issue because how could I ever say no to my princess but it’s not easy because she likes to buy a lot of stuff, not to mention the splitting that comes when I say no to buying something). She is the best girlfriend ever when she isn’t splitting she is so sweet and motherly and caring and selfless and loving and all. 

Help me be better, if there is a way for me to do so. 

TLDR; GF splitting, can’t set boundaries without more splitting, need to help her keep it together to get life on track, and need to help her stop the juvenile coping mechanisms.

Edit: We are talking again now, her and I have a lot to work on and neither of us are perfect. I know I sound sweet but I definitely said things that I didn’t mean because for some reason no matter how many times I learn about communicating with a BP, I sometimes feel like trying to reach her when she’s in an episode and that’s unproductive as fuck. I just need to keep working on myself and have a talk with her when the dust finally settles and try to get it to go somewhere.

Last night I almost :/ ended things TW: SI and SU,1700236522.0,"Backstory: I’ve been dealing with the thoughts my whole life, had a couple attempts and ended up in the mental hospital more than I want to count. Was diagnosed bipolar but new that wasn’t me so I continued life not knowing what really is up. A couple months ago I met with a online doctor she diagnosed me with BPD and said that she couldn’t treat me or give me meds bc of the state my SI thoughts are in. Every single day and I cannot help it. So I’ve been struggling alone and no one seems to care. I’ve been drinking way to much this past year, about a 750 ml every 3 days. I go to bed sick and pass out. 

Currently, last night: what triggered the thoughts was a phone call with a close family member. The call went fine and the person didn’t do anything wrong but I couldn’t stop thinking about how terrible I am, how I talk to much, how embarrassing I am, how no one can stand me, my own husband ect and I’m so tired of making a fool out of myself. I’m tired of existing and failing. After dinner I asked my husband to take my son with him and get us some ice cream, I wanted to be alone.. you get the point. I know it sounds pathetic but I thought that was my only chance and if I didn’t do it then I would keep suffering and things have not ever got better, I don’t want to live in pain anymore.

TW: idk if I’m allowed to talk about the details this is my first post on here. But here it goes- I grabbed my husbands hand *** and loaded it. Finished up my note that’s been sitting in my phone for a while and put it up to my head. I then got scared and couldn’t do it. Thinking of SI is one thing (sounds easy enough, sounds like a release) but in the actual moment I was actually scared of the pain. Finally I heard my husband pull back up the house so I quickly put everything back up. I went out like everything was normal and he went to where the stuff was and said “WHY WERE YOU MESSING WITH MY STUFF” I said I wasn’t and he called me a child and said “wow now I can’t even keep these in the house” he unloaded them all. I he kept verbally harassing me. I put my son to bed and slept in our guest room and he hasn’t talked to me since. 

Now I feel so embarrassed and alone. He makes me feel pathetic. I know I am. I’m barely hanging on and no one seems to care. I have told my mother and close people how bad it is and they said “sorry maybe you should get on meds “ I’ve been on soo many different types of meds my whole life and it was a nightmare, felt like I was living in a shell.

I have PCOS as well and I can see some improvement only now, I'm slowly coming out of my shell and meeting new people, attending events. I feel extremely lonely and scared to give people a chance again, fully aware I may ruin everything because of my obsessive needs to over give and get hurt.

I feel stressed and tired of life and i feel so alone. I work a full time job while attending university (studying engineering) at the same time and its been so hard on me. I am all alone in life which means i had to work and figure things on my own since i was 16 years old and i am so exhausted. I am trying to do better and be a better person, friend and partner but its like i am the most despicable person to them so i don’t blame anyone for abandoning me but it’s so hard one me cuz i am trying and i don’t want to be that person but i cant. 

It feels like I’ve hit rock bottom and my life is a mess. I am on academic probation due to my declining gpa and grades even though i am trying my best i am attending every class doing everything on time studying well before every exam but i seem to be doing something wrong cuz my grades don’t reflect that. My job isn’t going that well it’s so stressful and triggering and i am overworking myself cuz I can’t lose it or i will be homeless with my university tuition, rent, bills etc…., My house is a total mess its disgusting  i am so embarrassed to show it to anyone its the worse it has ever got though i live in a tiny space. 

My relationship with my partner isn’t going that well and i am mainly the reason why. He supported me more than anyone in my life and been there for me through everything but when it comes to mental illnesses he doesn’t really understand what i am going through and keeps trying to encourage me in the wrong way with things that work for normal people or for him not for someone who is suffering from crippling anxiety and depression as well as bpd. Though he is trying to change his views.

And i need help cuz i can’t do this anymore and i want to give up i see no hope for future the harder i try the worse it gets and though i love my partner more than life and is the i only person in my life, he is better off without me i hurt him so much that I can’t even forgive myself anymore though he worked through it all with me. I cant do this life anymore i have nothing to look forward to and honestly don’t want anything.

i feel a little silly(?) if that’s the right word, maybe embarrassed but i just met with my local community mental health team assessor today for the first time. after 15 years of being messed about, let down etc she actually listened to me and said she doesn’t diagnose but she said i can tell this isn’t clinical depression and your symptoms seem to suggest EUPD(the word she used), and said she thinks the doctor is going to prescribe mood stabilisers, so i’m wondering what are the side effects like for any mood stabiliser? just to prepare myself. 

also, does anyone have any advice on how to come with finally getting that diagnosis? just to add, i’ve had many GPs suggest i probably have BPD but they never actually referred me on to get this support/actual diagnosis

"I'm in a deep hole, and it's not my fault.",1699379380.0,"My mom didn't pay any of the rent in a flat the city arranged for us. Since she's still raising 2 kids and work only 3/4 times, the court deemed her unable to pay up, so now I will have to pick up the bill.

But I don't want to, I Fucking don't want to and don't have to.

She broke me mentally and socially.
 I've been babysitting her kids since I turned 7, every day, I wasn't allowed to go out on my own more than twice per month.

She never cared for me, never went to parents-teachers meetings, never thought of helping me with homework.

Whenever I went to her and asked for help because I was getting bullied she brushed it off with ""then change yourself if you don't fit in"" 

She never did anything when my deadbeat father was beating me, with belts, spoons, cables, broom handles, kicks, punches. Not a word I heard. I don't actually remember if she hugged me.

I couldn't ask her to appoint a doctor for me. Whenever I was sick she'd wait until I get better or I couldn't get out of the bed. 

She never cared for my dental health, never bought me a toothbrush, toothpaste or a floss.

When I had a rotten tooth she waited for 3 weeks to appoint me with a dentist, and only after the pain was so intense I had severe delirium and tried to kill myself, but it was too late and I had to undergo an emergency tooth extraction, and even then she was hesitant to pay $20 for an anesthesia shot. 

She'd never buy me new clothes, only after my old ones were to small she would go to a thrift store and buy me some 2nd hand old clothes. 

When I said in school that I don't think I'm good up the dome (a saying in my country), they appointed me to a psychiatrist, she was hesitant, missed the first term, after I got another term she went with me once. After the meeting doctor said that I show symptoms of ADHD, depression and possible BPD. After that she told me to ""act normal and shut up about our problems in school"" because she won't be going to the shrink with me. 

I never asked for things like a PC, smartphone, a bike or a fucking allowance.

I could go on and on about how she fucked me up, but when I turned a legal age I went to work, every day after the school I was working 5 to 12 at local McDonald's to bring some money and support the family. And I did support her, gave her enough to cover the rent, paid the electricity bills, bought her new furniture, new fridge, new shower cabin, whenever one of my siblings needed something I was the first to whip out my wallet. 

And now I was sentenced to pay a Fucking debt of almost $10000 because this Fucking bitch never cared for anything but booze and drugs! 

I don't have that kind of money, I don't know where to find it, I don't know what to do. I thought I was finally free of her when I moved out, but no. She had to do me dirty one last time. 

I Fucking hate her. 

It is a vent but I hope someone might help me and tell me what to do. 

This whole thing has turned me into an aggressive asshole, I've pushed everyone away and whenever someone says something on the street to me I just yell ""fuck off"" or go straight to a brawl.

I (24f) have been struggling with bpd since I was in high school. I restarted seeing a therapist in august of last year after I got out of the hospital and was put on meds. I still struggle a lot with lashing out in anger which is what this post is about. Last night I got really angry with my boyfriend. It was over something really stupid. It’s no excuse but he was pushing my buttons so bad and I laid my hands on him. At first I didn’t mean to hurt him and then I realized I was getting way too rough. Today I feel like shit. He’s obviously really mad at me because I hurt him but I want him to forgive me. I understand he needs to process but the guilt is overwhelming me. I’ve begged for forgiveness over and over and he won’t say he accepts it. We can’t even look at each other. Does anyone have any advice for processing guilt when you’ve done something wrong? How do you come to terms that they’re not ready to forgive you yet? Is there anything I can do to right the situation?

The thing is, I’ve always had inability to stick to one emotion and whatever emotion I feel, I feel it to the full extent but this is not really a problem for me in my normal life, it becomes a problem whenever im in a relationship. I completely lose myself when I’m in a relationship, I turn into a person who is perfect in every way for the person im with.

When she would get in trouble at school they would laugh about it and think it’s cute. She threw scissors at her teacher once and broke her glasses and my family laughs about it like it’s a cherished family memory. But when I was in detention in 8th grade for getting bad grades because I was getting bullied by everyone including the teachers I got my ass whooped for it. As a child I would constantly get whooped for things she did because they thought I was lying and because their precious baby wouldn’t do that.

My sister loves throwing enormous fits and making a spectacle of herself. She always did it in school and got a slap on the wrist. Any time anyone says anything to her that she doesn’t like she’ll start uncontrollably sobbing and throwing an enormous fit and my family literally babies her! They’ll be like “Oh my poor baby you’ll be okay” okay from what? from me asking her to stop being a smartass? every time my sister purposely starts something with me and I snap in  a BPD rage they paint me like some big bad evil bully.

Like do they not realize siblings fight regardless? I don’t know any set of sisters that have never fought before. But because of her disability it’s magically not just siblings fighting but now I’m this evil person that’s so hateful and mean. But she’s never hateful and mean when she starts the shit with me?? 

Every time I vent to my cousin about it she’s blown away by how my family acts and will say things like “if they think that’s bad they’d hate seeing me and my sister fight” like EXACTLY 

I’ve never been able to use my BPD as a scapegoat or an excuse (not that I want to) and it’s funny considering they’re the reason I have it to begin with.

My sister is 22 and doesn’t even know how to act in public. She points and stares at people and i’m talking creepy staring to where people get uncomfortable. And whenever I ask her to stop my family just brushes it off and says “oh my baby you’re okay” no it’s not okay! there’s no reason she should be 22 and still thinking it’s normal to throw explosive fits in front of other people. And they baby her every single time so she’s never going to learn that it’s not okay. I was still throwing fits until I was a teenager and I got verbally abused and my ass whooped for it because I was “too old” but her being 22 isn’t too old to be acting like that?

They never hold her accountable for anything she does. My grandma literally said earlier “Well she doesn’t know she’s being so rude when she is” well how the fuck is she gonna know when i’m the only one that tells her and y’all jump me for speaking up??

I love my sister to death I would do anything for her and die for her. When we went to the same schools I always stood up for her when kids would ACTUALLY bully her. Sibling arguing is not bullying bro. I love my sister and I just wish she was taught how to act right. I honestly think it’s cruel as fuck to treat her like she’s incapable of learning how to act polite. She’s extremely intelligent if she had the proper people guiding her in the right direction. There’s no excuse for having a 22 year old that can’t act right in public i’m sorry there’s no fucking excuse.

If anyone is going to disagree with me please keep your comments to yourself. If you have no knowledge of living in a scenario like this I don’t care if you think i’m being mean.

the week of 10/2-10/6 we spent the night together twice, both at mine and his house. We had sex both times.

That following sunday I texted his textnow saying “wyd” (this is what he says to me) no response. so I wait an entire week and last sunday I said “hope you’re doing good” no response. so last night I downloaded textnow and texted his real number saying “Did I do something?😭” no response so I text again today saying “Alright ill leave you alone i hope you’re doing good and i’m sorry for whatever i did” no fucking response.

so I go check his twitter and he tweeted something a few hours after I texted him (until then he hasn’t tweeted in 3 days) so i’m like wow now I know you saw it. old me would blow up his phone and freak out and it’s really taking everything in me not to do that tbh.

"Follow up - How to stop being abuser TW: SI, SA, ABUSE",1697576538.0,"Hello. 
Some time ago I posted here about being afraid of parpatuating in cycle of abuse. Since then some things have changed. 

I still feel guilty for my past. I still feel like a bad person and I still feel lost. But at the same time thanks to therapy and meds I was able to break the pattern.

Long story short I was in long distance relationship for past two months. Me and my boyfriend tried to work it out. Unfortunally he wanted to stay in a place where he currently is, because it is better than my country for him. I can't immigrate now because college in my country is free while in the USA where he is I would have to pay. And although I love him and I would immigrate it would be in a time when I finished college and gained more financial stability - I have problems with impulsive spendings - so It was hard for us. We drift Apart and although both of us tried we both weren't happy. Me especially because as a pwBPD I am triggered by abondoment and distance. And the first plan was he would come back to my country in 5 months time when he gets his papers in check. 

So at Sunday we broke up. It wasn't easy decision. I think we both took it very hard. But I am proud to say that I broke the cycle. I would split on him even back in March when we met. I would harras him, I would beg him to comeback even threathend to hurt myself. And just to him, but to my parents and friends as well. I would probably be institiunalized again or at least took to ER. But this time I blocked him. Not because I hate him. I am hurt, sad, deppresed but I don't hate him. I finally see the other side the other person feelings even though my heart is bledding. I see past my hurt feelings and unmet needs. 

So for anyone in similar situation: block your ex. Delete all of the contacts, reminders etc. Go to therapy. Practice mindfullness, meditation, yoga. Focus on other stuff. Do whatever neccesary to not cause harm to you or your ex, especially if they were your FP. Let yourself be angry, hurt, dissapointed. But don't took it onto yourself or the other person. Don't split. It is hard. But therapy and meds help.

If anyone Has the same guilt and shame as me and is afraid that they can't change let this be an example. And also don't beat yourself up if you fucked up. Healing takes a lot of time and work. You won't be perfect, I am not Perfect. But we can heal.

What is this?,1697368043.0,"Hello all,

I recently broke up with two people I was in a poly triad with, and one of them was my FP. At first, i felt so much better after the breakup; but now, I’m having anxiety that wakes me up from sleep too early and sometimes gives me anxiety attacks.

I have both rational feelings and thoughts and the typical ones that come with having an FP and seeing them with someone else— doesn’t help that he seems particularly upset with me for breaking up with them.

I blocked them on most things, but I had wanted to stay in the discord server that my FP had bc i wanted to ultimately remain friends with them and the people in the server.

It can be a bit much seeing the two of them match pfps, which they started doing the day after we broke up, while I was still in the house— feels a bit triggering, maybe.

I feel guilty for having such negative feelings towards the one who isn’t my FP knowing I’ve had such genuine feelings for them before. And they seemed to try their best to be friendly with me, but everything felt like it was being rubbed in my face and I couldn’t stand it.

I’ve had these feelings happen before when I fell out with an FP, and the whole FP break ordeal lasted 4.5+ months (I stopped feeling angry toward her probably closer to a year later). I’m not particularly down for this lasting that long, especially since I’m taking a break from school and I’d like to get back to it when I can, and this stuff takes up my whole mind.

Do I love him or is he my FP,1696976663.0,"I (24F) have been on and off seeing someone (30M) for the last year and a half. I consider myself very self aware and always consider if my emotions are genuine or coming from a place of anxious attachment. Because our dynamic is more “situational” there is no consistency which in the past has made my symptoms more pronounced so in this case I deliberately try to remain as unattached as I possibly can to avoid the obsessiveness that often happens for me in romantic relationships (which is why I avoid them).  We have never talked about anything that’s transpired between us or how we feel, so I’m never sure where he stands (and vice versa), but of course I have over time developed feelings for him and I believe it’s mutual but also can’t tell if that’s me trying to just feed my delusion. I allowed myself to feel close to him and the intimacy is there and I’ve welcomed it when we’re together and it feels extremely passionate and natural. I don’t have any interest in pursuing anyone else and my thoughts are always flooded with him. I want us both to be happy whether that’s together or apart. I feel like I love him but I also can’t really decipher “love” from having a FP or if there is a way to. Does anyone have any advice on how to start detattaching from a FP? I care about him and I think he cares about me too, but I think we’re both stubborn to show vulnerability first and it’s not healthy for me to not have consistency. We don’t talk regularly also hence the situational dynamic I mentioned before. We’re both adults and I feel like if a man felt the same way about me …. He would have made it known by now? Not saying it’s only his responsibility because it’s not, but as a woman I’d like a man to not be afraid to affirm his feelings for me if they exist too because that means something to be in terms of reassurance and security. I don’t know what to do. Do I just tell him how I feel when I get the chance or do I try to let it go and move on?

Managing splitting and paranoia in the early stages of a relationship/dating,1696898910.0,lam dating this guy and we've only hung-out a few times but are continuing to do so and are making plans consistently. I find myself already starting to split and demonize him over the silliest things and now often avoid him deliberately or will make intentional efforts to be passive aggressive or rude to him when we talk over text. In the past with close friendships and longer relationships i have been able to make a list of all the things I admire about the people close to me and my favorite person to combat these feelings but i don't really know enough about this man to do that yet. so i just have all of these bitter feelings towards him for no reason and it's causing me a lot of anxiety and frustration for no reason. any tips on how to manage this and any other advice for dating with bd would be much appreciated.

So Stuck RN,1696866984.0,"I have had periods of being very well emotionally regulated, mostly when I am modeling good behaviors/actions for others. What ultimately happens is I am so focused on others that I forget to tend to myself. I’ve had a few bottoms. One came during the plague with social isolation. I then got a WFH job and social engagements got super hard for me. Looking back I can almost see my self completely unwind. Stop going to gym, stop journaling, stop meditating, stopped taking showers, changing clothes, brushing teeth, then stopped taking my medications bc if I take the ADHD meds I feel locked inside my head and almost paralyzed on the outside. By this time my head had 8 different trains of thought on 6 tracks and at least one wants me to unsubscribe from life and they constantly whirl around up there. I asked for accommodations from my company and they then found a reason to fire me (Top sales rep, most customer compliments) and I tail spun. 

So I swore I would unsubscribe from life before giving up my 325ft studio apartment (bc it was mine and I paid for it all by myself) and move back in with my parents. Soooo…..my brother let me crash with him. My head was so dark and so mean to me that getting out of bed seemed impossible. Sublet the studio to someone who is trashing it and also wants to sleep with me. (Uggggg)

So now, I have done EMDR, ART, DBT, CBT and I’m therapy and have a psych and I’m still in this rut where I JUST DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF AT ALL ANYMORE. It’s like the spark or fire went out. I can’t seem to find it. Brother was paying for top tier therapy and now it’s been downgraded to better help. He’s upset he’s not getting a return on investment bc I haven’t been able to be more regulated for the last 2 years. 

I’ve gained over 100lbs in 2 years thanks to gastroparesis from Weygovi/Ozempic/Rybelsus. 

I now have a bedroom that I operate out of and while my brother can be super encouraging and supportive, lately I only hear what I’m doing bad/wrong.

Now dad has had heart issues, step sis going thru divorce from a narcissist - she has two kids 4/9 and she’s a flight attendant with her own Truman’s manifesting in such dysfunction rn. (Which is effecting the kids)

I can show up for my dad and step sis and my niece and nephew and lately, I put the very disassociated mask on where I’m modeling good behaviors, showering, changing clothes, doing laundry, doing sisters dishes and laundry and going to doctor appointments. Did I make my psych appt this month…nope. Dad in hospital. 

When those duties/obligations end…..I deflate back into a dark hole who doesn’t really care if I see tomorrow. 

2018-2022 I racked up over 30k in debt, so there’s a bankruptcy that gets to happen, and I’ve asked multiple people to be my body double so I can sit down and get the information I need so I can file it. Currently, if I go back to work, one of my more aggressive lenders will get a judgement and garnish my wages. It’s so traumatizing for me that I did this to myself that I don’t feel safe doing it alone. 

I filed for disability bc it’s actually proving that me acting as the Geico duck in the boat plugging all the multiple holes (my family’s needs) is enough to be a full time job and I have adhd, ptsd, BPD, anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety. I don’t have clothes that fit. So I have mostly pajamas. I hate going in public and won’t do social things. And I’m so dysregulated rn that I couldn’t imagine working part or full time doing anything. 

I don’t know how or when we crossed that tipping line of full heartedly believing that my life is worthless. I don’t matter, I don’t want to be here, and have made certain promises to not do the thing I really want to do while parents are alive, or in family’s house. (This is one area where black and white thinking is helping me.) I care more about NOT inflicting trauma on my family than I care about myself.

I very much wish that I felt/believed/desired like I was capable of going back to giving a fuck, and taking my meds, and showering and looking forward to working out, wanting to be social, enjoying life rather than I have XYZ task that drains my batteries and takes all my spoons so now I need 4 days to recharge. It’s exhausting. 

I cannot seem to create and keep a routine bc nothing is routine. I’m pulled to take care of the kids or dad has new appts nearly every week. I’ve lost enjoyment and fulfillment in the things that used to make me happy like painting or singing. 

Everything hurts, every muscle aches. I don’t feel like stretching helps.

I find that I am seeing or aware of every flaw of my body and limitations since gaining all this weight. I could go on and on.

I’m getting frustrated at my limitations and when the frustration hits I’m not able to positively spin it to find a way to overcome it, the frustration is too loud and draining and before I can even acknowledge it and catch it to try to reframe it, my batteries are dead. 

I don’t know where to start or what to do first. I assume it’s one little thing to the next. I just don’t know how to do it when i genuinely don’t want to be here and don’t care. I am truly stuck. Like stuck stuck. 

Anyone with any experience with this apathy and stuckness, I’d really like some help from people who have been where i am and found a way to care again.

I live in the US and our mental health resources are limited and sorely underfunded and my family doesn’t have the resources to put me in a nice place for 90 days that would force me to have a routine.

He and my psychiatrist also will be doing testing for adult ADHD at my appt next week. I don’t want to get consumed with labels. I do it all the time and get obsessed. My question is how did you find out you had BPD? How old were you when you received the diagnosis? Do you have any idea how to be a human?? lol pls anyone with just advice on living with BPD.

Needing support,1696625932.0,"Hello!
This is my first post ever on Reddit. I need support from people who also have BPD. 

I am 22f and I was properly diagnosed with BPD last year although I suspected it for a long time. I always had troubles with impulsivity, deppresion and emotional Control. Last year I fully realize how bad I am even though I was in therapy for almost two years at this time. It started when my boyfriend broke up with me. I Had a relationship before but this was first more long term. We were living together for couple months. 

I am acknowlegding that we had problems on his side, but I was more impulsive abusive and awful, because my mental Health was awful. I just got out from my parents house, was adjusting to new work, new city and was dealing with relative that Had dementia and unfourtunally died at the end of 2021. I am not saying this to demish what I did which included intensive splitting, arguing, trying to keep it through being FwB even though it was hurting us both etc. This land me in group therapy which I couldn't handle, because I really had a hard time hearing critism and taking full accountability for what I did. 

My question is does anybody else deal with a guilt after being abusive partner or is afraid of repeating the pattern? If so does it get easier and can you fully recover from it and be a good partner?

I am in New relationship since March this year and I am just afraid. Especially that It is long distance.. I don't want to hurt anybody else or myself. The guilt is sometimes overwhelming. And yes I am in therapy and on meds which makes me at least able to keep my job for a longer period of time.",Middle-Hyena-8284,,False,171nkeh,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/171nkeh/needing_support/
Love sucks,1696545093.0,"**trigger warning substance abuse** 

So I’m going through a breakup right now and I’m not okay. We were together for 203 days when he broke up with me, our anniversary was Mario day. I remember every single time we hung out. I remember tripping on acid with him to connect with him on a more deep spiritual level. I told him about my bpd when we first met and it was the same thing as always. You guys know what I’m talking about, the “I promise I can handle it” and “I promise your bpd won’t scare me off” but this time I genuinely thought it was going to be different. He showed me the beautiful and gentle love that I was looking for my entire life. He showed me what true love is, but as always when it comes to having bpd. I ruined the relationship, I was jealous and irritable, I regret so much and wish I could’ve been a better girlfriend to him. The love I have for him goes above and beyond, I can’t find words to be able to help someone comprehend how much I love him. I see him in the stars, the moon, the sky, the wind, and the sunset/rise. I genuinely thought this was it and I finally met the one, I thought all my failed attempts at love and looking for affection everywhere I could find it regardless if it was healthy or not. I thought the search was over but here I am. Heartbroken, depressed, high as fuck from relapsing after 162 days being sober. I’m so scared of ever opening up my heart to someone else. I’m a person who’s full of so much love, I wear my heart on my entire body, but I’m just scared of this happening again. I genuinely don’t think I can handle another breakup.

Asperger’s & BPD in a Relationship?,1696611774.0,"okay so I haven’t posted on here before and this is kinda nerve wracking, but I wanted to ask if anyone has any experience being in a relationship with someone who has Asperger’s? 

I have BPD (24 F) and my partner (23 M) has Asperger’s. We have been together for 3 years. I really enjoy when we are both on the same wave length - we have similar hobbies and interests and can get into fun deep conversations about things. 

The thing is, is that I feel very much emotionally abandoned a lot of the time. I feel like he doesn’t think like how I think (because he literally doesn’t) and I struggle because he just does what he feels in any given moment. His facial expressions can be very neutral too which to me feels like he hates me (I have tried to not assume this and ask if he is okay etc, but I can’t help it when he looks raging sometimes) 

Recently we’ve been having a few arguments regarding mental health. I don’t feel he is accommodating to me a lot of the time, and I do so much for him. I cook and clean and do things that I know would make him happy before he’s even thought of it. I am hypervigilant and want to do everything I can to make him happy. However as I get older, I realise that my needs always go unmet. I never feel cared for or looked after and I want him to provide that. Anytime I bring it up it turns into an argument about how I don’t understand his mental health struggles and then I go off the rails because I just feel like he’s not listening to me and that I’m literally doing everything in my power to make a nice life for us. And then it turns into an argument about how I am crazy and can’t control my anger etc. I always end up apologising and we just ignore it. 

It’s hard to know what to do. I love him, but I don’t want to like through another year of feeling uncared for. 

I also struggle to know if it is my bpd acting up or if I am actually being rational. Any help would be great thank yo",Tiny_Lime5707,,False,171hqaj,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/171hqaj/aspergers_bpd_in_a_relationship/

I’ve always known I am impulsive and self disruptive, but I’ve only just kind of noticed after thinking something like how bad it is, and I’m just wondering is this part of bpd and do other people experience this and how can it be changed. So for example today, I didn’t sleep all night was doing cocaine till about 1pm today about 5pm I said to myself and meant it genuinely, felt like I really was serious for once, said I’ve had enough of doing this, and it’s selfish and I’m bored of it and had enough of repeating this cycle & that I’m not going down this route, because I know what’s happened in the past when I’ve abused drugs to much. I even said to my friends that I do drugs with, I was going to distance myself from them & obviously I have said this to myself before, but I like felt really serious this time. Bearing in mind I still haven’t slept, without even realising to myself what I said earlier I go and get more on tick when I’m skint and have an early morning hospital appointment, so deep down I know it’s a bad idea but just don’t even think about the consequences, even though my normal self is the biggest stress head and overthinker, but for some reason when I do these self disruptive things, I somehow just don’t care almost and just think will be fine. And I went ahead got drugs, eventually started to feel the regret flowing in, then quickly realised the conversation I had earlier, and literally felt baffled, because I didn’t know I was so kind of out of control with my own head, that I can go from being stressed and feeling terrible n hating myself n think I’m really fed up and done with this, to literally just reckless. I’m just wondering is this normal with bpd and i’ve just never really noticed it before and if so, is there anyway to control yourself when you go into the self disrupt careless mindset, like how do you get your normal self back that thinks logically, because I can see this is like one massive problem in my life, and in the past that mindset got me to a point I was an alcoholic, doing cocaine whenever I got the chance and on a rehab list and eventually jumped off a bridge, because of hating myself so much n rhen doing it over again, then feeling terrible later on.

he was saying stuff like he had been miserable before he met me and i made him happy, that he wasn't going to khs because i was there. then what went wrong after that was when we were being intimate, he told me he loved me, when we had really not known each other for very long before that. that's when i kind of noped out and distanced myself. when we were talking about it he said that he feels like he used me and fucked with my feelings. that's when i cut it off because i was hurt and didn't want that to happen to me again

so then later he had a panic attack and said he needed an ambulance. i was confused and he told me that i made him feel better and now i was leaving he felt so much worse again. I don't judge him for anything and i know he can't control it.
later after this he got dissociative amnesia and completely forgot everything that happened. i was completely wiped from his memory as a defense mechanism.

this is when i really fucked up, because i kept talking to him. at first i only said the good things that happened; he said that was okay and we agreed to be friends.
after this i thought that he was stable again so i told him more about what happened, and that i felt hurt, violated and stupid. he went back into crisis.
I did what I could; I called another ambulance, checked in at his, talked him through it and offered to do anything I could to help.
though he ended up telling me that this was my fault. I’d been bedridden and very consumed by guilt after this. it's really triggered my own mental health issues

One of my personal values is that I don’t think that is is anyone’s fault, unless that person was abusive. And I’m so, so worried that what I did was fucked up, and potentially slightly emotionally abusive, it reminds me of when I was abused emotionally by my ex fp of 3 years. He told me he was vulnerable and didn’t want to know what went wrong. I selfishly told him anyway…

This was about a week and a half ago. We actually only knew each other for a few days. But I know for sure that this person is my new FP.

you've made my life hell. i engage with all kinds of jerks and ass-hats because of my lack of emotional boundaries. nobody understands my disorder. ""yeah babe, i understand."" no fucking don't. partners don't understand their borderline partner's condition unless they don't educate themselves on how bpd works, unless they communicate to their partners about their symptoms instead of letting the partner do all the healing alone and being a jerk + unsupportive. 

you can't understand what your borderline partner is experiencing if you don't know the basics of what is the root of bpd. childhood trauma. deepseated childhood trauma. don't ask me why I keep doubting if you'll leave me at the first chance you get. fear of abandonment is a real thing. talk. listen. please be there for me. make a bloody effort you fool. I'm at the verge of killing myself but sure I'll put up with your emotional unavailability and never leave you. and yes, I'm always at the verge of killing myself and that's no joke. and if you're offended by that, that's cus you don't know suicidal tendencies are like an integral impact of bpd among rage episodes, intense feelings, fear of abandonment and a ton of crap I put up with.

Did I make a mistake by telling FP I don't wanna meet them anymore?,1695239476.0,"CW: ex-boyfriend, relationship, sh, suicidal thoughts,?

  
I have impulsively decided to stop texting my favourite person on Friday. He was my first boyfriend. I don't have a therapist at the moment who I could discuss this with, and my sister is just happy about me getting rid of anyone in my life since she always ""admits"" to never liking them.. so I wanted some advice from here:) My decision relies on the fact of how much my happiness depends on his attention to me. I probably should mention that he's ten years older than me (we met when I was 16). He broke up with me after taking my V-card but kept in contact with me, and we usually slept with each other. I tried breaking contact before when I started a new relationship, but after a few months, I saw so much I disliked in my partner that I decided to text my ex again.  
This sounds like he's a horrible guy, but I always liked spending time with him. It was kinda like the best friendship I've ever had whenever we just chatted. Whenever I knew I had to go home soon, I already got super upset and would often sh when back home.. I don't have many friends and the only other contact I have is with my now other ex-boyfriend (he never was my favourite person). I get told to look for new friends and relationships, but they never seem to get it right. They are either so overly obsessed with me that they annoy me or they think I'm weird and end up abandoning me.  
What I texted him last Friday was basically ""I don't think we should meet anymore. I'm sad to think that you'll never love me and I'll never trust you because I'll always think you're cheating on me. you make me lose hope in men. if they were all like you'd wish I was never born."" his only reply was ""Sorry"" (There is a bit of a language barrier so I never really expect big replies, but it still hurt).  
I have done similar in the past to him.. worse actually because I blamed him for some stuff I did. But after saying sorry he was okay with it. I think I also like him because he's the only person who actually listens when I have suicidal thoughts and replies in a way that reminds me of a Buddhist monk?  
Anyway... I feel like I'm having withdrawal symptoms almost like a drug addict. Did I make a mistake in cutting him out completely or should I text him and say sorry.. or maybe something else entirely??

It is what it is.,1694972853.0,"Sorry, English isn't my first language but I really needed to take this off my chest.  
  
Just yesterday, an ex-best friend of mine just told me to fuck off.  
  
We were really close, and when we met the connection was almost immediate. It happened at the end of oct/2020. Used to talk every single day, vent, just live our lives as a pair. Shared interests, both very passionate about what we liked.  
  
Lately (since february of this year), he started acting strange. Barely answered my messages, didn’t even view the videos I sent him.  
  
Two months ago, he started posting pictures of his new friends, at parties and overall just having a really good time — While this happened, he straight up just didn’t visualize anything related to me anymore.  
  
The part that really bugged me is that he hadn’t expressed no sign of discomfort while talking to me, and he still followed me mutually in every social media we shared and even had me in his Close Friends™.  
  
One time, some months ago I followed a pretty girl that was recommended to me by Instagram, and only yesterday I came to discover she was his new best friend/gf.  
  
The girl posted a selfie in her stories and I just said something along the lines of “Looking really good with this makeup!!”, and like, 5 minutes later she replied with “Fuck yourself!!” followed by a picture of her, that motherfucker and a boy I don’t know, all with their middle fingers up.  
  
She blocked me when I opened the picture.  
  
This really hurt, and then came the realization that maybe I’m a bad person.  
  
To add, I’m autistic and really struggle with social cues, especially if they are being displayed online. Venting about this with another person made me notice he was purposefully being rude as fuck with me all this time. Either way, I just feel helpless.  
  
Is there a way to cope with this?

My partner probably has depression and I don't know how to help,1694963474.0,"Everything he is saying points to him being severely depressed at the moment, and the BPD in me is going crazy because he doesn't know if he wants to be with me anymore. He hasn't known for months and I keep telling myself that if he doesn't know by now, then he doesn't want to be with me. But then on the flip side, if he's suffering with depression, would that mean he can't think positively about us in any way and can't know what he wants? 
He's unhappy in other areas of his life not just our relationship. 

I dont know how to help without splitting and just telling him to fuck off and leave me. In my head that's what I think is going to happen, but I am still holding onto that tiny bit of hope that maybe he just needs help.

Telling him to go to his GP is a no go, he doesn't want antidepressants and struggles with the NHS not helping people when they need it (experienced this myself a lot) 

Telling him to get self-help guides etc won't work because he knows he can access them and has ADHD too so finds it difficult to follow on or carry out anything like that. 

Telling him to go private is also a no go because he's very stressed about money and drowning in debt.

I was told my whole life by my adopted parents that my bio mom was an evil person who never loved me and my bio dad loved me so much. As I got older I found out that it was the opposite. But because of all my childhood trauma and genetics I ended up with bpd, bipolar 1, anxiety and c-ptsd. I recently was able to move out of my adopted parents home and move across country to be with my bio mom. I’ve been here for over two months and it’s been a big lifestyle change. With my adopted parents I was given the most expensive things and taken on lots of vacations. Now with my mom we are living in government housing for the mentally ill. And recently our apartment got a massive flood from heavy rains. In the two months I’ve been here I haven’t had much issue with my mental health. But the stress of moving across country into government assisted housing and then the flood, my mental state has declined a bit. When I woke up this morning I wasn’t in a good headspace so I stayed in my room because I didn’t want to snap at my mom or my 4 year old sister. I finally got up at 11:30am and my mom wouldn’t say a word to me. Then it was time to go get my sister from preschool and I always go with to get her so I was getting dressed and my mom told me I wasn’t allowed to go and to go back to my room until dinner and not interact with my sister tonight. When she got back from getting my sister she came in and started yelling at me for not getting up this morning. I tried to explain to her that I didn’t want to snap at her or my sister and she went off on me saying that’s she’s stressed too and that I need to get over it.

I’m fixated on this boy and it clouds my every waking moment,1694349351.0,"

I was diagnosed with BPD when i turned 18 and ever since then it’s been a roller coaster. 

I wanted some advice on how to cope with the favorite person obsessions.

There is this boy at work who I’ve had a crush on for a few months. We drunkenly kissed on a night out but he told me nothing can come of it because he’s going abroad across the globe in a few months and doesn’t have a return ticket (he’s originally from that country) and doesn’t know if he’ll ever come back. This was the first red flag where i should have got out of there before the feelings really developed but it was too late. I went abroad for two weeks and came back feeling slightly over it but seeing him again made them all come back. We ended up talking for a while and kissed again but this time SOBER. I knew that meant something and we said we would keep anything private between us from our co-workers. 

Fast forward a few days and I’ve become completely obsessed again. He is on my mind nearly every waking moment and I can’t seem to shake to what so ever. I can’t seem to get him out of my head and it’s starting to really drain me. I have no idea where we stand now after that kiss and I asked him if he wanted to come out after work with me and he said he was tired and probably going home, but when the entire group was going out he changed his mind. I don’t know if this is my own head playing tricks on me or if i’m being manipulated. 

I just wanted some advice on how to cope with the obsessive thoughts and not have it plague my every waking moment. I feel like i’m in a constant state of distress bombarded by anxiety and decisions of whether to text him or not, whether to talk to him or not, even thinking about what i’m doing wrong. I’m in a constant battle in my head asking am i doing too much? too little? if i do this what will happen, if i don’t do this then that might happen. It’s draining and scares me the way that it can drag down my mood so quickly and intensely. I even have self destructive thoughts of ruining any potential by being too much, just so that i don’t have to think about it anymore

How do you handle conflicting diagnoses from different doctors?,1694340055.0,"Ugh I've always thought my psychiatrist was kind of shit, he apparently worships Reagan and only spends like 10 minutes a session with me and keeps asking me if I'm religious and when am I going back to church??? (Left the church years ago having been raised in it and never looked back)

I hate that he doesn't advertise himself as Christian focused but does this to his patients. Anyway... my lovely psychiatrist left and I was handed over to a new one in her office a long time ago. And I feel too over it to care. He gives me my meds, I want to take them at this dose, he agrees whatever. 


But a legitimate psychologist (my therapist) who I find to be very sane, thoughtful, caring, and intelligent has recently diagnosed me with Borderline. I brought this to my psychiatrist of 10ish years and was met with the standard, ""you dont have that, those patients are very hard to deal with, you're very easy to deal with, you dont want that."" I think it's relevant that I'm relatively quiet, with high social anxiety, avoidant, and a  high-functioning variant of Borderline, meaning I can hold a steady full-time office job and a relationship of a couple years. But it's the first in my life longer than 3 months where he isn't abusive. And it really only started being functional after I restarted medications, which I've quit cold turkey several times in my life during depressive episodes.

Ok, first of all, as if I chose to have this disorder. Second, does having BPD necessitate breaking down in front of the psychiatrist and telling him to fucking hurt himself or something?? Does it necessitate a history of alcoholism or inpatient or cutting?  Has he spent more than ten minutes with me in a session in this whole year? Did he give any thought to the diagnosis other than to say ""well, I don't want to deal with another one, so I'm going to deny that's even possible and hope things stay the same""

Like wtf man is it because you think I have a dumb female therapist, Mr. Christian Republican know-it-all? She is a licensed psychologist who has been practicing for decades and has also treated borderlines before. Ofc, he didn't care to find that out, just hurried me out of his virtual office. Fucking making bank off being lazy and careless with patients like me. 

So idk if it's even a conflicting diagnosis, because he seemed not to even look into it or even want to acknowledge it. But my therapist has diagnosed me and we started going through DBT. 

I want to know if any of you have dealt with having your reality questioned by doctors, and how common it really is to be misdiagnosed with BPD, maybe if you really had something else going on. 

I've only heard that it's common to be misdiagnosed with bipolar, but in my case my mood swings are very clearly shorter and attributed to triggering events, I'm def not bipolar. My past diagnoses are complex PTSD, GAD, panic disorder with OCD features, and some mild depressive episodes. 

Anyway, what are your experiences with misdiagnoses?

I'm shaking writing this out of pure anxiety and panic so sorry for horrible wording of things. I feel nauseous and dizzy.also paraphrasing coz its complicated with unnecessary details. 

Few days ago I was excited to show my friends something and they responded with a few vague words and it really crushed me and made me feel uncared for. I was sad at the time and was expressing my feelings to another public group about it (not mentioning her, just about my excitedness being annoying to people.)

Yesterday she was upset and hurt when she found out what I said because to her it felt like I was making a targeted attack behind her back. She said I could've just mentioned how she made me feel. 

I didn't want to do that because they always get upset when I ask stuff like ""are you mad at me?"" And ""do you hate me?"" All the time. I didn't know how to win in that scenario. 

I told her that and also that I obviously never meant to upset her and I was never mad, just sad and needed to vent. I was never calling her out or anything. 

She never responded. Its been a day and yea, I have kind of freaked out begging them to respond and just tell me if they are mad at me. I've been sick all day just on my phone waiting for them to respond. 

I didn't fucking mean to make anyone upset but my feelings again ended up hurting someone and now its my fault for causing pain again. And I have to apologise and beg for forgiveness. Again.

But I'm also hurting so bad from this too and I know if I say that they'll say I'm manipulating things and making myself be the victim. But no,im just suffering and in pain and I can't control that

I absolutely hate the way medication makes me feel and I was very open to trying tons of different options from tons of different psychiatrists.

Struggling to Relate,1693926186.0,"Reading some of the posts here I can’t help but feel a bit like the odd man out. I’ve been formally diagnosed with BPD and managed to come to terms and acknowledge that yes, I might have a spooky scary personality disorder, but reading through this subreddit and what other people who share my diagnosis generally say I’m even starting to question the psychologist who diagnosed me. 

I wouldn’t describe myself as a jealous or possessive person, hell I could probably count the times I’ve felt like that in a romantic context on one hand, which is also why I’m poly (by choice, and very happy with that). 
I still get intensely obsessed with new, shiny people and enter a stage of what I’d describe as lovestruck mania. That usually lasts for a few weeks before I either loose interest completely or calm down a little, but can be reignited as it happened with my current fp. 
In most relationships I’ve been the more distanced one though exactly how I feel about someone can fluctuate heavily, but so far I’ve always done the breaking up in the end (usually because I lost interest in someone or they did too many tiny but wrong things). I think I’m also fairly good at managing the whole fear of abandonment thing or rationalizing my feelings and restraining myself when a small comment makes me want to cry or scream. 
Of course I got plenty of other issues and while I wouldn’t say I’m good at relationships I’m generally reflected enough to force my feelings to conform to what I deem appropriate and minimize the harm for both people. Its a ton of work manually managing and weighing the rationality of every impulse and emotion though.

Has anyone ever taken the DES assessment while receiving therapy?,1693350608.0,"Recently, I’ve experienced a severe mental breakdown - to cut a long story short, the experience resulted in several hospitalisations and taking time off work for 2 and a half month to the present date. 

The aftermath of this was me receiving a care coordinator and psychologist, who have decided that given my recent experiences, they want to do an ‘extended assessment’ to clarify my diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with BPD for close to 3 years now and when initially diagnosed, I did not have to take the DES assessment. 

DES stands for Dissociative Experiences Scale, which is essentially a test of 28 questions relating to dissociative tendencies that you rate between 0-100% based on the regularity of your experience with the posed scenario. 

This is not anything I have ever been asked to do before, and I am unsure if this is a typical part of a BPD diagnosis. I have made peace with my diagnosis and being presented with the DES has sky rocketed my anxiety that it might not have been right all along. 

The last thing I want to do is send myself down the rabbit hole by googling to try and find any form of clarity on this, and I would be immensely grateful if anyone could shed any input on this or if they have any experience (personal or not) with the DES assessment.

Never Give Up,1693098429.0,"A lot of people post about relationships and wondering if it's possible. Some of you may remember my posts and comments about mine with my wife of 12yrs. before losing her to cancer. Once I lost her, I was depressed for almost 2yrs. Anniversary of her passing is next Thursday the 31st. 

When I started coming back to myself I decided to try dating again. A friend of 3yrs admitted feels for me and one night we started dating. Didn't last long. Turned out I was only a temporary thing, and she's an addict so I found out. Not that the addiction is a problem for me, if she wanted to get clean. I'd help her through it. But after we broke up I swore I'm single for rest of my life and stopped looking. 

Fast forward few months and friends needed a place to go. They asked if they're roommate can come to. So I begrudgingly said yes. As they moved in me and the roommate started to get to know each other, compared life stories and mental issues, and we just clicked. Neither one of us were actively looking but love brought us together. 

In the few weeks we've been together she's pulled me out of my depression, pushing me to get my business back where it was prior to my depression hitting, and has me so happy that I don't really feel the need to talk about JoAnne anymore. I will forever love JoAnne, but as one of our mutual friends put it, she would want me to be happy not lonely and depressed. And Angel has reminded me what it feels like to be happy and loved. 

I did tell her about my issues, triggers, etc. She did witness a mini-episode already, and is fine with it. 

Now, really the only time I bring up JoAnne is when we're replacing something that was hers in the house or moving something that was hers elsewhere (furniture, wind chimes, things like that). Though she says she doesn't mind my talking about her since I lost her, it wasn't a breakup. 

I'm getting off track with this post now. 🤣 Point being, BPD or not we can love in our own way and can be loved. I had real, true love with JoAnne and now I have it again with Angel. And I really do believe Angel is an angel because she's so calming and happy. When I'm feeling stressed and an episode coming on, all I need to do is look at her and I can't help but to smile and I slowly calm down. 

Granted it's a new relationship and we're in the ""honeymoon"" phase so to speak, both of us want it to last and we've promised each other that no matter what we'll talk through anything and everything as it comes up. 

And being with her is even teaching me new things about myself in a way. She's half blind (lost an eye years ago so one eye is a fake eye) and she's legally deaf (literally can't hear unless her hearing aids are in). So I need to be more patient with communicating with her then I have had to be with anyone else. 

I've been thanking her everyday for coming into my life. I don't know how to put it into words but we just clicked from the day we met. 

Never feel you can't love or be loved. Communication is key. As long as your open with your partner, and they with you, you can make it work. If you're single, my advice is stop being hard on yourself and trying hard to look for it. Love will find you when and where you least expect it. And when it finds you, grab hold of it and don't let it go. Communicate and be honest with your partner and let them know that no matter what they can do the same with you. Don't worry about scaring them off, if they love you then honesty and trust will keep them around and make your relationship stronger. But if in fear, you don't talk about certain things or try to hide certain things (triggers, episodes, etc) it can make things rocky as they won't understand. 

Building a strong relationship depends upon both parties being completely open and honest and trusting with the other no matter what it is.",RedConradcom,,False,162cg30,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/162cg30/never_give_up/
Potential break up shook everything up,1693087895.0,"I really am going to try hard to summarise here because no one wants to read an absolute essay, but it's kinda hard to do so I'm sorry in advance.

I've been out of therapy for about a year now, and kinda thought I was getting on fine, still the regular anxiety issues but in terms of BPD,  kind of only really trigger based situations rather than it being a constant daily battle. But about a month or so ago when my partner of 7 yrs was literally in the process of breaking up with me it was like someone just opened the curtains and everything came flooding back. I honestly feel like I have not been awake for a long time. 

Long story short, we were able to talk some things out and I was showing some problematic behaviour that he never made me aware of, one example is that I just do not show much affection, I never have, but I guess for a while I've been cold. And I am now painfully aware I was this way, but he kind of let me get away with it, and I thought everything was fine. That's just one of the issues, but I've been working really hard to try and be more affectionate, both physically but also just saying I love you more often and things like that. 

It's kind of crazy because I thought I was managing my symptoms, but because I was never forced by him to put myself in a vulnerable position (not showing/giving affection means there's no potential for rejection), I stopped experiencing the symptoms. It turns out, I just found a really unhealthy coping strategy...now I'm in a position where it's like I'm trying a lot harder to keep the relationship, so now I feel so much more vulnerable and am seeing everything that he does or doesn't do or does or doesn't say as rejection. And it. Is. Tiring. 

He's been really stressed this week because of an audit at work, but I wanted to bring up to him that I notice the only time he says he loves me is when he's saying bye to me, so whilst I nearly got dumped for not being affectionate enough (one of many reasons), he's able to get away with only telling me he loves me when he's saying bye? Which to me, kinda sends the wrong message, and when we were working things out we both agreed we would make more of a conscious effort to say we love each other spontaneously or whatever. But because I know he's been stressed, I've kept it all inside and the audit finished on Thursday,  but I still haven't said anything. 
I know he's been so tired and overworked, so now he's asleep on the sofa downstairs. Even that has hurt me because when I went down I noticed he had got a blanket, so to me, that means he had no intention of coming to bed with me.  I know the longer I leave it I can turn back to being cold and resentful to protect myself, which just creates more problems. But I'm also SUPER scared to say anything, in case he actually just doesn't even love me anymore. 

For context, that is not just my BPD talking, but when we nearly separated he still said he has ""mixed feelings"", so it is entirely a possibility that he just doesn't want to be with me anymore, despite us saying we would work on some things.

I have BPD, bipolar and all that ""wonderful"" stuff. Anyways, as someone with BPD, I have major mood swings at the drop of a pin. When my boyfriend and I get into arguments, we just kind of give eachother space, and time to think.

Instead of staying there asking me if he could help, or even show any sort of support. He left. He fucking left. 
I felt hurt, lost, crushed, everything. I hated that feeling. 

I called him later on to tell him once again why I wanted to do that, and how I was feeling. Instead of being helpful, he screamed at me, blaming me because I left first, and he thought he was showing up to his dead girlfriend.

I want to so desperately be a good partner,1692655714.0,"Hi there! Me (20) and my girlfriend (20) have known each other for a while. We met online and slowly fell in love. It was and will always be one of the most incredible and special things I've ever gotten to experience. Going from being her friend, to being her close friend then her best and eventually her partner, is the greatest thing that could have happened to me. I was diagnosed a month ago, and although it's been great to finally have a diagnosis it's become very apparent to me that old habits are hard to break.

After months of completely random outbursts that came out of no where and disappeared almost as quickly as it came, change in daily patterns and moods and general lack of communication in the relationship and motivation in life; my girlfriend has asked to take a step back from the relationship. She's such a good person to me, she's always been so patient, gentle and just generally supportive of me in everything I do. When she called me today to ask for a break I didn't break down, or panic, I let myself just feel how much it hurt to push another person in my life away. I've decided I can't ever let someone go because of that again. Especially not my girlfriend.

I need advice on how to break out of destructive loops. I need to learn how to stop allowing my mood to be taken care of by other people and become self sufficient, so that the day I get to be with her again I can make her feel the love I used to make her feel.

*Need Support/Advice* Self Sabotaging,1692468813.0,"My FP has been the guy I’ve dated on and off (more off recently) in the last 2.5+ years. However, I have this terrible habit of self sabotaging and pushing him away by lying and making up scenarios, rebelling like a child, or starting arguments for no reason. I’m aware that it is attention-seeking behavior and is fueled by a desire to want him to want me as much as I want him and to make him chase me. 

I don’t know how to stop this. I’m 41 years old and feel like I’m acting like a bratty teenager by doing this stuff but I just can’t seem to stop. He’s the only person who has had the patience to deal with this behavior while also understanding that it’s rooted in past trauma. (Even if he’s brutally honest to the point it hurts sometimes.) 

So, I don’t know what to do and I’m frightened that today has been the last straw for him and my fear of abandonment is now taking over. Intrusive thoughts are entering my brain and I’m feeling like I’m spiraling out of control. I need support or advice. Please save me from myself.

"Can't never be alone with myself anymore. Obsessed with bf, abandonment issues",1691420640.0,"Hello people! I don't know where to write this and if this is the correct subreddit I should be writing but idc I just want to rant and get help maybe or some advice...

I'm 20F and I live with my boyfriend this whole year. And everything is so lovely and good and I'm so grateful I have him. He heals my heart... and this.. this is the bad thing. I thought leaving my parents that I was so attached to would help me with my abandonment issues that I didn't thought I had all these years and recently noticed. All my life I acted so independently, I never asked for help, I acted 25 when I was a little child, always caring about others more than myself but not a people pleaser. I just didn't care about myself much.

When I was a baby until 7-9 I was so attached to my parents I always felt empty when the house was empty once they left. I had this dread feeling in my heart and I felt it sink in and I felt the loneliness hit me like a train in only a few mins. I felt out of control and my thoughts drowned me. I couldn't stand myself at all I was so scared also. Now don't get me wrong we all have this fear as children that our parents won't return from the super market and they'll be hit by a car on the way and stuff, I had these thoughts as well but that was different. It is different still.

Fast forward to now, I have been trying to heal myself and traumas with homeotherapy and a bit of psychotherapy for the past 2-3 years. I have seen a lot of change in me I mean I do struggle with s. thoughts, self-harm, depression and many obsessions but I'm feeling healthier these past 5-6 months. But I've noticed that I'm great when only my bf is with me or I'm around people. I haven't been alone in more than a month, not even a single hour I think. I work 2 jobs for season and I return home to my bf I even cry or I express myself in front of him but never alone.. I didn't get a chance this month. And here is the deal.. today my bf unexpectedly decided to sleepover to a friend and I was waiting to go home to hug him and sleep but he told me while on work and this dread sinked my stomach again.

I felt like a little baby again. I felt alone. I felt myself for a bit. I realised I haven't been with my mind at all and I hated to feel it now all of the sudden. I needed preparation. There was a chance for him to take the last bus but he didn't and it's okay ofc he loves me a lot and he tells me every day but I felt the f abandonment issues to the core. I am not independent, I'll never be. I'll always stick to a person to be able to survive and to handle days.

I was living by myself and I ended up hospitalized and in a ward last year. I couldn't handle the situation even if I was 1 hour away from bf,parents. Now I'm far away from home and I've been clinging to him to be able to handle everything. Work is shit cuz it's work. I pushed away my 2 best friends slowly, I can't relate no more. I am alone without him. I need him more than he does, he doesn't understand what is like to be dependent with life to someone, to be so scared of them leaving you. I came home and thought immediately about s.h even tho I'm months clean and good.

Anyways all I'm trying to say is why? after all this healing, after feeling so good I accomplished things, why do I go back to 0 when I'm alone? why can't I just be? sober, healthy thoughts, alone? why baby me couldn't handle me and why can't I do it now either? how do I deal with this?

I sought out this book as per reccomended by many people in this group. I am at about the end of chapter 2, and so far this book has been both transphobic/homophobic, lumping the latter in with ""sexual perversion"" and erased the existence of intersex people (aka bad science). It's clearly dated as it references the DSM IV released in 2000 as the most recent release. Therefore much of the information information it discusses as matter of fact is likely not even accurate by todays standards. Fuck, the book even tries to speculate that the increase in fascination with tattoos could be linked with ""the rise of BPD"" when earlier in the book it mentions that there probably isnt event a rise in BPD but a rise in awareness of it. This book seems to constantly contridict its self on top of being dated and bigoted. How does anyone find this credible?? 

I know i'm not that far in it yet. So i'm going to keep reading and give it a genuine chance. But at this point it seems likely that I am going to try to steer people clear of this book.

Please help me I can't cope My boyfriend broke up with me and I literally was only living for him and I don't know what to do with myself.,1690808157.0,"please anyone any advice will be so appreciated

he broke up with me after almost a year of being together and he was my first everything and our relationship was perfect but the past few months we've been arguing a lot because I overreact but the first day we met I told him I had bpd but he never put the effort in to learn about it and he triggers me a lot and I try not to get upset but if I don't bring it up I feel a heavy pain in my chest and head and Im just not okay so I just bring up every little thing so he can reassure me.

I have only one friend and she introduced me to him and after we got together I practically relied on him for everything and the only reason Ive been looking froward to the future or trying to not self sabotage as much is because im waiting for when we move in together and can get married etc I don't have a job and im out of education so tbh I just wanted to be his housewife or smthn were still young but I was gonna just cope in the meantime. Also this may sound weird but my father isn't in the picture at all and sometimes when im upset I age regress and I would kind of see him as a parental figure and I basically put him in the role of being like my dad so I honestly feel like I've been left by my ""dad"" as well I know its unhealthy and weird but it just kinda happened and neither of us minded that occasional dynamic it was the safest and most comforted I ever felt.

Also he was the only one I could come to for my panic attacks and he would know how to comfort me and we would go on call every single night so if I was ever having trouble he would be there and like I said id not really abbe anyone else so now im so alone. How can I be okay when I surrounded and based my whole life on him. He said all we do is hurt each other and its not good for us we have got into physical fights a little before but most of the time any argument was over text but when we were actually together we didn't fight often and really got along.

He texted me a long paragraph saying he just wants to be alone and he's going ghost on everyone apparently cause he wants to focus on work and what he's capable of and I absolutely just broke down I've hurt myself many times before because of our arguments but for the first time I haven't self harmed im almost so devastated I can't even will myself to do it also I wanted to prove to him that I could control myself cause one of his reasons was I hurt myself cause of our relationship so we shouldn't be together so I wanted to show him I could improve but despite not hurting myself I've been more suicidal than ever because not only is my favourite person gone but also any future I had. I have no friends no hobbies no opportunities no nothing I feel so lost.

he blocked me on mostly everything the last thing he didn't block me on I frantically texted him and tried to call him I said I want to die and he said I was threatening suicide on him but I promise I wasn't I was just trying to have him understand how much its emotionally impacted me we went on one last call and I was bawling my eyes out telling him how much I need him and he said ""I told you not to give up everything for one person"" he was so cold and this guy I knew who was there for me and took care of me was just gone he just sat by and didn't care how his girlfriend having a mental breakdown I told him I couldn't do it and he just told me to calm down and he has to do this for himself.

I literally have no life without him I feel like the only thing I can do is not live anymore im not hurting myself in the hopes he will come out of this eventually and we can get together again he was the love of my life and the man I wanted to have kids with and do everything with.

someone please help me with any advice since he's broken up and blocked me I have constant anxiety in the day and panic attacks and the one person who was there for them is gone my heart hurts and won't stop beating rapidly I have no motivation for anything and I can't bring myself to eat or drink.",Tomi-Ren,,False,15efgrd,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/15efgrd/please_help_me_i_cant_cope_my_boyfriend_broke_up/

I got married 3 months ago officially today and I've noticed my mental health going downhill pretty rapidly. It started with the classic imposter syndrome and feeling like I tricked my husband into this. Then came the loss of confidence in myself almost like I don't deserve any of this. Next came the depression and the anger balled into one. Which led me into tonight where I for a lack of better words... told my husband point blank that I no longer wanted to exist. 

I feel like I'm going absolutely crazy within myself and I know it's really because of the big change. I know that I just really need to take the time to readjust and establish safe spaces for myself.

Dating app advice,1690318691.0,"I recently came across a guy on a dating app whom I went on a couple dates with in 2015. (I'm very good with remembering faces!) At that time in my life, I was incredibly dysregulated and undiagnosed/untreated, and was using sex and substances as coping/connection.

Out of curiosity, I looked back at our texts. Apparently, we sexted A LOT and, also apparently, had sex once or twice. (I have very poor recall of this time.) We ended things after he stopped responding and I got prickly and confronted him. He apologized and told me I was ""amazing and beautiful,"" and that I deserve honesty. He said he gotten sick, and during that time he realized that he wants a relationship, which at the time I said I did not want. I got mad and texted something snide, and he did not respond. I totally get it. Again, dysregulation.

Now in 2023, I am looking for a relationship. I'm medicated, in therapy, and actively working on getting my life together. I remember liking him, and would be interested in seeing him again.

Part of my BPD means that I get SO excited about someone, and then do Too Much.

My question is, would it be weird if I texted him again, after 8 years, to say that I saw him on the app and would be down to reconnect if he is? Is that Too Much?

Is it normal to feel lazy and exhausted with life despite having no major difficulties?,1690155098.0,"I've been experiencing some feelings of laziness and exhaustion with life lately, and I'm wondering if others have gone through similar experiences. Despite coming from a supportive family where I've never lacked basic necessities like food, shelter, and money, I often feel like I'm just lazy and unable to cope with life's demands.

There have been instances where I've been very focused on certain activities, almost to the point of neglecting rest, in my pursuit of progress and achieving goals. However, at some point, I inevitably hit a wall, and everything spirals into depression. This pattern has been persistent throughout my life, and I'm currently 45 years old, feeling like it's all catching up to me.

Recently, I've been in a prolonged period of depression, which is unusual for me as it usually lasts for shorter durations. Although I don't contemplate self-harm, I find myself questioning the purpose of everything, feeling utterly exhausted and drained by life's demands.

I'd like to know if anyone else has experienced something similar, or if there's any insight or advice you could offer regarding these feelings.

Seeking Experiences: Life with Borderline Personality Disorder at 60+ Years,1689955600.0,"Hello everyone,

I'm seeking insights and experiences from individuals aged 50 years or above who have been living with BPD.

Studies suggest that individuals with BPD face a high risk of suicide, which is reportedly 400 times higher than the general population. As someone diagnosed with BPD just over a year ago, I am currently facing challenges coping with the symptoms, and it has been a lifelong struggle for me. I know you understand it's exhausting. Initially diagnosed with chronic depression, I only learned about BPD recently.

I've observed that many individuals with BPD can often work ""normally,"" but I personally have struggled to maintain stable employment, with my longest job lasting just over two years. At present, I feel hopeless, unemployed, relying on savings, and uncertain about my future survival.

Given the impact BPD can have on individuals and their surroundings, I'm particularly interested in hearing from those who have reached the age of 60 and beyond while living with BPD. I want to learn about how you have coped with the challenges and emotional struggles that come with this disorder over the years. Can you share whether you feel life with BPD has been fulfilling and worth it? 

Thank you for sharing your experiences and providing guidance within the BPD Support community. ❤️

I Feel Stuck,1689844332.0,"(TW: SI)

I'm too mentally ill to maintain any relationships. If people can get past my social anxiety (and not many people do), then my BPD scares them away. My sadness is too intense for them. People tell me I can lean on them for support but then it's too much for them and all the support they've given me is gone. I'm completely isolated again. I'm angry at them, but I also know logically that they need to do it for their mental health. But why is it that what's best for everyone's mental health is worst for mine? I feel so fucking stuck and I don't see a way out. I can't be close or genuine with anyone because it pushes them away. I can't take living like this. I want to die so much but it scares me. I wish I was braver because then I could either make new friends or just end it. I'm stuck here. I just want to sleep until my appointment with my new therapist.

Interesting interaction with medical professional - UK NHS,1689725509.0,"
I was in seeing a mental health professional today. 

I've tried cbt several times and I've never ""completed"" it some of the times there were internal errors, some times I moved out of the area and sometimes I was the issue and found cbt so harmful to myself I had to stop for the good of my health. 

I have been asking for dbt for years now but because I'm ""not in an active crisis"" they won't refer me to it. I was seeking help yet again today and the medical professional likened the fact I haven't ""completed"" cbt to ""not completing a dose of antibiotics"" and that leaving the ""dose unfinished means it can never help, so we don't actually know if cbt doesn't help"" they said this was ""tough love"" and  referred me bakc to a psychologist which I'm grateful for, however I'm worried I'm just going to be given cbt again and not have my worries listened to.
Does anyone have any insight or similar experiences with this? I'm in the UK specifically going through NHS Scotland. 

I'm trying to get better so I don't fuck up yet another relationship after stumbling across the nicest and most understanding human. He doesn't deserve the bs bpd can bring and I've done my best healing and understanding my bpd on my own but I struggle still with abandonment.

I then said wow I hate these kinds of talks I'm still not used to it. To which he wS surprised and said how I should be used to it after how long we've been together at this point. 

My thoughts; I went through prolonged trauma for almost a decade. A year year a half won't just change what I experienced and learned how to cope with (in an unhealthy way) for so long. Am I wrong?

Just a little look inside the mind of an average pwBPD,1689299733.0,"can really only speak from my perspevtive on love and BPD. Here are some signs of love in my experience as a pw BPD.

I will tell you I love you, but I'm not good about talking about my feelings always, so I might not do it regularly.
I will do nice things for you, presents, cook, favors, clean, things you like, or that I know will make you happy. Because when you are happy I am happy.
I look into your eyes longer if I love you. I will always be looking at you, like a weirdo, because I am infatuated by you.
I want to talk to you all the time. I want you to know everything that happens when we are apart- this is where my clingy/neediness takes control- and often where I get discarded.
I will try to be on my best behavior for as long as I can- bc I know that when you really see the evil inside of my disorder — you will leave, especially if you made it through needy land.
I will always dress up for you, nice new clothes, hair done, make up on. If I look good maybe you will think twice about leaving.
I will always ask for your opinion and advice on things of importance and things that aren't that important, because I can't ever make a decision of my own volition. What if you didn't like what I chose? Devastation.
I will test you regularly- I will question if your seeing someone else, bc I love you and bc I need a steady flow of reassurance and validation of our relationship often. This is because my jealousy detector is very sensitive and extremely temperamental when it comes to faithfulness- again I NEED validation, and reassurance you love me and your not leaving.
I will show my love for you through my sexuality. I will be trying to please you by meeting all of your needs (people pleaser). Sex increases our intimacy, and we both fall in deeper. I will use our sex regularly to “center my crazy”, and to regulate my emotions from anxiety, anger, or depression to shift my mood, but you won't know this.
I will compliment you on everything from your intellect to your choice of toothbrush. I do genuinely like the things I compliment you on, but this probably gets pretty annoying (Clinger).
I will idealize you and put the king of “Nevergonnahappenland” on a beautifully detailed jade encrusted throne on the highest peak in all the land. There you will sit to be admired and displayed by all the people of the valley (aka the Pedestal). ☆You will stay on the pedestal until the first bad storm crashes in and reduces the castle, king, and throne to a pile of rubble.
I will put the people I love before me in every way possible to make sure they are taken care of. Because if I make them safe and happy, they will love and accept me.
I will read or send you articles about things you are interested in- bc I want to learn, but bc we can connect in every possible way.
I will open up to you- this takes me a long time and I have to know that we are solidly committed.
I will tell you that I trust you- this is very hard for me as well.
I will bring you around my whacky ass family- its a sure sign that you are a keeper.
I will tell you about my good days with alot of energy and passion (excited-happy) AND about my bad days with the same type of energy and passion (sullen-angry).
Ill be extra supportive- your own cheerleader, even if I really don't like what i’m cheering for. I am a pleaser and I am trying to be accepted and seen as normal.
I'll sacrifice things I like to do just to appease you- such as giving up a hobby or alone time to watch sports if you ask. Although I hate watching sports and I will resent you for this later.
I will do anything you ask of me as long as I'm capable, it won't get me in trouble, and it's not too dangerous.
I will probably suffocate you, and you will want to suffocate me with a pillow while I sleep. 🤣
I will write, sing, and play songs about you, you'll be the topic of life, because I have no idea who the hell I am???
You will think I'm the greatest thing that's ever happened to you- until I feel jealous, criticized, slighted, taken advantage of, threatened, disappointed, overwhelmed, engulfed, or underappreciated- should I keep going???

THE SPLIT: TARGET IDENTIFIED

I am thinking of things in black and white now, I am hurt by something, you are responsible, you are the villian, I am the victim, your trying to get to me, I am scared and I feel unsafe, my world is upside down- I panic and I just attack. I start with a gut punch and it ends with your heart ripped out and stepped on with my aviator boot.

THE HIDDEN ASSASSIN: LOCKED AND LOADED

You are astounded by what is happening. You have never seen the evil beast that lies within. This beast lies dormant until it gets provoked. I been suppressing all of my anger and frustrations since we first met, but the monster is up, awake, and out for blood. Your blood. I can't hold it back, its just so strong, and I know this evil creature is doing the thinking now and IT WILL KILL ME if I don't do something. I am in a heightened panic induced state of mind- logical reasoning doesn't exist here- and it's KILL OR BE KILLED — so I KILL…

TARGET LOCKED- SHOOT TO KILL

I'm fuming- seeing everything I did for you, and comparing it to what you've done for me. It never lines up bc I always give too much than I could ever receive back, and I know this in hindsight, but while its happening I am completely unaware. My brain goes berserk I start to compute and equate the lack of gestures and words into disappointment. This disappointment makes it seem like you don't love me, and that your just using me, and then my mind is made up… I'VE BEEN HAD!!!! Well f#$% this! I'm not putting up with this shit- so I can give and give and never receive? Don't think so- so I curse you out going on and on about these insane accusations that I just dialoged in my head, and throw in some personal things you don't like about yourself, added with some insults, and some things I don't like about you- and then I either discard you or I go silent or I do both.

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED- THIS PERSON CAN SELF DESTRUCT AT ANY TIME- KILLING ANYONE IN HER PATH- PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

THE DEBRIEFING:

MISSION FAILED — WRONG INDIVIDUALS TARGETED- 2 CRITICALLY INJURED, 1 POSSIBLE FATALITY.

Welcome to loving ME- A woman with BPD (Critical injury survivor #1)

I typically love you right up until the minute I hate you. I don't want to be this way, its just the way it is though. Hurting you really does hurt me (Critical injury survivor #2) and I hate myself for the way I behaved towards you… (relationship fatality)

If you are very important to me I will come back to apologize and try to repair the damage I've done. But its often that the person is not wanting to fix it.

It's so frustrating,1689118075.0,"My ex bf dumped me about 5 weeks ago now and I just read somewhere on reddit him saying that if I really loved him I wouldn't have tried to kill myself. The problem is that I tried it once, Just one time. There were other nights where I took more of my medication than prescribed but those were definitely not suicide attempts, I only did it one time! I took a crazy amount of pills, everything I could find and really thought it would be enough but eventually I woke up at the hospital 3 days later. Since then, every time I took more pills than I was supposed to, he saw it as another suicide attempt, which it was clearly not. Because of that one serious attempt where I took about 80 pills or something, I know that 5 or 10 pills won't kill me. And when my emotions got to high I just took like 10 pills just to be asleep fast and hopefully for 12 hours or something. Taking 10 pills happened, I think, 2 times. But he still thinks those were suicide attempts as well. And now he's telling people I tried to kill myself 3 times which is absolutely not true! And that if I really loved him I wouldn't have done that to him 3 times, so in other words, he is saying I didn't love him! 
But it's the complete opposite, I loved him SO MUCH I know I can never find love like that again, he was my one true love, the love of my life, my one and only... so reading this of him saying I didn't love him hurts me so much! 

I live in the Netherlands and we have ""life ending clinics"" here, he knows I signed up last year, but as far as I know he doesn't know I got accepted... I got this news last week and I'm so thankful to know that I only have to live for another 2 years max. Because I can't take it anymore... the pain, the hurt, the crying, not being able to eat for 5 weeks now because of the BU... 

I just wish and hope and really want him to know that I did really, truly love him with all my heart, because if those 2 years have gone and I finally get to let go of this world and all of this pain and sadness and die, I really would want him to know my love for him was real, very real, like I never felt before  for anyone.

I just wanted to be understood sometimes. I don't want to say too much about my parents but I feel like maybe it was an attention thing I was seaking? I just wish there was more situations like this that I could read about.

He is so similar to me. 

And he keeps saying this how alike we are, i dont say it because i know my tendencies to overempathize and mirror. We have similarities, hes dedicated disciplined about working out. 
Its weird going down his insta we have posted similar things over the years and same halloween costumes over the year. 

Hes a scorpio sun sag moon, i am a sag sun scorpio moon (that may or may not mean anything lol butttt) 
I actively disconnect to give him space and also holding myself accountable for not oversharing or anything. We talk dat to day and ask how each others week was type of deal - our snap streak usually break every 4 days or so just cuz we get busy and i like that. 

But today he hasnt watched my insta stories or seen my snap and i am obsessively /compulsively checking my socials.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I’m afraid I’m too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I’d he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me….. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can’t and won’t get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",Old-Meet-1322,,False,14q52w4,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/14q52w4/bpd_cptsd_bipolar_2/

I’ve been fixating on this one friend of mine for years now, though I know he’s emotionally unavailable & we’d be a pretty awful match. I still can’t let go of him as a favorite person. I thought I was doing better about him, not as jealous or obsessive because I’ve been trying to work on this with my therapist but I was obviously very mistaken.
He recently mentioned a pretty girl hitting on him at work and explicitly saying she’d come back to see him. Idk why but despite knowing we’re probably never gonna date, I got really jealous & dissociated hard. The fact that he’s publicly mentioning this might mean he’s only emotionally unavailable to me, not potential other girls…and it’s feeling awful bc I listen to all of his interests and gift him things and just generally been around for quite some time yet he’s never called me a pretty girl or anything.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m thankful to be friends with him but part of me holds on to hope & it’s just been shattered. I know, silly. 
I thought I should go out & meet someone to move on, but I just can’t see myself with anyone else. I can’t engage. My heart’s not in it. And men also sort of scare me. I’m awful in social settings as well, so I have a hard time forming bonds with people. I just don’t want to be so alone, but idk how to change that. I understand it’s not gonna be him but my heart doesn’t budge on the matter.
In all honesty, if he dates someone, idk how I’ll survive it. Sometimes it feels like he’s my whole world. I’m supposed to see him in a few days & pretend I’m ok. What if this was my last chance at being with him? What if she does come back & they end up dating? What the hell do I do?
I know I should tell all this to my therapist & I will, but right now I just need to know if someone on here experienced something like this & how you managed to come on the other side of it? I’m so lost and hurt.

PS: he’s autistic if that may help. And I’ve never flirted openly out of fear of losing him if he did not reciprocate.

Is it too much to ask for friends to not get defensive/angry?,1688194873.0,"The title isn't passive aggressive, I truly am wondering where the limits are of a friendship. Because I dont know- apparently my idea of friendships is different to what societies is.

My friends know about my BPD diagnosis, and although I haven't spoken in depth about it because its a VERY difficult issue for me, they know how it affects me and relationships.
Constantly i overreact to little things they say or do and sometimes end up lashing out and upsetting them, and I hate myself every single day for it.
I've been trying to be better and learn, but its not easy to change how my brain works, even though one of them have tried to tell me to just not think like this. He didn't mean it maliciously, just out of ignorance of how BPD works.

Recently I'm having another bad time with them, overanalysing and having immense paranoia and insecurity, and crippling fear etc. They hadn't texted me in a day and it made me freak out and ask if I did anything wrong, and I felt worse when it took them a while to respond. Logically I know ""okay, its human, thats how it is"" but I just can't reason with myself.

And then to make things worse, when they did respond, they first were confused why I was asking and played it off like it was nothing, and then immediately got defensive and asked ""did ***I*** do something to upset you?? Is this why you're asking?"" And then told me it hurts ***them*** when I ask, because it makes them feel like THEY did something wrong.

And of course this spiraled me horribly. I just apologized a bunch and left. I wanted to say something, to say that I was just looking for assurance and comfort, or even just understanding that my brain just does this. But instead I felt like they blamed me and shamed me for this.

But as the fool I am, I thought someone will still stay with me. I don't think that is ever possible now. Last year, my parents told me how my sexual harrassment means nothing to them as it is not rape. I was shattered. Took an overdose of tranqs and cut myself. I never expected my parents to be nice, but I hoped they would be, and then this happened. That last bit of hope died inside of me. My then boyfriend didnt give 2 shits about it. I was depressed and asked him to just sit with me so I can study, he blatantly refused. He also abused me verbally. Told me he has to spoonfeed me and that I am nothing without him. He was my best friend for an year and then we dated for 1.75 years. He abandoned me when I needed him the most. I broke up with him. Additionally he was a nightmare for someone with OCD. And I decided not to date again as with all the issues I have, I didnt expect someone would stay.

I was suggesting something else and he wouldnt listen. My anger got a hold of me and I started throwing stuff around. He got scared. We had conversations about it and he was not at all fine mentally by me throwing stuff angrily as he felt I would have thrown stuff at him too if we were together in person (there are reasons for his fear, it is not irrational) couple days later i split on him. And then i apologised. And he said the apology is sudden and he can't believe I am sorry. I tried convincing him it was legit and at one point i said ""i have bpd, i change"". next day he sent me articles on splitting. he said he  doesnt know how to handle this. (before all this he was pretty exhausted due to recurring fights between us) He said he doesnt  even  know if he *can,* handle this. Which i completely understand, it is not easy. i dont expect anyone to ever handle me. 

&#x200B;

Then things changed drastically. He has some serious issue at his home. He really cant focus on anything else right now He still texts me. He still asks about my therapy and how I am. But things between us are sensitive now and I dont see him coming back. I dont expect he will, i just wish, and hope, and want, and need him to come back. He is all i can think of. I believe I deserve this abandonment. I am damaged beyond repair and expecting someone will stay with me is far-fetched. No one will stay with me. I am hard to be with. And he is not coming back as he will be exhausted af.

&#x200B;

I have regular suicidal thoughts. I dont act on them tho, it is a discussion him and me had, and no one of us will act on those thoughts. But they are persistent. I get depressed randomly. I get stuck in ADHD Paralysis. I wish I had someone by my side. Atleast to talk to. I feel lonely and abandoned and stranded. I dont have a single clue as to what I should do next. I am waiting for the 1.5 months to pass and I can meet him.

I think I've destroyed my relationship with the only person in my life that really gave a shit about me.,1687403440.0,"I don't want to go into our full history, it's long and also obviously personal. We both struggle with our mental health and seem to clash when it comes to communication. For years I've tried to tell him how I feel, nip hurt feelings In the bud and talk them out, but it never happens. 

Best I can describe his communication style is avoidant which is honestly probably the worst for someone with BPD. When we have problems he just never says anything about it and acts like whatever it is never happened. we've been together and known each other for a really long time so of course some major issues and hurdles have cropped up throughout the years, but since he's been unwilling to we've never talked any of it through, and I can't live like that. 

The past couple of years my anger and resentment from all that never was addressed has been building over until now where it's reached maximum boiling point. He even told me that he thinks I'm not a good person sometimes, and hearing that felt like total despair. I literally just curled up In the fetal position and cried, then sleeping pilled myself to sleep. 

The thing is I don't even think he's wrong. I'm hard on myself. Extremely hard on myself, and I think I am hard on everyone around me. I can't stop thinking that I'm so irreversibly fucked up and horrible. Now I see every mistake I've ever made with him even as I continue to make them. 

I don't know what I'm expecting writing this, I know it isn't interesting to read and probably nothing anyone would have any feedback about. I want to at least get a hold of myself and stop being bitter and lashing out. It isn't an excuse, but I don't even know how to be better than what I am. 

And I know as I am I'm not fit to have any type of relationship. Not just romantic but I shouldn't and, well don't have, friendships and I have fractured relationships with family. I used to think the trouble with family relationships was because my family members have their own mental health stuff going on, but I mean what I say when I say I'm not fit for any type of relationship with other people. 

My partner is a good person unlike me and very loyal and caring. I think he's reached his breaking point because of how I am. I don't want to hurt him anymore. It's like a punch to the stomach to see him tired, hurt, and unhappy. Which is how he looks more than not the past year. so I'm going to end things and the way he was talking to me last night (the first time he's really opened up in forever) sounds like that's what he wants anyway. 

He was saying things like ""this is why it won't work out between us"" basically already calling the relationship dead. Really saw him as such a pure soul and I've gone and done the opposite of what I set out to do. Because in the beginning I was all about doing anything and everything I could to make him happy. 

The crazy thing is that he only started to actually love me when these attempts stopped. 

Maybe spending life alone isn't as terrifying as Ive always imagined. Maybe this is just how it's supposed to be for me. I know I have a lot of love to give, but it doesn't matter because I'm too damaged to give love the way the people I love deserve.

i might be in love with my best friend/fp,1687155199.0,"i am someone who has quiet bpd, and i have also been through years of intense therapy, which has helped me learn a lot of ways to control/redirect certain thought processes and other things that help me to function semi-normally w bpd. i have also learned to become very good at maintaining healthy relationships/attachments and recognizing when an attachment becomes unhealthy. however, my best friend of like 8 years is definitely 100% my fp. i feel bad because i also have 2 boyfriends (i'm poly and open), but i just cannot get her out of my fucking head. it's not even like i know this is an infatuation, this has been a constant for so long i don't even know, it has to have been over a year at this point. she is constantly occupying my thoughts, i even fucking draw her constantly in my notes when i'm in lectures.

it definitely doesn't help either that whenever i go over her house, we always end up cuddling and/or making out for HOURS. we both find each other to be really attractive, and i don't know how she feels about me (romantically) but i feel nauseous whenever i'm around her because of how intense my feelings are for her. i love her so much, it literally is killing me to keep this inside, i haven't told anyone because i don't feel like it would do any good and it would probably also just bring me a lot of unwanted attention from friends about this. it just kills me that i have no fucking clue how to tell her how i feel without destroying our friendship. i want her in my life forever, whether or not we're just friends or something more (which i highly doubt). 

it also just feels so wrong feeling this way. i know it's a bad attachment but i don't try to feed into it and i manage it in a way where our relationship is healthy. i do not completely rely on her as a source of comfort, but when i'm looking to get away from the worries of stressing about college and the mcat and other shit, going to her house and chilling with her for the day is better than therapy. her presence is so calming and comforting to me, sometimes we just sit together with a show in the background and do our own thing for hours, and i love it. i love her company, i just hate that my brain is fucking obsessed with her because again, it just feels wrong. like that's my best friend. i shouldn't be having thoughts like this about her. and not to mention the insane jealousy that i have to grit my teeth and smile through whenever she talks about how hot our other friends are, or how she wants to date xyz person. i wish i didn't feel like this, i've been doing my absolute best to make sure that this has never developed into an unhealthy situation that would hurt her because i love her so much. i know the easiest solution to this is to just talk to her, and logically knowing her i'm sure she wouldn't be extremely weirded out by it and we could have a normal conversation about it, but i feel absolutely terrified of ever bringing it up because i don't want her to abandon me. i (irrationally) feel like she would get so disgusted and freaked out that she would just leave me. 

right now i've been spiraling because i was out with her yesterday and being high out of my mind (it was pride in my city so ofc i was fucked up), i smoked a cigarette in front of her, which is a BIG nono when it comes to her. she hates cigarettes, and has a personal history with cigarette addiction and it made her really upset, and after i dropped her off at home i wanted to scream and cry because of the way i had hurt her. it made me feel like the biggest piece of shit on the planet. i hated seeing how sad she was when i was driving her home in my passenger seat. i never want to make my best friend feel like that. i'm so scared i'm just making her hate me more and more and she's just going to end up cutting me off one day and never talking to me again.

idk. i really just needed to get this shit off my chest. i never talk to anyone about how i actually feel and i just wanted to do it online so i don't have to deal with it irl (since i have a large friend group that she's a part of)",klownbrainz,,False,14d6bld,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/14d6bld/i_might_be_in_love_with_my_best_friendfp/

Switching back and forth from obsession to disconnection (just sharing my experience/vent),1687027934.0,"In my late teen years when I finally had a group of friends to hangout with, I couldn’t feel a connection with them even though they were such a fun group and the first in a while. When I graduated I could easily cut them all off without a single word. It’s like I was building up to that moment from the very beginning. There was a lack of trust and I felt insecure having these good friends. Any little sign of possible dislike towards me would just flip the switch and I’d spiral down into overthinking and setting up barricades and walls AND reinforcing those walls with the most negative thoughts. 

I think with the people I have around me now (just my family) I switch back and forth from idolising them to just wanting to cut them off completely. Not because I hate them but because I feel so empty that even if I never existed, nothing would change in the family OR it might even be better for them. 

From my experience, I go numb when I feel scared that I might lose someone. Even if it’s just from the slightest paranoid scenarios I make up. I instantly think about cutting off the source of these feelings (the person), as preparation to when it happens, so that I won’t feel any pain. Usually that numbness is so strong and different that I feel like someone else with no emotional connection to anyone around me so it becomes very convincing that ‘I don’t care’.",Lupps_,,False,14bymqn,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/14bymqn/switching_back_and_forth_from_obsession_to/

I’m the BPD loved one and the one that has to step away,1686849875.0,"
In a nutshell, my fiancée and I ended things little less than a month ago. My BPD took over and I became a person neither of us could continue to love. I miss her more than anything, there is and never had been a lack of love in our relationship but there was a good amount of drama and trauma on both ends.   I wish more than anything we could be friends and be in each others lives but I unfortunately broke the trust I was granted and I can’t do that anymore. I have to keep her safe from the dark parts of me and though I’m feeling as if I’m starting to heal I still need to step away. I can’t hurt her or myself anymore.   It’s so hard being so in love with someone, being capable of being nice and civil  and being able to be there for them but knowing that the reason you can’t do these things is because you love each other too much.    


I don’t think you’re on here but if you are…  I’m gonna miss you. I’m gonna hope every day that you’ll reach out but I’m not gonna hate you if you don’t. I won’t even be mad if you don’t.  I just pray you take care of yourself and I pray for your healing.

she recommended more water, sleep and food.  
oh and to take more zinc- i never felt so misunderstood in my entire life. maybe that would be solid advice if i weren't leaving the country for the first time today (6/15). she recomended i cancel my trip due to my breakdown.

VENT // 2023 is Crazy and I'm trying to be strong,1686621913.0,"TW: ED

So this year it was awful. I moved, got my car broken into the second day. A day before my birthday I got into a horrible car accident (wrecked both cars). Someone new entered my life. My new coworker ""C"". She is a bit of a emotional and mental burden, I can especially say that now.  That said C and I get along well, but inside I am writhing in pain and fear. Working with her is a bit mentally draining, she is a diva and also can be overwhelming during our shared shift. Not much of a team worker. She is an explosive manipulative (maybe victim complex/ narcissistic) character, and just recently she got my hours cut at work (too much detail to type, but am in the process of figuring out how to get my work hours back and communicate to my boss about this). 

 Throughout all of this I have tried very hard to stay calm and move accordingly. DBT helped a lot through all this. Never would I have thought as an adult I can have moments where I'm proud of myself. Definitely a long complicated dark journey. 

However through all this, my ED came back. I'm trying to be self aware on how to cope with this. Yes I'm going through alot, but also I feel a large feel that I am dissociating most of the time. Days feel like a blur, if its not ED, I found myself drinking and smoking. Like its always something self sabotaging. Ik this is common with BPD. And I'm working to try to slow that cycle to try to put my own needs first.

I also recently got into a situation ship which is slowly moving into a relationship. There is a lot of nervousness about it, I am trying to navigate as well. I can feel the stages of Obsessive neediness, Withdrawing and withholding, and Escalating devaluation coming in. I don't know how to navigate that and its scary. I have never been successful with it as well. I'm also scared he became my FP with all of this shit going on. I want someone to just tell me what to do tbh, but ik thats also really hard. 

I want to explode and ruin/end all my surrounding relationships. I am also financially struggling and going to even more with the shit ""C"" pulled. I know a mental spiral is coming. I don't want it to. Any advice or guidance?

Violated,1683865511.0,"I have posted in here before,  it's about my fp. I learned a valuable lesson about bpd and that's you have to be very careful who you tell this too. People will use it against you. 

In the end she made it a point to let me know that she didn't believe me. That she lied and played games around me because she thought I was telling her this for attention. At some point I had stopped talking to this person and she wrote me an email that she studied it and watched videos about it,  that she believes me. I can talk to her for support etc...

I tried to be her friend but everything was dismissive from her. Then one day I needed her help really badly as I was arrested because some dude over stepped his boundaries. She completely dissed me,  she had no compassion at all,  she was just cold and dismissive. She ended up blocking me, which hurt me.  It triggered me really badly. usually the triggers last for the day or whatever but this felt different. I even had a moment where I called her phone to scream obscenities into her answering machine. I wanted to do all kinds of evil sht to her for the way she just dismissed me. It was very painful. I'm lucky it was just the phone, I probably would've ended up locked up for the rest of my life if i had seen her. 

She's gone now. 

I've moved on from that situation and I'm sobering from the funk, I'm coming out the fog,  I'm getting to see this person from the outside in.  She was never my friend or ally. She was making fun of me and screwing with me throughout this whole ordeal. 

That's very painful. 

I've been sad over it. 

Like this person told me I can trust her and in the end she was there trolling me the whole time. 

It was all a lie. 

The worst part is that she is the one I'm confiding into about this bpd, about my pain. To know that all of it was fake, that I was just a sport to her,  her family and her friends. That she was using me so they can have a laugh,  too know that nobody at that table even had compassion or empathy,  that's painful. How do you laugh at someone who has mental health problems? 

I was going through a crisis at some point and she's telling me that her and her family are laughing at me. She make sure to mention family because I keep my distance from mines to protect them from me. She mentions this to hurt me, to show off that she has people who love her and that I'm alone. She has this guy friend who she keeps sending after me through emails to hurl insults at me and mock me. 

I didn't really realize until now but this person has violated me. Violated my trust and it has broken me so hard,  I'm not sure I can even really manage it. 

This one person has made me so closed up to the world, even more that I realize. 

I used to have a boss who used to tell me to keep honest people honest. I didn't really realize until now that he really meant that a lot of people are just pretending to be honest,  to be good people and they're not. This person is the personification of that. She was just laughing at my pain

There is so much pain. I have to keep it all inside of me, all this pain, all this rage. 

I know I'm not the worst story out there, like it could've been worst and I understand that I want to be strong for everyone but I'm tired, tired of having to be strong,  pretend like everything is OK.

My strongest FP attachment ever.,1682699897.0,"This is a long one. 
I go to a local college in Upstate NY and my roommate (let’s call him Will) is my FP. He knew I had Bpd but didn’t think he was going to become my FP (neither did I.) But then, we became best friends within two days of moving into our dorm. I realized that he was becoming my FP when he started talking about this other girl (let’s call her Marie) and how he was in love with her. It was 3am and I couldn’t sleep because I was beating myself up over the fact that he was my FP. We got even closer as friends and I fell asleep in his arms multiple times after watching movies. We were attached at the hip and whenever he saw me on campus, he ran up to me and hugged me from behind. We talked about getting an apartment together and living there for the rest of college. Before winter break, we hugged each other for 5 minutes until my mom picked me up. 
Will, Marie and I made a group chat to schedule movie nights together. (I didn’t want her involved but I did it anyway.) Marie texted me saying she was in love with Will, so I told her that Will was my FP and explained the concept to her. She seemed to understand. When we got back from winter break, everything changed. Will stopped reassuring me that he wasn’t going to leave me, which led to me splitting on him and storming out of our dorm after fights. He said that he was always walking on eggshells around me and that I acted like he was evil whenever he set a boundary. He told me that “you act like I’m abusing you.” Instead of letting me explain. And when I explained, he told me that I was guilt tripping him. He decided not to get an apartment with me next semester because “we didn’t work.” And I’m still heartbroken over it. 
We got on better terms, but he still expressed anger with me and caused me to split occasionally. He told me that “if I’m your FP, don’t tell me.” And so I’ve been lying to him. I was so obsessed with him I barely hung out with anyone else, didn’t go to any of my sorority events, and missed many of my classes because I was staying up all night talking to him. We got better at communicating during spring break and we were back to being close.( not as close as the beginning though) in our group chat, he kept talking about wanting someone to attach to him, but refused to even acknowledge me. He said he wanted someone to be his #1 and avoided my obvious hints that it could be me. He joined a bunch of dating discord servers and talked to a ton of people. I thought he was going to fully abandon me for some guy and everything hurt. 
He told me he was staying in town for the summer.(my family lives 20 minutes away from my college) and I was so happy. I would be able to spend my summer with him. When I told him this, he acted really indifferent and didn’t reassure me that he would make time for me. He wanted to look for a partner in town instead. I’m so afraid that once this semester is over, I’ll be a stranger to him and he’ll never speak to me again. I only have 5 days left of living with him and I don’t know what I’ll do without him.",FlowerBeanBabey,,False,1320nib,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1320nib/my_strongest_fp_attachment_ever/
I’m just sad.,1682577145.0,"Why does it seem like people punish you more when you say youve been hurt, instead of being upset at the person who hurt you? 

When I was a child and would talk about my stepdad hitting my mom I was told I was lying and an out of control brat, and needed to mind my own business. But nobody cared about the bruises on my mother.

When I was married and confused by certain things my ex husband would do or say, I’d reached out to a few people to ask if it were normal because I’d never even had a boyfriend before him. I was told I was lying and gossiping. But nobody cared about me crying myself to sleep when he wouldn’t speak to me for days and days. 

When I tried to tell police and the school about a man on the school board who tried to solicit nudes from me and 30 others a few years ago they asked why I waited so long / what did I want / what are they supposed to do / atleast you didn’t send them though. But nobody cared that a man on the school board was trying to prey on teenagers. 

When I tell my partner that I feel hurt pretty often, he gets frustrated that I say “pretty often”. Not the part about how his words (or lack thereof) hurt me. 

Even the therapist today focused on my reaction, not the thing that hurt me that caused me to react. I wonder how todays session would have looked if she didn’t know about the BPD. If she would have commended me for sticking up for myself. It feels like pwBPD will always be looked at as the one to blame. 

I feel like I have to make apologies for saying I’ve been hurt, but nobody apologizes for hurting me. I feel so worthless now. 

The harder I try to be better, the worse I seem to be. I want to BE loved and safe, and I want to BE loving and safe. It just feels like I’ll never really get there. Like I’ll always be intense and over the top.

However, today, i let my overthinking get the best of me and brought up concerns that I have no business in, however, she chose to reassure me.

It got to a point where they felt the need to drive home that she has no romantic interest in me. We did have a past of this, but currently she does not feel this way. I still harbor strong feelings towards her. 

She wants to be friends, but I told her that if i were to do so without intense feelings involved, the best option would be for me to leave, as id handle it too intensely and go through all the emotions of heartbreak essentially, and that her being in my life only makes that grow, and if i stayed I could be hurt. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m distraught. I want to give up on everything. They gave me the same positive platitudes ive heard and i’m sure others have “youll find someone new, you deserve better, i want you to be happy” etc, 

I know sometimes we can get swept away in the negativity, but this is the first time in a long time where I believed something good could happen, and it just, it felt like it died.

I can't tell if it's relationship problems of if it's my BPD,1678990818.0,"I've been with my partners for over 3 years now. We met before my diagnosis and he supported me through it, even when I was at my worst. I've worked hard to improve and I think I've done a really good job. However, my biggest difficulty is in knowing the difference between the genuine state of my relationships and what the BPD thinks.

My partner's in his final year of university, which obviously means there's a lot of work taking up his time. He's also applying for jobs which takes up time. We've never been clingy, we could go weeks without seeing each other, happy to talk via text. But lately I feel he's been pulling way back? Some days now he doesn't text at all and I don't either because I worry he's busy and I don't want to disturb him. He has 3 set nights every week he spends with his friends and his uni soc, and sometimes goes to soc events and parties. When I go over he asks when I'm leaving. I've always been the chatty one but recently he just doesn't seem to want to talk to me at all, he just sits there quietly. I feel like I'm not prioritised in his life at all, and I'm scared of what our future looks like now, if I'll be loved at all.

Isolating,1676962500.0,"This has been raging inside me for so long, I only want to get it off my chest. 

I quit my job again. And this one was one of my favorite jobs I’ve ever had (I have had many, many jobs). But I couldn’t take it anymore. Dealing with my extremely condescending associate, customers hitting on me/trying to get my number/harassing me, my decreased appetite accompanied by dizzy spells (I’m 95lbs and have absolutely no energy. I feel like I’m withering away— meanwhile I’ve had associates pick on me to “eat a burger” and then confess they initially didn’t like me because they were jealous that I was so skinny. I am clearly malnourished and have been trying to gain weight for years! Unsolicited comments and hate on my body are actually not helpful!!), and 4 years of crippling insomnia has finally broken me. It’s all terrifyingly overwhelming. 

I no longer want to be seen. Simply going to the grocery store is too much all of a sudden. I hate going outside because I feel like all of my neighbor’s windows are giant eyeballs watching me. I’m pulling back and isolating. I blocked everyone on my phone and lost their numbers. I don’t want to exist. I don’t want to hurt anyone or be hurt. 

I don’t fit in, I don’t know how to wear a mask like everyone else does. It’s embarrassing and shameful that I can’t put on a fake smile for the sake of everyone else’s comfort. I don’t want to be a problem, but being myself is the problem. 

I’ve reached out for professional help, and am still waiting to hear back from the clinic. I am safe and I’m calming down a bit. But god damn if it isn’t hard to live with myself. I thought I was getting better. I really thought I had grown or healed quite a bit. It was all falling into place and I was so happy and proud of myself. All of my progress feels like a waste now. What the hell happened? 

I know the insomnia isn’t helping and possibly causing my lack of appetite. If I could just get those things on track, maybe my mental health would improve. I am trying, I am following a diet of healthy carbs and fats and I’m avoiding screens before bed. Why isn’t it working??? I feel so alone in my struggles. Can anyone relate at all?

Chronic Numbness/Emptiness *mention of suicide*,1668557770.0," 

So I am currently sitting here in front of my laptop and this is probably my tenth time in the past month trying to write out my feelings but every-time I tried to it felt so forced and fake. The numbness I feel is so debilitating it makes me feel like I’m not a person. I don't feel like I am real. Someone on reddit said that bpd emptiness specifically feels like constant numbness simultaneously accompanied with a heavy tension. It feels like there is constantly something weighing down my chest. But I cannot process what emotion this weight stems from. However, one feeling that I am able to feel is kind of a worry/fear. Because when I have gotten in these numb episodes in the past it has never ended well. It resulted in months or even years of my life wasted due to a lack of motivation, of care, of any effort at all. Because after a certain point of feeling empty you stop caring about everything in the world including yourself. 

I'm so scared of feeling the full extent of my emotions because every time I do I feel like a freak or a fucking monster and I always regret it afterwards. Repressing my emotions in the past has led me to self destructive behaviours like failing out of school, self harm, and using sex and drugs as an unhealthy coping mechanism to try to fill the void. As these episodes progress it causes my self hate to grow and grow to a point where it makes me suicidal, because while everything is getting worse and worse I am fully aware of how bad it is but I still can’t do anything to change it. This adds a constant guilty feeling over everything. The guilt of not doing anything to stop it. The guilt of knowing better but not doing better.

It feels like I’m digging myself a deeper hole with each day that passes with this emptiness. And thinking about pulling myself out of it makes me feel so exhausted and drained. It takes sooo much effort out of me to do so. Feeling the full extent of my emotions feels like walking into a battle field with no amour. And it never feels like it's worth it because in the end the cycle will restart and I will find myself deeper than the last rock bottom I rescued myself from. Apart of me knows that because of my bpd this cycle will not necessarily ever disappear because the trauma I’ve been through has rewired my brain chemistry in irreversible ways. However, I’ve been through enough therapy and read enough books to know that trauma is an inevitable part of life. I know that I have to accept the things that aren't  in my control and change the things that are. I know that trauma has both the possibility to shape people into success or failures and ultimately it’s up to me to make that decision. 

I've heard of stories of people altering their lives with therapy and developing healthier coping mechanisms but the question I always seem to come back to is how do they make it last long term? Why does it work for them and not me? I too have gone to the gym for 6 months consistently and have gone to therapy for months on end, ate a good diet and got 8 hours of sleep every night but there comes a point where slowly one by one each of those skills and coping mechanisms tip toe out the door one by one. Almost in a way where I don't notice it fully until they are all gone and I am left barren, all alone with the dark twisted corners of the inside of my head. No where to find comfort, no where to feel safe, no where to breathe smoothly. Each time I feel like an idiot for thinking the cycle is over.  Boom, I get a trigger I can’t handle. A trigger that the gym can’t take off my mind, or therapy sessions don't help with. There it is. Consuming me and swallowing me and I have to sit patiently waiting for it to spit me out so I can breathe again. So I can try again.

Hi guys this is is going to be a long post and is also super embarrassing for me to post but I’m really hoping you guys will understand. 

A few months ago I moved into my boyfriends family home with his mum and her boyfriend so we can save for our own house together. Recently, it came out that his mums boyfriend had been cheating on her for the majority of their relationship which has caused everyone in the family to have a complete different view on the situation to her as she’s now taking him back. I’ve tried not to get myself involved in this situation at home as I’ve only been with my boyfriend for just over a year and I don’t feel like this is a place for me to get involved but I have been dragged into the situation. I’m at uni studying a distance course meaning I’m at home during the day and so is his mum as she works from home and she’s been basically using me as her therapist, laying all of her emotions on me and I’ve been the one to offer her the most comfort. I’ve even stayed up with her until 4 am on several occasions comforting her, this has been fine as I know one of my strengths from my BPD is I’m a huge empath and love to be there for people. However, it’s come to a point where it’s now 8/9 weeks since the truth came out and it’s now getting too much for me. This situation is all that is ever spoken about at home and it’s starting to drain me and the quality of my mental health. 
Last Thursday this all came to a head as my boyfriend and I tried to talk to her about how this has been affecting me and how my mental health has taken a turn for the worst to which she completely invalidated everything I was trying to say, she said things like ‘well what about me, this has happened to me. I’m suicidal, I want to sl*t my wrists and starve myself.’ This was particularly triggering for me because I’ve always been very honest about my struggles with these things and I ended up snapping at his mum and went into full argument/rage mode, I just couldn’t keep the emotions in anymore, especially after these comments. She then told me to calm down which I don’t know about any of you guys but when I’m in that space, that is really not the best thing to say to me. 

I’m just wondering if I’m an arsehole for reacting this way, I feel so terrible for losing my cool but when I tried to explain how it made me feel the next day she then continued to invalidate me and wouldn’t apologise even though I apologised for how I reacted. I just feel like I’ve completely split on her and I can’t see it turning back. I just don’t know what I can do. 

Sorry again for the lengthy post, I just want to speak to someone who may understand how I’m feeling better than anyone else xx",Chlo0806,,False,ykiesa,10,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/ykiesa/any_advice_would_be_great_sorry_for_the_lengthy/
Advice -,1666740971.0,"I don't know how to start this. I need some guidance and perhaps support, but I feel I have completely fucked up my life. Rewind two years ago; I was living in a metropolitan area and working for a company that appeared to have a great trajectory and opportunities for travel. I had a tribe of friends that were smart, supportive and loving. Unfortunately, I did come out of a turbulent breakup, unleashing my most severe BPD symptoms. I moved back to my hometown to continue working remotely, a blessing in normal circumstances. From there, things started spiralling; I was in a messy family dynamic, including being around a very mentally ill family member who came to live with us. His verbal abuse and mean nature were triggering. I could go on about his mental health and the domino effects it causes my nuclear family and me.  

Compiled with the massive change to my living situation, I was triggered by my parents and their shortcomings and their current living situation, making me feel completely insecure in my ability to thrive. 

I was isolated physically and remotely, using marijuana as a coping mechanism. I didn't have the same support system withdrawing from loved ones and cutting people off for no good reason. Until recently, it felt like I was completely broken inside, being held together with an eggshell-like body embracing me in some physical normality. I have since been on better medications and feel like a whole person, not using marijuana and eating regularly but lacking a routine. 

In January, I was let go from my job due to covid and the lack of revenue. My rejection sensitivity went off, and I withdrew and did not collect my last paycheque from work and have not worked since or collected social assistance. I am broke. I had built up my credit and savings until then, I could kind of live off my savings. I didn't think I could find a job, feeling like I should have thrived in a better position by now, and now I feel like I fucked myself over in every way. I've cut off all of my tribe of friends, not working, and feel fucking lost. 

I know I need to reach out to my old employer, apologize, collect my last pay cheque, try and get social security, continue applying for jobs and reach out and apologize to friends in the hope I can build my life back up. But I don't know if any of that is possible.

A realization.,1666239238.0,"I was having an episode, of course, triggered by something small as being (Seemingly) Ignored. But it was more than that honestly. I made a server so I could make new friends, so I could have something or someone to talk to instead of my bf, who can't always talk to me cause they have other friends. But when I went to invite people I realized I don't actually know anyone. I tend to latch onto a person and just talk to them and only them. It's still something I want to do. I don't want other friends, new people to interact with. I just want the two people in my life that I can at least connect to somehow. But even then I can't have that. I can't have either of them all to myself. I do not have anyone. My best friend is my best friend, but I don't think I'm hers. She knows so many people, too many people. I feel so isolated whenever they come up and talk to her. And with my bf, everytime I see him online, and see he is not talking to me, it hurts. Cause then I'm alone. I want so badly to isolate them both, to have them only interact with me. But I can't, I can't do that. Even with the opportunity, it'd be too cruel. At least that's what I tell myself. I was really disheartened from making that server, and seeing the nonchalant reaction from my friends and my bf. I wondered to myself, if I was anyone else, would the reaction have been different? Or if I had never had my past bpd episodes, if I was normal would those reactions be different? If I could be their perfect person, would things be different? Would they need other people? Or would I and only I be enough? Of course this is just my selfishness talking. But when you're as isolated as I am, you can understand why I'm scared to lose them to anyone else. My family doesn't like me, it feels like they suck my soul and any energy I have from me. My ""Friend group"" Which was really my best friends friend group have fallen apart, and I was kind of glad. It only fell apart because one person decided to be a dickhead, which gave me a valid reason to dislike them. I don't know how i feel about the other person, If I could I would just be friends with my best friend in a heartbeat, and she would only be friends with me. That way I'd never be alone again, nor have to worry about anyone leaving me. But again, I cannot have these things, I cannot be the only person in these people's lives. So I decided that if I am so un-needed in their lives, they will be unneeded, in mines

I cannot rely on anyone, and I have had to learn this same cold hard truth ever since i was a kid. I do not have anyone, no one in my life, and honestly I don't need anyone. If they are gonna isolate me then I will just do it automatically. I do not need anyone, I don't want to talk to anyone, to hear anyone, to listen to anyone. That way I don't have to feel any of these emotions. It's better than killing myself and leaving them or anyone else with the burden, This is me giving up in the only way I can. I will never allow myself to be vulnerable again, never allow myself to be so in love, so obsessed with someone again. I do not need relationships, friendships, any kind of human interaction. I was doing just fine on my own, and so i think i will go back to that state. It's the only way I can keep stable. Even now the people I love are online, around me, ignoring my very existence. It's my own fault for allowing this to happen for the sake of other people. I just give and give and pour my heart out and it is not enough, I do all this only for someone else to do the same to them, to do the exact same as I did, yet they appreciate that more. There really is something wrong with me. It was so hard, it was so fucking hard to connect to people, so hard to make these friends and loved ones. I just copy and copy and paste, try to be the best person i can be, the best more right most funny most reliable most lovable person. When in reality I don't think I am any of these things. I am quite genuinely a shell, a mirror, a fucking reflection of what I think the person would want from me. Ive been told to find a reason to live, to find myself.

The fly in the ointment is I'm not physically attracted to him. I kinda thought he was when we first met then it faded. I told myself to look past looks as his personality and character made him attractive. There's nothing wrong with him or the sex but it's just okay...if that makes sense. 

When we're apart I miss him, but when I'm about to see him there's a pit of dread in my stomach. 

I've been going back and forth on whether it's self-sabotage or whether I'm really not attracted. I wasn't sure. 

This weekend was the first time we'd seen each other in 3 weeks (I had surgery). And I had absolutely no desire to have sex with him or even be around him. This was confusing and upsetting to me as I used to have an insanely high drive but it's kinda dissappeared with him. He bought me a dozen roses with the sweetest card and I just felt like the worst person. He could tell something was up so I told him how I felt the next day. We broke up. 

It hurt a lot and I really didn't want to lose him. I reached out the next day, we talked it out as apparently the way I'd come across sounded like an ultimatum. We got back together but I had to leave. We made plans to see each other yesterday. I was feeling excited to have sex but then once I saw him in person the feelings changed again. I tried to fake it while wanting it to be over already. I realized I should have just let him go. I'm pretty sure he loves me and I hate to hurt him more. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Idk if I'm splitting or if it's unfair to stay. I'm feeling so guilty and shitty.

But... What now? I quit my job that made me severely stressed/suicidal and further exacerbated my physical injuries.

But now I'm swapped with my sleep schedule (sleep during day, awake at night). Time doesn't matter anymore, I mean it's not like I have anywhere to be. Is this existential dread part of it? I've felt similarly before but now all I have is tons of time to think. I haven't gotten a therapist yet and I'm feeling quite crazy. My pops kicked the bucket after a short but tough fight with cancer. I just get high and sleep all day sometimes. I'm rarely productive. I don't even know what I'm looking for here, maybe just to vent or talk with others who can relate. Is there some trick to us borderlines where we can't even be happy when our physiological and safety needs from Maslow's Hierarchy are being met? Hopefully it doesn't come off as whining as that's not my intention. I'm still waiting on my therapist and I feel like fellow BPD might have some new light on this. 

Also I'm generally a quiet borderline so most people perceive me as lazy since I ""seem like I have my shit together"". It feels good not to have to break my body and mind working jobs I hate and getting let go or quitting frequently. But I also worry about how people like my mother perceive me.

How to get over an ex/possible FP,1657638364.0,"TW: mention of sxicide

Sorry this post is super long! I'm trying to convey as much as I can as this has been super heavy. If anyone reads the full thing I'd really appreciate it as I'm desperate. 

From my first relationship at 18 to a much older man, all my relationships have been extremely toxic and rocky. I endured a lot of emotional abuse in my first relationship that still affects me. I was diagnosed with BPD about 4 years ago.

 My most recent relationship started near the end of 2019. I was 23, he was 26. Honestly, we started dating because of the sex. It was mind-blowing for both of us. We were together almost all the time. Compared to my past relationships, this one was the most stable by far. I was stressed about something when we started dating and he said ""don't worry, we'll figure it out"". That really impacted me as I'd always felt alone in past relationships. He didnt insult me, berate me, he pushed and encouraged me to do better. I started college at his urging. I was so afraid of losing him, of this wonderful thing I'd found, that I became incredibly toxic. I am so ashamed of how I acted. He was naturally flirty and charismatic. People were drawn to him. He had many friends, I had almost no one. My family didn't have much to do with me. His friends liked me, told him to hold on to me. I was constantly terrified of him cheating. I'd go through his phone, read texts, start arguments, retreat in silence. I constantly felt the need for him to prove his love for me. And my awareness of my actions, knowing if I continued to act this way he'd leave, made it worse. I couldn't stop no matter how much I wanted to. I knew he cared, he showed through his actions yet I didn't believe it.

We broke up 3 times during the 15 month period, each time initiated by him over text. He didn't see a future for us and didn't want to draw it out. At that point, I didn't see life worth living without him. While hating myself for doing it, I'd cry, yell, beg him to give us another chance, that we could make it work. We'd have make-up sex, it would be better for a few weeks and then get bad again. He told me I brought out his dark side and I felt terrible I could do that to someone. One night, he grabbed my neck out of anger. 

3 months before the end, I became filled with the idea that I should cheat before he does. I had never cheated on a partner. A ""friend"", who did not like him, suggested I start onlyfans as I was short on money, living alone. That snowballed into me finding a pimp. I escorted 3 times in one week, without protection. I didn't even try to hide it from him. He found the whole truth out one night and left, disgust on his face. He came back hours later, crying, asking why, while I had just returned from another appointment. I couldn't believe that I had made this happy, cheerful man sob like a baby. I felt horrible that I had hurt someone so bad but also fascinated that I had the power to hurt someone like that. He still stayed, we had sex that day. I thought, ""he really does love me"". I ended things with the pimp.

We started having symptoms some weeks later. After the doctor told us it may be herpes, he tried to break up with me again, saying I had ruined his life and he wished he'd never met me. I then threatened to kill myself. It wasn't an empty threat, the thought of life without him filled me with dread. It was incomprehensible. If I wasn't taking care of him,  cleaning the house, cooking, doing his laundry while he was at work, what was I going to do? I would have no one without him. He had become my whole purpose for living. I'd never seen a future for myself but I wanted one with him. We stayed together only for him to dump me over text 3 months later. And this time, he was done for good. I went over that night to get my things, he wouldn't even look me in the eyes. I begged, I cried, I threatened suicide again, all to no avail.

I called suicide help lines several times over the next few weeks. I made a will. I was in contact with one of his friends and roommates who I had become buddies with. He told me he was pretty sure my ex was over me. The pain was so great I actually thought I was dying. Everything reminded me of him. I saw him several times after as he sold weed and would roll it for me since I didn't know how. I had started smoking after dating him as he was a heavy smoker. He invited me out to drinks to see how I was doing. That confused me and gave me hope. The last time I saw him, he was smily and cheerful, told me I looked really good and told me about a new album by an artist we used to listen to. My heart broke all over again. During the break-up he had said we could be friends. After that last time I texted him asking if he really wanted to be friends, as he took days to respond to my texts. He replied that he didn't want to and he wouldn't sell weed to me anymore. It took me months to delete his number. I only deleted the rest of pictures a few months ago. 

I hung out with his other roommate, an 18 year old female a few times after the break-up. While we dated, we had argued over her many times due to how he acted around her and my fears. Stuff she told me made me view him in a different light and made me realize he's not the nice guy he pretends to be. I was also told disturbing things by someone who knew my ex and I. It made me realize stuff he'd said to me, he was telling the truth the whole time. The charming, smiling self he shows to the world is a facade, a mask. He hides his true self very well. I expected that to kill my feelings. Yet it didn't. I still loved him (or whatever idea of love I have). He flirted with people while we dated knowing that really hurt me, he would lie. I realized that I had idolized this man, put him on a pedastal he didn't deserve to be on. That started a spiral of destructive coping behaviours, namely having a LOT of risky sex. I'd see 6 different guys in a week. I felt hollow inside. I'd cry while driving home, wishing I was with him instead. I tried to hate him but that didn't work. 

It's been 17 months now. I still think about him often. Many times someone will be saying something that reminds me of him and I start talking about him, about a memory. His name crosses my lips far too often. I stayed single from that time. I didn't believe I could ever love someone like I loved him. The pain hasn't eased.  

I bounced around the idea of trying dating again. Everyone I met, I compared against my ex and found them lacking. I couldn't decide if meeting someone new would help me get over him, or if it was unfair to meet someone while still grieving your ex.

When I was about to give up, I met someone in March. I'm now 25, he's 30. I almost didn't reply as he used the same line my ex had used. Our first date hurt so much. He reminded me so much of my ex- his aura, smile, the way he talked, it was a bit of deja vu. We had a great time however. Getting to know him more, I realized he was nothing like my ex. From the beginning, I knew this was different. It was such a mature, healthy space, I was actually terrified. I wasn't used to calm, to mature, I'm used to dysfunction. We'd go from laughing about something trivial to having intelligent, deep conversations. He's such a kind, caring, sweet individual who hasn't had much sexual or romantic experience. He wants something healthy and lasting and hopes to start thinking about marriage once he completes his PhD in 3 years. I was terrified to tell him I have herpes (found out this year), it barely fazed him. I told him I have BPD and how it affects me, he asked me thoughtful questions, gave me flowers and asked me to be his girlfriend. He is so thoughtful, positive, emotionally mature and self-aware. He voluntarily started therapy as he wants to learn to express himself better and get in touch with his feelings (grew up in west Africa). He is quick to adjust and make an effort if I express something I'd like changed or am nervous about. We've been dating a month now and my BPD is so calm compared to my last relationship. I have no desire to go through his phone, I'm not consumed with thoughts of him cheating. I have no worries about him. The fear of rejection is still there though. I'm scared he'll get sick of me one day and leave. I take things he says the wrong way sometimes and start to shut down. This time though, I express how I'm feeling, we talk it out and it's all good. He holds me while I'm having a panic attack and lets me cry. He does what he can when my endometriosis is flaring up. I see him once a week and when we're apart I miss him. And yet, I feel that if we broke up, I wouldn't be that cut up about it and that worries me. Everytime before I'm about to see him,  I get filled with dread. The sex is good, nothing like how it was with the ex. I have to teach him a lot, and he tries but it's not the same and I resent that a bit. 

And yet, my ex is never far. I hear a song about the one that got away and I think of him. It's like there's a part of me that still hopes, still thinks that maybe one day, he'll realize what he lost and come back. How can someone walk away from the best sex they've ever had, as he told me countless times? All the things I did for him, the money I spent, I'm filled with rage that I was used and discarded. While he's achieving the career goals he wanted, I'm crying over him. I feel so angry at myself. How can someone still want someone who wanrs nothing to do with them. When there's the most wonderful person right there waiting to love them. I feel like such an awful person.

Invalidating my BPD and experiences. Is this common/normal,1657576366.0,"So I just recently got medically diagnosed with borderline a few months ago. I also recently found this sub (as well as BPD memes) and I can relate to quite a few of the things I see but I always feel like it's wrong saying I have these issues. I know I'm stigmatizing and generalizing here, but even though I do have my problems it's not too the point I can't hold a job (at least I think. Maybe my BPD has gotten worse and I just haven't discovered yet, I have an interview next week). But to be direct, there are also some things I can't relate with.

villain era,1656463838.0,"Anyone else had success just saying ""fuck it"" and embracing being kind of a shit person? 
I don't mean tolerating abuse or  hurting people and justifying it, etc, but just recognizing where a lot of these undesirable BPD traits come from and easing the slack on yourself. Like maybe I am kind of intense, volatile, needy, unmotivated and childish, and a bit of a deadbeat. Maybe I am boring and high demand.... but I'd rather be a minor villain and be alive than unalive out of shame at who I am right now.

I genuinely don't know if this is helpful or not but after being called all these things for so long and melting down at how hurt I was by those words, I've developed a thicker skin. 

Like why would being dramatic and difficult mean I don't deserve to be alive? Maybe I am those things, I can still put up with myself and take care of my basic needs. 

I think for me a huge part of my emotional volatility anyways was the pressure to be a perfect person or meet people's expectations that I literally could not. Or letting their words get to me on such a deep level. 
It feels pretty powerful to hear someone call me a loser and a narcissist and just be like ""okay whatever you want to see me as"" and not defend myself anymore bc what is the point? Ive tried to explain or mask that I am better and more capable than I am and that seems more hurtful in the long run. 

Not everyone understands what people with this kind of illness go through. 
Do I wish I was an upstanding, disciplined, calm and rational leader type with emotions of steel and a strong sense of identity so I could dedicate myself to a noble career? 

Yeah, some days. I loathe being This. But why? 
Because I decided early on only those Very Good People deserve to exist or be loved. 

But the more attached I've been to that idealized image of who I am not, the more judgmental I've been of others too and the more I project my own insecurities outward. 

I haven't done DBT yet but wonder if this is part of the process, like recognizing and accepting flaws, insecurities, and limitations and integrating them into your identity instead of rejecting them so as to be more tolerant of both self and others. 
Its just making sense to me as accepting being a villain. Sort of how many LGBTQ people (myself included) have reclaimed Disney villain queerness or slurs.

But her job is slowly migrating back to the office and that means she won't be with her phone during that time. It's apparently just for a week before going back to working from home. I'm not sure how it works; her country / job is really weird and harsh. 

But for context: when she's asleep, or we don't talk much I feel myself slipping. I feel empty. All I can do is wait for her to talk to. It's been like this for over a year. I've completely gone dependent on it and I know that. I don't remember how to be alone with just myself anymore. I get anxious, I get more depressed, I feel guilty for feeling clingy. I'm also not in therapy right now cause my therapist retired and the only one they had to offer me was a middle aged man... and I have trauma with men, so I couldn't do it.

I actually had therapy and meds since I was 13/14 years old, till I was 20 last year I stopped using my parents insurance because I completely distanced myself from my family and honestly everyone all my friends from the past because they all just were shit to me. 

After I left rehab when I was 17, I still had my bpd symptoms but I experienced a weird like 2 years just not feeling real. I don't remember much of that but I just really dissociated all the time. 

I started having friends again, smoking more heavily, did risky things more than ever. I even tried almost not even wanting to think about the past, I wanted to reconnect with my family a bit. But pretty much every single of those people ended up really hurting me. There's so much that was happening. My life honestly felt like hell to me, and it hurt my soul that growing up I've always thought about how the hurt seems to only get worse and worse. And here I am wanting to just be okay, start living independently. But my family doesn't give a fuck to admit their mistakes, these friends are all fake, people think I'm weird. I still get anxiety at work hoping customers don't notice or say anything about my arms covered in scars. 

But I'm so tired of suffering from my past wounds I want to just get rid of but why does the pain stay? I know I'll have to struggle with my mental illness, and just try to maintain it.

How to maintain a relationship with my bio mom while working on my mental health?,1653711032.0,"Hi so i'm (20F) am living with my biological mom for the past 2 years, I don't have a job, I'm trying to sign up for therapy, do everything I can so I can get on my feet again, but my family aren't that supportive especially my bio mom. I was taken when I was 3, we used to visit a lot growing up but over time I stopped answering her calls for a reason even I don't know. I was diagnosed when i was 19 and now I'm almost 21 but I've always been like this even as a kid. My bio mom doesn't see that but my adopted parents do and they did everything the could (granted they didn't have a lot of knowledge of how to handle adopting kids) I always thought for the longest time the reason I'm like this was because I wasn't with my bio family but now that I know how my Bio mom is, I realized that maybe I shouldn't have left my parents house.

Ever since moving here, I've been yelled at for things I cant control such as crying over her jokes. She's said things like ""I hate crybabies"" ""I cant handle girls, I hoped you were a boy"" she's never physically affectionate, no hugs, kisses, I cant even lay next to her in her bed when I'm sad. She tries to make it seem like I'm an awful daughter. She calls me a bitch more than she says my name. I ran away once because I couldn't handle it anymore and then when I came back I told her how my friend let me stay with his mom, how I spent the whole time with them and she cried with me even tho she speaks spanish and I don't. She's hugged me kissed my forehead more times than my mom has in my lifetime. gave me clothes, let me sleep on her bed while she took the floor, basically everything a mom does for her kids. I then told her how I felt like I deserved to sleep on the streets but they didn't want me to and were worried about me. Her response was ""you deserved to sleep on the streets for acting like a bitch"" The whole argument she's talking about was bc I had $7 and I wasn't sure if I wanted to give it to her because she's an alcoholic and she wanted to buy beer and I kept telling her idk it's all I have left and to her it wasn't the answer she was looking for. She kept asking and I kept saying the same thing, its the last of my money but it's my social security money and I like to save the little amount I have for myself for the next month (I get less than $100 a month) and it turned into me being ungrateful, disrespectful, making her look stupid and my biggest trigger is yelling, she knows this and was yelling an inch away from my face and I was terrified I was shaking and crying and closing my eyes and she said ""why you scared? I never hit you whoever told you that is a liar, you're such a pussy"" ""youre so much bigger than me and stronger"" She also brought my bio dad into it who I haven't seen in years due to his ongoing struggle with addiction and it scared me because I love him more than anything, he's my favorite person always have been. It was unfair because he's not stable, he doesn't know what's going on with me because he wants to keep me away from all that for my safety. Oh, not to mention, my step sister (12) agrees with my mom that I'm disrespectful, I hate her how I don't deserve her ect. I get she's a kid so I don't hold it against her but it really does make me feel like I'm the problem

It was like a snowball effect, anyways, I've been thinking of calling my parents and telling them but I'm scared on how they will take it because my mom is my bio mom's half sister and she loves us both and has seen me on my horrible days and she might agree with my bio mom. I keep on wanting to ask to come home but to me, it feels like everyone hates me and doesnt want me around and it's getting to the point where I wanna end everything.

Anyways, I went through a breakup two months ago, and now almost anything sexual repulses me or triggers me into thinking about my ex and thoughts of him having sex with someone else. When I think about him being intimate with someone else, my face gets flushed, I go into a panic, and have terrible, intrusive thoughts about how I'm a loser, ugly, disgusting, etc. When I'm in a good place, I'm very sexually liberated and love to be sexual with my partner. However, this breakup really fucked me up and he also gave me an STI, which has left me feeling so undesirable. 

I want this sensation and feeling to be over, I want to move on so badly. My brain knows that I am indeed desirable and that this diagnosis (BPD and STI) are not necessarily going to hold me back from finding love, but the BPD part of my brain loves taking control and trying to convince me everything is pointless, worthless, and that I am indeed a piece of shit.

To me the core of BPD is feeling emotionally invalidated but the. To survive we have to suppress and deny our emotions...my autistic logical brain hates this.

They get in the way of doing anything because I just haaaave to do what I feel like doing or stop trying to take action on unwanted tasks to avoid meltdown.

I  can mask through work but trying to do errands on my own or interact with people pleasantly is too much.

FRUSTRATION STATION,1652146627.0,"Hey all. Thanks for having me here. 

I'm (27 FtM) struggling to prioritize in my life. Having finally gotten some self awareness on the borderline patterns of attachment, obsession, and trying to break out of this cycle of centering my life around unattainable or unavailable people, living in fantasy worlds, being super self absorbed, venting and only talking to people when I want attention, validation etc. that is keeping me from moving forward, gaining skills, etc. Everyone is so frustrated with me and I have had to come to terms with being emotionally abusive/neglectful to my ex, neglectful at my jobs and of my pets and self. 

It feels very awkward and unnatural and forced to try to be consistent in friendship, my habits, life. I never have had serious addictions besides social media and other peoples approval. 

Im exhausted. But I know I do have habits and can form new ones because I definitely have bad ones like laying in bed all morning or spending a lot of time in my head. 
Its just that every single day my mood is different even on mood stabilizers and I'm used to doing what I feel like impulsively based on mood, or what I'm forced to do. Which is a surefire way to spin out of control or feel hopeless. I need to develop my OWN locus of control and discipline and its just shitty that my moods are the enemy when they so badly crave validation after decades of gaslighting and being blamed for their intensity and destructive power. 

Im wondering for those who are actively recovering...what has really really helped you out of old coping mechanisms? What were you able to commit to?

I am PDA autistic and have ADHD or bipolar, still waiting on a psych evaluation, but one of my biggest struggles is finding something to be consistent with that doesn't end up trashed by demand avoidance or getting bored/splitting on it. 

Every kind of routine or demand outside of my fixations ends up feeling like swallowing pills or pinching your nose to eat something nasty until I just stop. 

 Everyone says to fight depression, meditate find hobbies and get outside yourself find something to do for others, exercise. 
But I legitimately feel my habits and mental copes are like gravity or a black hole and getting out of them or making changes in life exhausts me and I collapse back into them. 

I guess this is just what recovery is like. But I've tried Codependents Anonymous, talk therapy, astrology, divination, meds (except ADHD meds about to start those), being more social, creative expression. At the end of the day my brain always finds a way to invalidate destroy or get convinced that thing ""isn't it."" The only thing I come back to is taking pictures on my phone (never organized) and writing long rants on the internet. Im so bored of my SELF. And analyzing myself and recounting my past trauma.. everyone else seems to somehow find something to do, or to love, or commit to,, even when we have the same diagnosis and experiences. 
Ughhhhhhhhhh. 

Is it really possible to form an identity and learn how to commit? 

I'm so tired from fighting myself. 

It feels like a normal life is just within reach if I could follow the steps (apply for jobs, show up to jobs, budget the money, move put of home state, take care of my body, cook and eat, have a creative routine, go on a run, care for my pet, evaluate which relationships are good to have around, spend time in nature, set boundaries, learn time management, learn emotional regulation) so I can get to a place where I feel stable enough to really connect with others and not sabotage everything or get hurt because I picked someone wrong.

 But those steps feel so impossible when I keep proving to myself over and over that I will not stick with anything, I will sabotage everything, and every single day I have a new idea about my next big project or career path or what ever. 

How do you build trust with yourself or anyone else without consistent effort? 
The only way I feel motivated is to get a FP or romantic interests approval, or extreme outside pressure and fear of punishment. 

Im just so frustrated I could scream for days. 

Does it get better? And how! Does DBT help with this?

Venting,1652030374.0," 

Im sitting here writing to myself again. Everything is falling apart. I feel weaker than ever. I feel like my mom hates me. She said that I am a shame to my father who abandoned me and that she has done nothing as a mother. I have never felt so much pain in my life. I sobbed like a toddler in front of her. Because she knows that I blame myself for my father leaving me. She knows how much I fear abandonment. So for her to confirm that even my abusive and alcoholic father would be ashamed of me hurt more than anything could ever. She said “look at you, I did nothing.”She feels like she failed as a mother and in result of that I am a failure of a daughter. We failed each other. after I told her how I felt and opened up to my struggles she didn’t respond to anything I said and only made an issue out of the fact that if anyone were to find out about what’s going on all the blame would be put onto her. While I opened up to her about my bpd diagnosis and how I feel on a daily basis she was only concerned about how it would make her look as a mother. She says every-time I have a breakdown its the same story and same excuses. Which is true because none of these issues have ever been truly addressed and worked on. I can sit here and provide reasons as to why but it would sound like excuses and manipulation so I give up. I failed and I am a shame just like my father to her. She says my father still controls me and its true. I just don’t know how to stop it. I want to get help but all outpatient treatment options have several week/month waitlists, and although I have signed up for them I feel like I don’t have that time. She wants change immediately. She wants me to go cold turkey and suddenly change my life around to happiness and butterflies. Because if other people can do it so can I. But I just don’t believe that. No matter how much I try I just cannot. 

She thinks that I purposely do things to disrespect her (smoking weed). I know that smoking weed is destructive, it is my addiction. She believes that addiction is a choice. She kept saying if I wanted to change I would. To her it is simple. She does not understand the complexity of my mind and the things it makes me do. She believes that I am purposely manipulative. She thinks I don’t want to put in any effort. She thinks I am choosing to be a victim but she doesn’t understand that trauma traps the person in a victim mindset. That a person with untreated trauma is constant living in the exact state of the time of trauma. They are stuck reliving the trauma if it is untreated. She doesn’t understand how it affects the brain. She doesn’t understand that not everyone is the same. That just because she was able to deal with all of her trauma (that was  much worse than mine) doesn’t mean that I can do the same. I am not the same as her, but she expects me to be. She doesn’t understand that my thought processes are corrupted and that in order for me to regain control of it I NEED therapy, I need to learn how to unlearn and rewire my brain to adopt healthy coping mechanisms and thought processes. She doesn’t believe that therapy can help you help yourself. She believes its all a business and that people use mental illness diagnosis as an excuse for their bad behaviour. She keeps telling me to help myself but I literally cannot do it on my own. She keeps telling me to do the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome. Dealing with my trauma alone will never work. I can accept that but she cannot. 

I am sick and she doesn’t understand that. Because she is angry at me and angry at herself. Angry at me because she thinks I don’t want to put in any effort and angry at herself for creating a child like me. 

I feel alone. And I feel like all of my negative thoughts about myself were confirmed by her. Because I don’t think that people understand to what degree people with BPD hate themselves. The self hate is debilitating and constant. Ever since I can remember I have absolutely hated everything about my being. And when you don’t care for yourself, you make decisions that reflect that. The self destruction I engage in is not intended to hurt others it is only intended to hurt myself, because I feel worthy of hurt and pain. When I am in these long periods of numbness it is true I lose my sense of empathy. All sense of any emotion. And it causes me to hurt her. Because I am unable to even consider her feelings. I am sick and I hate it. I hate what I do.

I understand her anger because it is the same way I feel about myself. I just wish she could understand me. I wish we could break the wall in-between us. But every time she says things out of anger it makes me want to build the wall higher and stronger.",ImpossibleBicycle249,,False,ul6h66,14,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/ul6h66/venting/
"Did anyone else feel that, despite diagnosis, BPD symptoms as listed in the DSM don't really speak to them?",1651793651.0,"After doing tons of research on the internet, it seems like there is no better explanation for my problems (e.g., probably not misdiagnosis). But I'm back where I started: not all the symptoms listed in the DSM for BPD speak to me, and those that do are much milder for me than the literature (Fox book, etc) seems to suggest.

I have no trauma, no self-harm, no emotional dysregulation. At first glance, I'm pretty normal. I've never quit a job because a boss was mean to me (I am good at holding my tongue/kissing ass if theres something in it for me). I've never gotten literally **obsessed** over someone. Sure, my interpersonal relations are as bad as they could imaginably be, I have enormous issues with delayed gratification, my impulsivity is very bad with respect to my vices. But that's all pretty mild, if not to say simply personal failings.

Is this a normal thing that some people diagnosed with BPD experience? Two disclaimers btw: I am a guy and I did not score the ""quiet"" subtype.

Feeling lost,1651509770.0,"I've never understood myself or anyone or even my emotions but being diagnosed with BPD was the reason that made me question myself and the way I acted, why detachment was often so easy to me like isolation and how it hurt so bad to experience feelings, much more worse when I feel negative ones. 

To me, I think BPD is some sort of curse and I feel like I can't tell anyone that not even my bestfriend because they're not a borderline and I don't know any borderlines in real life or any professional support that can really help me understand. 

I left my doctor months ago and she's told me I'm good to not rely on medication as I've been doing it for a few months already prior to the last session we had and for some reason, I didn't feel anything even when I should've felt happiness because I'm free from relying on it and going back to the expensive sessions that barely gave me anything to understand or hold onto. The only thing she said is live life for myself and that's what I've been doing ever since I've heard it. She's also mentioned to process my feelings and after a while, I stumbled on people who had BPD's dpt skills which they learned from their psychiatrists which really cemented that I only knew the labels I wasn't diagnosed with but not at all understand any of it. 

I can honestly say that I've been torture to work with even when I was undiagnosed, my family would just call me crazy whenever I had an episode and had often regarded my mental illnesses though I'm not using that as an excuse for the way I reacted because that's just shitty and I've been working on being better by myself so by doing that, I'll go backwards once again and I think this is my last chance to change and not give up. I remember often blowing up and crying my heart out for hours and even days that turned into weeks, I remember the pain I felt in my chest for minuscule things like small disagreements over dumb things or a comment that didn't land good to me. I remember hating how sensitive I was and how everything & everyone made that so obvious that they started to be careful with me. I can't blame them at all and at one point, I truly believed it when people told me I was starting to become like my dad which set me off and made me want to be spiteful when I was so suicidal and at my lowest, I chose to live in spite which ironically kept me alive. 

I still hate my curse and how I can't seem to ever escape the label of being a borderline. I hate the fact that I'll always be demonized and reduced to a diagnosis as if I'm not a living breathing human that's just dealing with some things that I can't ever escape but that truly doesn't mean I won't constantly try to be better and learn from my mistakes. I hate how I can't seem to stop seeing people who speak so much about personality disorders and make people feel worse about themselves when they're just struggling, I get shitty people who have this diagnosis but not everyone is like that and by lumping us together, it hurts a whole group of people— doesn't matter if they're a borderline or not, I say that because people just diagnose people who act shitty. 

I've had people act differently towards me because of this label that somehow explained who I am as a person in big bold red letters, a red flag. It really is a curse to be a borderline and when I was first diagnosed, I knew I didn't want to live being labeled as one after seeing how people often scorn them and how much I didn't want to go through hell like that while also dealing with my hell. I don't know how to understand myself but I do love myself and who I am, just not those parts of me that I don't understand but will try my best to. 

I have a lovely partner who understands my triggers and never invalidates me but people can get tired too, I don't want the love of my life to be drained from dealing with my issues and for us to break up because of the  misunderstandings and episodes I deal with when bad days come. I truly want to understand myself and unlearn harmful behaviors that I've used to survive back then, I want to grow and be happy and not be shackled to this label that's not wholly who I am. Everyone's been telling me I've been doing so well and that it seems like I'm okay now but I'm not satisfied with growing and just stopping there, I feel like I'll never truly reach my potential as an individual if I'm not constantly learning and growing. I just want to understand myself and why everything is hard inside and why it hurts so bad in my chest, why I feel physically ill sometimes when I've had a really bad trigger. 

I just want to be better than what I'll always be determined as just because I'm a borderline.",,,False,ugtuhs,11,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/ugtuhs/feeling_lost/

How common is BPD misdiagnosed? Asking because I was diagnosed a few years back and do not think it was correct,1650338007.0,"Hello everyone, 

I am not sure how common my story is, but I think it's more common than I would think.

I was a problem child for a lot of my childhood in school, but began to improve in middle school. I was very bad with people all my life and everyone who meets me ends up disliking me (this is not an exaggeration, this is unfortunately quite literally the case). This caused me to be a very homebound child and I grew very, very attached to my family. I was academically rather successful in HS, but socially the same. College was an unmitigated disaster for me and at the urging of someone I ""saw someone"". The last time I was evaluated was for autism and ADHD in elementary school and was given a clean bill of health, so to speak.

After two days of talking to someone, the psychiatrist said she believed I had BPD. I heard of the condition before, but I was taken aback and after several sessions asked if she stood by her assessment and she said yes. After our sessions ended (I saw her in secret), that was kind of it.

I began reading about BPD more and more and the more I read, the less I saw myself in the condition. Yes, I have huge issues with impulse control and have pretty dire self inflicted issues with my health. I am very clingy to people because of the fact everyone I have ever known has run away from me. I have a limited sense of self, to a certain extent, and have huge problems being alone without anyone with me. 

But otherwise, it just doesnt click all that much. I am not suicidal, I am not driven to make rash sudden decisions that screw up my life, I am not the kind of person who would quit a job just because I want to curse out my boss (I am pretty good at holding my tongue when there is something in it for me). I wouldn't say I have emotional dysregulation. 

This happened a few years ago, and I havent followed up on it, but the problems in my life havent gone away. 

I figure that I have to wrestle with whether or not I was misdiagnosed to make progress on that front. Is it a thing to be misdiagnosed? Is this a condition like ADHD, where it's over applied? I am a guy, if it makes any difference.

NSFW bpd female seeking advice on how to manage and lessen emotional pain,1649446203.0,"Hi
I’m a 20 female who is diagnosed with bpd,adhd and in the process of being diagnosed with ocd.
Lately my intrusive thoughts, suicidal thoughts, mood swings and self loathing, has been getting out of control. I’m writing here in the hopes that someone could offer advice, as I really don’t know what to do myself.

First a short rundown of my situation:

Last year in November/December I spent 6 weeks in the psych ward. I had been receiving dialectical behavior therapy for about 8 months before that, but had to stop in the middle of it due to being admitted to the ward. I reacted really well to my therapy and the plan was to continue the therapy directly after getting out of the ward.

Things however, didn’t exactly go to plan… due to Covid, The system failing to make sure I was connected to a mental health professional for several weeks after I was discharged, and a doctor failing to do their duty and literally refusing to let me back in to the bpd team(a complaint has been launched and there are talks of a lawsuit), I haven’t been able to start therapy yet. 

Due to all of this, I have slowly become more unstable over the past few weeks.

My self-loathing and self hatred has become extreme to the point where it is physically uncomfortable, and I’m constantly restless and sad throughout the day.

I think all of these feelings stem from the belief that everyone arounds me hates me and that I am annoying and a terrible person. These beliefs come from a list of very traumatizing experiences that I have yet to tackle, but I feel like I can only do that in therapy.

My feelings have become overwhelming to the point where it feels both mentally and physically unbearable to be in my own body and it makes me want to call it quits on this life thing.

I’ve tried to use all of the stuff I learned in therapy, as well as talked to my nurse, my psychiatrist, my parents and my friends, yet nothings helping. (I have informed them about my suicidal thoughts, so they are aware and can help look out for me)

I’ve tried to go through my binder from therapy to figure out precisely which techniques would help me but I can’t seem to find anything that tackles the extreme amount of self loathing I’m feeling.

I’ve tried to reach out to some of the people that I feel hate me (some of them I’m quite close to), and they have reassured me that they don’t hate me and that they care for me. Usually this type of clarification would help my feelings of self-hatred and self loading but this time it’s not helping.

I’m desperate for any advice or help that anyone can give me on how to:

1. Lessen my self hatred and intrusive thoughts about myself 

2. How I can hang on until I get back into therapy (hopefully within 2-3 weeks)

thank you for taking the time to read this.

So basically I have a FP (favourite person),  he's one of my online friends, and they've been my FP for a while, at first I thought I liked him but soon realized it's just an obsession. I wanna be with him 24/7 and especially talking to him in VC. He does know that I have BDP because I keep feeding him information about how I feel (for example, I'm jealous of you and X being together most of the time), to him 24/7 and I always second-guess him (you must have snitched to X because you guys are so much closer!), and he seems pretty annoyed with it. He told me it is fine to vent and it was too much. I think it was too much too and I don't want him to be angry at me because I will literally cry if he shows any signs of him being angry, I know it's mentally draining for him but I can't control myself to not tell him. Jealousy is the worst problem I have to deal with, it makes me anxious and sometimes angry, or sometimes I will just burst out crying. It makes me anxious when he's talking with other people and extra angry and sad if he's talking to someone one-on-one, which he rarely talks to me in a VC but sometimes I just wanna hear his voice. I always stalk him 24/7 to see if he's doing something with his friends and I would also stalk his friends if they are both online on discord, if they are both online I would assume that they must be talking to each other and having fun, which makes me more anxious, why would he want to spend time with a mentally broken and a boring human-being? I have way too many expectations for him (he's gonna text me anytime sooon~ I'm waiting!) (He will understand me 100%) (He will comfy me If I say this to him)

Soon I realize that this is getting more unhealthy and unhealthy day by day and I want to do something about it but I'm so helpless,  I'm literally experiencing stomach pain because of anxiety, If this goes on, I'll be at my limits soon. I don't know what to do, every time I talk about this with him I just end up pushing him further and further, and I feel like I overshare too much. He's such a precious and fun person to hang out with and he's kinda understanding too, I don't wanna lose him as a friend.

I hate the stigma,1646763902.0,"The stigma in addition to the lack of self identity is absolutely crushing and then people who don't have BPD saying 'oh build your self esteem' when their advice to anyone with a pwBPD is 'Oh I don't think BPD folks aren't worthy of love but THIS one needs to work on themselves or you need to leave' and that's the case 100 percent of the time.

God it took me so long to even find a support group of people with BPD--suggestions are full of people self diagnosing abusive partners with BPD or NPD (another horribly stigmatised mental illness). I hate that it's palatable to others if you have clinical depression or anxiety disorders (not that they're not ableist to them either) but 'FUCK bitches with BPD, RUN' (/sarcasm and cruel irony and total ignorance of the fact people other than women have BPD too). I hate that I'm scared that if my abusive ex finds out about my diagnosis he will demonise me and all the trauma he put me through will become null and void. He has been able to do it without knowing my diagnosis ah imagine what he would do if he got to know it.

Also I feel like I have to chant this everyday-- Abusive behaviours should not be tied down to mental illnesses. It is ableist af. People can be abusive without having a mental illness. This also applies to people self diagnosing their abusive parents with NPD. I am dying on this hill.

I had been diagnosed with OCD years ago and fuck I have never had to experience this. Back then, the issues were people confusing with germophobia and the 'everyone is a bit OCD' bullshit.

I hate that people don't bother to learn about it and act shocked when relationships don't work out and tell everyone how it was entirely the fault of the pwBPD and how everyone chimes along saying 'yeah it's not your responsibility to take care of them' (which is somewhat true but it's misconstrued here) and encourages for the relationship to end and then act shocked about why people with BPD have abandonment issues and also fuck them if they do because how dare they have emotional needs /sarcasm. And dare they get angry or need reassurance/sarcasm.

Also haha if a pwBPD points out how things could have wrongly worked against them, ah no fuck the pwBPD because they think nothing is wrong with them--we have self awareness, sometimes we are irritating because have poor self esteem since we are overly judgemental of ourselves and the other moment we are dangerous because we are completely self unaware and don't realise we are a problem to others. Make it make sense (of course I am oversimplifying it but there have been situations where this is applicable). I am so scared of being invalidated even now, in a BPD support group with people with BPD.

I just wanted to vent--I don't want solutions. I just wanted to put this out there and if anyone wants to build on it (you don't have to be constructive, you are allowed to feel indignified and angry).

TL;DR-- My experience with BPD has taught  me that society works under the 'Trauma is cool and all as long as it makes you 'enjoyably quirky' not a person with extra emotional needs because of it.' And abusive people definitely have to be mentally ill/sarcasm. (it's ableist)",,,False,t9nb4y,39,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/t9nb4y/i_hate_the_stigma/

r/BPDsupport is **now open to approved users with BPD or borderline features**, and I'll explain the change.

Before now, we were a ""private"" sub, with the benefit being that anything shared here was invisible on profile histories, so it was safe from strangers using something against anyone here. Unfortunately there is a lot of hate on Reddit, and only a few places that are safe for many of the people here.

However, since I made the change to fully 'privatize' the subreddit, the activity and subscriber level absolutely fell off, and r/BPDsupport has not seen much activity over the past year+ for that reason. I moderate r/BorderlinePDisorder and r/BPDmemes as well, and frankly didn't feel so concerned, and have mostly directed users to those resources for more active communities.

Recently, r/BPD, the largest subreddit on this topic has become unusable, due to mods choice to private their group and take an 'indefinite hiatus'. I'm not sure any change here in r/BPDsupport will relieve the pressure, but I don't see a reason to keep it private, and this will make the subreddit more visible.

For now, I will do my best to manage new user approvals with a sticky post. To stay focused, this will continue to be a text-only support and venting sub. You won't see memes, researchers, music, or any questions or comments from users without borderline, just words from people with borderline who I hope you all connect with.

i made this free card deck to help me manage my BPD,1645924382.0,"hi y'all. i've used the DBT Skills card deck in the past, and found it really useful. I wanted to make something that brought together my favorite elements of DBT (emotion regulation and distress tolerance), plus what i've learned from buddhism.

so i made [this free, printable card deck that i'm calling the Mastery Deck.](https://bit.ly/3HjpwsM) 

it's a combination of Mood, Mindset, and Mantra shifts. 

* The Mood cards are mostly a combination of emotion regulation and distress tolerance tips from dialectical behavioral therapy.
* The Mindset cards are ways to shift your perspective and shore up your sense of self.  
* The Mantra cards are mainly quotes, including several from the wonderful Thich Nhat Hanh.

the deck is meant to be used in any way that serves you: by picking one card daily, or just when you need it, or by shuffling until something resonates.  

this is just V1, so i'd love feedback and for you to share if you like it. <3",victorywulf,,False,t2c8cj,50,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/t2c8cj/i_made_this_free_card_deck_to_help_me_manage_my/
Cringe.,1645634196.0,"Hi all, 

I'm looking back at my behavior, the things I've said to people, and the damage I've done to my own life. Kinda hard to get out of bed because I'm so embarrassed. I've been steadily pushing the people who love me away because I want them to forget me. It's easier leaving people before they leave me. I've fantasized about being completely alone so it would create a bubble-like space to start confronting/working on my bad traits. Ideally (delusionally) my plan was to reappear years later, fixed and nice and fun to be around, able to have intimate relationships. I want to start working on being a completely different person,  but now that I am alone all I've done is sleep. I don't want people to look at me because I feel disgusting. I'm so ashamed of being in this body and I would love to erase everyone's memories of me, including the good parts. All of it.

End marriage?,1639086646.0,"TL;DR: I am trying to decide if I should end things with my husband, given his cheating and dishonest past, and I would like to know if my demands: **He needs to delete all ""friends"" he made from dating apps, and people he flirted with, and people he had a sexual relationship with, even if they do stay true friends now. Given he has never been honest with me, I demanded him to open up his phone to me fully so there is transparency and to make sure he is not having unprofessional interactions with other people** are reasonable to rebuild the relationship.

Hi Everyone, my husband and I are in a phase where we are deciding what to do with each other in life and would really appreciate some advice on this.

Some backgrounds on this:

We are an international couple, with very different views on dating. I come from a more traditional background and at my place, if we start a new relationship we are supposed to cut all contact with our EXes, or those who flirted or hooked up. My husband is American, and he makes friends on dating apps like tinder, where they would flirt and stay friends if they don't work out, he would also stay friends with the people he hooked up with. The thing that lead everyone downhill is the time I discovered him making a very sexual post on Reddit and made a Snapchat to sext, and ask to join a zoom room to do some nude video chatting. I proposed to divorce but he put his knee on the ground to beg me to stay.

I am the one with BPD and I cannot accept what he was doing even if he explains that he's professional with the people in the past, and he doesn't think he was cheating since the definition of cheating is to physically meet up for him. Since then my BPD got worse since I lost trust in him and become hyper-sensitive on who he is talking to. I stalked him and make shady comments when he talks to ""friends"" he made over dating apps, we fought bad, really bad, I grab knifes to threaten to take my life (end up having the police called on me multiple times, and restrainted in ER twice), and harmed him during the breakdown too. I know this is not correct and now in therapy i truely realize it is not ok to engage in unsafe situations whatever the reason is. I also realize I did a lot of harm to him physically and emotionally, and I do regret that.

In the end, he cheated multiple times, and would never tell the truth to me until I stalk him and find everything out myself. He said he felt so empty inside and lose himself gradually and he wanted an escape so bad that he cheated on me. He said he is no longer guilty of cheating, because of the harm I have done to him. Even before, when things were not escalated to this level, whenever we have a fight, he would turn to one of his ""friends"" and flirt with them, sext them. He even said, ""I find you cute, and if I were single I would be with you."" He said there is nothing wrong saying that, its just a compliment.

After therapy, I learned to stay calm and don't let BPD act instead of myself. I proposed to end things peacefully and I go back to my home country (which would mean we would probably never see each other again). My husband has issues with separating and wants to rebuild with me. But he is still dishonest with me when I ask him if he is interacting with other people sexually, he says he is not d**oing anything, but he would not reject filtering comments from ""friends"" and would sext them (all of this i have to find out by demanding him to show all his social media to me). He explains that he said he didn't do anything because he is not meeting up with these people (again, it's the idea that it's not cheating if is not physical). In fact, he still talks to the people he cheated on me with, even after multiple attempts of me demanding him to remove those people (which shows he only cares about himself).**

**I proposed 2 minimum conditions that I need for me to work with him towards a life together again:**

1. **He needs to delete all ""friends"" he made from dating apps, and people he flirted with, and people he had a sexual relationship with, even if they do stay true friends now.**
2. **Given he has never been honest with me, I demanded him to open up his phone to me fully so there is transparency and to make sure he is not having unprofessional interactions with other people**

**He said he would work with me but what I am doing is isolating him from his ""friends"" and invading his privacy, and refused to agree to these terms.**

**From where I am from, there are even linked accounts for couples, where we can access each other's social media, and if you are in a relationship, and you refuse to let the other person check the phone, then you must be hiding something, and you can absolutely have no contact with EXes and previous hookups (should block them).**

**At this point, there is no trust and honesty in this marriage, and I do want to end things, but he keeps holding on to me (but still talking with the ""friends"" and not rejecting flirty compliments).**

**I just need some input on this. I know this is very long, and I really appreciate if you read all this and leave some advice.**",Ok_Captain784,,False,rcs7y9,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/rcs7y9/end_marriage/
Impulsive behavior triggered by feelings of inadequacy and abandonment,1634638896.0,"I'm just so messed up. I kinda need to rant right now because I'm feeling like a piece of shit. I like people but I push them away. I even love people but I push them away. I really like someone special and I keep pushing them away. I am not feeling appreciated enough and I don't think they're interested in me the same way as they were before. It's all very confusing to me. I've known them for almost a month. I think. And of course my feelings quickly went from ""hm, I don't trust you"" to ""I want to spend the rest of my life with you"" and now to ""I hate you so much it hurts my soul"".

I'm exhausted. I hate feeling like this. I'm in therapy. I'm taking my medication. I'm cutting off harmful people. I'm trying my best at creating a better life for myself. I'm sleeping well. Eating fairly well. But I'm stuck. Stuck in this fear of never finding someone who won't leave me. But with this fear comes me being overbearing, annoying, needy. Which leads to me being abandoned either way since I let my addiction show. Yes, I guess I get addicted to people I love. And/or like a lot. Maybe it's not the end of the world to feel that way if you don't act on it. But I do.

I'm destroying this new relationship now, stripping it away piece by piece. All the love and care will disappear. My hate will overtake and then loneliness will show it's ugly face again. I don't want to ruin everything. But I am. And I really don't know how to stop it. I'm in a real bad place with my emotions and my relationships right now. Since July, things have just escalated a lot. I'm tired. I want to fall in love - but not without them falling in love with me too.

How do YOU control your emotions? Any advice? Tips and tricks? I've begun writing whenever I feel like shit or when I feel like destroying the relationship. But I couldn't last night.

Rant. Advice? Maybe both?,1634330613.0,"Hey guys. Perhaps I'm not able to get an answer for this but here it goes anyways. I did cross post this into the other BPD group but I really want someone to see this and just maybe relate to it...

I have BPD, like most/all of us here. It turns me from an overemotional teddy bear into an emotionless asshole who doesn't care, and vice versa. I've been emotionally unavailable for a few weeks now. My gf has some stuff going on and I cannot support her. I don't know how to explain to her that when I am this way I do not care about myself, her, or anyone else on the face of this planet. Period. I drive reckless. I take risks I shouldn't. Have violent thoughts about myself and others. And feel numb at the same time. 

I guess my question is, how do you maintain a functional relationship with someone when youre this broken? I can't pretend to care. It feels wrong. I do care but it's buried so deep within myself when I'm like this. Does anyone else have any insight or maybe any advice they could lend to me? That's it. That's my rant.

Success and Struggles,1630252030.0,"I really just needed to talk about things with others that may be able to relate.

Some BG:

So, I've had mental health issues as long as I can really remember. I was in and out of psych hospitals and treatment from my mid-teens until present (now almost 36). I am diagnosed with both MDD and BPD, and while things have improved a lot since I was younger, things are still a struggle a lot of the time. I'm learning that I'll never really react to the world as someone who's more 'neurotypical', and that's okay. I instead need to learn how to be more effective in managing how I deal with the ways I experience my world. I hope that makes sense.

Anyway, I have not been able to work for a long time now. I have a huge issue with being able to consistently get up and out of bed and in to work. After enough of that, well you get fired. And after losing enough jobs, you just kinda say it's not for you. :/

Well, after years  of not working outside the home, I had my first day of sorta work yesterday. I say sorta cus it's more of a side gig type thing my husband got me at his job. I'll go in on Saturdays, with my husband, and help out.

It was nerve wracking. It keyed me up for hours before and after. (I didn't sleep Friday, went in to work Sat, got home Saturday night and slept for like 4 hours, and now I'm awake again. FML) I had to be around people I only sort of know, and I don't really leave the house, like at all. I was scared of screwing up, and looking incompetent, and reflecting badly on my husband. I was afraid of talking to much (which I do when I'm nervous) I'm still not sure if everyone liked me or was faking it.

When i woke up again, i saw messages that he felt eveb worse and that he has apointments tomorrow (now) so that he may wont be online soon again. Im so thankful he mentioned that but..i feel so bad. So selfish for sleeping while he wasnt well. And it got worse during the night while i was just lazily sleeping. And now, it takes time till we will have contact again.
