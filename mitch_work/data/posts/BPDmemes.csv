This really upset me seeing it on a ptsd support group on fb.,1713013485.0,"I fucking hate this. We will never follow this advice on this. No excuses. Yeah you can fuck up by accident but not in serious ways. You know better. Research. Learn. 

No. I‚Äôm sorry but you need to learn to break the cycle. You can‚Äôt excuse yourself for fucking up your children with being emotionally unavailable just because their parents were . They caused the cptsd and Bpd I have. They were the ones who allowed my father to sexually abuse me and my mother said I deserved it since I was a woman and also that I deserved being raped by other men when I went to her about them. That‚Äôs not culture. That‚Äôs abuse and they have no excuse or reason to be forgiven.

‚ÄúDoing the best they could with what they knew and had‚Äù

No sorry. That‚Äôs an excuse. There‚Äôs no excuse to be drunk all the time and ruin your kids life when they beg you to stop. It just means they don‚Äôt care. They literally don‚Äôt want to improve.  Oh it‚Äôs culture to be drunk all the time. No it‚Äôs not. You literally can‚Äôt control yourself when you‚Äôre drunk around your kid? Then don‚Äôt fucking drink. 

‚ÄúOh sorry I couldn‚Äôt afford your much loved hobby and skill that you were learning because I spent it all on booze! ‚Äú fuck that. You could have tried harder and not spent it on the fucking booze. He could have learnt and been a master at that craft. You chose your needs above your child‚Äôs. 

You beat your kid? ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs all I knew!! Oh yeah I love being beaten so I‚Äôm beating my kids oh wow! ‚Äú
No. You know what‚Äôs bad and good. If you didn‚Äôt like it. Your kids don‚Äôt either. I don‚Äôt care if you grew up with it. You don‚Äôt punish your kid by giving them what you grew up with. You give them better than that. 

This post is so invalidating for those who have been abused by their parents and is a huge trigger.

Don‚Äôt have children if you don‚Äôt have the capacity to understand your children or be emotionally available for them. Don‚Äôt have children if you don‚Äôt want to resolve your trauma. Don‚Äôt have children if you don‚Äôt want to be a better person for them.",kittycakekats,,False,1c31i4b,224,49,https://i.redd.it/112gbxwkw8uc1.jpeg

Rant: Any Support / Advice is Welcome,1714397121.0,"I would first like to say thank you in advance for anyone taking the time to read this. I have always felt a true sense of camaraderie on this sub that I have greatly appreciated, and i‚Äôm really in need of that support now. 
   I truly feel as though I am drowning. I cannot escape myself or my BPD diagnosis. For the past 6 months, I have been in an on again off again situationship with someone I should‚Äôve never been with in the first place. We have nothing in common and he‚Äôs not nice to me, but my brain has CONSTANTLY convinced me that without a man by my side, I am nothing. I turn into a hollow shell, void of my own interests or self respect, and in turn become a vessel for the other person, my current FP. All my time and energy is dedicated to him and him alone, and the whole world disappears, including myself. The cycle is brutal, of course, because no one will ever be able to match the level of affection I give (or so my brain convinces me) so therefore they do not care about me or for me whatsoever. 
   Granted, he did not make my life easy. I‚Äôve never cried so hard in my life. Coming over to hook up, but constantly wanting to keep us a secret, asking me what I was planning on wearing to meet his parents then less than a week later abruptly telling me it‚Äôs not going to work out, then coming back into my life because he thought another man might be interested. After being given no affection by him at all (no compliments, no affection unless we were hooking up) being discarded, and picked back up again like it was nothing 3 times now, I am at the lowest point in my life than I have ever been. I have begged him and begged him to give me a reason why he couldn‚Äôt at the very least communicate with me, the person he had said he wanted to be his girlfriend. He finally told me it was because I am convinced there is someone else, and when I cry around him about it, it makes him ‚Äúfeel bad and lose interest.‚Äù It‚Äôs pathetic, but if my partner is nonchalant and wants to keep things behind closed doors, it‚Äôs difficult for my brain to not fill in the blanks with terrible anxiety ridden thoughts, like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs definitely talking to someone else.‚Äù I will admit that if I didn‚Äôt have that issue we‚Äôd likely still be together, which is why I‚Äôm in so much pain. 3 times he wouldn‚Äôt communicate with me, he would just become distant, and then after ditching me for plans we had that day, he simply wouldn‚Äôt show. Or he‚Äôd take hours and hours to reply to my messages. Once I would call frantically begging for answers on why I was being abandoned, he would coldly respond ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù And each time destroyed me. If I had just a shred of self confidence, I wouldn‚Äôt have taken him back the first time, and I wouldn‚Äôt feel like offing myself now. But I am tethered to him, and my body and mind have suffered greatly because of it. My anxiety is through the roof, constantly wondering why I wasn‚Äôt good enough when we‚Äôre apart and if there‚Äôs someone else when we‚Äôre together. I‚Äôve cried so hard that I get a massive migraine and throw up. 
   Yesterday, however, was the biggest blow. I walked in for my shift and noticed a handmade bracelet on his wrist, made for him by ‚Äúa friend.‚Äù a girl. after he reassured me we weren‚Äôt parting ways because he found someone else, but because he needed to focus on his accelerated school program, but i think he lied. Just like I felt like he was lying to me when we were together. Two weeks ago I asked him if he would consider waiting for me, because I would be willing to wait for him. He said yes, and that he missed me. Then a week went by and he texted me saying that I can do what I want, he doesn‚Äôt care if I wait. Now that he‚Äôs in school, I only see him once a week, and after feeling physically ill this entire day due to the bracelet his new friend made for him, I have decided i‚Äôm going to ask for that day of the week off my schedule. 
   My brain is more fragmented than ever before, and the worst part is, this isn‚Äôt even the first time I‚Äôve had to learn this lesson, that not everyone who gives me the slightest bit of attention has the best intentions for me or us together. After all, I was willing to take him back after he went to hang out with a girl without telling me and I found out from my friend. My insanely low self worth made me this way. I am so tired of being a doormat with the words ‚ÄúWALK ALL OVER ME‚Äù stamped on my forehead. He said I made him feel loved and cared about, which he said his ex did not. I tried, I tried so hard to give him so many compliments after he said he didn‚Äôt get any. I took him to a sit down restaurant for his birthday because I wanted him to show that he mattered to me, still matters to me. I never thought this would be a situationship, but here I am, half a year later. He never committed and now he‚Äôs gone. I know if he came back right now with nothing but a half assed ‚Äúsorry‚Äù i would hold him in my arms forever. Today he looked me in the eyes and i sobbed and I asked if i could give him one last hug. he said okay, and kissed my cheek. I feel so defeated. I love him. Why was I never good enough for him, or anyone else? why can‚Äôt my brain just shut the fuck up and stop telling me i‚Äôm being cheated on, or more importantly to stand up for myself? Deep down I know I don‚Äôt want to be with someone like him, so uncaring and cold, yet I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him and I want him back so desperately. I wish i could turn my brain off and never turn it back on again. I can‚Äôt keep repeating this cycle. I come back weaker and weaker every time, in agonizing pain until i find another FP to fill the void until it inevitably sours and it starts all over again. I just want to be alone to avoid this pain and suffering. I want to be free of this disorder.",turtlegab021201,:spinel1::spinel2::spinel3::spinel4::spinel5:,False,1cfz28k,83,3,https://i.redd.it/hwgarp9u6fxc1.jpeg

Tonight was our final concert of the semester and I was already feeling shit but before the last song started the conductor listed out all the graduating seniors and I cried the whole time throughout the last song I couldn't even play my instrument correctly. When the concert ended I was trying to run to go to my car ASAP but I ran into my fp and started bawling even harder and he's like ""dont worry I'll still keep in touch and I'll still see you in tuba/euph ensemble!!"" I love him so so so so much it's crazy I wanna kill myself I really do it's so embarrassing why am I so in love with this random ass fucking chemistry nerd who plays tuba. Like when I came into uni he was the first one to talk to me and he's always been very kind and wtf I think he's amazing like I want him but I feel even worse bc 1. I would never be able to act normal with him and I already have a boyfriend (bro used to be super abusive but now he stopped??)  And idk sometimes I fantazise this cool tuba guy wouldnt abuse me

BUT holy fuck I wanna die when I think that I'll have to see my fp on Monday again at school, the tuba ensemble is having their own concert am I gonna have that same experience of crying like a pussy at the last song bc I will never be able to be close with my fp. Being a music student with bpd fucking sucks I should quit my instrument and drop out and lie on some train tracks. I could literally never show up at school again I was shouting bc it was so bad when my mom was trying to comfort me but just ended up pouring salt into the wound.

"Your girl is struggling a bit rn, details in post, support/advice welcome",1713707497.0,"Partner and I live in a 2b2ba, one room being turned into an office space/gaming room with a comfy couch. Partner and I have had so many laughs in that room, and I crash on the couch in there when he plays games. Sleeping has always been hard for me due to prior delusions that finally went away, so beds are a bit uncomfy.

That room felt safe. That room felt like home. Bedroom, kitchen, living room, do not and I oftentimes avoid them completely.

My older sister is moving into that room today. I've been avoiding the room for weeks now. There's only ever been one other room in my entire life that immediately allows me to release a breath, that room being a specific bathroom at my psychiatrist's office.

I know I can make our bedroom feel safe by organizing the furniture in a specific way, but I'm having a bit of trouble coping. I spent so long wanting to go 'home', finally having a spot that embodied that, and now I'm a bit worried I'll never find that again.

If anyone's been through similar, and has advice on what helped them- it would be so, so appreciated. Thanks so much guys ‚ù§Ô∏è",AerisSpire,,False,1c9ie1i,89,3,https://i.redd.it/3wya2oh88uvc1.jpeg

When nothing helps and nothing works and you're supposed to just deal with it ,1713659538.0,"Insurance is fucked. I hate it. The whole fucking healthcare system in America is bullshit.

Nothing I've tried has worked. I've felt like shit for years. We're getting desperate and looking into TMS, ETC, and Spravato/esketamine.

Except my insurance straight-up just doesn't cover TMS. 

ECT? Yeah, that's covered... at facilities 2.5+ hours away. 

Spravato? A mix of both. It's like an hour and a half away, AND the medication itself isn't covered by insurance.

I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm running out of options and ran out of hope a long time ago. By the way it looks, I'm just gonna have to deal with it...

Until I can't, and I don't know how long that will be.

And all of this fucking shit is because these fucking companies bribed their way to where they are now and completely fucked everyone. Now, because they can't play nice with certain places, I either have to make inordinately long trips, or just do without and feel like shit. 

I hate this. I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it.

Tfw you‚Äôre going absolutely feral over some boy and he hits you with the ‚ÄúI want something casual‚Äù line,1713310811.0,I started seeing this guy on his weekends off when he doesn‚Äôt have his son and now he‚Äôs my fp. We had an amazing date the other day and drank and stayed up until 10am talking and fucking. Told each other things we‚Äôve never told anyone else and he said that he liked me and I wasn‚Äôt like anyone he‚Äôs ever met before (unhinged? hyper sexual? does anything for validation? riddled with mental illness?) Talked about going to see Hozier and he was down to go and I ended up buying tickets for us and when I sent him the screenshot of the confirmation email he said he just wants something casual and that he has a lot on his plate. And that dropping so much money on tickets for someone doesn‚Äôt seem like casual to him and he doesn‚Äôt want me to think he‚Äôs like one of the guys I drunkenly told him about that used me for my money. so now I wanna switch up and just treat him as a fwb and then dip once we finish fucking when before he would ask me to stay and cuddle and shit ü§™üôÉ,smokeycuntz,,False,1c5v17i,97,5,https://i.redd.it/6nk0dwpogxuc1.jpeg
