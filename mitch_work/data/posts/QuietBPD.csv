To Those Who May Feel Suicidal.,1595308092.0,,Saudades21,,False,hv1d9k,33,3,https://www.elephantjournal.com/2020/07/to-those-who-may-feel-suicidal-im-here-with-you/
Quiet BPD books for spouse,1595262540.0,"I know this is SUPER far fetched, but I had seen the BPD From the Husband's POV book for spouses, but in reading about it, it's more focused on the person with Rage BPD. I don't throw things, punch walls, spend extravagantly, etc. Maybe I'm just that far into treatment, but I never raged. I want to find a book or resource for my spouse about Quiet BPD, the insecurity, the black/white thinking, etc that is more typical of people with Quiet BPD. Anyone have any resources for this?

TIA

Edit 1: so many people saying “I Hate You, Don’t Leave Me” however, this is still directed for those with Rage BPD, not Quiet BPD. It’s also a very demoralizing book that I don’t recommend. No one needs that kind of shame in their life.",miss80five,,False,huocc3,78,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietBPD/comments/huocc3/quiet_bpd_books_for_spouse/

Recently Diagnosed BPD,1576256010.0,"I am a 34 M recently diagnosed with BPD. I’ve known that I’ve had PTSD, but the BPD diagnosis was new... and hard to accept. Reading about Quiet BPD seemed to describe me almost perfectly. I’ve changed meds several times in the past 6 months and I am starting DBT. Any advice with meds or therapy would be appreciated.",GreedyHomeless,,False,ea6i4a,35,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietBPD/comments/ea6i4a/recently_diagnosed_bpd/
