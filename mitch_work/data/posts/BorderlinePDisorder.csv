How do you handle change? ,1716135053.0,"Hi guys, hope you’re all well💕 

Im really bad when it comes to anything changing in my life. Schedules, interests, people pulling away etc. I tend to focus on literally everything, like I’ll be hyper aware of people’s body language and especially their tone. 

Recently, my FP has been sounding really tired and distant on the phone with me. We speak 24/7, and I depend on him for everything. If we don’t talk for like 3 hours, then internally I’ll start stressing. I think right now it’s worse since I’ve been unemployed for 5 months. 

I asked him if he was okay, and if we were okay and he reassured me that we are but I can’t help but feel like he wants to pull away because I’m so clingy. He said last night that he’s tired because of his work (he works nights) and he wants a new job and he misses having time to watch YouTube videos and draw. He reassured me that it’s not me and he loves spending time with me but my brain is dead set on convincing me that I’m the problem and that he’ll just… up and leave. 

How do you guys handle changes? Do you also hyperfixate on people’s tones and freak out if they’re even just a little bit different? 🙁 I feel like this illness is gonna ruin me lmao ",Safe_Climate_1724,,False,1cvrtg2,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cvrtg2/how_do_you_handle_change/

I hear things or feel paranoia but only when I’m stressed ,1715722255.0,"I was diagnosed BPD last year. I’ve always had depression and anxiety, but symptoms worsened after a traumatic event, and that was the beginning of being diagnosed. 

I’ve always considered myself to be “a high stress” person, but it wasn’t until my symptoms worsened to the point of my BPD diagnosis that I began to hear things when under stress. I don’t hear specific voices to tell me to do anything, I’ll just be trying to sleep and I’ll suddenly hear a chatter of voices, or people outside. Sometimes I hear loud noises like an alarm, and it’ll be so loud in my own ears, but my husband never hears it and neither does my dog, and it’s terrifying. 

I sleep with an eye mask at night and sometimes I hear my husband come in the room or put our dog on the bed, and then when I take off my sleep mask and none of those things happened, again, it’s terrifying. Does this happen to anyone else?

"Not sure how to cope with my bpd boyfriend’s outbursts, any advice is appreciated. ",1715605129.0,"Hi there, 

Been with my boyfriend now 2 years and we were friends before that for 5 years. Things are good most of the time, besides his occasional emotional outbursts. 
For some context, I have autism myself and he recently got his diagnosis of bpd 6 months ago. 

In the last 2 years he has “broken up” with me 2 times, what usually happens is he gets highly emotional about some subject, gets angry, blames me for imaginary things and leaves for 2 weeks. He comes back, apologizes and tries to fix things. 

The last time this happened was 4 months ago, and it was quite an ugly break up. I had to call his primary doctor because he was screaming that he wanted to end his life, after his doctor came to our home to check on him, he left again. 

Right after he left, he texted me he told me he’s going on vacation with his family for 3 weeks and he’s going to get drunk and have sex with every woman he sees. 

He had me blocked for about a week, then came back again. Wanted to talk things out. And actually since then things had been better than ever before. 


But now he left to go on that vacation with his family and last night he was suddenly not on his phone for several hours (when the rest of the whole vacation he had been texting every hour) I texted him that i was going to go to sleep and hope I could speak tomorrow morning. 


He texted me he was out on a walk with his brother and then he started drunk calling me, I picked up the first time and he was in some loud bar, he sounded very drunk. I texted him that I heard what was going on and it made me feel uncomfortable and if he could please let me know in the morning what’s going on. 

He blew up at me, cursing, name calling and told me to just block him and get this shit over with. I didn’t block him.

I left him be for the night and have yet to text him, but I’m really not sure what to do. 

How can I deal with this and what’s the best actions to take when he gets like this? 

I hope somebody can help and sorry for the long read

She suggested I was being emotionally abused a long time ago.

Help understanding ,1715131421.0,"Please help me understand what causes a partner to just do a complete 360 and tell you they hate you and don’t want to be with you any longer. He bought a transport that wasn’t ever going to actually be his via a lease program with a carrier. Didn’t read the paperwork and was going to own nothing in the end. So I persisted and fought the company and he took ownership of his truck. Then the engine needed to be rebuilt, which was $40G.. then he had to put the truck on with another carrier that he didn’t ask the proper questions, and they told him the pay would be the numbers he wanted to make but didn’t disclose the cost of fuel. So the long and short is he’s been miserable there since December. 

I weigh 130lbs am 5ft7 and he’s began calling me fat and that my chest hangs to my knees. When I try to express he’s hurting me he tells me to get out there is the door go find someone else. If the conversation isn’t what he wants to talk about then I’m nothing he hates me doesn’t like me and is so tired of fighting everyday. The thing is the fight becomes as a result of his extremely agitated and aggressive mood. 

We have been together 21 years and thinking back over the last 6/7years his mood seems to change just prior to Christmas and gets worse into the earlier part of the new year and then eventually evens back out..

He’s threatening he’s leaving but has nowhere to go, nor do I. He’s been sleeping on the couch for the past almost 9 days.

Scared of my own mental state,1715096371.0,"I’m a mom in my 40s. Of multiples and a dog as well who needs so much attention. I am mid-processing childhood trauma and just this diagnosis alone, and really experienced so much trauma in the past couple years that I’m just a shaky mess. My husband and I have been extremely rocky. Since day 1 honestly and now 5 years later it is just so toxic I can not think straight. My abandonment wound is raw and open , I was told by my therapist she thinks that I finally felt “safe” enough to work on it. That was a whole two months worth of my husband being gentle, kind, compassionate, empathetic and truly acting safe and he was emotionally validating me for the first time ever. Yes recently. 

So yes I agree. I did feel safe. But like normal , the ball dropped. He devalued me. Hard. He goes into this mode for up to two weeks. He devalues, he doesn’t understand me at all out of nowhere, he looks at me with disgust and triggers the abandonment hard because he shuts all the way off emotionally. Completely disconnects. Uses silent treatment for weeks and unfortunately my mom raised me doing that shit.  It has always been a head fck but now it is worse than ever. I really feel he’s idealizing me , I mean the man Worships me and that is no exaggeration and then goes hard into  devaluing me constantly. I can not leave. Not anytime soon. It is wild and confusing and so hard to put into words. 

Anyway this time came with him telling me he’s going to another state via plane for a job today until next week. He’s never done that as his jobs were never more than a 20 min radius. So I’m in a very fuckd up space. Obviously shit got very bad last night and I locked him out of the house impulsively but he walked in the back door no problem and blocked me. We have rebuilding trust issues due to betrayals early on and removing his location is a trigger let alone blocking me before he goes to another state. It feels like raw abandonment physically and emotionally. I did something weird for me and blocked him too and told myself “this is the time to run with this and go for separation into divorce asap” woke up to see somehow I got a notification that he shared his location again but because I blocked him I still can’t see it. I’m trying to stay strong. It’s hard.

If you’ve stayed this long, I just need some words from the wise who have maybe gone through a toxic divorce or long term break up and how did you stay sane? Last night I was wondering if I should do a weekend trip to the mental ward, But waking up on Mother’s Day in a mental ward over some inconsistent dude is just not ok. As I stated I’m dealing with lots of trauma not just him but to have this perfect human just absolutely shut off and destroy me didn’t help.

"It will be my birthday on Friday, and I will be completely alone.",1713820347.0,"I will be turning 30, and it's the first time in my life that I will be completely alone on my birthday, mostly because I realized that none of my most important relationships is reciprocal enough, and no one prioritizes me, so I'd rather be alone by choice rather than expecting something that will never come.

My mother probably won't even remember, and even if she did, she would only be willing to celebrate on her terms, which would be lunch somewhere extremely close to her home. My father wouldn't even want to come with us. 

My partner is a musician and the only gig he managed to get the whole entire week, is on Friday. And I resent him because I work 40+ hours a day, cook, clean, and so on, while he sleeps, or plays games, or just rests, just for him to work on the absolute single day that I'd like to celebrate with him. And the weekend won't be an option because I'll be visiting my parents on Saturday as I always do, and he accepted an UNPAID fucking gig on Sunday.

I love them all a lot, and it really hurts me that things are like this. On previous years, I would take the day off, organize my own birthday lunch, pick everyone up, pay for everyone, drop them off, and be happy. But things have changed and circumstances have made me realize that I did too much, and it wasn't appreciated. I would drop everything and do anything for the people I love, but that wasn't reciprocal at all, and it hurt. So I've changed my way of loving and now I feel so empty and like an awful person, but at least I'm not pushing myself in vain.

I want to feel grateful, but I just feel sad.

Questions,1713677704.0,"So I was diagnosed with Bpd when i was about 18 or 19 years old, when i was put on a 72 hour hold at a psych unit. I definitely was having a mental breakdown. Thought everyone in my life was basically acting. Like placed in my life to act the position they were playing.  I guess basically the Truman show, without the cameras. I most definitely  was not okay when was released. I just knew i had to lie and tell them i didn't think that shit anymore or they werent going to let me out. so i faked it. I was ordered to go to see a pysch dr after release which i did, one time.  In that visit they diagnosed me with having Bipolar 2 & borderline Personality disorder, then the dr said he's going to leave the room to discuss with another dr what meds i should be one. I asked if i could go outside and smoke a cig, they said yeah, and during the cigarette break i got in my car and left lol.  I now wish i hadn't done. I'm a 41 year old man now that definitely knows there's always been something wrong with me. I don't the difference in bipolar 1 and 2 but i've always thought that diagnoses was bullshit anyway because i NEVER go thru fits a mania or depression.  I'm generally an even tempered individual. However they symptoms of BPD are pretty much spot on with the catastrophe of a life i've lived.  However I've read a lot of contradicting things about it and different descriptions.  Is there anyway that could maybe explain it a little better to me? Also does anyone know of anything really that helps. Coping mechanisms. Are there any meds?

I'd truly like ya'lls insight. Its a lot! Did I split on him? ,1713656570.0,"So I just got divorced on the 15th. Because my ""past self"" cheated on my ex twice. I say past self because I had ECT, and the treatments got to the point where I came too one day where I don't remember the past 8 months. I actually go by Persephone because I don't want to be associated to what that person was. 

  
But with this divorce, he informed me he is willing to give me a second chance, which included me giving him space until he's ready to talk.  I feel like I might have fucked it up. Because I'm going through some living insecurities. The house that I'm living in, was the last full memory I have. It was us moving in. So there are some stuff in the house that belong to his mother, that she gave to us. She wanted it back, but then decided to just leave it at the house. Today I had to inform them that I might have to break my lease and the furniture might be left here. I wanted to give them the opportunity to pick up the items. I also shared with him me having to possibly move out. He responded with ""Okay. I give you condolences"" followed up with "" What do you expect me to say or do"". To which I literally just told him I have no right to ask him for anything, but also that I have no way to reach out to what used to be our friends because of what past self did. I also just told him I'm trying to survive, and I'm asking for help, hoping someone will give me grace. 

But then after sitting with my thoughts (while high) I just felt so bad for vomiting all that to him. I was supposed to be giving him this time. I apologized for unloading that all on him, and told him i'll step back. if he wants to reach out he can.. I told him I messed up, and that i'm scared of the future.

My (42M) wife (41F) wants a divorce because I didn't realize I was using a logical fallacy. ,1713621346.0,"I know the title is kind of clickbaity. Obviously there is a shit ton of context from the past 17 years of marriage that I will try to sum up in a few sentences. 

I recently realized that I most likely suffer from BPD. Tons of childhood trauma and abandonment issues etc. In both this marriage and my first marriage I was abusive. I allowed my anxiety, misogyny, and narcissistic traits to keep me from listening to her. I constantly got angry when criticized, lashed out, called her horrible names, manipulated her, etc etc. I could go on for hours about all the things I did, but suffice it to say the only thing I didn't do wrong is that I never put my hands on her. 

I know I fucked up this marriage on my own. We have been on the edge of divorce many times in the last few years but she always has decided to give me more chances that I squandered. I know what got me here and if she had just said that she would never be able to move on from all those years of abuse and that because of that she was done, I would understand and not blame her. 

The BPD epiphany changed almost everything. I have learned how to remove myself from situations and analyze my thought process. I have stopped raising my voice, manipulating, getting angry and have basically been able to have difficult conversations without any sort of abuse. Admittedly this is only the last few months but I can tell this change is real and permanent in myself. She told me she wanted to give me a chance to change all these awful things about myself because she loved me. 

A few days ago we had a disagreement about how to handle something serious with our autistic daughter. We she asked me not to handle it that way I was taken aback because she had done the same thing in the past. I immediately jumped to ""But don't you do it too?"". We talked about it later and I still saw it as hypocrisy. I didn't get upset, I didn't raise my voice or call names or be rude or uncaring in any way. I just continued to disagree with her and told her that despite that disagreement I was fine with doing things her way, and that I wouldn't resent her for it.

She was not happy with this and continued to press me on why I disagreed. I continued to not get upset, basically begging her to just be OK with me agreeing to do things her way. This was not sufficient. Early into the first conversation about this, when she tried to re-explain her  reasoning behind why I shouldn't disagree, she got visibly frustrated and angry. Something that happens early in every conversation like this (understandable given the past), and that sends me into panic mode.  Yesterday afternoon when she explained it again using the phrase ""Tu Quoque"", I looked it up and it finally clicked that I was being stupid. I took accountability for my failure to listen fully and apologized. 

Unfortunately now she says she is done. I asked her why she thinks this is divorce-worthy when I have changed all the hurtful things I used to do, and am just struggling to reprogram my brain into being able to listen and digest when she gets angry and I am panicking about it. I know this is likely a straw that broke the camels back kind of thing, but if we really are giving this a chance to save the marriage I don't think I did anything serious enough to give up on that. 

She actually suggested that I write this post so that I can get perspective from people with no skin in the game.

"I wish people would stop romanticizing BPD. I wish people would stop painting us as quirky psychos. To all those persons who do it, FU! ",1713621515.0,"So, I recently came across an indie game that's been kind of controversial. I wanted to try it out just to see if it was as interesting as people claim it to be, so I also decided to take a look at the game's subreddit, and OH GOD, it made my blood boil. 

To briefly summarize it, the plot follows these two siblings who find themselves in a codependent relationship with one another as they commit various crimes while trying to survive a dystopian world.

There's a few other topics that make this game controversial, but I won't talk about them since I don't find those to be relevant at all.  

The thing is that these two siblings aren't the most healthy persons on earth when it comes to their mental health. – They're fictional characters, but people don't seem to understand that. 

The subreddit's first post I came across was: ""Where can I find a woman with her personality?"" - Referring to one of the siblings. 

Some of the comments were: 

– Redditor 1: ""Any forum for someone who has a cluster B personality disorder (histrionic, narcissistic, antisocial, borderline)"" 

– OP responds: ""Where are these forums exactly?"" 

– Redditor 2: *** Proceeds to link a BPD subreddit *** 

– OP: Thanks. 

➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️

– Redditor X: ""BPD forums""

– OP responds: ""Now this right here is a man you can trust with your life. Thanks homie.""

– Redditor X: *** Sends a winking gif *** 

– Redditor Y: ""ooh yeah, they're intense""

➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️

– Redditor Z: ""you all want a BPD b¡tch until u actually have to deal with her"" 

– OP responds: ""It's useless to argue you, so here, have a picture of Chairman Mao"" ~ *** Sends a meme *** 

➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️➖️

Wow. Just WOW. 

At first, I thought they were joking, but after reading all the comments, I finally understood these people were being completely serious. ( Not to mention how disrespectful some others were when referring to people with mental health issues... ) 

I don't usually mind jokes about mental health, but there's limits to everything. Reading all those comments left me with a bitter taste. 

The fact that people are so quick to compare someone with such a painful disorder to an effing quirky video game character just makes me so mad... 'Cause yeah, I am aware some characters do present disorders, but c'mon, it's not something ""cool""! 

We are not your fucking fantasy, we are people who struggle with their mental health. We deserve some respect.

If you want to simp over a fictional character, go ahead and do it, but don't trick people into your sick games just because you have a fantasy...

She threatened with a police protection order / restraining order. She was serious and sent me a certified letter and I was very confused. It’s not dangerous to want to meet your wife for a coffee once a month. Then I remembered there is no reason for that fear except her mental illness and it’s not fully my fault. 

I love her deeply and hope to salvage my marriage - even if she’s unwell. 


Question: What’s the best way to get someone like this back? 


Please not looking for advice on why I shouldn’t be in a relationship. She’s an incredible person and I want what I want. Just trying to figure out how to maximize my changes. I’m not sure if it’s with a heart felt letter that I mail or a huge bouquet of roses or just to give her lots of space and pretend she doesn’t exist. 

This isn’t a normal situation so I don’t know how to deal with it.

I feel like i’m just existing and going on autopilot.,1713607440.0,"This isn’t a plea for help. Just asking for advice from someone like me to help.

I was diagnosed a few months ago, with Borderline Personality Disorder. I felt like there was always something wrong with me. Like something didn’t fit properly—something didn’t go the way it should’ve. After my diagnosis from my psychiatrist, some things partially made sense.

I don’t know how to love properly because it just turns into an obsessive thinking style. “If i don’t get a reply from this person within a few minutes, i’m going to go crazy”. or “i wish i had their location so i know that they’re okay. But i also want it so i know they’re not going somewhere they told me they wouldn’t”. It would kill me. I would call them several times then hang up. 

It got so bad at one point with a person that if they didn’t text me throughout the day, i believed they hated me. That they thought i was annoying. I am very good at masking—however, eventually i lose friendships because of my own thinking.

I would self sabotage my own relationships. I would become dependable on my friendships because i made the thought that “friends are family”. But it was true—i didn’t really have a family. 

I don’t know how to process losing a friend properly. I don’t know how to let go. I don’t know how to be okay that not everyone wants to be around me 25/8 like i do with them. I don’t know how not to take things seriously and not to “wear my heart on my sleeve.”

And if i get told one more time “just let it go” or “let them go” i’m going to go ape shit. It is so physically and mentally very difficult for me to do let alone over another person. Especially if they’ve done something that has wronged me. Because knowing me—no matter how badly someone has hurt me, i refuse to let them go because we were once friends/partners.

I guess the point i was attempting to get to was, i want to stop becoming emotionally dependent on people. And of course to not be emotionally vulnerable ALL THE TIME. And how to really let go of someone in a healthy way.

Realizing I'm still bpd (duh),1713605532.0,"Diagnosed around 2017 as borderline it definitely fit. But I actually forgot I was diagnosed because I was struggling so much with psychosis (I'm also schizoaffective). I was thinking I didn't qualify anymore because of how ""calm"" my life has been. But when I checked the symptoms it was dead on. 

I can't maintain friendships. My only friend is my husband who absolutely is my fp my whole world revolves around him. We live and work together and I still get lonely if we're not side by side. I frequently cry thinking of him dying (was told that's fear of abandonment). I would do anything for him, be anything, I'm unhealthily in love. 

Most of my destructive habits are food related now because I can't drink/smoke due to psych meds and I can't self harm or it'll upset my husband. Sometimes I resent him because I want to self destruct and can't fully. 

I feel so empty inside. Most my emotions are muted most of the time then it switches to 150% on blast. I don't feel like a real person. I have no aspirations for the future. If it wasn't for my husband and cats I wouldn't be here. I don't know why I'm still alive. 

I switch on people so much. I try to be reasonable and remember people are complex but it's still very black and white. Often I defend people for too long then the switch flips and they're now dead to me. 

I have no idea what I really like or not. I've been so many different people. I feel transient. I've struggled with gender, religion, fashion, etc. I'm just a conglomerate of mismatched pieces. I go through more phases than the moon.

There's more but I just needed to get this off my chest. So yeah, I may not be as outwardly reckless as I used to be but I'm still borderline af and I don't know what to do about it. I've thought about going back to therapy but it's so hard to find a good one.

I’m starting to have severe night terrors the last week where I wake up very hot and confused, thinking I’m lost or in the past and like I left or forgot something somewhere. It’s like a panic attack with impending doom and my heart is just racing out of my chest. I literally feel like it’s ghosts or demons around me I get so scared.

My friendships having been dying off over the last few years literally like bursting into flames. I feel like I always end up with female friends who are selfish, extremely entitled, and/or very secretly jealous and hateful to me behind closed doors. My last friendship of 5 years that ended she wouldn’t stop being inappropriate towards my bf, I had been single for 2 years and knew in advance I couldn’t ever bring a bf around her because she was always needing any/all male attention in the room. She also did very mean/nice sick things to confuse you. Before that a 2 year friendship ended because she really envied the $ I made but would never take my advice.. she ended up majorly body shaming me sending pics of me to her ex while they bashed me for being too skinny while she was on a vacation with me that I was paying for. Then another friend who yes has severe drug addiction and I was delusional to think that was healthy because she has severe trauma and it plays out. It seems like the women I attract all secretly hate other girls but sometimes I hear that’s just how women are. I’ve had plenty of other friendships end, ironically many revolving around traveling and it brought out just how selfish and intolerant “my way or the hwy” these “friends” were.

I still miss him two years later ,1713580580.0,"
I went out with this guy a few times in 2022. We met on a dating app, I wasn’t even going to match with him but I saw that he had paid to superlike me so I thought I’d give him a chance. We only saw each other twice but he made me feel things nobody ever had. I really really liked him. He made me feel happy and I think he really did genuinely care for me. He’s the most attractive man I’ve ever met. I felt so safe when I was with him. I remember that we talked a bit about the future and what our goals are. He said his goal in the future was to get married, buy a house in the country, have a family, live off the land and so on… it stuck with me for a long time because that’s what I want too. And in that moment all I could imagine was us being like that in the future. I was so happy. We texted each other all week until we saw each other the next weekend. That time we were hanging out and I smoked weed for the first time. While we were high he told me he thought I was special and that we already had a very strong bond and connection. I felt so comfortable with him since I met him I felt the same. We planned to see each other the following weekend but the next day he texted me and said he had bad news and would phone me after work. He told me he might be moving across the country  due to family stuff. He said he didn’t want to burn any bridges because you never know what could happen in the future. He sounded really upset and so was I. He said we shouldn’t talk until he found out. I sat down and didn’t move for at least half an hour after I hung up the phone. A few days  later I texted him and he replied something: I’m really sorry but my family doesn’t approve of me seeing you. “You’re a beautiful person and I’m sorry that they don’t see you that way. This is going to hurt me a lot but I’m sorry, goodbye”. I don’t really remember what happened after that as I was smoking copious amounts of cannabis that summer. (I’m pretty sure “his family didn’t approve of me” because I was recovering from psychosis and at the time my diagnosis was schizoaffective bipolar, I was very unstable around this time too. A few weeks before that I had my first date and the guy OD’d after our date unrelated but anyways). I hooked up with a lot of guys that summer trying to get over him. Then a few months later he reaches out and says we should reconnect as friends. I ignored it as I was with my boyfriend who I dated for a year. Anyways a few months later after the novelty of dating my bf wore off I started to miss him so much and I would cry and cry about him thinking of what could’ve been. I kept thinking that I was going to be with him, whether it’s 10 years in the future or whatever. I believed we were soulmates and connected together for life. But at the same time I felt he had probably forgotten who I was. I couldn’t stop thinking about him and I felt so bad because I loved my boyfriend. But I remember thinking of him while we were having sex and feeling guilty and sad and cruel. The thoughts about him subsided until about a year after I was going out with him I saw a guy who looked like him kiss a girl and I freaked out. I was so distraught. I was so depressed (and on meds that didn’t work at the time) and he was all I could think of. I listened to music and fantasied about him, us being together, thinking of our time together. One night I was feeling really I don’t even know how to describe it but I wasn’t me. I made a fake phone number and texted to him “you’re one of the reasons why she killer herself”. No context to the message. Then when I came to I felt like an idiot. A bit later I checked and he had unblocked me idk when, but I texted him and admitted to him how I felt towards him and that I still liked him and would do anything to be with him again basically. He said that he misses what we had too but it was in the past now and that he was sorry but he wasn’t looking for a relationship and he was going to the military soon but was very flattered that I told him. We agreed to still be friends although we haven’t talked since. After I told him it calmed down a lot and I got over him for the first time. I was sad but I felt peace of mind. A few weeks later he started commenting on my instagram posts, liking my stories and comments on reels videos, replying to them, even added me to his close friends story. I thought nothing of it because I think he was just trying to be friendly. Around this time I also broke up with my boyfriend who id been dating at the time because I didn’t feel he loved me and I didn’t feel a connection. And then a month later I find out he has a GIRLFRIEND. And it crushed me. Because I knew I would never be with him. He’s moved on from me. I’ll never be someone special in his head like he is to me. And that makes me so sad. That I think of him in all these different ways, that I consider him my first love, but I mean nothing to him. I’ll just be one of the girls he went out with a few years ago, if he even remembers me. I went to Europe this winter with family and for some reason I couldn’t stop thinking of him. I was dissociating almost the whole trip, hallucinating, got physically assaulted. I wrote our names in the sand and (TW) fantasied about ending both our lives while having sex so we would be bound together forever physically and in death. He was forever mine in my heart. When I got back home I started feeling better. I started to resent him for what he did to me. How he treated me, acting like he cared about me just to abandon me. Telling me we had a bond and acting like he wanted to be with me. He ruined my life for at least a year. And I hate that he takes up space and memory in my mind. He’s the reason why my attachment issues are so bad. Why I never believe nobody will stay with me or want to be with me. He ruined how I perceive relationships.  Now mainly I’m happy for him that he’s doing what he what’s to do and that he has a girlfriend and that they love each other. But sometimes it makes me sad. He’ll always think of her. She’ll always be way more special to him than me, even after he breaks up with her. He will only think of her and never me. I want to say I still hope we’ll be together one day but I don’t even believe it anymore. I only really think of him when something reminds me of him (hence why I started writing this). It makes my heart ache with dread and sorrow. I’m over him for real, but I still want him. I still cry when I think of him. If I could just wake up and it’s all been a bad dream since then I would never take anything for granted again. I just wish i could meet a person that one ups him.

i feel (and can’t feel) a lot of scary things, and while i have a boyfriend of 3 years and my family/friends are very “family oriented” it’s still really difficult to open up or try to explain what my brain is putting me through and it’s so tough to feel like they understand (they don’t) — it’s hard to feel a connection with anyone around me when i don’t feel seen or heard or understood at all. i barely understand myself. but lacking connection with everyone around me is really taking a toll on my mental health and putting me into a really shitty isolated, dissociated, frozen mental state.. 

i’m just desperate to find a connecting conversation that feels like it makes sense to all parties.. i feel like thatd get my gear’s in motion and yield at least some progress regarding getting my mental health under control

i mask a lot with psychiatrists and therapists and i try not to but 🤷🏻‍♀️ it doesn’t feel genuine because they charge me $300+ an hour to feel heard.. i understand it’s their job but idk it’s tough to open up when it feels so transactional and medical

this sounds dumb but i looked for a support group in my area and i was hoping to find a little group of people that understand (?) and we could just meet every so often to feel seen in a world full of people that don’t feel nearly as intensely as we do, “fill each others cup’s” — i didn’t find one so reddit was my next best bet but texting/online doesn’t seem as genuine or helpful to me and i’m thinking it has the potential to connect me with people who will enable behaviors that maybe aren’t ideal 😂

"Trileptal/Oxcarbazepine, anyone?",1713566493.0,"Hey y'all! I've just recently been diagnosed with BPD. First it was schizoaffective disorder, but then I went to a realllly experienced doctor with a phd and he diagnosed me almost immediately, we ran some tests and holy shit I've never understood myself better!

Anyways, I was prescribed Lamotrigine (which is basically Lamictal) and everything was amazing, my emotions were under control for the first time in ever i could feel like a normal person, but then I developed a rash on my hands and my gland was swollen :( I felt really disappointed and guilty (idek why) and, of course, had to stop taking ut immediately. Then my psych prescribed me Depakine and honestly, it didnt really do much for me, I scooped super low, self harm, hysterical crying and rage, almost broke up with my bf again, suicidal thought abd etc. 

So I went to the psych again. I offered him to try a Lamotrigine rechallenge, which is when you try to get back on it again super slow, but he suggested not to risk it and changed it to Trileptal now (Oxcarbazepine). I'll be upping my dosage super slow. Not seeing any side effects yet, apart from the fact that im sleepy (but maybe that's also influenced by my period). But honestly, I felt very discouraged because everyone keeps saying that itwas so incredibly amazing and its the first drug that's always prescribed... I don't see that many positive reviews for Trileptal from thise with BPD. Has anyone here had a good dinamic on it? Does it cause loss of libido?

feeling like my partner is not real/imposter?,1713556971.0,"in the last few months i had an ""abandonment spree"", there were breakups, rejections and cutting off entire friend groups, which obviously did not affect my mental health in a good way.

but recently i met this wonderful woman with whom we click and understand each other on so many levels, and it soon became a relationship, and i felt like we were completely ""in sync"" the entire time since we met.

yesterday was a very difficult day for me due to my responsibilities and annoyances of my current living situation (period pain didn't help either), which reminded me a lot of my trauma and made me mentally exhausted and a bit detached by the end of the day.

me and her texted each other until late in the evening, and something completely innocent in our conversation triggered my childhood neglect trauma, and for some reason my mind immediately stopped believing that the person im talking to is the same wonderful person ive been spending all this amazing time with lately.

i barely have any memories of her aside from the most basic information, i feel like this is some kind of stranger that is for some reason acting like she's very close to me. 

today i was trying to explain the situation to her in text messages and after she said she wishes she could give me a hug right now, i felt like i lost control of my body and immediately typed ""get the fuck away from me, you monster"", while shaking and having blurry vision.

i just want to get back to how it was the day before that, i don't understand why this is happening, i never experienced anything like this in my adult years, i understand none of that is true on a rational level, but my emotions are completely delusional, and i just wanna steer them back to how they were, i don't recognize my own voice",podokonnicheck,:pride:LGBT+:pride:,False,1c86ey0,5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1c86ey0/feeling_like_my_partner_is_not_realimposter/

Our last two sessions, the only two sessions I’ve had with her, have been me just talking quickly about everything and everyone. Nothing but negativity and feeling like I deserve the loneliness and people staying away from me. I told her from the beginning that I’d like to do sessions every week until we start CBT or until I feel I can listen and she started putting me down for every other week anyway.

Guy coworker confronts me then blocks me?,1716399651.0,"In the past, I had talked to one of my coworkers. I was young, dumb and naïve. I made mistakes. A long time ago, I was in this enclosure room with this girl checking me out from my shift. I had asked her, ""Should I f\*\*\* \_\_\_\_\_ or am I just bored?"" Someone outside the door heard and told the guy. Ever since, we haven't been cool. Later on, he was supposed to leave for the USMC, so he had hit me up. We talked and hooked up multiple times. I talked about our relationship with a few other coworkers and he did not like that either. We were always on and off.

I would drive about a hour away just to see him. One time I asked him, are we fwb? He said no, you're nothing to me. Yet, I still continued to see him. Something happened and we stopped talking. I had made a joke at work with our mutual coworker saying that he's my work ex. The coworker told him and he texted me very angrily, so we stopped talking. On New Years, I texted him and he didn't answer. Months later, he texted me hi. I texted him back and I didn't know who it was because I had deleted his number, so I called him. It was him. Later he texted me saying sometimes I miss you then I said well I don't then he says, proud of you and that was it. No contact after that.

A month later, time has past. I've been working on myself and I realized that work is just work. He's not the only person I had conflicts with. Regardless, when I'm at work, I try to help everyone. Regardless whether I like you or not, I will offer help. Now I try to keep my work and personal life separate. Just because me and him had history. Yesterday, I worked with him and I offered him help once then he was like I'm fine. After, I accidentally rang in an extra drink, so I went up to him and my coworker (I'm good friends with her) and offered them this drink. Neither of them wanted it. It's whatever.

After I get off of work, I saw that he texted me. He said, ""I'd appreciate it if you stopped trying to talk to me at work, you've talked too much shit about me there. It's fake and manipulative. Thanks."" I tried to text him back, but I saw that he blocked me.

I want to confront him at work, in a respectful way. I want to tell him like, hey I don't think you got my text, but I know what I did in the past was fucked up and I have been working on myself. I hope we can just be civil at work and please don't take acts of help so personally, I just enjoy helping everyone.

I don't hate him. We're just two very broken people who are not compatible. Yes, I admit and I am now very self aware of how I was not a good person back then, but I know for a fact that I have grown a lot from that. In the end, I want to be able to help everyone without feeling uncomfortable. Teamwork is something I value as well as helping others.

4 months ago I found out my meds were killing me (dramatic but it was Stevens-Johnson's Syndrome) and they took me off them immediately. Not good. Greatly slowed my career-trajectory.

Thoughts on Self Confidence & Self Love with BPD,1716391679.0,"With BPD, it's such an insane struggle to have any sort of confidence or self love when I'm having irrational thoughts and feelings (which is most of the time), and cause the turmoil in my relationships that I cause. It's no secret that those with BPD often experience very painful self loathing and hatred, and because of that are at a much higher risk for suicide. I'd like to believe that gaining confidence in myself and learning to love myself for who I am is possible. But I just don't know how to do it while having such a painful, debilitating, and destructive mental illness - I think maybe accepting who I am and the illness I have would be a good first step. But how do I do that?

Over the years I have become filled with bitterness and anger for the fact that I am forced to be alive with this illness. I am so angry. I live my life angry at everything. Angry at the things that have happened to me in the past, angry at things that I wouldn't have cared about at all ten years ago. I'm angry that any positive emotion I have can disappear completely at the blink of an eye over something that shouldn't matter at all, because of this illness. I have no patience, no grace, no slack for myself, and it shows. It feeds my self-hatred. And when it's that intense, others know it, too.

I tend to think that having such strong hatred for who I am as a person is somehow a selfish way to think. Maybe that's contradictory. Who am I to think that I, as a whole in who I am, matter so much that I deserve to be singled out from the rest of the world because I am 'bad'? Who am I to think that I don't deserve to be on this planet when all that I am is a living, breathing organism who exists because of a couple thousand miracles that brought me together? What is it that people say... Matter can neither be created nor destroyed, and so our bodies are made from literal stardust! What a fucking miracle! I am not significant in the sense that I am just a human. I'm not an alien, like my brain likes to tell me I am. My limbs are made of flesh and bone and blood. But I am important - I'm the most important thing in the world, right? I only perceive things from my own perception. For all I know, nothing is real outside of my perception of the world! And I only get to experience what it feels like and what it is to be ALIVE once. How DARE I take that for granted. I'm lucky to be able to feel emotions, to taste, smell, to be able to know how different it is to stand on cool grass versus warm sand. I know what it's like to be drenched by rain on a warm afternoon. I know what it's like to laugh with a friend. I am ALIVE. So why would I put any effort into anything that keeps me from actually believing it? Why do I wallow in my sickness? Why do I intentionally feed the anger by hating myself?

I am so tired of hating myself. I believe that every person on this planet has some inherent value and that their lives are worth something. I have yet to include myself in that list. But I want to. And I want the same for others who may feel similarly to myself. I want to stop being selfish, and I want to see myself as I see others.

Writing this post has somehow been therapeutic for me - talking about what it's like to be alive has made me feel it, just a little bit. I hope it does for you, too.

Those of you who consider yourselves to be self confident and have love for yourself - how did you do it? Is confidence something you were born with? Or did you put time and effort into building your confidence? How do you manage building and maintaining confidence & self love while having BPD?

And for those who don't - what motivates you to want to love yourself? What's holding you back? What can you do right now to make yourself feel loved and worthy of feeling loved? What makes you feel ALIVE? ",Rough-Presence8379,,False,1cy30pr,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cy30pr/thoughts_on_self_confidence_self_love_with_bpd/
Boundaries,1716388468.0,"I am 46 years old, and I think I finally understand boundaries. Boundaries are not what you ask others to do for you or respect for you, though I do agree they need to be respected (yeah I know, ironic, keep reading). Boundaries are what you do for yourself, that requires nothing from someone else, to be better and take care of yourself.

I never understood boundaries because I was always led to believe that I had to endure the pain, so I never gave myself boundaries and thus I never understood to respect them in return. I was so emotionally, verbally and physically abused as a kid that it never occurred to me that I didn’t have to endure it all, ALL THE TIME. That I didn’t need to continuously feel uncomfortable and therefore I learned to be triggered and fight-or-flight my way out of every situation. I would endure the hurt until I could no longer and then lash out and hurt EVERYONE around me, viciously and violently, specially when I feared being abandoned. I would endure days of suffering instead of removing myself from the situation every time and paid the just price for my reaction.

More than one thing can be true: 
That I’ve done inexcusable things that I’m ashamed of and I will never be forgiven for. That I’ve created trauma and that I did so because I never understood that I had to take care of myself enough to stop hurting. My reality has been a more than willing addiction to feeling awful almost all the time, specially as a consequence of my actions, in a vicious never ending cycle.

The only person I’ve avoided actively lashing as much out at, the only person I unknowingly set up a boundary for, has been my son. Unfortunately I did it by literally staying away from him, being stand off(ish), being barely there. At times letting someone else raise the poor kid. Hurting him in a completely different and I’m sure, lasting way. Maybe even perpetuating the cycle.

I’ve tortured myself for 46 years. I’ve tortured for 46 years everyone I’ve loved.

Apologies do nothing at this point, so I’ll spare everyone what I’ve become so good at. I just wish I didn’t have a mountain of dead bodies, figuratively speaking, behind me. I was just trying to protect myself, badly and awfully, as stupid as that sounds, and that matters not one bit anymore.

I just saw him tonight and was so hyped about it and he seemed pretty happy too. I normally see him when I go with my mom and tonight was the same. We always talk about my pets and his kids, and neither of us have ever gotten a weird vibe about him. He’s super nice. 

He gave us (more specifically me) his number so we could talk more cause he works graveyard now and I don’t go during graveyard. He doesn’t recognize my mom when I’m not there but he recognizes me. Probably because I’m super loud and immediately start talking like I know him, but my mom doesn’t do that. He seems somewhere in his 30’s and this is the only potentially weird thing he’s done. My mom and I both agree he’s never seemed weird at all, and he also gave me the number in front of my mom which lowers the weirdness level. 

I’m sitting here trying to convince myself it’s not weird and it won’t go badly. I’m 20 non-binary AFAB. He’s seen me with a partner before so he at least could assume I’m dating (I’m not but still). He also sees me with my mom and knows we’re close.

He has the same name as a guy who tried to groom me and threatened to kill me n my family which isn’t helpful, but not his fault. It’s a common name. I really like him (platonically) and I hope this doesn’t go poorly. It’s my favorite gas station and I really do enjoy talking to him about random stuff. I’m trying not to over think this.

Can you guys help me relate to my dad?,1716340495.0,"Hello, I come hoping to learn because I am struggling and as a result, I fear I am causing the suffering of my dad and I don't want to do that. I will apologize in advance if this is long and also for any misunderstanding that I have that comes off as judgemental or ignorant about BPD. I just am starting to learn about this and need perspective. 

My dad and I have had a really difficult relationship for many years. I feel he criticizes, micromanages and constantly blames others for problems that he creates and spends lots of time talking about how he is the victims of life's constant bad circumstances against him. At the same time, my dad has caused a lot of harm to people whom I love. My half brother and sister from my mom's first marriage were treated very poorly by him, but my dad doesn't acknowledge any of that and it is hurtful. He has also been unkind and rude to my mother whom I treasure. I have spoken to him about his many, many times in many ways.

The situation has gotten worse after my mom recently passed away in September. My dad has been openly resentful and hurtful toward my mom almost consistently in the 30 years since they got divorced. Since she passed I told him in no uncertain terms that I cannot have him speak ill of my mom. That I don't want to ever hear him talk about their marriage or divorce and that I will not suffer him saying anything negative or hurtful about her. 

On my mom's first Heavenly birthday just a few weeks ago, he sent me a completely unsolicited message and among other things made negative comments about her and about their marriage. It was devastating to me. I had already been keeping my dad at an arms length but this made me want to go no contact. 

As I have been talking with my therapist about this, she has repeatedly stated that she believes that my dad has BPD and that he ""isn't capable of a relationship in the way that I want and expect my dad to show up for me"" and that "" people with BPD suffer immensely emotionally because of the difficulty they have to connect"" which made me feel that I am needlessly hurting my dad by withholding my relationship with him if he truly doesn't understand how his actions and words harm me. 

I have decided that I want to try to have a relationship with my dad but I also need to have some self preservation and my dad does not seem to know when is hurting my heart. 

I am open to learning whatever I can to help me safely approach and foster a relationship with my dad and seek your guidance. If you have read this far, I appreciate you.

Systematic influence ,1716326160.0,"The systematic influence of media in young human and their development of whats good / bad (hero / villain) shape that can result in a black and white thinking flowing outside of the media reality into the common reality and brought into adulthood.

The often insensitive and dualistic used language catalyses the development of a black or white rhetoric leading into a black and white thinking, feeling and manifesting.

The rhetorical acrobatic dance around societies rules (law and customs) makes the patient close to neurotic behavior in an attempt to balance the application of the rule book and to control and regulate themselves.

At the same time the emotions are intensive and impulsive and require a skills to regulate around the rules of society. Again both written and unwritten.

If the intensity of the emotion is too strong and has not been noticed before, the brain can not regulate anymore and the emotion dictates the next action bypassing what we call our rational self. 
Sadness can dictate to cry or move away.
Anger can dictate to break the TV or even kill someone.
And being scared can make you run away

The magic is in becoming aware of the emotion before its too high and taking care of it in a way thats social adequate.

I met this guy D (21 at he time) when I was 19 and we dated for 9 months and I was really in love with him. This was 2 years ago. After we were together like 5 months it got abusive and we broke up for the first time, but it was toxic from the beginning, from both of us. We enabled each other and made each other worse if I’m being honest. But we were also really in love and his personality was so amazing and there were so many things I loved about him.

It ended after a really bad night where he was very violent and I felt my life was in danger. His family, especially his mum, put so so much strain on the relationship because she’s really controlling and didn’t like me. 

We didn’t talk for a long time, like 1.5 years. 

The first time we broke up I went to stay with my parents for the summer and I met a guy, P (22 at the time).  This was about 5 months into my relationship with D, but it was over and we had gone no contact, I didn’t know we would get back together for a short while after. P was great, smart and kind and we had much more similar interests and a real connection. The main issue with P is he doesn’t like unpredictable, crazy girls who are a lot. That’s me. I’m a lot of things he really likes, but not that. And he’s not perfect either. We’ve had a summer fling every year for the past three years and always blocked each other at the end, having annoyed and upset each other.

I hate alcohol.,1716320376.0,"TW: mentions of suicide, mentions of self harm

Kind of a vent ig?

I've been the most stable I've been in the last 3ish years. 
Typically I'd go around 2 weeks max without a suicide attempt.

But after my last one (Beginning of April). I decided I'm actually going to attempt to get help instead of sitting around letting myself rot because my ex was being an ass.

I took this giant leap of faith and took myself to the hospital, from then on started booking regular appointments with mh professionals, started utilising my CBT/DBT skills. Finally found a balance that works.

Met someone really cool in this time, things have been going great. There's challenges, a lot of them. But im working through them as tough as they are.

My intrusive thoughts decreased significantly to the point I'd say that I'd been doing spectacularly.

There's been one incident of self harm, 0 suicide attempts in OVER 55 DAYS.

I went to an event 2 days back and felt a little nervous and thought I'd have ONE drink. Now lucky me, I get to remember why I don't drink regularly.

I like alcohol, it's calming. Though I don't like have 3-4 straight days of anxiety, self doubt, intrusive thoughts and second guessing how everyone feels about me.

My BPD symptoms have been so minimal lately that I kinda felt slapped in the face when it all came to creep back up on me.

I'm surviving it, I've been okay. Haven't harmed myself or anything. Haven't had a breakdown, haven't lost it.

I'm just feeling quite anxious with all these awful thoughts in my head.

They're mostly what if statements.

I understand they aren't really logical ones as well, I'm just hoping this starts working it's way out soon.

That's why I'm a social drinker.
I've drunk a grand total of 4 times this year.

And I'm not planning to drink again for a while.

Alcohol is just a shitty trade.

30mins of feeling great for 3 whole days of bullshit.

I guess in a way it's progress, in the past I've tried to end myself after drinking and I'm nowhere near that point. 

Lately I've been a 1-2 out of a 10 rather than my usual 5. So I have no concerns over sh or suicide attempts.

Just rather on easing this discomfort so it hopefully doesn't turn into paranoia.

Relationship BPD help,1716306794.0,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year now and together for over two years. We’ve had our ups and downs but I feel like I have always been the one making sacrifices for his bad behavior and habits. He’s been abusive (emotionally and slightly physically when drunk) but I still refuse to let go even when I know he isn’t treating me how I deserve to be treated.  I’ve always been extremely attached to him however even before we were dating. I would have panic attacks and be insanely irrational any time we had to be apart or he wanted space or even just a trip home for the weekend. When we were living in dorms in college I would wake up in a panic if I’d realized I’d fallen asleep without him and would find any possibly solution to get us to spend the night together. 
Even nights before we were dating when I’d see him kissing someone else or he’d still be hanging out with his ex I’d be so angry in the moment but still feel that pull to him and I’d end up getting drunk or using drugs to fight that feeling of wanting to cling to him even when he was hurting me only to come back to him in the end and destroy myself for him.
When we started dating and moved in together he still saw his ex and there were rumors of him cheating but I still could not let go of him. 
I get irrationally angry when ever he goes out with people other than me or has a life outside of me and know I shouldn’t be angry at him simply hanging out with friends but it was still there and I’d still act irrationally. 
The other day, in a fit of rage at work and over text, I told him I was packing up my stuff and leaving knowing I was only doing it to see his reaction. To see if he would accept it or let me go even though I know that leaving is what’s best for me and I’ve been wanting to put myself in a better situation. When the time comes to actually leave I never do it. 
My emotions are so up and down and all over the place all the time causing a lot of conflict between us because I will get irrationally angry at random things and have a lot of trouble letting go. 
He got a DUI this year after I continuously told him his behavior would lead to that and that his drinking made me very uncomfortable. Now he’s struggling to come to terms with the restrictions of that and what it means for his life but there’s only so much I can support and put up with. 
I am finally moving back home to help myself out financially and emotionally but I don’t know how to let go of him and to leave him. I feel like he won’t stay loyal when I’m gone, and he has trouble controlling his emotions and acting impulsively. 
He lacks maturity, is unable to ever admit when he’s in the wrong or straight up apologize and he will yell at me, blame me when I’m trying to bring up an issue with him, and curse me out. 
But I still have that gut wrenching feeling when I try to leave him that it isn’t right that I need him and he needs me and I’d rather go down with the ship than do better for myself. Even talking about everything he’s done to me and every rude daily daily behavior I would still do anything for him and in the moment I’m in a rage but after I’m still upset but that attachment to him is stronger. 
How do I let go? How do I do better for myself when I have no desire to feel any better.

"""Traumatized"" by my worst BPD spiral and breakdown",1716286724.0,"First of all, I want to say I know the word trauma is thrown around a lot and here I'm not using it to make a claim I fit the diagnostic criteria for it, just using it in lack of a better descriptor so please don't come for me about that - I'm aware it's likely not the correct usage, just can't think of a better one currently and I think it gets the point across.

  
This fall and winter I had the worst spiral and breakdown of my entire life, related to a toxic relationship with a FP that also has their share of mental health issues and addictions.

I ended up breaking it off and I moved to another country afterward, which was planned anyway before.

The relationship was ended but we still had contact and it was of course all ups and downs, BUT. My current issue seems to be more with what has already happened rather than what it is now.

I get what I can call ""flashbacks"" of what happened between us, how I felt, how my mind interpreted it at the time, and it just sets me back for the moment, feeling empty and terrifried and in so much pain, again. When I can center myself in the present moment I'm very much aware of the progress I've made, of how this person really doesn't have a place in the life I'm trying to maintain and while my thoughts and feelings aren't ""good"" or even close to normal, they're not unmanageable or terryfing. 

When I get a ""flashback"", it feels like I fall into the abyss again and it hurts so bad it makes me bend over at moments. If I didn't know I had BPD, I'd think I was having a heart attack. All the feelings are back and I can't stop my mind from very rapidly producing the ""BPD thoughts"" that devalue myself and life itself to absurdity even though an hour ago I would be more or less stable and thinking in a more balanced way.

  
I'm supposed to move back to the city where I lived, where it all happened, and it would be a very good choice for me in all aspects of life, however - I'm terryfied of it. I panic when I think about having to go back. Because I know I'll have to pass the places related to all these events during my episode and it makes me feel like it's gonna be twisting the metaphorical knife in my chest that I can't seem to pull out.

  
What seems to be my problem is not suffering for this person in particular, I feel like what hurts me now is this whole series of events that had me breaking down and having the strongest psychiatric intervention of my life. This period of my life that lasted a few months feels like hell, like I've been sucked into another dimension where out of everything in my life ever, it's only the pain and fear that exists.

  
I don't even know what would be the right term for what I'm experiencing and have no clue what kind of help to seek for it.

"My sister has BPD and is making my life miserable. I love her, please tell me how to handle situations?",1716276375.0,"
*CONTEXT:*
I (17f) have two elder sisters who are twins (20f). We are going to call them sister A and sister B. They always hated me because they always thought that our mom always spoiled me, even though this was never the case. Hence, they always resented me. And I actually quite adored them, I wanted to be like them, always respected them as my two lovely big sisters. Other than this, we were quite the happy family, our parents always showered us with love equally. 

Now, fast forward to when sister A was 15. She met a girl in high school. And all of a sudden, sister A started to resent all of us. And started sh. My mom never understood that, because she and our father did their darn best to give us the universe. Here’s the thing: the sh never came from her having life contemplations, but her “friend” encouraged her to do it, and when she’d show it to her, her “friend” would say: “ just 5? Should’ve gone for 10.” This is something my sister A has actively told. 
Now that the readers have an idea about how it all started, my sister still does sh. She also has been going to professional therapy since she was 16. Hence, she was diagnosed with bpd. 

Now, her behaviour never really affected me other than my parents just ignoring me to give her the attention , to the point that I haven’t had a heart-to-heart with either of my parents in 4 years, since, I was 13. And of course I am crazy jealous, but my love for my sister still remains. The thing is, my sisters, as twins, always operated as a team hence, they always had each other and still do things together (excluding me). And hence, I only ever had my mom to talk my feelings with, which I haven’t been able to do since, I was 13. And even if I have, she has told about it to my sisters who come confront me and start a whole other argument. And that has taken a toll on me and I have been failing my classes. I went from a straight A+ student and now, recently I got a 19/100 in maths. Hence, I have been quite bitter to my family. And obv I also had my own petty arguments with my parents. TLDR: I also have my own teenage issues that have formed due to the lack of communication with my parents.

Now, here comes in my sister. Whenever, I have any disagreement with my parents, big or small, in the middle of my argument, even if my voice isn’t raised, my sister would jump in and SCREAM on the top of her lungs and say that I should lower my voice. And there have been instances that she would even shout slurs at me in front our mother and she wouldn’t even bat an eye. And in all of this, my problem would  still be unresolved. This example comes from my following problem: I had private classes, but I had an extra-curricular event going on in my school. So, I was trying to convince my mom to let me skip private classes. 

Now, there was another instance where my mom was condemning me from using my phone cause of my grades, and again; my sister started to not shout but, scream at me to lower my voice. And started crying, telling our parents that they don’t deserve a child like me. And at the end of the night, my mom was cuddling her.  

These type of things happen quite frequently now, even this morning. As much as I love my sister, I really do. But I am growing frustrated of this. I don’t wish any harm on my sister but I do wish my sister never met that “friend”. 

I do not need any sympathy or hateful comments, I just want constructive criticism. How shall I handle such situations? 

Point to note: I might be an ah, because when I get frustrated of her antics, I do snap back at her. And my mom does tell me to quite down.

Am I just being paranoid?,1716250063.0,"I haven’t ever posted, because it brings me a lot of anxiety to post anything online. Will probably delete. 

I started seeing a guy again that I’ve been off and on throughout the past year with for brief times. He’s a bit emotionally distant, because emotions seem to make him uncomfortable. I have actively tried not to say every time I want to be reassured, because it’s stressful for him. I haven’t had the greatest trust with him and I’m not always so paranoid when I’ve dated other people. My family has met him and doesn’t trust him, which furthers my paranoia. I just want to feel safe, secure and healthy minded. Am I just saying all the wrong things? He doesn’t text much, because he is very busy and I only see him once every one, or two weeks. He has come into my life for the third time wanting to date, but the other times he has ran out saying he wasn’t ready for a relationship. In the past I have thought he just wants sex and not a relationship with me. I hope I’m not his back burner, or it’s because I’m his only option…

Sorry my messages are so sporadic. It’s probably due to my bad ADHD. Also, when I asked why he always says my my name when he’s stressed explaining things I hope it didn’t sound angry, because I was just trying to communicate and understand what he was feeling.

I don't know whether I should continue living with my gf or move out,1716242937.0,"I really need some advice about this because idk what the hell to do. I've been dating and living with my girlfriend for the last 2.5 years, and it was great for awhile. But something changed last Sept when my gf started working. She had a huge personality shift and went from a fun, caring, amazing gf to someone I avoid as much as possible. She's always in a bad mood, goes to bed at like 5pm (so we don't spend any time together), and she just isn't nice to me anymore. She's not abusive or anything, but she just lectures me and gets upset at me about the stupidest things and she dosent make me feel good about myself the way she used to. The breakdown of our relationship has destroyed my mental health to the point where I cry every day and have started SHing again. We stopped having sex and being physically affectionate last October and I've spent most of the time since then sleeping on the couch. We're essentially roommates at this point, but I don't know if I should try to fix things or give up on our relationship.

For the first 2 years we were together she was literally my ideal partner, and I saw myself being with her for the rest of my life (and not in a BPD favorite person way, we just had an amazing relationship). Part of me thinks that her personality shift might be because she's struggling with her mental health, so I've been trying to be understanding, but things have only gotten worse since last fall. But, I'm terrified to move out on my own. I can't drive, so I don't have a way to go anywhere without her. And I have hella mental health issues (including agoraphobia) and rly high support needs atm so the idea of living alone scares me a lot. I also don't have many friends so I'd be committing to a life of solitude.

TDLR: Here are my options:
1) Continue living with my gf. I wouldn't be alone, but if we don't fix our relationship I'll be absolutely miserable for another year
2) Move out and dump her. I'd probably have a complete mental breakdown, but I could be a lot happier in the long run
3) Move out and try to stay together. It could be good for our relationship, but it could also just be delaying the inevitable. There'd also be a lot of messiness because she uses my car to go to work and if we don't live together my parents said she has to stop using it.

Do you regret cutting someone off? Are you able to tell the person actually did care after some time?,1716242697.0,"I have quiet BPD. I latch unto people to a very unhealthy degree. It doesn't matter how badly they treat me I will not get rid of them; however, I may go quiet on them.

I know we're all different but I'd like to understand an untreated BPD friend who abruptly cut me off better. I guess I'm trying to make sense of what happened. I understand no one here can tell me what they were thinking. I'd just like discussion/thoughts.

To keep the post short - this friend did something that caused me immense anxiety. They apologized profusely, and later came back upset that I had anxiety over their actions. While listening to them, they were also angry with me about situations that never happened (so they made up scenarios and said, ""I bet you would act this way"" which furthered their anger towards me. I was watching this person build more resentment towards me for things I hadn't done).

This friend knew I had terrible abandonment issues, and they also knew I went through something traumatic earlier in the day. By the time I was done apologizing (I know I should'nt have but I didn't want them to leave me), they blocked me on all platforms - and it's been weeks.

Burning bridges just seems extremely foreign to me because I'm thinking about the other person's feelings. I did consider it here, which was rare, but backed away immediately from the idea because I knew this person was hurting.

What triggers your BPD symptoms?,1716218621.0,"I want to put together some sort of informational book / guide for people who have a relationship (family, friends, or romantic) with someone who has BPD from the BPD perspective.

Online I feel like you generally get this generic response that may help but doesn’t quite tap into the full reasoning or understanding of BPD. I myself have a hard time putting everything into words and I want to have input from all perspective so that it isn’t fully focused on my experience but many experiences from people with BPD.

Please note: this will be a much more effective impact if there are not only examples of triggers and how to avoid them, but real life situations you may have had where someone did something or said something that triggered your BPD, **and what would have de-escalated or prevented this by an alternative reality that could have better suited your needs**.

>Examples:

>1)I had a fight with someone I was romantically interested in which started over me not being able to find my wallet. I was frustrated and having anxiety and ultimately started to panic. He told me “you need to calm down and stop getting so worked up over minor inconveniences”. 

>This made me feel invalidated and after the fact I remember calling my best friend saying “I wish he would have simply acknowledged my feelings and offered to help, or even just said nothing at all.”

>2) My mom and I were having a discussion that escalated because it felt like she wasn’t acknowledging how I felt, but more so how she felt. She started to overwhelm me and I tried to separate myself from the situation because I knew if I didn’t I would have said or done something I would regret later. She told me to stop and engage in this conversation so that we can resolve the issue and I explained I needed a second before we continued. I was grabbing the keys to my car to go on a drive because it is something that helps me reflect and compose myself, as well as prepare for what I will say to fully explain my perspective and needs n a calmer manner. As I was doing this she told me “if you leave angry you cannot come back.” In my mind at that moment this I felt invalidated, and what she said came across as *she doesn’t care about me or why I’m angry, and doesn’t understand or care about my coping mechanisms, and is going to abandon me because of them*.

>What I needed was her to acknowledge that I was angry, and understand that I needed to calm down before continuing the conversation. Throwing out a threat of not allowing me back made me feel unwanted and unloved. If she had let me go and said nothing, or said “okay let’s pick this up later when you’re ready”, it would have started my de-escalation and shown me that she cares about what I’m feeling, and understand that I needed to approach this when I was ready so that I didn’t feel as though it was an attack.

>3) My mom also has this bad habit of when I feel overwhelmed about something unrelated to her, she tries to help by offering multiple solutions and affirmations. This can make me feel as though I’m incapable of solving my own problems and that she feels obligated to solve them for me. When she is offering multiple affirmations at the same time, it can come across as she’s lying to me rather than she’s trying to express her love or admiration. When this happens, I usually tell her I need space which makes her upset.

>For me, compliments and encouragement all in one go or on many occasions can feel fake. In these situations I’d rather come to her if I need the help than have it shoved in my face. If she were to give me a minute, and say “do you need some help / advice”, it would make me feel more in control of the situation at hand and show that she cares and her help is offered when I need it.

Friendship advice,1716215732.0,"Hi, I learned a good friend has a BPD diagnosis and ignoring labels, it did help me get clarity on a lot of behaviour that is different compared to my more stable friendships. (She didn’t tell me the diagnosis, she posted it online; we have not discussed and I will not raise it.)

I am struggling with the strong emotions, mood changes, putting me down in front of shared friends, negativity and picking fights.

I am not a psych or expert so there are probably issues unrelated to BPD such as I feel she doesn’t celebrate my successes in life and is insensitive to some losses I’ve had, and I could really use some positivity right now. 

I need to focus on my on wellbeing at the moment as I’m in a rough patch and I don’t have the emotional capacity to meet her high expectations for a close friend. I also have some boundaries about how I’ve been treated recently - namely, it’s not ok and I have feelings too. 

Any tips for gentle or kind wording to express that I want to continue to be friends but I need to take a step back for now. I understand this could be a triggering conversation and I am unsure how to approach it in the most fair but firm way.

Need advice with a BPD friend,1716190230.0,"My friend is diagnosed with BPD.

She has seeked emotional comfort in me (if we can call it that). I don't blame her for that, but... let's say that she was way more emotional than I could've ever hoped to handle. It was just too much for me. I told her I need a break so for 3 months we went no contact. That's was a year ago.

We are still friends, but when I ask her how she's doing, she responds with two words, sometimes with three. I think, that in her mind, she has reached the conclusion that if she ever were extremely emotional again, I would abandon her for good. A year ago she told me that she sometimes spends the entire night crying. Nowadays all she says is ""I'm fine"".

She is very affectionate and always listens to what I have to say. It is very one-sided. I want her to open up a bit. I would never ever abandon her but sometimes it's just too overwhelming, I have a life and can't be her parent. Finding a balance is very difficult.

He's just a friend. We met online when I was 17 and he was 16 and we were just friends for the next four years but then all of a sudden last year I got a crush on him out of nowhere and it just progressed into this Thing, this devotion. I used to care a normal amount and we would have meaningful conversations and it just worked. And then when he became my favorite person, it turned into torture. When he talked to me it was euphoria, but when he didn't respond I would sob and cut myself. He's the only thing I think about, every day I have conversations with him in my head just to feel comforted. He's a good friend and he has said he cares about me in the past but I feel him gradually getting farther and farther away because his band is taking off and he's getting more friends and confidence and awareness and wisdom and I'm not growing at all. I can't. He sees that. He's repulsed by my depression, even though when I met him he was severely depressed,  and he seems to dislike me and the worst part is that I told him I liked him last summer and he asked me to send him pictures of myself naked. And I did it and I felt so happy and I kept doing it over and over again whenever he asked, even though I knew he didn't care about me. He even said so. I asked how he felt about me liking him and he said he didn't feel anything at all and he didn't care either way. And then last month, we hooked up, and I was so nervous and excited, I felt like I was on coke, and it was good and I felt happy. But he has other options and opportunities, and things that make him happy, and my main thing is him. I need to pull myself out of the mud and let him go, because he's onto better things. And I need to fill my life with projects and things that I'm passionate about, and I know that, but all I want is him.  It stings that he has so many friends, because I get jealous of people that have friends. I used to have a whole network of friends that I loved very very much, and then I went through psychosis and became the crazy girl and everyone disowned me. And I noticed that some of his new friends are in the same group as the people who disowned me. All I can think about is him befriending them and leaving me behind. The ones who think I'm a total freak loser. And the thing is those people label themselves as freaks, they're alt and different and outcasts and I don't even fit in with them, I'm stiff and depressed and awkward now and nothing like how I was and I don't know if I can ever be that person again. I feel like a total loser, I feel like I'm totally broken and I don't have a chance of ever talking to him again. And I know he's said he gets worried about me, which might mean he cares, he said that right before we hooked up last month, but it just seems like he's on his way out and I have to be strong and say goodbye and all I want to do is text him but I don't know what I would say or if it would bother him, and I'm trying to figure out with online tarot cards how he sees me and they all show me images of people that look repulsive. And I don't know if it's all in my head or if I'm picking up on something real, I feel a burning sensation every time I see his success because that means that he'll just see me as more and more lame and worthless. And I don't even know if he's the type of person that thinks of people that way, but I'm afraid he is. It''s likely he is.  I long to talk to him and I don't even know why him exactly, it's just this feeling and it's all consuming, it feels so empty thinking about not talking to him and I think it will feel better once I just rip the bandaid off and start doing things for myself but I don't know if I'm strong enough. I will keep telling myself that I am strong. But so many times I said I'm done with him and I'm focusing on my self worth, and then it's like a total riptide back to him. I'm so sad and I wish i could cry more about it but I just feel a burning sensation in my solar plexus like always now. I think that's where I store my sadness, but I don't know. What do I do when I don't even know reality, I don't even know what he thinks of me, or if he's done with me, or if he doesn't even have an opinion of me that much. It seems like it would be so easy for him to lose contact with me and not care, he has so many opportunities and options, he's like a kid in a candy shop and I'm like a kid who's starving and just found a lollipop. I'm gonna cling onto that lollipop for as long as possible and I'm not gonna let it go, and I'm trying to eat the stick to get the same feeling I got when I first started it. The world feels empty without him, and he doesn't feel the same way. It's like a dagger in my gut. I don't know what reality is, I don't know if we're fine or if he's put off by me, and I only get to surface from this dark pond once in a while and see that it doesn't matter, before I get pulled back in. 



 TL;DR What do I do so I don't go crazy being inexplicably tethered to someone who I think feels nothing for me if not repulsion? Should I just text him, because nothing concrete has happened at all between us, other than him leaving me on read a couple times? How do you guys deal with saying goodbye to your FP and what do you do to cope with it? I'm going back and forth between he's fine with me and he's repulsed by me, do you have any coping skills for this? Or coping skills for anything else I mentioned?

Do any of y'all have advice regarding this realization?,1716170616.0,"I'm posting this to a few bpd communities to try to reach more people with different perspectives. If you're active in other communities and have seen this post recently I apologize!

I'm a good person. I know that. I love people with my whole heart. But my behaviors (or at least motivation behind behaviors) have not always shown that, even if they were disguised as ""good"". Something that has helped me A LOT lately is thinking ""am I doing this act to help someone, or to make myself look good."" The statement varies slightly according to the situation of course, but honestly it has helped stop many attention seeking behaviors. This has helped me modify and adjust how I react to situations. 

For example, I daydream every night before bed about me or characters from a show being either a victim or a hero. One or the other (thanks black and white thinking). Basically I write fanfiction in my head. It usually contains dark subjects like SA, abuse, death, etc. When I first started giving myself time to daydream before bed I noticed a decrease in attention seeking behaviors in real life, however as the years went on I started to convince myself that those things I was purposely dreaming of were ok to do irl if given the possibility. Anyway what caused this revelation is that my favorite resident at a SNF I work for is in the hospital with an unclear fate. In my daydream time about a week ago I imagined different scenarios and played through them. Doing this led to me really thinking about why I do things. One of the scenarios I had to run through of course was ""what happens if the resident passes."" So I imagined myself at her funeral and her family member asked if anyone else wanted to speak. So I did. But as I was dreaming about what I would say ""...when you see someone everyday for two and a half years you get to love them. She watched me grow up and gave me some of the best advice one could ask for..."" I realized I was thinking about the family feeling sorry for me. I saw her daughter looking at me thinking ""oh that poor person loved my mom so much, they must be hurting a lot."" This made me snap open my eyes and look at the ceiling. I realized i was imagining my favorite resident's funeral (i usually try to picture future scenarios in my daydreaming time to prepare because it soothes anxiety, i don't plan to stop fully but at least be more conscious of my actions to those scenarios in my dreams) and picturing her FAMILY, feeling sorry for ME. 

Ever since I had that dream about a week ago it has completely changed my perspective of how I go about things and I hope I keep this in mind. Humans are inherently selfish. Every action we do have some form of self satisfaction to it. Even something as simple as tying your shoe laces so you don’t fall, is motivated by a level of selfishness. That is normal. However, I want to make sure I do things for the right reasons even if the outcome of the deed wouldn't change. If I volunteer l to help someone with a task is it because there are other people in the room watching me and I want to look good? Is it because I want this person to like me and think I'm a good person? Or, is it because humans deserve help and kindness and if I have the (mental, physical, financial) capacity to do so I WANT to help someone just to make their lives easier. 

Like I stated earlier, it is very human to have to think of yourself in others shoes to be empathetic in most situations, I mean that's what the golden rule is (for example, I don't want to see people in pain because I know what pain feels like, therefore I do my best to prevent and reduce pain in others)! But in my experience people with bpd tend to have a little extra motivation: how we are perceived to others as ""good"" to prevent abandonment, or for validation/attention seeking that we feel we deserve and honestly sometimes NEED. As basic as it sounds I'm trying to be more aware of my motivation behind my actions. Who new it would take 7 years of CBT and 1 year of DBT to get to this point. I feel kind of silly honestly.

 I am a self aware person, however that often made my attention seeking behaviors worse. This made my behaviors worse because I would rationalize them as ""well I'm communicating to people what my needs are, therefore if they don't react appropriately they are at fault. If I'm genuinely suicidal and I let my friends know then they should shower me with love and concern. Even if I've been genuinely suicidal over many 'little' things that they now think it's a boy who cried wolf situation. I've identified my feelings (which really are real, just because they seem dramatic doesn't mean im not feeling them, so me it's so intense and real, to them it's purely for attention) and communicated so I must be doing things right."" Now I realize that crying to my coworkers while they are trying to work is not acceptable because they are acquaintances and we are at work. Another thing that has caused me to have trouble identifying what is or isn't okay is understanding that just because I would drop everything to comfort a random coworker/acquaintance at work does not mean everyone else is comfortable, has the emotional capacity, feels safe, or feels motivated, to do the same. In my mind everyone takes the golden rule (treat others the way you want to be treated) so literally. It's why I'm seen as clingy and can't often tell the difference between romantic, platonic, acquaintance relationships. Because I dont care if we met a week ago if I like you and you seem to like my you're my friend in my mind and I got your back. 

So yeah I just wanted to share/rant lol. Do you guys, gals, and nonbinary pals have any recommendations for how to deal with needing to be listened to or almost ""coddled"" sometimes? For me it was the daydreaming that I use for my anxiety but I'm not sure if that's the healthiest for me anymore. It definitely helped for a long time, but I think some change would do me some good.

Bpd and break ups,1716168711.0,"I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder/ dysthymia (i went to  a few different psychiatrists) and have been on ssri for over 2 yrs. I have been suspecting that I have had BPD for yrs but I've never truly been honest with my psychiatrists and there are lots of thing that I didn't tell them, just because I don't trust them or it's too embarrassing to bring up some of the stuffs I've done in the past.

I recently broke up with my ex of 2 yrs. Although I am the one who initiated the break up, deep down I wanted him to stop me. 
So, I lost my shit when he refused to get back together. I felt like I was abandoned, unloved and wanted to kill myself. I haven't cut myself in the last two yrs i've been with him, but when he rejected me over the phone, i cut myself again and told him about it. 

 Now I am feeling extremely guilty that I threatened him like that, especially because I've made the same mistake in the past with my other exes and I promised to myself that I'll never do that again. 

I honestly thought I improved a lot in this relationship, but my ex left me for the same reason as all of my past relationships. Apparently, I am too much, and he doesn't think he can't do more to make me happy.

I need help getting across to my mom.,1716163631.0,"I’ve tried so hard to explain that the way she acts or talks to me is what triggers my outbursts.

All the articles I’ve found express that people with BPD are hard to maintain a relationship with and that they are manipulative. That or something along those lines. 

I feel like she doesn’t listen to me because in her mind I’m overreacting, but I know that if she reads an article or a book that explains I need validation and to feel heard along with changing the way she approaches issues with me could really help.

What’s sad is I don’t usually have as many issues with BPD until I’m around her, and I’ve told her this in the best way possible by explaining that it’s not necessarily who she is or that I hate her but the way she can make me feel invalidated and unloved.

Can someone help me with finding an article or book to best express this to her?

EDIT: 
Especially in situations where she will throw out threats for the way I’m feeling. 

Example:
Last week she was talking to me and wasn’t listening to what I was saying of how she made me feel, but rather just coming back with I’m disrespectful and selfish and need to get my anger under control. 

I was feeling so overwhelmed and upset that I decided I needed to leave or I was going to do or say something irrational and she told me that if I left angry I won’t have a home to come back to.

I just can't go on anymore ,1716162936.0,"Like the title says. Throwaway, because of topic. 

I don't have BPD, but the woman I love does. We've been involved for over 6 months, but she refuses to agree to a relationship, even though we do all the things people in a relationship do. 

When things are good, they're great. I love her with my whole heart, and I know that she loves me just as fiercely. 

But when she's on a down-swing, I take it really hard (her depression triggers isolationism). I have an anxious attachment style, and even though I'm really working hard to be more secure, it really hits hard when she keeps me at a distance. 

There have been events recently that were severe enough to drive me to want The Long Nap. We worked through them, and for a while things were good again. 

She ended up on a distancing streak again this week. I've been trying to manage it as best I can. But today I woke up, and my anxiety was just getting the best of me. I reached out to her, asking for validation of her affection for me. 

Needless to say, I didn't get it. And as I began calling out the insecurity it made me feel, I was met with dismissiveness and ignoring. By lunch I was in full spiral and stuck dealing with it on my own.

So... I've got a diagnosis... And now I feel even more confused,1716159197.0,"So I asked my psychiatrist if I had BPD.  
  
I had been looking for a diagnosis for so long because I didn't understand why I couldn't control my emotions and why I'd have reckless behaviour.  
  
I've been asking for so many answers, read scientific literature about BPD, bipolar disorders, cyclothymia and stuff because I thought "" something"" was running in the family (my mum is under bipolar meds, she's better now but I kinda feel sad for her now because she's so quiet).  
  
So I asked my psychiatrist if he could diagnose me and he casually said ' yeah, I'd say you're 80% borderline and 20% mood swings"".  
  
I know it's not a written on paper official diagnosis and he did say that this diagnosis would get more accurate the more we see each other (I've been seeing him since February).  
  
I'm currently on quetapine, gained weight but my mood swings have stabilized (except when I keep losing games and I keep remembering about my painful past...).  
  
So yeah hearing about this diagnosis... Made me feel uneasy.  
  
I've been asking for a diagnosis so many times, hoping to find some answers. Went through suicide attempt and a car accident while I was drunk and on meds.  And now I've got that diagnosis... I feel ashamed.

So I get rightfully so pissed off, I ignore her for a bit while she begs me to listen to her apology. She asked if we were done, I said I’m not sure, I’m not going to make a decision out of anger.  Then she breaks up w me because she says she can’t keep doing this fighting or whatever.  Says she unhappy , that she needs to work on her trauma, she can’t be in a relationship because she doesn’t love herself, she’s afraid that she’ll become obsessed w me and when I leave her she’ll be in a hole again and just in general that she needs to work on her mental health and can’t be in a relationship.  I think it’s bs and she just doesn’t like me anymore so I try getting her to just admit that but she won’t, she won’t say she doesn’t love me either.  A day later she says yes we weren’t a match.  Just hard to believe because literally a week before she was telling me how she’s not marrying anyone if it’s not me, told me how I changed the way she views love, all the sweetest things someone could say to someone.  I was gone for a month for smth related to the army where I did not have my phone.  In that meantime she bought a necklace w my name on it to keep guys away she said.  She texted me every single day even though I couldn’t read those texts. She got legally separated from her husband for me. Basically as you can see, it doesn’t make much sense to me.  She has openly stated before she has BPD, she has all the symptoms and tendencies that go along w it after I did some research I saw.  Like trying to commit suicide when her ex husband broke up w her, threatening him w cutting herself, shopping addiction, going thru my phone, telling me she was afraid I had bad intentions.  What do you all think?  I was really mad at first but since researching BPD a little I see she can’t completely help herself no matter what and in some way is telling the truth.  I’m just wondering if her suddenly saying, we’re not a match after saying we get along better than anyone she’s ever been with is the truth.

After she left i went to the bathroom and start crying and was depressed all day yestarday and today to. She continue talking to me tho, like nothing happened. But you girls may confirm that talking to a guy everyday may mean nothing. So should i just quit talking? She is the only person i talk with, i dont really have any best friend to talk every day or to tell my problems.

Hello!,1716127774.0,"Hello! Lately I've been struggling more than usually and decided to look for some sort of group where I can be understood or look for advice. But I wonder if my presence here is actually okay after reading the rules?

To start, I'm 17 and diagnosed with unspecified personality disorder because of complexity of my case: I'm auDHD and have CPTSD + my new psychiatrist doesn't really diagnose her patients, they just prescribed medication for symptoms. My symptoms though are very heavily leaning towards BPD since a long time already. I've been in therapy for years and only now was managed to find the one that is actually helping me the way I need it (don't get me wrong, the one before did help: because of it I managed to work on my very bad possessiveness and jealousy, and in general behaviours that were harmful towards other people, leaving me with ones that harm ONLY me 99% of the time). 

But despite slowly being able to discover who I am, finding my identity a little by little (I can answer questions like what is my favourite colour, food, flower, season, etc. and I'm incredibly happy about it!) I'm still massively struggling. My mood swings, abandonment issues, anger outbursts, extreme attachment to people, etc. are making it hard and sometimes I really need to talk to someone who would understand. 

That's why I thought about joining this channel! But when I read the rules, the one about diagnosis to be exact, I wonder if its okay? I really don't want to intrude on someone's safe space. ",finnleyyyyy,,False,1cvp4th,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cvp4th/hello/
I need help,1716126318.0,"I (34m) am in a relationship with my gf (34f) for 9 months now. I’m well educated, very successful, come from a good family, but was in a split home with extreme and traumatic childhood. My gf was raised by a drug addict mother and doesn’t know her father. Went from foster home to foster home. Never had stability in her life, only had drug addict boyfriend that mistreated her. She also was very promiscuous and had multiple relationships at the same time. 

Since we started dating I revolved my entire life around her being there 24/7, providing for her financially, taking care of her kids, even helping clean the house while she sat at home and struggled to do much due to her mental health (borderline personality disorder). Things were good she gave me bursts of love and attention and when they were good they were great. As soon as we had a fight though she’d flip my whole life upside down. Call me names, put me down, attack my character, tell me shes only with me for the money and the sex. She’s very negative and extremely judgmental and usually misjudges all scenarios around her. Her mood is up and down constantly and she always wants to leave me as soon as we fight only to ask me to come back shortly after. She forgets all the good times right away and exaggerates everything negatively. Goes from loving me saying that we are not compatible and that she doesn’t like my personality. Lately she’s been jumping to text other guys right after a fight/break up. She’s also been saying that she wants to go back to having 7 boyfriends. I wasnt innocent in all this. I also retaliated verbally and was very hurtful at times. it was all in the heat of the moment and to defend myself more so than attack her. 

Why do I stay? Because I love her and want to give her and her kids a better life. Because I see her struggling with these problems with all her friendships including her mother. Because I’ve invested time and money and planned a future with her. Because i don’t take offence to her insults when she’s angry because no one in their right mind would act like that. I feel stuck and don’t know what to do. Do i stay and try to make it work, or do I give up on her and move on? We had amazing periods where we were in so much love together. I don’t want to give up on that and let her ruin her life. I feel like leaving her is equivalent to me letting a drink drive. I don’t know what to do.

"FP reached out, how now to spiral? 🥲",1716034228.0,"
TLDR; I’m still “in love” with my FP. He reached out and i’m teetering the edge of spiraling. Help 🙃


I met and dated someone who quickly became  my FP last year, and it was an absolute shitshow. The most beautiful love i’ve ever felt until it was me feeling like a full-blown “psycho”, begging him not to leave me while doing everything in my power to push him away, soul crushing devotion, all the usual things over the course of 6 months. I could yap about all the emotions and pain but if you’ve ever dated an FP and it didn’t work out, you probably get it. 

I was undiagnosed and unmanaged at the time, and while I know he loved me too, a lot of my behaviors were probably scary and intimidating. They were definitely frustrating and difficult to deal with. He kept coming back every time he said we wouldn’t which somehow furthered the attachment. Id all but convinced myself it was this great love story where we just can’t leave eachother alone, we’re gonna make it through this and be that couple that grew & overcame together, etc. In reality he was probably just addicted to the thrill of being with someone who’s unstable until he realized we were unhealthy for eachother. He possessed the skills to walk away. I, clearly, do not. 

I am in one of the worst places I’ve ever been as far as emptiness and SI. A few weeks ago, mid-episode, i asked him if he thought we could ever be friends and he told me he’s dating someone. This, obviously, triggered me deeply. I’ve barely been able to avoid falling back into the dependency behaviors I’ve acted on in the past (blowing up his phone, begging him to hang out with me, losing my mind when he doesn’t want me), but even 7 months after breaking up I think about him and miss him every. single. day. 

ANYWAYS, I woke up to a text from him this morning. Some stupid meme that we would have laughed at together in the past. It took me an hour and a half of typing and re-typing my response to reply to him. Since, I’ve been checking my phone nonstop, feeling rejected and disgusted with myself while also wanting to physically be next to him more than anything.

Any advice to try and stop the inevitable spiral and embarrassing (hating) myself yet again? Tell me i’m being an idiot maybe? I don’t want to do this but I know myself and it just gets worse from here. I just started DBT and have only made it through the intro so i don’t actually possess very many skills…at all.

she told me she attempted suicide by overdose and spent five days in the hospital. she was scared to tell me but my brother said she should.

instead of coming to see me for mother's day she tried to commit suicide. she was going to leave me here without saying anything.

me and my mom both probably have BPD. i've been diagnosed (twice) and for her the lack of emotional regulation, extreme fear of abandonment, suicidality, etc... are all there. i have beef with the diagnostic framework for mental illness in general, but if if looks like a duck, quacks like a duck... yeah, we're basically both really fucked up from trauma. she's just the one who caused most of my trauma. but holy shit i never ever wanted her to kill herself!!!! ahhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",pastelxbones,,False,1cuuu99,8,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cuuu99/my_mom_attempted_suicide/
Alcohol,1716030013.0,"I have an alcohol addiction bc it’s really the only thing that makes me feel normal. When I go sober yea I feel great for a while I feel like I have more energy and more control over my emotions and no depression

 but after a while it starts to hit me how different I am from everyone else and how much trauma I’ve been through compared to most ppl and then the depression comes back and I feel the need to drink again bc drinking makes me feel more normal and less self aware.

 Either way I feel depression so I don’t quite see the point in staying sober. I want to not exist either way but at least alcohol makes life more fun even if I am slowly killing myself. But idc that I’m killing myself bc I’m not really missing out on anything in this life being who I am.

Hypnagogic Phenomena,1716029980.0,"I am reading the diagnostic criteria for BPD in the DSM-5 for my university course. Whilst reading, I noticed that a symptom can be “hypnagogic phenomena”.

I researched into this and was SHOCKED. It is essentially like sleep paralysis, below is a definition:

*“Hypnagogic hallucinations are vivid visual, auditory, tactile, or even kinetic perceptions that, like sleep paralysis, occur during the transitions between wakefulness and REM sleep. Examples include a sensation of impending threat, feelings of suffocation, and sensations of floating, spinning, or falling.”*

I have always had sleep paralysis and have thought it’s been associated with my BPD but knowing that it is now a psychotic symptom of BPD has honestly made me feel so weird. I’m sick of my BPD being associated with everything and being the cause for all my negative experiences :(

Does anyone else experience these hypnagogic hallucinations?

please help:(,1715997140.0,"so my(28f) (now ex) boyfriend (33m) and i have been together for a little over two years. i have bpd. he always accepted it before and i don’t think he could handle it anymore. the last 4 months have been pretty toxic. just fighting a lot. i like to talk about my feelings a lot and he doesn’t like when i do that anymore. he said i always found something wrong with what he was doing. all he did was work (from home) and play video games and hangout with me. however i always missed the honeymoon stage so i would bring up how he wasn’t as lovey with me as he used to be, not really romantic anymore, never wanted to have deep talks. and my biggest need is emotional intimacy. his is peace. all he ever wanted from me was peace. he thinks i criticized him for everything but i was never trying to put him down, just talk about my needs and he said nothing he ever did was good enough. i just wanted to be shown all the time how in love with me he was. he has an avoidant attachment style and gets dismissive and shuts down. i have done soo much work on my bpd.  but my abandonment wound gets very triggered. especially bc he’s threatened abandonment a lot but never actually left me. he has a lot of narcissistic tendencies and traits and ended up using my BPD against me a lot. he started seeing my counselor with me. she told us not to talk about any feelings basically for a month and just keep things light so i gave him peace for a whole month. i held in all my emotions that whole time and i ended up telling him what was wrong and sent him a long paragraph of how was feeling. we were supposed to talk about it in person two days later. two mins before i left my house
to come over he texts me and says he doesn’t want me to come over bc he’s mad at me for blocking him on insta and life360 when i was pissed a few nights ago from a fight and told him i was blocking him on everything for both our sanities. however he didn’t see i did that until right before i came over. i apologized and said ill re-add him and that i told him i was doing that when i was mad. he didn’t care and didnt wanna talk. i felt abandoned and ended up showing up to his house anyways. things turned really ugly bc he didnt want me there and didnt wanna talk. i guess i “cornered him in his own house” and he got really really mean. i wont go too much into detail but i tried hurting myself bc he broke up with me and was making me feel horrible about myself.. a crisis team came and they made me go to a hospital. i’ll leave out the rest of the details but he ended up ending things with me bc things got so toxic and have been for a while. im sooo self aware and admit to any of my wrong-doings. he basically thinks everything is my fault and doesn’t take much accountability. 

he claims hes still in love with me and this is the hardest thing he’s ever had to do but he has to walk away from this relationship right now and that he just needs to be to be alone and have peace and recover from how bad things have gotten and he didn’t like who he turned into and lost himself in our relationship lately. he basically blames it all on me.

he said he would like to try again one day and there’s a hole in his heart where i was and he misses me terribly. i begged him to please not give up (i beg when im being abandoned, i know, pathetic) but he was my whole world.  he said he needs a couple months to himself and that he’s not gonna do anything or talk to anyone ( he hardly ever leaves the house, major home body) and said he will reach out when he’s ready and he promises. we shared locations again and he said i can reach out to him if i need to but not blow him up. im not gonna reach out to him and hopefully he will miss me. im willing to do anything it takes for it to work again. i hope he is too, when he’s ready. 

am i dumb for agreeing to this and waiting on him? im so in love with him and know i could never be with anyone else. he’s my FP. he was my bestfriend. he will always have my heart. we’ve had so many good times together and have always gotten through the bad times . i already miss him so much and i hate that we won’t be spending our summer together. but i have no choice. i can’t force anything anymore. my heart is so broken. i’m gonna take my time and grieve and work on my independence and stoicism and spoil my dog with love and continue going to the gym, journal, hangout with friends at some point when im ready. but i feel like im dying.  

please be nice,im fragile, but you can be blunt too. im so scared this might be bc of another girl but i think thats me overthinking. he swears its not and that hes gonna come back to me when hes ready. 

any advice on all this? am i being dumb? how to cope? how to not let months without him make me wanna die? how to not give up hope? or if i should give up on any hope at all? i feel so lost without him. i don’t ever want to be without him. my worst fear happened-he abandoned me. what if he doesn’t actually want me back in 2-3 months even though that’s what he’s saying?

I wanted to walk past the house for my sake, to avoid any future confrontation, I wanted to get it over with.

Turns out, he killed himself a couple of years back. The grieve I felt was so confusing. Can I be sad for someone who ruined a great part of my life, even if I forgave him?

BPD or Bipolar 1? ,1716001190.0,"hello! I’m a 26 (F) and today I went to my first appointment with a psychiatrist. They said they suspect I have Bipolar 1 and are planning to prescribe me medication (vraylar) during our next appointment. I’ve been worrying about it nonstop since then because I don’t want to begin a medication that maybe isn’t even what I need to be taking. The key difference I’ve noticed in symptoms is that my mood swings are entirely situation based and irregular. They’re also always consistent with the fear of being abandoned or perceived judgment. Someone can make a simple comment in passing and it’ll send me on an emotional spiral. Kind of like my psychiatrist saying she suspects Bipolar 1. I’ve read that it can go misdiagnosed and I’m wondering if that’s happened to anyone here? I want to make sure I know how to advocate for myself the best before going into my next appointment. 

I’ve been in therapy for 3 years and have found that DBT has reduced my symptoms and improved my emotional regulation the most.

looking for advice.,1716000703.0,"I've recently been diagnosed with BPD traits and throughout my life i've ended both friendly and romantic relationships quite abruptly. Usually, when a friendship is causing me too much worry or trouble, I decide to end things suddenly, usually by blocking my friends on social media and not speaking to them again. This has been going on for as long as I can remember.

I recently met a boy who broke my heart. He is a friend of a coworker of mine who became very close to me and who I came to consider my friend even outside of work.

However, this guy left me emotionally devastated and I never received much support from her. I felt a little alone and misunderstood, because she used to call herself my best friend and I used to reciprocate the feeling (although it never felt quite right).

This week I realized that I didn't want to be friends with her anymore, so I stopped talking to her for a couple of days until she confronted me. I finally told her that I didn't want to continue our friendship especially because her presence in my life reminded me a lot of this guy who broke my heart (for context: both my friend and the guy are best friends). She seemed very upset and we haven't spoken at all, which has made our work relationship a bit strained.

But, strangely, although I was satisfied with my decision at first, I find myself missing her a lot, especially the fun times we had at the office. We weren't very close outside work, but she made everything more bearable and I think her affection for me was genuine (and greater than the affection I felt for her).

Should I talk to her and apologize? Should i explain my reasoning? I wouldn't want to ruin things further, she seems very angry (quite rightly so).

I'm ashamed because I didn't do things right. I spend all my time complaining about this guy who broke my heart and ghosted me when I needed it most and I feel like I did the same with my friend.

I would like to wait let the waters to calm down a bit and try to get closer to her again, but I'm afraid that she will hate me for what i did. Honestly, i'm starting to feel like crap and an assh0le.

How to forgive gf with BPD after she cheated.,1715998455.0,"We are both 19 and have been together for almost 2 years now. Unfortunately we had to go long distance for college, and I am really the only person she is close to, so this ended up leaving her without a good support system. The entire time she was away she kept talking about hurting herself and other terrible things, and I kept pleading with her to get help.

In the last month of college, I told her if she doesn’t try to get help I really can’t be with her anymore. She promised to do better and it seemed like she was. She was talking to more people from her school and things calmed down. About a week before we both got back, she told me she needed a break. She told me this at like 5 am, and at the time I was like “okay, I will reach out as soon as I get home.” I ended up reaching out to her a couple days later, and we went back to talking like normal.

We both got back from college last week, and since then things have been going great. She even started a full program, seeing a therapist, a psychiatrist, and with her own case manager. In just the first week they have already diagnosed her with Autism and Borderline Personality Disorder. 

However, just today she admitted to being drunk when she told me she wanted a break. She also admitted that a few days later she planned to kill herself, and ended up fucking the guy who had gotten her drunk. She admitted she was NOT drunk when they fucked, but claimed she was having a bad BPD episode and felt like she couldn’t say no to him after following him to his house. Since she was planning to kill herself that night anyway, it didn’t matter to her at that time. 

Of course she didn’t end up killing herself, and here I am now. She says she never even wanted it to happen, but just didn’t care at the time. Of course I can’t help but be skeptical. At the same time, I want to be there for her and make sure she gets the help she needs to keep going.

It makes me sick to think of her letting someone else use her body. Even if I stay with her, there is no way I can go back to normal intimacy.

What the fuck do I do? Is it fair to break up with her? I feel so bad because she really doesn’t have anyone else besides me, but at the same time she is hurting me so much.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the advice. I have ultimately decided to go through with it on Sunday, when we can be face to face. I would still love to hear anybody’s input if you haven’t shared already.

I feel all of this pressure at university and I fucking hate it. The semester will be done in a month, and I just don’t know how to push through!

With my husband, I want 2 children, but I’m scared I’ll go into these bad habits when things get hard with them. I’m also TERRIFIED that my husband will divorce me while I’m pregnant because my emotions + hormones for 6 months = psycho crazy lady.

Of course I will never do this, but I have these thoughts constantly. The guilt of what my parents would go through would be too much. I know they love me, but im still not over how I life was when I was in high school.

Two friends, A and B. I recently went overseas for three weeks. Before I left, both friends expressed to me multiple times that they wanted to come visit me to hang out (I live about an hour away from all my friends, except my partner, so getting visitors is not something that happens a lot and I was very excited that they wanted to make the drive to me as it’s usually the other way around). I told them my availabilities, but they never answered me and they never made the trip.

A few days before leaving I asked A if they could drop in sometime during my absence to water my plants. As it is a long drive I told them they are welcome to stay as long as they like and also help themselves to my bong and weed. At first they were hesitant but agreed when I said they could bring one of our friends. They chose the day they would come up and planned it around B’s availability. Both A and B stayed about 2 days.

I just feel disappointed that it was so easy for them to plan a trip up to my place when I wasn’t even going to be there. We are all “best friends” but I often feel somewhat invisible when I’m with them as they talk mostly to each other. I hate that it bothers me because they are clearly closer with each other, and while they are the closest friends I have I am not the same to them. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t get jealous, but I would never express this to them because I think it’s wrong of me.

I asked my partner about this last night, and they told me earnestly that they don’t think my friends are trying to exclude me, but I am not convinced at all.

 Its really hard right now to cope with since im not even dating this guy, and I just can't be away from him?

BPD diagnosis,1715974067.0,"I’ve recently been informally diagnosed with quiet BPD after having suspected I have it for years. I had really been pushing off talking to anyone about it because of my fear of not being believed. So many of my symptoms are internalized, but it got to a point where I felt I really needed the help. For the most part I feel like I am a pretty stable person but that might just be what I’ve been telling myself all this time. Either way, I’m taking some time to consider if I would like to be formally diagnosed as my therapist suggested, but I've been having a really hard time finding any helpful information. I think being diagnosed would be validating for me, but I’m a little more concerned about the external pros and cons. If my diagnosis would just be getting in the way of any sort of medical treatment when I don’t feel it should, then I would want to know before I decide. If anyone has any information on that , or on the general stigma around bpd in the US that would be really helpful!

I’m also scared to talk to my parents about it. For one, I don’t think I’d be believed without an official diagnosis. On top of that, I’m not totally sure they would understand even if I were to be formally diagnosed. How should I go about telling them? I’m not very good at opening up about my emotions to my parents but would it be helpful to go over the bpd criteria, how I fit into it, and what it’s like for me?

I am trying very hard to get better (DBT, yoga, therapy, etc.) However my ex and i both realized that I emotionally traumatized them and she now has panick attacks about me.

My ex is wanting me to move out but I cant find an apartment and I was finally getting comfortable living with the both of them. I am just so sad and at a lost.

I want to prove to her that i can manage my BPD and that im redeemable, but I am also her abuser and causing her great emotional stress. TBH even if I did find another apartment there's a very slim chance I could afford it. I am just so overwhelmed and saddened and am unsure what to do.

The Overlap of CPTSD and Borderline,1715963717.0,"I have been diagnosed with BPD and PTSD and have been in DBT & EMDR for a while. My symptoms have improved greatly, but I still wonder if it is truly the correct diagnosis. None of my psychiatrists have actually accepted CPTSD as a real disorder, when I bring it up it always gets shut down and it makes me particularly speculate on if my diagnosis is right since CPTSD has never even been considered. I fit the criteria for BPD, because much of my trauma IS abandonment. Could BPD simply be CPTSD where the trauma is abandonment? I often hear people say the main difference between CPTSD and BPD  is that with CPTSD the unhealthy behavior is in order to avoid the trauma, while with BPD it is to avoid real/percieved abandonment. But abandonment and neglect can be traumatic?? I am often perplexed by the overlap.

"Jobs, Income, and SSI",1715961736.0,"Hello! 
I am 27 years old and I was diagnosed at about 21. 

I have had at least 20 jobs since I started working in 2014. Most of them I was fired from.

This was my first year living out of my parents house. My boyfriend and I got an apartment together in August of 2023. I was laid off from one job during the application process, and fired from another. With my job record, I should've gotten something more affordable in case, but I didn't. I thought I would find my forever job. 

I was fired from another Job at the end of February. And another on the 1st of April. 

We are unable to pay our rent now, and I borrowed some money from my parents, and he is going to borrow some money from his dad hopefully. 

I think I'm at the point where I want to give up on trying to work, and just get on disability. Employment is very triggering and exacerbates my symptoms, and keeps me from being able to get as much treatment. 

And its just not stable or predictable income for me anymore at this point. 


TLDR:

How many of you work? Can you keep a job long term? Are you on SSI? Was it hard to get? 

We have to move back to my mom's when this lease is up, to catch up on everything, and I am dreading it, because my relationship with my parents I'd not Healthy when we live together.

My Friend Was Recently Diagnosed,1715955523.0,"I reconnected with an old close friend of mine last October. We occasionally hang out and text/call (not on a daily basis, but frequently). I was busy the last 2 months because of work so I wasn't talking to them as much during that time. I reached out at the beginning of this month to catch back up with them and offer support as they were heading into exam season. I'd noticed that their emotions and mental state seemed to fluctuate with more intensity but wasn't sure if it was stress or other factors so I would try and cheer them up or talk through things with them.

We had dinner together last night and they confided in me that their pcp diagnosed them with Quiet BPD. I've never met another individual with BPD or have much knowledge of it. They told me that they were prescribed medication and it did help when taken, but they do not want to rely on it in fear of getting addicted. Their pcp referred them to two general psychologists, but they haven't gone to any therapy sessions yet. They are in the process of looking for a therapist that specializes in BPD but have yet to find one.

I know the journey ahead of them is going to be a long and difficult one but I want to be able to offer support when needed. The only thing I am wary of is if they will become heavily dependent on me. They used to be very dependent on me before we stopped being friends. I stepped away because I felt that I wasn't taking care of myself and always putting them first. I think right now we have a good relationship where we are comfortable sharing personal thoughts and emotions with one another, but maintain certain boundaries at the same time.

I'd like to keep the relationship we have because it is most comfortable for me, but I wonder if it is comfortable for them? Am I being a bad friend if I want to keep our current boundaries up? Is there anything I can do to offer reassurance and support when they are going through low tides? Is there anything I should avoid mentioning in case it worsens their mental health?

Lost medicaid a month ago and now my life is falling apart due to meds withdrawals and unchecked borderline,1715922961.0,"A little over a month ago I found out I lost my health insurance so I didn't have access to my meds. I had to ration them which resulted in different levels of withdrawals different psych meds and nerve pain meds. During that time, I started feeling more and more unhinged. I was too anxious and missed my last few classes in the semester so of course I failed a class. 

Moreover, my anger has been out of control. My abandonment issues are running rampant with everybody, including my psychiatrist who is retiring this summer. My therapist is very helpful and I've been terrified of losing that therapeutic relationship. I've been having several panic attacks a week and daily crying spells. Suicidal on and off but most days in the last few weeks I've felt passively suicidal (and sometimes actively but I know deep down that I won't ever attempt again). I know I'm not okay. 

I’ve been fighting with my partner who I love more than anything in this world. The thing that kills me is that I keep pushing her away. I keep telling myself not to push her away and not to fight with her, only to find myself in the same predicament again. She’s getting tired of my shit and I can’t blame her. I am afraid that she will leave me soon and if I am this unstable right now, I’m afraid to find out how much worth it can be. 

I want her to be happy and I want to be happy. I really want to work through my anger problems and only contribute love and positivity to her life. I don’t know if it’s possible for me to change, but I know that I would never forgive myself if I didn’t try. I don’t want to be like this. It would be good for me and for her if I managed to stay calm and communicated better. I really am trying so that's the frustrating part where I get in my own way. I tell myself don't fight with her and then I do it again. 

I want to believe that I can change. That I can at least improve and learn to be a healthy communicator and a more supportive partner. She is a good person who cares about me and is invested in my well-being as well as her own and I know she has made mistakes too, but I really need to try harder and stop fighting so much or she will leave me.

To love like a dog,1715913807.0,"
(Not really a poem, more of a train of thought)

In general I'm a smart, motivated, empathetic, confident, enthusiastic, independent person. 

But when I start to love, I love like a DOG. 

You know the quote from The Notebook ""Just tell me what you want, tell me what you want and I'll be that for you.""

That's what runs through my mind every relationship I get into. Wether it be friendships,  a lover, a new school or job. Even a hobby or passion. It doesn't matter.

When I love, I love like a dog.

Transforming and training myself to fit what they need.
So they won't leave me.
So they keep giving me the bare minimum of food and water.
So they won't bring me to the pound.

And I'll do it unconditionally. 

I guess that's why they're called a man's best friend.  

But of course almost every dog will eventually bite back. 
If the pains too bad. 
It's a reaction. They probably don't even mean it.
When a dog is in pain? They bite.

Usually the ones they love most.

I feel like I’m not in the relationship I should be in. 
I feel like I’m having to accept and change my authentic self to make it seem to work, when I feel like I am drowning. 
It’s hard when I’m having to keep accountable for everything, like time, making sure things are okay, asking if things are okay, I feel like I have taken on another mothering role. 

I feel like the only time I’m worthy of touch is going to lead to sex and that makes me feel gross. I would like a normal encounter and affection with touch that doesn’t lead to sex every now and again. And I have expressed this to him and he said it’s not the case but I can’t help but feel and link them. 

I feel like I’m the one who has my life set up but I’m so far behind too. Waiting. On pause. 
I am nervous because I’m the only one at the moment with a car, and my partner wants a car and is organising a car loan but I’m anxious because that’s $600 a month on top of finances if we stay together. 
I’m 27, I wanted to have kids soon but with the financials I do not feel comfortable to bring a child into this world anytime soon. 

I feel like I’m not worthy of basic messages of good morning/goodnight, and to elaborate, I mean just acknowledging that i exist? 
If I finish work I make sure to message or something but I feel like I just get forgotten on his end. It would just be nice to know and be told I am on his mind as much as he is mine, but it doesn’t seem that way. I bring it up and I’m told that he’s just not a romantic and then I feel like a shit person for feeling my feelings. 
When I’ve asked about this he’s simply told me “he’s not a romantic person”.

I feel a great disconnect from him when he’s not with me due to his lack of/sparse messaging and often forgets/leaves me on delivered. 
If I’m having a rough day, he won’t reach out to ask if I’m alright or ask to support me. 

Im constantly anxious now because when my energy isn’t met I am worrying I’m too much or that he’s upset with me.

Recently Diagnosed with BPD,1715881031.0,"37/f here. I've had severe depression and some anxiety my whole life, as well as struggling with a crippling alcohol addiction. It has been recommended by my therapist (who I am not currently seeing at the moment - long story, but has to do with insurance) to enter into a DBT program. Part of the pre-requisite for the program is to have several sessions with a DBT therapist. 

BPD had never been brought up to me in the past, but during my last session the DBT therapist we read over the diagnosis criteria and I fit 8/9. I am taking this with grain of sand as he and I haven't been working together for that long, but it makes enough sense to me to look into it further.

Can anyone please recommend a good place to start? As with most mental disorders, I figure asking Dr. Google won't give me the most reliable results. Any websites with information or books would be a huge help, along with any tips you think might be helpful for someone just learning about her diagnosis.

My friends have abandoned me during one of the hardest and lowest points in my life ,1715878563.0,"I thought I’d share over here, perhaps at least one person will be able to relate? It’s been an incredibly hard few months for me. I am newly diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. And have had major depression disorder and anxiety since a very young age. I just got out of rehab for a weed addiction a few weeks ago (very successfully - I am not on any substances anymore and don’t plan on it again). Since being out, I’ve found it incredibly hard to adjust back into my home environment. Everything was so safe and I was so protected in the clinic. They even decreased my meds because I was doing so well. 

Fast forward to coming out and back into my home environment and I’ve never been in a worse place in my life. On top of this, two weeks ago, I found out my friend took his life. When I found this out, I tried to call my one friend, but she ignored my phone call because she was too busy smoking, knowing that I needed the support because I was alone, and one of my conditions were for my friends to please not smoke in front of me. So she didn’t pick up and chose to smoke with my other friend instead of them asking if I maybe wanted to come over for some company to grieve with them. Then, I had asked my very best friend if she would be around for company and support after my friend’s memorial. She said no, it’s too much for her. I will admit that I started lashing out on both of them after those two occasions, which I’m not proud of, but because my friend had just died and no one wanted to be around. At some point I pulled back. 

They haven’t spoken to me for two weeks, and don’t plan to. My best friend said “she just wants her old friend back”. Which makes me feel hurt because I’m still here. I am her friend. The same friend I’ve been for years. I’m just not the perfect version of myself that she wants me to be right now. I can’t have people in my life conditionally based on my circumstances. I would do anything for my friends. Especially if they were at their lowest points. I am in such a bad state that my mom is on watch for me in case she has to take me to the hospital to be under observation if I am a danger to myself. And my friends? No where to be seen. Not only have I lost my friend who took his life, but now I’ve lost two of my best friends after the fact as well. And I am alone in my grief. I just feel completely helpless. I’ve had to delete social media because they’re posting petty things to their stories. I’m finding it hard to accept that these friendships may have run their course. Because they’ve been in my life for years. But I just think it’s such a nasty thing to do, especially considering my best friend is a psychology major, who was so supportive of my diagnosis and one of the only people I opened up to about it. And is in her mid 30s, so it’s not like I can even chalk it up to an age thing. Which is such shocking and juvenile behaviour for someone in her position.

I don’t know how I feel (biggest regret),1715876024.0,"Last year was very hard for me. I have severe attachment issues and I ended up losing everyone in my life.

During college, I had a long term friend that I was living with and a boyfriend.

During my senior of high school, I was exploring college orgs and that’s when I found a sorority. I’ve always wanted to join one, but never had the chance until my junior/senior year of college. I couldn’t explain why I exactly wanted to, but I think it’s because since they promote sisterhood and a home away from home, it made me a feel a certain way. I don’t have any sisters nor a good home, so I really wanted a family. According to my therapist, she said I wanted to join to feel validated.

I had a good relationship with my long term friend and boyfriend, but once I started the pledging process, that’s when everything changed. The sorority process was high demanding and involved severe mental hazing. I couldn’t tell my long term friend and it took a lot of time away from my boyfriend. The process took a toll on mental health which affected me physically, mentally, and financially. I was so messed up in the head that I started projecting my anger and stress on the two of them. I was super toxic to them and myself. At one point, I was given an ultimatum by boyfriend, it was either the him or the sorority. It was really hard for me because I wanted both, but I think I said some stupid shit like the sorority is forever, whereas I don’t even know if we’re going to last. Eventually, me and my boyfriend broke up and later on, me and my long term friend stopped being friends-she felt betrayed that I didn’t tell her. After losing the two most important people in my life at the time, the sorority later on cut me off and I ended up cutting off the sorority for good. 

I sacrificed myself, my long term friend, and my boyfriend aka my FP, for a school organization. My therapist was like wow… so you chose a school org specifically a sorority over a potential life long life partner? I know, I was stupid. I was young and desperate to find a group of people that can accept and validate me because apparently my long term friend and boyfriend was not enough. After it was too late, that’s when I realized that I took them for granted because they were my family all along.

It breaks my heart even more because I was financially struggling at the time. I had to my pay for college and rent all by myself. I had a little bit of money to spare and I did see a psychiatrist and counselor a bit, but I decided to devote all of my time and the rest of my savings into a sorority that I ended up regretting.

It hurts me a lot knowing that I sacrificed very important people in my life for fake, surface level friendships that didn’t even last longer than a year. It fucking sucks. I’m full of regret and it’s hard to live. I wished I was more self aware. I wished I went to therapy and took medications. If I never joined the sorority, I wouldn’t be as depressed as I would have if I didn’t. 

I know that I had put myself into this situation, basically self sabotaging myself, i ended up hurting and losing my friend and ex boyfriend now. It is my responsibility. Even though I felt like it wasn’t me who was living in my body at the moment, in the end I still did it, so I have to own up to it.

After I lost everyone, that’s when I finally started therapy and medications. After a few months, I am now so self aware. Looking back, I really don’t even remember myself living in the moment-I had no sense of reality. It breaks my heart because I was so discombobulated and disconnect with reality, as if my BPD had control of me. I don’t want to blame it on mental health because in the end, the BPD is still a part of me as an individual.

I wish I could go back in time and change everything. I really hate myself for making actions like this. I split so easily and it sucks because I always regret it after is too late. It’s just so hard living knowing that I was so broken and mentally ill that it took over me.

Everyday I tell myself, it’s okay. You were young and you didn’t know. They left for a reason. If they all didn’t leave me, I don’t know if I would have even started therapy and medications. It sucks because I really want them back. I am full of regret. I would do anything to get them back. I wished they knew how sorry I am, but no one wants me back anymore because the damage I did isn’t forgivable.

Therapy is working and the medications definitely help, but I just can’t let go of my long term friend and ex boyfriend. I know I’m still young, people come and go all the time, and there’s still many people that I haven’t met yet.

Many people have told me that I’ve grown/matured a lot and they can tell that I am a better version of myself than I was before.

It’s just that I hate being so self aware now because I feel like the memories of me acting all crazy and sick in the head at time just consistently replays in my head. It doesn’t even feel like it was me who did all this.

People don’t understand me and honestly I didn’t understand myself either. I’m grateful that I am able to now afford therapy and medications because I will be the one who breaks my family’s generational trauma.

I just can’t believe I did all this. Living with regret is so fucking hard and it’s even harder now that I know that I was the one who put myself in the position that I’m in right now. I need to be more to nice myself, but it’s hard to be nice to someone who did fucked up things. I’m grateful, but I’m so depressed.

Ive been on zoloft for the past year and i know its not working i need something else. I feel psychotic at times and very unregulated. 

But because im very self aware every therapist ive ever seen just assumes im so much better than i actually am. 
Everyday is a struggle. I told him weed is the only thing that helps me and i was thinking of asking my doctor for a prescription. He is obviously against weed because he just told me to stop smoking and that it wont help. “Self medicating wont help” 

If i didnt smoke weed i would literally SH or attempt??? Like what? And ive said this to him that it calms me. But he said theres a risk of psychosis, i understand that but ive been smoking for 7+ years and its never given me psychosis its the only relief ive ever been able to find. But ive got charges on me for having weed so im too scared to buy street weed and getting caught again.

Ive been trying to change my meds for almost 6 weeks now and ive had literally no help. Ive been going through a breakup and its literal hell. But nobody is listening or understanding.

His text: ""I'm sitting in a bar. It's all a bit weird."" my reply ""good for you Tim 👍"" and have heard nothing since. He mentioned a few weeks ago that he saw me on Bumble but I didn't really know what to say since we're friends and he never hit on me it or asked me on a fancy date... is he pissed he's friend-zoned and now he's trying to passive-aggressively hurt me?
Our kids are friends and his parents come to my house when they're in town, but a couple of things happened in between which makes me think he's trying to withdraw from our friendship for instance we bumped into a lady in a bar once who said something about me to her friend, and I told her when she stood in my way to leave that she was a bitch (i happened to once be friends with her and then she ghosted me and then actively caused me to lose my job and consequently I couldn't apply for my teaching license in that state anymore).
He looked shocked at my outburst and said something like ""gee you seem to have alot of enemies"" haha i wanted to say, you don't know the half of it 🤣🤣🤣

recently met a guy online— am a female and a lesbian. for the record. it isn’t romantic which makes it worse, cuz i’ve never had a fp who wasn’t my partner, except for a childhood best friend, but that was YEAAAARS back(and also just realizing that was a fp too), so i’d love pointers. 

it’s so weird. before i met him i was fine. alone and had no friends but i didn’t feel alone. now i have friends AND feel alone. whenever im not around him or talking or texting him i feel empty, like im an NPC waiting for the player (him) to interact with me 😐

 i’ve called a hotline atleast 3 times since i met him. not for the intended reason, but just because i felt so alone. and i only realized he’s my FP yesterday. 

the next kicker is that we only met like a month ago. i rarely feel connections like this. i’ve lost interest in my hobbies. caught myself mirroring things he does. i’m pissed and embarrassed at myself.

I'm reaching out because I'm really struggling to manage my emotions, and it's taking a toll on my mental health. I have Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), just like all of you, and sometimes my emotions become overwhelming. I experience intense sadness, emotional dysregulation, and even suicidal thoughts (which I know many of you can relate to).

Despite having a support system, I feel like my family and friends don't fully understand the severity of my struggles. I wish they would take the time to learn more about BPD, its symptoms, and how they can better support me during difficult times.

"Honesty and therapy, a breakthrough. ",1715845389.0,"Long story short.. I started being more honest with my therapist. I recently started working with her after an insurance change, and she specializes in BPD and complex trauma. She worked with my previous therapist as a supervisor and runs the DBT group I’m in (on hold due to issues with living situation), so she’s already a bit familiar with my case. 

Remission is my goal. No longer hurting those around me as a result of my illness and fixing this shitty inability to take proper accountability is my goal. But that meant I needed to do something I haven’t done in the 15 years I’ve been in therapy. 

I had to be honest. Brutally honest. And I hate it. 

I told her about my manipulative tendencies. I talked about how I wanted to control the people around me, and how I see it as a way to both protect myself and limit my stress, despite it always being at the expense of others. I talked about it in detail, even though I felt like a monster while talking about it. 

I started talking about the death threats. The suicidal manipulation. Violence. Self-harming and how I’ve used it to control others. The emotional blackmail. The financial abuse. The extreme codependency. The horrible splits, discards, and hoovers. The obsessive tendencies. The impulsivity. How I’ve cyber stalked my ex lovers and friends. I will be telling her more of this as our sessions continue, and it’s incredibly difficult. The shame and guilt almost make it feel impossible. 

Part of why I went so long without a diagnosis was because I would omit these details. I would describe situations in a way that only made me out to be a victim. Sometimes I still do this, because I will genuinely convince myself that I’ve done no wrong even though that isn’t true. 

We talked about where this behavior came from. A mix of my dysfunctional family and an inability to properly cope with stress. I’ve started to identify patterns in my behavior. I infantilize myself and deflect whenever I have to take accountability. I try to use my trauma as a way to justify my actions and behavior. 

I talked about the bad stuff. The part of me that I hate. The part of me that takes over when I feel shame, invalidation, fear. The part of me that’s extremely dysregulated and abusive to my loved ones. 

The next step is finding ways to cope without hurting myself or others. More effective communication skills. Better emotional regulation. 

I’m considering showing her emails and texts I’ve sent while splitting too. But that really scares me. I’ll bring them up if issues arise in the future. I have to remind myself this isn’t for validation that I’m right or that I’m a victim. It’s to gain new perspective and shine a light on these hideous parts of myself, so these patterns can be properly addressed. 

Gods, I hate it. But it’s gotta be done at some point, right?

I’m really grateful for my therapist. She’s very patient with me and doesn’t show judgement, even when it would be more than understandable for her to do so. 

I have to remind myself that I’m here to get better, not to convince my therapist that I’m a good person. 

And that’s the hardest part. My ego wants me to be a good, innocent person so badly. But I’m not. There’s so much work to do. 

The real work starts with that discomfort.  ",BamBamYangGang,,False,1ct7j6u,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1ct7j6u/honesty_and_therapy_a_breakthrough/
How do you guys cope?,1715839626.0,"I should preface this by saying I’m not diagnosed. My psychiatrist said that he suspected it but long story short he’s not allowed to evaluate me.

It feels like my rejection wound will be the death of me. I am also diagnosed with social anxiety. All I do is worry and feel disgusting all day. Every interaction is exhausting. I’m constantly reading between the lines and feeling like people are judging me, trying to put themselves above me, or just in general look down on me/hate me. And then I feel bad after because deep down I know it’s not the case, they had no bad intentions. But in the moment it’s like I forget I ever had that line of thought and I honestly just get angry and then start extrapolating to things about their personhood. Like, for example, if I feel like someone is judging me I’ll sit there fuming like ‘maybe if you weren’t so judgemental you’d actually be happy.’ All I do is analyze in my head if people actually like me. When my friends are nice to me I just get scared. Because I know if I mess it up and they don’t like me anymore it’ll take me forever to make peace with it. And I feel empty because I’ve shown them a false version so they don’t even really know me. 

I smoke a disgusting amount of weed because feeling makes me so uncomfortable. The anxiety is paralyzing. My mother has said she has been able to see my heart beating through my shirt, and I didn’t believe it until I saw it myself. The anger is all consuming, and I’m ashamed of the things it’s lead me to do. The sadness is overwhelming, the self disgust constant.

Also, I hate that I have to make all my ""friendships"" official via following... It makes me unfollow people and it is weird if they come back after a while. I think those less strong relationships could do better in long term if I hadn't officially ended then via unfollowing.

Does anyone experience opposite emotions with BPD?,1715808277.0,"Hello, 

I have been recently diagnosed from Bipolar to Borderline. As a way to try and learn more about my disorder and possible ways to cope on my own, I’ve started to watch YouTube videos and even come onto Reddit to see what other people with BPD have problems with. Now from what I have been finding I feel like I maybe got diagnosed wrong. Any feedback as to what I will try to describe would be super helpful.

From what I read and hear, a lot of people with BPD can split from happy to angry. For me I don’t experience that and have that happen  only on some occasions/situations. Almost always I split from happy to sad and have extreme reactions like intense negative/suicidal thoughts and lots of crying. It’s really hard to explain. Almost all of those splits happen with my fp, and they result in me crying and being anxious and scared that they are going to leave me, or they are lying to me and cheating on me. Even sometimes making me feel like a terrible person and that I manipulated them. Little micro expressions will set me completely off. I feel like I have my moments where I almost compulsively do manipulative things to get my way, but I really try to not do that.

Also on a separate note, I have a very hard time remembering things. Is that something anyone else goes through?

I(17) have been dating my boyfriend(19) for about three months now. He has borderline personality disorder and lately, he has been going through an episode. He warned me about this before since he knows he has a habit of isolating himself when things get too bad, but I'm really worried about him. He still texts me every day, tells me what is going to do, or tells me he loves me etc. But we haven't been calling like we usually do. Which I don't mind ofc!! If he needs space, I'm more than happy to give it to him since I know it can be draining for him. He has been feeling really guilty for not spending time with me, even after I reassured him I do not mind and I'm not going to leave him because of this. I think I am moreso just asking for advice to better help him. I know things about BPD from asking him questions and researching, but I still feel like I don't know how to reassure him that it isn't his fault he's feeling like this and I don't mind waiting.

Thank you all for your kind words. I have to regretfully say that he broke up with me.

Is it borderline though?,1715749904.0,"I (21M) got diagnosed with borderline at age 16 or so and now my 22 birthday's just around the corner. I've been in therapy for way too long, usually is for short periods of time  but still, therapy has been part of my life since... Basically forever. 
I went through very traumatic and rough stage in life in my teens and thats when I finally got my diagnosis. At the time it made lots of sense but I'm not so sure anymore. Maybe it's because I've gotten treatment for so long and just got really good at understanding myself but, I cannot relate to most of the usual problems when it comes to the BPD community and it's frustrating me because, if not BPD then wtf do I have?? What's wrong with me? I haven't gotten a straight answer for so long and I don't know what to do anymore.

Last year I talked to my phycologist about my diagnosis and how I don't think I have BPD but I DEFINITELY know I have something messed up in my brain, he agreed with me  but he said he couldn't really give me a straight answer because  as time goes by our mind also changes, he said there's a possibility that maybe I just dont have something in particular, it's just the basics of a personality disorder. 

This ""nothingness"" is taking a toll on me, I don't understand where this feelings of anhedonia, passion (hate-to-love or vise versa), emptiness, impulsivity is coming from if it's not BPD. I only relate to the community when I'm ""spiriling""  or having a rough time but it usually disappears as soon as I feel better, it's like I gaslight myself to survive.

Is there anyone here who doesn't feel like they quite belong in this diagnosis that has been in therapy for a long time?

Me (M19) and my Fp (M20) have been in a serious romantic relationship for quite a while, we both have bpd and he’s being evaluated for possible schizophrenia, we’ve both been open about our mental health and since the beginning, we’ve been open about our mutual fps on each other and due to it, our separation anxiety. Due to recent events which I won’t go into specifics to in attempts to keep this post as short as possible, my Fp was sent to the psychward for about a week or so, he had to give up his phone just about two hours ago and I’ve been at a total loss, I don’t know what to do with myself and I can’t stop crying, I don’t know how he is, how he’s doing, what he’s doing, nothing. We are long distance due to college starting in a few months so I cannot visit him, he wrote down my number before they drove him to facility so he wouldn’t forget it but it’s likely they won’t let him call me anytime soon. I’m in contact with his mom but our conversations have been limited and I am at a total loss.

I’ve tried distracting myself but there’s nothing i can do, i have no friends to rely on, I have no enjoyment for anything anymore, watching videos and playing games leave me with nothing, I feel a sense of emptiness so deep that it’s crippling, I don’t know what to do. He’s my support system, he’s my everything and without him I have nothing and I am nothing, I have awful thoughts and memories that I try to fend away but i cannot, nothing helps and I’m hurting. I am an artist, I have art I owe that I must work on but I can’t get myself to do anything, my hands are hurting, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can’t think or I think too much, I still can’t tell.

The worst part of it all is that I was forced to stop taking my medication suddenly after taking it consistently everyday since April. For some context, i started having an allergic reaction yesterday, mainly just hives, I still don’t know what from, today the hives were still here even after I spent the day yesterday taking allergy relief and lathering myself up In anti itch shit that really didn’t help much. I went to the doctor today once they started to swell, initially I suspected my medication because I didn’t eat or do anything out of the ordinary (i don’t go outside) but after being seen by the doctor and had blood taken, he ruled it out and I fainted, had a panic attack, had some stuff injected in me and all that good shit. I called my psychiatrist right afterwards for good measure and she was unable to speak with me since she was with another patient but her receptionist contacted me after speaking with her and I was informed to stop taking my medication all together until we could speak. 

My next appointment was meant to be June 3rd but I am considering calling in tomorrow and arranging a sooner appointment or something because I feel like I’m losing my goddamn mind(

What would your perfect birthday be?,1715723032.0,"I think for a lot of us, birthdays are a sore spot. I know I always struggle. I make a huuuge effort for loved ones birthdays and even for people I'm not close with I like to do things to make their day special. It was always awful with my ex, with my husband it's OK but I still feel disappointed every year.

To be clear, I know how ungrateful I sound, and I feel a lot of guilt about it. But like with gifts, all I want is to feel like the person has put thought into it and that the gift shows they know me. Monetary value means nothing to me. I just want to know they know me. My husband has a favourite discount website he exclusively shops on and every Christmas, birthday and mother's day its very clear that he just goes on that site and picks out whatever they have that's tangentially related to me. It's weird, the gifts are always so close but so far. Like he sees something and thinks ""that's pink"" but then his thinking stops there, there's no ""oh but it is x, y or z that she doesn't like"". This year he's got us concert tickets to an artist he likes that I've not listened to in maybe a decade. But of course the guilt is eating me up for how ungrateful I am.

Oh and every year I naïvely try to organise something and every year every single person involved cancels, no matter what it is.. I don't blame them, I don't have a friendship group, only a couple friends and a few acquaintances that are all totally separate from each other.

If I could have my perfect birthday it would look like this:

-Breakfast in bed - pancakes! 

-A gift that shows how they know me and love me. Just real thought put into it. ""I saw x and thought of you"" ""I got you x so I'll always be with you"" ""you once told me about x and never forgot"".

-A birthday cake. I bake a lot, always have. I always bake birthday cakes for people even if we're not close. My husband doesn't get me a birthday cake.

-A big surprise party. This one will never happen. No one would organise a surprise party for me, no one would attend, no one would ever think to do it in the first place. The effort and love that goes into planning a surprise party... It's just not going to happen for me.

Autism & BPD - any signs and/or personal experiences?,1715721437.0,"I (20F) have been diagnosed with BPD for almost a year. Previously the diagnosis was Bipolar II, but this was altered when I went inpatient for two days last summer. I have also been diagnosed with ADHD (pretty severe, which I am medicated for) and OCD for about 3.5 years. I've been evaluated over 5 times in my life, starting when I was very young, and to my knowledge, Autism has never even been on the table.

People around me seem to think I have Autism or land somewhere on the spectrum - the majority of my close friends are Autistic so I spend a lot of time seeing and hearing their experiences with Autism. I don't think I share many of their symptoms/experiences, and the symptoms I do share (sensitivity to certain noises/textures, difficulty connecting with people sometimes, etc.) feel like they're more related to my current diagnoses. 

I do, however, realize that I am biased and not a psychiatric professional. So, if anyone has BPD and Autism combined (or have had both diagnoses at some point and landed on one alone) and would be comfortable sharing your experiences, please do! I'm not looking for psychiatric advice or treatment - just personal experiences from others that I can use to help inform myself.",gothashm12,,False,1cs3gnu,3,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cs3gnu/autism_bpd_any_signs_andor_personal_experiences/

I cut off my closest friends,1715718953.0,"TW: suicide, drug use

I probably took it too far, but maybe not?

Earlier this year, I felt suicidal and decided to buy as many drugs as possible so I could go out with a bang. My plan backfired because as soon as I got high I felt better and decided I wanted to live again (yes I'm aware of how this reads). I had quite a lot of gear left over and became afraid of what I might do, so I asked one of my best friends to help me get rid of it. He obliged and I asked him to please not to tell anyone.

He lasted all of two days before telling our other friends. I get that he was concerned but I felt a little disappointed that I couldn't trust him with such a volatile secret. When they all started making derogatory jokes about drug use at my expense I should have spoken up immediately but instead I stayed silent and just seethed and felt like a piece of garbage. Then one day one of the jokes went too far and I left our friendship group chat in a huff. No one said anything for a week, not until the day before an event we had organised when someone asked what was happening. I explained the situation, and was met with an ""I'm sorry you felt that way"" non-apology and ""we don't know what to do anymore"". They don't know my diagnosis, no one does, only that I have a diagnosis \~✧ of some kind ✧\~ and I would never tell them anyhow because they're apparently \~✧ shit at keeping secrets ✧\~

It's now been about two months with zero contact and in a few days time is a group birthday party for two of them which I'm sure I'm no longer invited to and even if I was, I probably wouldn't attend. I don't know how to feel about this whole situation, because my best friends made fun of something I did when I was in the darkest of all dark places and because of our falling out I am certain that our wider friendship circle have all of the juicy details by now. I highly doubt they've kept it to themselves and the shame of everyone knowing about this could crush me. Then again, I'm the one with the disorder and I'm aware that my judgement, thinking and emotional reactions are disproportionate, and probably I can't place blame on anyone for behaving the way that they did, all things considered.

I feel like it's an awkward time to reach out but I don't even know where I would begin. Should I just let them enjoy their birthday without me and deal with it later?

He tends to be the rock as he's had a lot more therapy and time with meds than me, while for me I've had almost two months of decent therapy and my meds don't do shit.

Last night though was really bad. I ended up having a huge emotional high and being super elated and out of control with impulses. He had a manic episode (bipolar comorbid) too so it was... not great.

It didn't end too badly luckily. Got it under control by like 4 AM after my mood crashed and he actually took his meds for once. The worst that happened was just me getting shitfaced drunk and a few close calls self-harm/suicide wise.

I just, don't really know what to do if this happens in the future. I mean it was like 12 AM and our neighbors in the housing program were asleep and I couldn't get their attention.

Then I start to devalue them and basically split. I become very cruel and all the love I had turns to hate for them.  And somehow I’ll make it seem like it was them and I’ll find a reason that seems valid enough to make them the villain in my head. Then I’ll go into a manic episode where I’m extremely social, extremely sexual with no protections, extremely confident to the point people have called me cocky and self centered.

with my ex, i’m very aware that she mentally and emotionally abused me and it’s as if part of my brain is being rational about it and that i need to cut her off to fully heal but the other part of me doesn’t know how to live without her or the hope of getting back together. she completely ghosted me after 4 years together(not great for the abandonment issues) and has recently come back trying to be in my life 2 years later. before she made contact id been feeling the best i had in years, i was eating n taking my meds regularly. all of the progress i made feels completely erased now and im back in the mental headspace where i would do anything to not lose her. after speaking with a friend for a while tonight i came to the realization that im clinging onto my ex so hard because i rely on her to tell me how to feel and i believe im deserving of the way she treats me but even knowing that i still find myself trying to give her another chance. im not sure how to trust myself to know what to do about anything without constant reassurance and im terrified of what will happen when i make decisions on my own so i don’t know how to move past how dependent on her ive been for the 5 years ive known her.

My bpd symptoms are only apparent when im in a relationship. With that being said, I think its unfair that the only way to feel “normal” is by isolating myself. 

It breaks my heart into a million pieces thinking that the only way to feel sane is by breaking off the relationship I have with my ex. I still have hopes that we’ll get back together, i mean we are in contact and hangout all the time but it breaks my heart that im no longer one of his priorities due to my past behavior. Of course this makes me feel like he doesn’t love me and the spiral begins, nothing is ever good enough for me and I only seem to prove him right… 

Im in therapy, im waiting for an evaluation for medication. My therapist told me to not put all my eggs in one basket, to not think that medication will help all my issues but I really hope it minimizes this feeling of emptiness, doubt and impulsivity. 

I go back & forth with feeling helpless and not wanting to let this define me. But recently i cant get the thought out of my head that I’ll never have a healthy romantic relationship. No one deserves to put up with someone like me.

BPD and work.,1715657493.0,"(27M) So I have been holding a chat support job for the last 6 months and counting, the longest I have ever manage to with any job I've ever had. This company is actually quite okay with their pay (15USD/8-hour shift, 5 days a week,which is just okay for the COL here in Southeast Asia), the people here and the environment are decent.


However due to the nature of my work, dealing with many times, unruly customers, and due to the unpredictable nature of customer service work, I always get intense anxiety before going to work, and I have used up many of my paid leaves on just random days where I don't feel like going to work. I was trained to not take it personal in this line of work, but my BPD just makes it so hard for me.

Today is one of those days, and even though I have used up all my leaves, I just can't muster the strength to go to work, and I have asked my team lead for a day off even if it is marked as absent and unpaid.

Maybe I just want some postlitive affirmation that I am not in anyway wrong for doing this. Am I wrong? Because I do feel guilty for taking so many days off already.

Sometimes I wonder, how can people do this, working a job for a mediocre pay and just keep going for half a century until retirement. I sometimes just wish I have enough to retire immediately because I just don't have the strength or energy to deal with this anymore. But alas, I need to feed myself in this struggling economy. 😔

"Unable to care about others, except my partner",1715651331.0,"I have BPD, and I am unable to care about others.  
  
I have a friend who wants to work on helping his community and possibly being a therapist. That's great.  
  
However, I honestly do not care enough to want to do that. I see a lot of people being nice to others and helping them, but I just honestly don't have that much of an urge to help out. In fact, empathy at this point feels like ""If this happened to me, I'd feel sad and shitty, so I shall help this person out.""  
  
I do not feel the urge to take my life for a child, I don't want to give myself to others for a living, etc. I just... Don't care.  
  
Also, I honestly don't care about what happened in my friend's day. If something shitty happened, then I'd like them to vent about it cause well what kind of friend am I if I don't let them vent?  
  
When I make a friend, I usually have to answer these questions: Do I share similar interests to this friend? How much will this friend benefit me? Does this friend have enough time on their hands to spend time with me? Do I already have a friend?  
  
If I already have a best friend (as I do now), then I'm not gonna be attached to other friends. Like, at all. In fact, it'll be a chore to talk to them. I only really like talking to one best friend and my partner.  
  
I'm really selfish...  
  
And honestly, I also don't want to fix it. I just want to know why it is happening. When I do feel empathy, it's extremely intense. I feel intense emotions about my partner, also.

"No euphoria, low highs",1715647856.0,"I would like to hear about experiences from people with clinically diagnosed BPD that have low highs.

Euphoric highs are such a defining trait of BPD that it's hard to find sources talking about instances of BPD that lack it aside from ""it's possible."" What do your clinicians say to justify diagnosing you with BPD despite a lack of euphoric highs? How do you be confident in the diagnosis without it? 

I experience pretty intense swings but my ""highs"" are either head over heels enamored with someone (not proud of this) or able to simply have fun for once.

He said he loves me very much, and these were the best months of his life, but he doesn't want constant fights or to be limited by my fears and jealousy.

But it is a job where he’d be interacting with girls/ having to be physical with them on a daily basis. (Not going to be specific about the job but I hope you can get the point.) Even typing this I feel evil for even having thoughts like this. I truly do trust my boyfriend, I don’t even know why I’m feeling like this. It’s a reflection on me, not anything he’s ever done. He does nothing but reassure me, affirm me, be so patient with me, and love me. 

This has me feeling so insecure and shitty. Outwardly, I’m being nothing but supportive and positive. I want him to succeed and be happy. And he really deserves the job. But something fucked up in the back of my mind is hoping he doesn’t get it. It’s so fucked up for me to be this selfish.

Do I have borderline personality disorder?,1715550528.0,"I know that this isn't necessarily the place to ask this question, but I've been lurking in this sub for a bit since my last trip to inpatient. The psychiatrist there sat me down and tried to explain that I didn't have bipolar and really was borderline after all. I was scared and confused and I believed her, so I decided to take Lexapro as she instructed because it was supposed to help with anxiety.

Fast forward a few weeks later, and surprise surprise the ssri made me manic which at least confirmed bipolar. But borderline still seems to...fit. Everything I've read on here I still feel applies to me as well. I know there is a lot of overlap, but I just can't seem to shake the feeling that I have both.

Because for me it feels like there are two people inside me. One that is logical and wants a better life where I don't sabotage and destroy every relationship before it even really begins, and then the other side that is emotional and wants to tear everything apart. It's like there's a war inside me and it feels like it could truly rip my mind in two. It's like a child in the way it throws tantrums and wants to be the center of someone else's world. Like it wants to feel special and desired at all costs, but once I get close it also wants to push everyone away. And I don't understand it, because that's not what I want! My sober, logical side knows that I don't want that kind of life. I don't want to feel so intensely about other people and obsess over them to the point of genuine madness. The feelings are so intense that they feel physicalized inside me. My stomach twists into knots and I feel nauseous and like I want to scream sometimes when the emotions are at there peak. Meanwhile I keep saying how much I want for those thoughts and feelings to go away. In a lot of ways it feels like I'm haunting myself.

Is it possible to have a close friendship and not make that person your fp?,1715538730.0,"If so, how? I recently (within the past year) met someone new when starting a new part-time job and we quickly became friends. About 6 months into being coworkers, we started hanging out outside of work. Then I went full-time and started the same shift as them, not necessarily because of them but because of financial reasons (working the same shift as this friend was definitely a factor though). Not long after, they connected me with their landlord and got me an apt right under them, so we carpool and are essentially living together. Since I was only diagnosed recently, I’m only just now learning the terms and one that stuck out was splitting. From what I understand, I’ve already split with this person once before and hurt them immensely in the process. I don’t want to do it again, and I don’t want them to be my favorite person. I just want to be close(or best) friends without crossing the line and being fully dependent on them, but I feel like I already have considering just how intertwined our lives are. I also fear I may be confusing admiration with romantic interest, even though I know we are incompatible sexually/romantically since they’re straight. Is the only answer to go out and find a romantic relationship to replace this person in my favorite person role? That also seems kinda messed up because ultimately my only reason for doing it revolves around my feelings for my friend. Ugh. Thank you for reading this vent post.

I know she's been extremely stressed because she's just been diagnosed with cancer, and to make matters worse our son has recently been hospitalized, he's doing okay now, but he's in the hospital getting some help, I know she has separation anxiety pretty bad, there's just been a lot going on and these freakouts have been progressively getting worse, and she's hurt herself (accidentally) a few times now. I've thought about taking her to the hospital because I know I can't do enough by myself to help her work through this and I know if she can't find a better outlet soon it'll get worse and could lead to some serious injuries, it's happened before and I don't want it to happen again. I love her wholeheartedly and I want the best for her, but I'm not sure how to support her through all this and I worry that if I can't something seriously bad could happen, and the only reason I haven't taken her to the hospital is because of her separation anxiety and I know it'd cause a lot more stress on her end, she also hasn't hurt herself much, the worst she's done is some scratches and cuts from hitting a mirror, I'm not sure exactly *why* she hit the mirror but I believe (because of the way she was acting) it might've been some sort of psychosis or something? Either way it was easy to help her get cleaned up, I've tried talking to her but she says she doesn't know how to word anything the way she wants to, she's always had this issue and it's okay, I just feel like it'd help both of us if she could get it off her chest and maybe I could understand more, maybe be able to help her find better outlets/other ways to cope. *I will take her to a hospital if it is shown necessary*. She's lashed out at me a few times, she's never physically hurt me on purpose and I know that, and even if she did I can forgive her because I know she's just having a hard time, and no it would not make it right for her to do that, but at that point I understand she's not all in the right mindset and with BPD I know there's always some sort of trigger behind it, whether it's something I do on accident or not, I know it's not her fault, her struggles are something she can't handle on her own. Sometimes I worry that I don't do enough to help her, and that I'm not careful/caring enough to be right for her, but I'll put that aside, I know she just needs someone to help her through, she deserves the world for what she has to struggle with and anyone else who struggles with this does too, it's clearly a lot and it's for sure not easy.

Back on my meds after 5 years,1715507779.0,"Just finished commenting on a post in this group offering advice regarding BPD like I’m handling mine SO well. 

When in reality I’ve just had to go back on my meds after 5 years (give or take) of proudly being unmedicated. 

When I was first diagnosed after an episode so intense it resulted in road laws broken, police and ambulance called, and an attempt on my life (that I can’t remember) my mum and I devised a rating system for my episodes. 1-10 with 10 being another serious attempt of harm in some form.

I moved away from the state my parents and I lived in for 15 years to live by myself by the seat of my pants (trial by fire kinda vibe), and promised them that if I had an episode stronger than a 6 I would immediately seek out restarting my Lamotragine with my doctor. The other month I had a “awaken from a dissociative state” moment on my SIL’s couch. I’d been sat in my car out front their house for the last hour. 

Now, the return of the strong episodes was all due to a situation in my life that was a black and white fix, it eventually was fixed, now life is dandy again, but I’m staying on my meds for the time being.

I don't understand how to proceed,1715507168.0,"*Need to know some experience and insights PLEASE*

I have a partner who is a neurodivergent, they are not in the best state of mind. As someone with BPD I have a lot of mood swings and splitting. I have made myself stable enough to communicate those without sounding like someone owes me kinder treatment (I'm saying this not out of self loathing but out of the understanding that we as people are not on our best behaviour all the time)
I work on myself everyday(literally, like I take care of myself and try understand my actions and reactions for regulation instead of impulsivity) 
What I am facing here is that my partner has been depressed over a few months. And in the starting I wasn't that empathic, I just tried giving advices and let them know that they need to do their urgent work in order to not let them add the work on their pressurising thoughts that they are already having..
Later I realised that sometimes we need to stay in those feelings and let it run its course..
This took me a while to understand..
But still I was keeping up with my emotions to support them..now that he says he's functioning better I talk about how I am feeling(pent up sadness is still in me, not only because of them but also trauma triggers) and in response I find them telling about how they are messing up and how much hurt they are causing me.. 
To be honest, I'm pretty tired of assuring them that they're not the whole/only reason that's making me feel this way(instead I'm just hoping that they'll feel better sometimes instead of any hurt they're causing me).. I'm unable to lie that they're nowhere the reason..because I am sometimes hurt because of them. At this stage I'm not that stable myself and going through a lot of intense emotions.. and the fact that I have to take care of their needs all the time and reassuring them mostly has gotten to me.. I'm questioning basis of the relationship. 
I don't know how to proceed further.. I am not able to keep up with this- telling them about my feelings--them trying to make it about themselves -- reassuring them -- them wanting space cz they think they've fucked up again.. I'm tired of regulating I don't know if they're even thinking about me.

We have been living together for 7 years (yes, it is chaotic), but my recent diagnosis allowed us to try to really support each other this time.

However, from a business course, he is suddenly studying for med school and would need to stay at home for good. Everything is so rushed and the changes in our lives would be too drastic for me. We planned to get married soon but now, he can’t even live with me anymore. 

My BPD is really acting up and normally, I would try to prevent him from continuing med school. But now, I know that is not a good idea and this is what’s best for him.

I know it’s not right but I can’t help it. I can’t stop imagining him with other girls in class (he has history of being caught attracted to other women who gives him attention and suits his taste during our relationship) + he probably will be too busy with studying.

This is the best for him and we have broken up for days now.

Her relationship with our parents is very bad, she's also recently gone through a divorce so I can 100% completely understand the way she's behaving. But I feel like her mental health is completely deteriorating her each day. I won't go into specifics, but I can if necessary.

She's seeing a psychologist, but here's the thing... It's making her worse... The way I see it, is psychological help is good, but they only see a one-sided story (Not my or my parents perspective). I think they're just working on the trauma and issues she raises, but not the BPD issues itself, which is a huge mine field of complexities which is obviously beyond my skills or anything.

My relationship with her is great, I've normally vibed with her and she comes to me to rant out or ask me for advice which is taken well, but I recently came to the conclusion that she most likely has BPD and is a very complex case. I really feel like I need to ""wake her up to this"" but I feel like my hands are tied as it's a slippy slope and I hate to see my sibling go through this or damage our relationship like how she has with her parents...",mentiononce,,False,1cpyq2a,1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cpyq2a/how_to_help_someone_with_bpd/

How to stop craving a relationship??,1715478860.0,"I've been feeling good for awhile, but now I feel like I'm circling the drain. I am constantly craving a relationship, and I want to find a partner(s) but I also don't want to feel this way. I know that getting into a relationship at this point would be impulsive and unhealthy, but I can't help but want to feel loved by someone who isn't a friend or a family member. So, the next best option would be to stop feeling this way, and I want to know how.

The reason why I feel this way: The only friend I talk to constantly is in a relationship, and it's one of the main things he talks about, constantly. Part of me feels left out, part of me feels unloved since he has partners and I don't. You can call it jealousy, but it doesn't feel like how jealousy normally feels.  
  
I'm also reading a bunch of romance novels, where the main character finds love. So, that's another reason why I'm craving my own romance.  
  
I'm also very pessimistic, and I always imagined myself with a boyfriend(s) in high school. Since, I don't have any, I'm always thinking about how I'm gonna end up dying alone or be alone forever.

Is it possible to have a 'stable' relationship?,1715474566.0,"I'm sorry for the bad translation, English is not my main language
I recently met a girl (19), she's the daughter of a friend, I'm 26.
 From the day we met, I felt there was good chemistry between us. At first, she was the one showing more initiative, but then she ghosted me.
 We talked a couple more times, and at a party, we let ourselves go and talked about starting a relationship. She said that since the day we met, she felt we connected, but she also told me about her daddy issues, the need she has to sexualize herself for attention, that she has BPD, and that she has self-harmed before. 
She asked me a couple of times if I was sure I wanted to be with her despite that, and I responded yes. I really like this girl, I feel like we connect, and I would like to have a serious relationship. 
The whole night went well between us, we had agreed to give it a try, and we made plans for the weekend. But the next day, she was distant, and 2 days later, we stopped talking. 
On social media, she sometimes posts hot photos, has sold content a couple of times, and on other occasions, she talks about her BPD and how the only person she has a good relationship with is her best friend and her mom. 
Maybe we'll see each other on Friday.
 The thing is: is it possible to have a 'stable' or 'serious' relationship with a girl with BPD and daddy issues? Is there any way I can help this girl? Should I just distance myself and forget about her?

Friendship fallout: Am I in the wrong or just difference of opinion here? ,1715449100.0,"Curious what people think of this specific situation. 

I am quite laid back when it comes to texting but my friend expects immediate or very quick responses. When I say I am laid back, I just mean I don't respond immediately in 5 minutes and I'm not someone who feels offended if they don't reply for a few hours (or even if they take a day or so). I often won't even see the text for a good few hours because I do work full time and am not always clung to my phone. 

He has said I mostly  take ""days"" to respond. Usually that's not true and when it has happened in the past there was a reason (I wasn't well)  which I apologised for. We also already spoke about this at length because he was offended at the time, and he appeared to be understanding and said he knows I respond when I can and the reason I was a bit quiet for a period of time- but now it feels like it's being thrown in my face so he's clearly holding a grudge about that. I apologised again that I did disappoint him that time and we were fine after that (or so I thought).

As a rule normally I make an effort to respond within the same day since then because I know for him it's important but it still feels like it's not good enough because it's not instant. 

It isn't that ""I've seen the text but couldn't be bothered"" it's a ""I was at work so didn't check my phone for hours, or I was out for the day, or I was sleeping, I didn't have data so WhatsApp didnt come through until I got home a few hours later"" - so to me these feel like just normal and understandable reasons for not getting back to someone within 5 minutes? We are adults and I feel like if you text me during the day and I get back to you in the evening then that's pretty good going? If it was urgent, I'd expect a phone call so I definitely know straight away. 

For example, last week he sent me a message asking if I was free, no context for why. I was sleeping at the time as I'd just got back from holiday, so it was about 4 hours later that I responded and apologised for missing his text, it was late by this point so I couldn't chat but I suggested "" I'm sorry I missed this text, should we talk tomorrow if you're free?"" And he didn't reply to this so I assumed that was a no. Then didn't hear from him for ages so ironically, he didn't reply to me 😆 (but it's a crime for me not to reply immediately). After I week I didn't hear from him so I reached out again, he threw this in my face and said he isn't going to reach out when I don't respond- so even though I got back to him a few hours later it is still unacceptable? I don't feel it is reasonable at all to expect me to reply immediately or else?

He also said if he messages me during the day and I reply in the evening that this is not good enough?  
However I can't promise to reply immediately, I could be at work or doing anything, I also don't have unlimited data and he uses WhatsApp, so if I'm out for the day that message might not come through until I get home. Is this not just normal and fair enough? There are lots of times I do reply instantly as well or like within an hour or so. 

I feel that he only wants to talk to me so he can offload his problems, so often wants to speak about it there and then maybe? So I'm not giving that immediate response he wants and that might be why he finds it so annoying because he wants to talk right this instant. I also fundamentally disagree that I should be available at all times and if I'm not then that makes me a bad friend. I wouldn't expect him to always be free. I feel like he won't respond to me out of spite even though if I did that to him he would kick off...

He's said he's not going to keep reaching out when it takes days to respond, but it's rare that I would take days, it's usually within 24 hours at the most. In the past when I knew I was not going to be able to talk I've sent a text in advance saying ""I'm really sorry I can't talk for a bit but I will reach out "" so they had advance warning that I couldn't have a 2 hour catch up at the drop of a hat for a while. He even said to me that he knows it is not fair to expect someone to speak at the drop of a hat so I thought it was all good. It feels like my needs aren't important and only his because HE needs to talk, so there's no empathy or respect for my time. To me that shows a lack of respect for me and only caring about himself and what HE wants. 

We normally have like 3 hour catch ups once or twice a week usually which I feel is quite a lot! He also doesn't text me that much anyway so it is interesting that he is so offended by it, we usually ""chat"" when we speak over video call, not back and forth texting. 
I also spoke to him (for like 3-4 hours) nearly EVERY DAY last year because of a very difficult situation he was in which I was more than happy to do to help, but of course speaking for hours a day was not going to be sustainable in the long term. I have a partner and my own life and work full time so it's just not possible. It's almost like all of the support I did show was just discarded the second I couldn't do what he wanted. I feel like he is focusing on the wrong things here, why not focus on the fact that I do give him a lot of my time, rather than me taking a few hours to respond? 

I don't expect to hear from him again but it's awkward because I work with him. He is extremely stubborn so if he has decided that I've done something wrong, he is unlikely to see where he might be being unfair too. So rather than meet in the middle it's like it is going to be his way or the highway. Ultimately I respect that maybe he just needs friends who are available 24/7, but I personally don't agree nor could I do that if I wanted to (but also how many people can promise this?) I think it's just difference of opinion. But it's like our whole friendship just thrown out the window for something I think he is being unfair about. And now I'm so upset thinking he just hates me now. At the end of the day if the friendship is not meant to be then it's not meant to be, but the backdrop of how supportive I've been it feels like I was just used and then discarded. 

I feel stupid and it's really triggered my abandonment feelings and I've even thought of not being here anymore as a result. How do you guys cope when someone turns on you like that and thinks they are in the right? I really don't feel I've done something wrong but it hurts to think he has just cast me off so easily because he expects me to reach unreasonable expectations.

How I restrained the urge to contact an FP.,1715445746.0,"So, a week ago this person expressed kindness to me. A fast track to them being my FP.

I will now recount how this fucked me up for a whole week.

# The Dysregulation

That night I cried for hours as if someone had died, because I knew I'd never really talk to them again. I did not sleep. I was awake all night. I couldn't stop thinking about them. I wrote them a letter. I edited the letter. I thought about the letter. I put the phone down to go sleep. My heart kept racing. I wrote a second letter because the first letter would've come off crazy. Thankfully, I had the foresight to know that the second letter was also crazy, although less so.

What do I mean by ""crazy""? I mean that, the fact that I wrote such a letter demonstrates how invested I am in making contact with them. Which is really off-putting and would feel imposing to that person, because they would feel a very tangible feeling in their body of being put-upon to then make contact in the way that I want them to. I noticed as well how suddenly manipulative my mind had become, to try and establish and maintain contact with them.

Imagine a postal worker calls you about a package and how to safely leave it at your house, and later that day you send them 8 paragraphs about how you'd like to know them. While this example makes it obvious, somehow this self-awareness is lacking in this state. I'd been in that state many times in my life so far, and I knew that I was lacking insight like that. I knew that I was basically fully delusional and that I needed to NOT actuate the actions I desired to. I had to put off contacting them.

So, I then got out of bed after having written these two letters and I went for a walk to try to get my mind off things. I did so many miscellaneous 'chill' things like that to try and calm down and stop thinking about them. I tried journaling many times, I tried meditating, I tried calling help lines, I tried eating, I tried masturbating, I tried sleeping, I tried dissociating...

I could go on. Just know, the whole week I've been fucked up and dysregulated.

# The Right Action

A few things I think were key to restraining myself from being a crazy person.

* **Reality-checking**. I used call lines. I wrote down facts. I wrote down social conventions. Not projecting an idealized fantasy onto the situation and ignoring the reality of it.
* **Self-awareness**. I had to be honest about what I was trying to get out of the situation. Observing the mind and what it is aiming to accomplish. How it schemes to get what it wants.
* **Mentalization.** Thinking about how they would respond to the letter in a non-idealized way, keeping in mind the way that they might think about their own needs.
* **Acceptance**. Accepting that what I wanted wouldn't happen. Letting go of clinging to them. Accepting that I am traumatized and this stuff does trigger me, and I can still choose to do the right/ best thing.
* **Reparenting**. The need I want this person to meet, which is maternal love and safety, I need to meet for myself. I use mindfulness and self-empathy to get the sense that this person isn't the ONLY way to make the bad feeling go away. I try to practice self-care.

# A Reifying Moment

I wrote on a piece of paper:

>I choose to live in a reality where <person> leaves, and I never hear from <them> again.

I then challenged myself to read it out loud. And I just broke down crying, sobbing, hyperventilating, bawling for a good while.

I felt how I felt about it, I couldn't just ignore it. The reaction had already happened.

Even now I wonder if I could have avoided letting it out and expressing it like that. As a man, it also feels pretty unmanly to do this which adds to that.

Well, I did let it out and express it. I'm self-helped enough to not judge it at this point. And after I had stopped blubbering, I felt like I had in large part accepted the reality of the situation.

# It's All Trauma

Here's an insight for you: I wasn't sad about this person leaving, about not being able to contact them. It had nothing to do with them. This is the CPTSD (many people with BPD have CPTSD as a causal factor) part of things. I was projecting a mother-role onto this person. I wanted them to be my mother. And the traumatized part of me experienced the reality of them not being a mother to me, and leaving, as a re-experiencing of what had happened in the past.

I'm still pretty fucked up about it, but after a while of successfully not acting on what I wanted to do, which would have been socially unacceptable and had bad outcomes for me, I viewed these urges as an opportunity to practice strengthening this skill. And I feel more confident in future situations to be able to connect more because if I do get triggered by that connection, it seems like I will have the opportunity to not ruin it. I had been avoiding connection for a long time because I felt it was hopeless.

The hopeless feeling that I often have is that this disorder ruins literally everything. I still correctly evaluate myself as fragile in these situations. And I correctly evaluate that people don't have a lot of patience for it. But, hey, this is a win. And for a week of my time, I'd say it was worth it still. Maybe next time I can get it down to 5 days.

How to evaluate PHP/IOP programs,1715445048.0,"My 25 yo son has BPD and generalized anxiety with extreme mood instability. He has been spiraling down for months now, feeling that his 40 hour/week job (which used to give him joy) is unmanageable timewise with ""all the other things I have to do"" (he has a dog...that's it). He just pursuaded his Psych office manager (not even his psychiatrist, who was not in that day) to put him out on medical leave because he can't manage anymore, and was given a list of 5 different PHP/IOP programs in the Denver metro area and told to put himself in one of them. The group does not have social workers or other personnel to help faciliate the process; he's on his own.

3 of the 5 programs on the list focus on substance abuse rehab (he uses THC but nothing else, and I don't think he abuses THC, but what do I know), and the 2 that don't have intensive outpatient therapy that is 3 hrs x 3 or 4 days/week. My questions to you all are:

BPD and Dreams ,1715442468.0," Hi guys, I recently saw a video saying people with BPD are more likely to remember dreams than those without Bpd because our dreams can feel really intense and vivid and when we wake up we still feel that intensity of our feelings. So I googled a little bit and also found that people with BPD also tend to have some increased trouble with dream-reality (though a lot of people can have this occur it just seems to be more pronounced for us) As in sometimes being unable to recall if something you remembered was part of a dream or if it actually did happen in reality. 

I for example depending can remember most but not all of my dreams because I tend to have very vivid and intense dreams. I can even randomly recall them hours later after waking up. Also because a lot of my dreams tend to emulate reality a lot, I will find myself saying “wait … I think that happened in my dream actually” but this doesn’t happen that frequently only once in a while. 

So now I’m wondering how true and accurate this information is. So my question to you guys is 1. Do you have really intense and vivid dreams that you’re able to recall soon as you wake up and maybe even later after waking up or not? And 2. Do you often times find yourself frequently being unable to discern whether a memory you are recalling is coming from a dream or reality?

I have a lot to mentally learn even tho it’s not a physical job. And I have to get up early every day and insomnia has always been a bitch to me since I was a kid. I have reached the point of sick where not getting enough sleep makes me fall asleep sitting up, get delirious, and even almost pass out. 

I recently was put on nortriptyline for nerve pain and it didn’t help I think it made it worse. It’s only been a few weeks and we’re tapering it down I have four more days of the lowest dose.

I’m completely overwhelmed because if I can do this job I lose my cats, my home, anything resembling my life. I feel like I should just kms if I can’t do this. I had to call off on day 5 of a new job that’s a shitty start as any.

Butttt now I’m wondering if the nortriptyline fucked me over mentally cause I am pretty sensitive to meds and this has happened before.

Anyone’s experiences with nortriptyline bad? I just need something to hold on to even if it’s not the medication’s issue so I can try to keep going.

If I can fight the mental breakdown then maybe I can sleep and do this job. Idk what to do other than that.

Tips on how to handle Husband's BPD blow ups,1715371940.0,"Long time lurker, first time poster!

ALSO I'm sorry if ""Blow up"" isn't the correct terminology-- it's what we call it at home so if there's a better word let me know.

But, inevitably, there will be a day where he gets mad at something that honestly doesn't even make sense to me and blows up.  Nothing I can say or do will calm him down.  He has NEVER been physically domineering, violent or aggressive with me-- it's always vocal.  Shouting and cursing-- telling me to f\*\*\* off or go f\*\*\* myself when I try to reason with him.

We will go weeks with no issues at all (aside from the normal -being with a person every single day and getting on each others nerves- thing) and then BOOM.

I just wondered if any of you kind folks who deal with these kinds of blow ups could give me some tips on how to react when it happens?  I've tried walking away, I've cried, I've begged him to stop, I've yelled back, I've left to stay with my parents-- nothing seems to work.

I feel like people only like me when I'm drunk,1715361536.0,"I guess I'm kind of torn on this viewpoint. On the one hand, when I drink I become a lot more sociable. I'm very introverted and awkward by nature (like, quiet and a bit off-putting / boring awkward, not shy) but a bit of alcohol in my system seems to spawn this whole Jekyll and Hyde situation where suddenly I'm able to strike up the most fluent conversations in the world -- it feels like even people I don't know too well genuinely WANT to talk to me. Maybe because they are also drunk. Probably because they are also drunk. But it feels like people avoid me like the plague when I'm sober, and that really gets to me. I have this one friend in my little group who I'd consider to be one of my closest -- they're on my frontline of people who I see as a sort of safety net -- but it feels like the only time they can tolerate hanging out with me one-on-one is when I'm drunk. And it is just solely a me issue, because right now they're hanging out with one of my other friends and I can see them on life360. Maybe that's why I'm going mental. I just feel very unimportant to them. They are very blunt about their feelings and they clearly have favourites within the group, which kinda hurts.

On the other hand, the people who are close to me hate it when I drink because I always go overboard. There's a sweet spot between being about as approachable as Sloth from The Goonies and ending the night with my head down the toilet -- the sweet spot being where I feel great and I can talk to anyone about anything without a care in the world. I always, ALWAYS go overboard and end the night violently throwing up. I say stupid shit, I spend 2 hours in the bathroom, I go home early and then I sober up with the most gut-wrenching suicidal ideation and the urge to break my year-long clean streak from SH (I hit the milestone a few days ago, very proud of myself).

And yet now it isn't as scary. Maybe I just got used to it happening at least once every time I'd be sent to the psych ward. But it feels like I'm safer restrained than left alone.

Often I'd bang my head on walls or rip flesh out of my arm with my teeth. I hate doing that it hurts as fuck I don't want to do if but it's like I can't think of anything else to do when I'm not okay. I guess at least I don't get to do those things when I get tied down and that's the part that I find better about it. In a way whenever they lock the door to the isolation room without restraints isn't scary anymore either. It's almost more comforting than if they leave the door slightly open. Sometimes when I don't feel okay I imagine myself on that bed and it's somewhat comforting.

How to save your relationships with anyone you care about? ,1715347415.0,I'm a 24 F and I've completely stopped on the idea of dating or even meaningful friendship because I will distance myself from them even before anything has happened or they've done anything to hurt me. I talk to new people sometimes on dating apps but after one or two good calls I seem to not care about them that part is still manageable to slowly let them down but the part when you begin to care about these people is hard because I don't know how to bring myself up to talk about BPD or my depression or how I want to talk to them but whenever I try to I fear their judgements or losing them. And mostly importantly I fear them using my vulnerabilities against me along with my past and all the dreadful things I did to myself. This community is the only place I feel safe. I don't even feel this way even when I'm with family in the beginning when I was diagnosed with my problems my family was supportive but the underlying thing always had been to get better how do I make them understand there is no getting better just managing it. And now all of them have grown impatient they're honesty stressing themselves for my condition that when will she be better but they never make me feel it's okay to feel this way. And it's hard seeing my parents hurt this way knowing im the reason for their worry. One time my father told me he'll die of a heart attack because of the stress I've caused him.

Now after 3 years of waiting I have finally gotten through to mental health care... it's been to say the least, disappointing. They quickly identified me as a bpd girlie (Noone is surprised) and since then, all I've experienced from the psychiatrists is passive aggressive slutshaming, getting talked down to and generally being treated sub human by the staff. 
I smoke weed to calm me down now, I used to be a heavy drinker and party drug abuser. Weed is the best choice I've had, there has been no help from anyone especially not the ""growing ups"" and now they tell me i need to quit completely for them to help me, not offering me any other kind of relief. My meltdowns are not a joke, they are not fun and they are definitely not something i can just like ignore.
I just don't know what to do, I don't trust the psychiatrists, they don't really even listen. The way they look at talk to me and then the nerve to tell me what to do in a situation they have never them selves experienced.... honestly I'm just so frustrated.

Okay SO long story long I'm 32. The first time I suspected I have BPD I was probably 22, if not younger.

I recently did a partial hospitalization which was really just a BPD crashcourse. I havent been in therapy for a bout a year and fell off dping the work on my own, so it was BIG fat wake up call/ refresher course. 

I've been talking about my thoughts a feelings a LOT lately as well as the meds they have me on and which ones I would rather try. 

The other day, while reading a peer review article about mood stabilizers for BPD, my mom got a little teary and started in on the ""I'm sorry I didnt believe you when you first started bringing up BPD. I feel bad because I could have done more. Etc etc""

SOOOO in the moment and for several days afterwards, I felt really relieved and grateful that her and I had that conversation. BUT the longer I sat with it, I started to hear what she said as ""you could have gotten help so much earlier. Your 20s could have been something other than a garbage fire. You could be stable now instead of still wanting to kys all the time. I can never care about you the way you need to be cared about"" and its just. So difficult to deal with. 

So basically my natural response was to take her at her word and to FORGIVE. But then its like my BPD kicked in, like it woke up from a nap or something. What the eff is going on in my brain? What are your thoughts?

And as an aside, I know pretty much everybody here has a bad relationship w/ their mother, if at all.

Anyway, back to the issue in question. Im having big trouble having anyone close to me. It makes me extremly anxious and makes me feel like im not safe. Like im a pray that got to hide. Probably an anxiety reaction. Because of this circumstance, im spending most of my time alone. Its not an issue for me to be alone. As you probaly already thought I prefer to be alone to not have this constant stress response (I'm not unhappy when I'm alone). It especially bad in my apartment. I can't let anyone into my personal space. If i still would let someone in im dissociating (like i did before i wrote this). It's very bad. The lighter version of this happens when someone wants to know more about me or gets close. This also instantly triggers a intense stress response i cant explain. If its constant, It can get so bad that i have to take time off(go to the doctor) to function again. The reason why im creating this post is because i would want to be closer to other people but its just not possible. My life would fall apart immediately. It all functions because im alone. When im alone stress is low. How do I feel safe when with other people? Does anyone else have similar experiences?

Sometimes I feel like he is my best friend and other times he is fine doing reasons to be upset with me or blame something on me. Even when I think I’m doing everything right, it’s still wrong. I’ve never been so confused and alone in my entire life. There have been times where he is just screaming at me some of the worst things I’ve ever heard. There  have been past instances where he has gotten upset and pushed me. There have been a few times where he repeatedly lunges at me with his fist like he’s going to hit me . But he doesn’t. I think it’s because he doesn’t want me to have any physical evidence on my body and I think he likes to hear me beg for him to stop.

He threw a drink in my face and called me a stupid bitch in front of the entire bar and his friends. and that was my last straw and things had been building up for a while.

the foot steps i hear is what makes it impossible. sometimes i see black figured too out of the corner of my eye. all of this only happens at night/darkness though. during the day i can face the wall/away from door no problem.

I recently relapsed after a few years clean and now every time she’s nonverbal I feel like there is no point in anything and if I harmed myself I would at least be able to see the punishment instead of feeling punished through clouds of guilty feelings that just fade in and out as I’m left with my thoughts and she keeps me in silence. 

Like, I know I’m being irrational and unreasonable but I just can’t help but feel unloved and neglected. I feel like I’m owed so much but at the same time, nothing, because it feels like I’m just a horrible partner. Because I feel so rejected I ignore her when she tries to touch me because it just feels like she pities me. She’s been nonverbal for about a day and a half now and I feel like ending it all.

FP is slowly abandoning me ,1715256165.0,"Two weeks ago, I checked myself into the ED because I had a plan for suicide that I intended to carry out that night, my therapist immediately knew something was up, and she said I could go myself or she’d call the cops to come get me. 

I spent a week in inpatient and now am in a PHP program. I had been in a bit of a fight with my FP prior (a trigger but not the sole reason for wanting to commit suicide) and he was completely ignoring me. So, I called on another good friend to let the appropriate people know where I was, so they didn’t worry if I wasn’t getting back to them. This included my FP. Everyone else that knew hopped on group chats, shared their worries, made plans for my release, went to my apartment to clean and stock groceries etc. When my FP found out he basically said, “I’m busy with my girlfriend, thanks for letting me know.” He never asked for any updates from anyone.

I did eventually call him from inpatient and asked him what his fucking problem was, to which he had a bunch of lame excuses. He then started calling me every morning, but made zero effort to visit and since I’ve been released has made zero effort to help out in any way or even spend time with me. 

I’m just at such a loss. I don’t understand what happened, and I can’t get my mind off of it. This used to be a guy who would always come through for me and it’s like HE split on me. My best guess is his new girlfriend doesn’t like that I exist and he took the coward’s way out of distancing himself. I do genuinely believe if I had gone through with killing myself he would have been relieved. 

Anyways, thank you for coming to my rant. I hope y’all have better FPs because mine sucks. ",laceybaghands,,False,1cnvkr0,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cnvkr0/fp_is_slowly_abandoning_me/

I know I probably don't have BPD, but?Ever since I could remember, I've glamorized my own depression.When I was 9 years old, I began hurting myself and threatening to kill myself for attention. I engaged in impulsive and risky behavior for the thrill and for attention. I'd create drama and start issues with other people simply because I wanted to, and I'd lie about stuff all the time. I'd always feel so depressed that my relationships would alternate between love and hate. I had mood swings, I was so happy and loved everyone one minute and the complete opposite the next. I never trusted anyone, and I always felt like people were going to leave me. I've always had this feeling that something bad happened to me that I can't remember.I was exposed to graphic things at a young age, and at age 10, I was always arguing and hitting, and I had major anger issues. I was acting crazy, and my parents thought something was wrong with me. I mirror personalities and I cling to people, and I don't know who I am or what I like. I shut down, and I get close to people, but never too close, because I don't want anyone to actually know me because then they'd hate me and know that I am actually a shy person who lies for attention. I also feel like I'm not actually mentally ill; I'm faking it for attention. It's just teenage hormones; I'll grow out of it, and I need constant reassurance. I have episodes where I hate everyone and I love everybody, and I feel so guilty. I know I'm a bad person, but this isn't even all of it, and I'm not even mentally ill, I abuse drugs to make it all stop and I am so impulsive, im scared someone is gonna leave me so I leave them before they can leave me but i always go back because i love attention. Ive always had this chronic feeling of emptiness since i was little as well.I'm 14. I'm not asking anyone to diagnose me because bpd is a very complex disorder and this might just be me faking it all but this isn't even all of what I feel. I know I'll probably grow out of it but I really just need some insight if it's just teen hormones or me being a shitty person or actual mental illness.

Today was really hard,1715226442.0,"I was diagnosed with borderline recently (been diagnosed bipolar, adhd for years). The combination of mood swings, depression, rejection sensitivity, and abandonment issues really came to a head today in my life. 

I do the majority of the household chores, as well as earning 75% of our income. I’ve been trying to get my husband to take more responsibility for mutual chores as well as get our spending under control. I brought these up today and he didn’t want to deal with it. I tried to go through the fair play cards with him, then he took them from me and wouldn’t give them back. He wouldn’t listen to a word I said. So ofc I did the most toxic thing possible and threatened self harm so he started ripping the cards up and told me he wanted a divorce or at least a separation and I needed to pay for him and his son to go somewhere. I’m broke. We spent all my money. I’m trying to rebuild my savings again and spent all day making a plan to do that so I really can’t afford that.

My heart broke when he asked for a divorce. I didn’t beg my ex husband to stay but I did beg my current husband. My sobbing and screaming was disturbing his son so I left to go on a walk. 

I literally have a diagnosis of intense fear of abandonment. I’ve had multiple suicide attempts due to abandonment and rejection. And so my husband decides to tell me he’s abandoning me and then thinks I’ll be able to handle it. I’ve been working on my coping skills but they definitely weren’t prepared for this.

I fantasized about kms but I want to be there for my beloved cats. I don’t want to hurt my family who has loved and supported me through my roller coasters. I called my mom to try and ground myself. I’m really proud that I’m still alive tonight.

I’ve blown up nearly all of my friendships thanks to bpd so I don’t have a huge amount of support.

Thankfully I have therapy and a psych appointment tomorrow. I’m thankful that I stayed (mostly) safe tonight. I’m grateful for the support and love of my family and my cats. ",incrediblewombat,,False,1cnny5s,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cnny5s/today_was_really_hard/

I wish I could of seen one of them before I left last week but it didn't happen. Made me a bit sad. That person was close in a way even tho I've not known that person for long. I know that person was unaware of me leaving since it was a super fast leave.

I had to leave fast. My ex found me and held a knife to my throat on camera where I was at until I figure out what to do. I knew he was looking for me. I really wanted to stay where I was but it wasn't possible when you didn't feel safe anymore. Plus being homeless with 2 dogs wasn't easy either. 😕  

I'm hoping I will be able to see this person sooner rather than later. Fuck even to talk to that person for awhile might even help me relax. We are in 2 different time zones now. That person is 2 hours behind and I'm ahead. Maybe this person has a calming effect on me. 
Hopefully we can figure out a way to communicate talking wise.

i’m new to this. ,1715221245.0,"For years i’ve been undiagnosed with BPD. I’ve gone through multiple mental health programs, spent my fair share at mental hospitals. Not until I recently went to a psychiatrist were they able to diagnose me and for once I felt like the puzzle piece fit. I’ve been  misdiagnosed my whole life and it never felt right, the medication I was put on for depression and anxiety helped me for when I was manic and I felt on top of the world. But when one thing happens, one trigger happens. My whole world crashes down. My psychiatrist reccomended DBT therapy and i’m going to start in 6 months. I don’t know if i can go that long with the state i’m in right now. 

I hate that men are always the triggers for my episodes. I meet someone, we have chemistry, I feel like this person is perfect. They fall in love with me everything is okay. Then i get attached, i get this fear of abandonment the same question we have all asked before “do you still love me?” “do you want to leave me?”. I’ve seen numerous anonymous people saying how this is draining and when their partner repeatedly asks these questions they get annoyed. I never mean to be annoying. I never mean to set someone off the wrong way. 

I get into a relationship, they figure out who i am, and then they leave. I can’t blame anyone else but the people i grew up with. The numerous counts of childhood trauma i went through and the amount of bullying, people walking out of my life, mental health struggles I had already dealt with. It’s not even just family who have walked out of my life or made me feel guilty for things I should’ve never felt guilty for. It is friends, people i fell in love with who walk out of my life with no answer as to why. Leaving me clueless. 

I don’t know if I was born this way, maybe if i grew up a different way I could be loveable in a way? Maybe i wouldn’t have to walk on egg shells and constantly overthink about every single word they say and cry to myself without wanting to worry them. But a part of me deep down, wants them to worry, i crave that attention. I crave the comfort the reassurance, the physical touch. Which i never receive. I recently decided to start dating this guy i’ve been close with for three years. We hit it off dated for around 2-3 months. Then we got into an argument, and he’s never dealt with someone who thinks harder 10x more than a person without BPD. He gave up on me, he left. And my friends keep telling me to not only blame him, to not hate him but. It’s what i was trained to do. Once they leave I have to hate them or else I will blame myself entirely and I don’t think i have the mental strength for that. 

I just wish I was normal. I wish i didn’t have to take all these medications where I don’t know what i’m putting in my body. At this point, i’m not even doing it to get “better” i just want to be loveable, and i don’t know if that will ever be possible.

Sexual abuse? ,1715202415.0,"I went through it when I was young, however I don’t know if it’s sexual abuse. 

Our family’s knew each other since kids so naturally me and him knew each there since kids. We were really good friends and done everything with each other. Slept over every night, hung out till god knows how late, played games, talked about all sorts of shit. All the way till we started getting older and maturing, we ended up going different schools but still hung out. Obviously we got to a point we stopped talking but a majority of our kid and teen years we were close. 
He matured pretty fast when it comes to watching porn (8-9years old), unfortunately he made me watch it too. He was young and jt twisted him, to the point he would drag me along and convince me to try things. Things I didn’t wanna do but did anyway. And it kept happening more and more till we had done all of it. Thing is I never stopped it, I kept on going with it even though during the time I wasn’t necessarily okay with it. There was never force or “rape” so I guess it wasn’t as bad as most people’s sexual abuse. But it happened and changed me. I only started realising the damage later on though, I was so focused on BPD and figuring that out I didn’t know the answer to my sexual trauma. Took me a while. Seems pretty clear now. 

But still, this left a scar on me. It changed me whilst I grew up. I became addicted to porn and my sexual desires and orientation started changing, I was so ashamed and disgusted in myself. But I couldn’t help it. It got worse and worse and it in other words ruined me, giving me fucked up fantasy in my head that I wanted to happen to me, rape in other words. I don’t know why I wanted things along those lines. 
Plus at a younger age (3-4) I have memories of my dad, I don’t know if they’re real but still. That could play a role too. 

I’m a straight male, in a relationship with a great girl. But I’m still damaged from that. 
I don’t even know if I could say I was abused, you guys could say I wasn’t and that’ll be okay but I just wanted to put it out there to hear opinions. There’s a part of me that feels like a fraud. 

And yes I know this has nothing to do with BPD, but I do have BPD too and obviously struggled with that since birth.

(30F) I’ve completely ruined my relationship and I’m terrified. ,1715189257.0,"He (37M) literally wants nothing to do with me. He’s been wanting nothing to do with me. He broke up with me in December, one of the most painful break ups I’ve ever experienced, only because I love him so much and he’s such a good man. 

But he says not only does he not love me, but I don’t love him. I’m not capable of loving someone properly. I’m just selfish for wanting him to not leave me and I don’t genuinely care about his happiness. Which, I guess is partly true. 

I want him to be happy, I’m just completely destroyed that I don’t and can’t make him happy. I don’t have family to fall back on, I’ve never experienced secure love and I’m so terrified to lose him. 

We ended up getting back together because I found out I was pregnant. I’m not going to lie—I prayed I would be pregnant, I just wanted a reason to live and have something to love and love me back. I guess I was being selfish again. 

I didn’t try to baby trap him, it had happened while we were still together in November and I was on birth control, I even took plan B if I accidentally missed a pill. But plan B doesn’t work if you’re ovulating. 

He did agree to getting back together for the child, but the focus would be the child. I’m currently 6 months, we have moved in together and I thought I was doing better emotionally and mentally, but I have my slip ups. I haven’t started medication because I’m scared of the effects on my future son, but I know I need it. 

But it’s gotten to the point that he wants to break up and just be roommates. It doesn’t matter what I say or do. I would always check on him and ask if he was okay, or if he was feeling trapped, or if he was resenting me—and he’d respond that he’s happy and he wasn’t. T

Today, he said everytime he said that when I would check in on how he was feeling, was a lie. He lied to keep the peace. He still resents me. He’s willing to coparent with me, but that’s pretty much it. 

My mother is an alcoholic, my brother just died in Feb and my dad chose his wife over having me in his life (I didn’t understand why it had to be a choice, I don’t understand why he couldn’t have a relationship with me outside of her, but here we are. No contact). 

I’m just beyond horrified. I know my abandonment issues, my suicidal thoughts, my insecurities are nobody’s problem but my own. But I don’t know what to do with these feelings that plague me. I’m currently crying in a dark room at work and relapsed with self-harming to self soothe.

BPD In A New Relationship,1715184512.0,"Using my throwaway account because my girlfriend follows my main one. 

I've been with my girlfriend for over a month now, and my BPD symptoms have never been this bad in a long time. 

I've become so overly sensitive and my mood swings are getting out of hand (I'm going to be going back on mood stabilizers and hopefully antidepressants ASAP). 

This is my first relationship with a woman and there are a lot of times I feel insecure about how pretty and talented she is, especially when it comes to doing hair and make up (she has curly hair, something I've wanted for as long as I can remember). 

I've also noticed that she doesn't take pictures with me much anymore, but she will take selfies right infront of me which bothers me for some stupid reason. 

One more thing I've noticed is the past couple times when she comes home from work, she will be on her phone (mostly social media) a majority of the time, even after sex. 

I'm not entirely sure if I'm just overthinking all of this, and I don't really want to talk to her about it because I've already talked about so many things that bother me and I feel like I'm already coming off as ""crazy"", overly emotional, or possessive. 

She also doesn't text as often as she does when we aren't together. I know as relationships go on and you get out of the ""homwymoon phase"", things slow down a bit as you get more comfortable, but I'm still so attached and feel like she's losing feelings. 

I'm already feeling like this relationship isn't a good idea, like I should just be single. But I don't want to throw away a relationship that does have a lot of good because of my stupid mental illness.

Rejected by potential FP,1715177498.0,"I hooked up with this guy who, I gave little to no thought to prior. I knew he existed but I didn’t care.. we work in the same industry so I would see him around but never intentionally. The other night we hooked up in the midsts of me being in the middle of my alone, depressed, looking to feel something cycle and I went back to his and found out he had so much in common with the girl I was when I was the happiest. Naturally, I began to idealize and fantasize about us and about how being with him I’d go back to my former self. I even wrote an entire blog post about the feeling of love I felt and the reconnection to my self. 

Last night I go to one of our events and he’s there because he always is at that event. And im excited to see him because I made it up in my mind that we’ll see each other and go home together and I can feel that love all over again.. When I get there my group is right next to his and I get a front row seat to him the entire time.  I was so nervous to see him and talk to him I waited until I was good and tipsy to go say hi. There was a momment when we were outside, him smoking, and me going greet a friend where time slowed and our eyes met but I didnt say hi.

When I did say hi, he was in the middle of talking and breifly acknowelged me before some girl pulled me into a conversation. It was the same girl who I saw him talking to earlier in the night.

As the night wined down and everyone was leaving I sent him a txt asking if he was going home after this, he responded “hey, hey, yes.”

I had already called my uber and was hoping he’d say lets go together before it arrived. I saw he posted on his story instead of responding to my message of “want to go back together?” (we live fairly close.) 

39 minutes had passed so in my uber I unsent the message and an hour later, I liked his message and then sent another. This morning, I wake and he didnt even read it.

Im so disappointed. Everyone was complimenting me on how good I looked last night but he didn’t even give me the time of day.

I was so inspired by him, he had me writing again, I went to go pick up some of my favorite things from that time yesterday and was on such a high because I was reminded of all the things I used to love.

Now in the after math im wondering and questioning so many things about myself. 

But im trying to tell myself over and over, im still with me… his reaction and response to me doesnt change all the good I reminded myself about myself.

We’ve been married 3 years. He meets 6/9 of the  criteria listed on the NIMH website. 

We had a nice life, mostly. Bought a home, decent jobs, etc. He has admitted he’s had a better quality of life with me than ever before, felt like he was doing well in life. He is an alcoholic. He was in recovery but has relapsed. Last week I learned of his ongoing affair, I don’t know if there were others before this one. 

This feels like the ultimate in self sabotage behavior. And I’m so dumbfounded by it. The other behaviors I can rationalize abstractly related to his past traumas. But to torpedo our entire life has me flabbergasted. The marriage is over, just a matter of paperwork and division of assets, cheating is my line in the sand. 

Can anyone offer insight to the self sabotage behavior? Like how that would make sense for him, cause it’s like a foreign language to me.

"loml with bpd broke up, she doesn't seem okay - help?",1715172136.0,"i'm an (ex) partner of someone with bpd. we were in a relationship for about a year and best friends for two years. i'd like to think that we managed her bpd well and coped together in a healthy way, even though it did get super overwhelming, she was healing and so was i as well (i dont have bpd, and im autistic and went through a huge period of autistic burnout from external life things) and we wanted to spend our lives together.

then out of nowhere, she broke up with me - when 2 days ago she was reassuring me that she didn't want to leave me just cause things are getting busy (we both started university and our routine was shifted); and a week before that; she was crying in my arms about how she didn't want us to break up / take a break. i guess i should've taken these as signs the thought was on her mind, but i thought she was worried and wanted reassurance.

what happened next is she asked for a break - because she ""wants to figure herself out"" (even though she said she loved me a few hours before that) and she's overwhelmed. someone told me she might have been cheating with some potential evidence, so i confronted her, and she fully broke up with me then - saying i deserve better and she cant give me the stability i need, but she still wanted to be friends, and still kept saying she's not interested in anyone else, so on.

you can probably look at my profile and see some other posts i've made about this, which might add more context. the fact that she wanted to stay friends, which is super out of character with how she treats her exes. i went no contact 2 weeks ago because she was telling me about people flirting with her and acting nonchalant and ignoring me for days then suddenly texting me all the time and i was hurting a lot, talking like anxiety attack for the past 2 months of this whole situation a lot.

i tried to talk to her and ask her why she's treating me like that, and i said she's not acting like herself, and i'm worried and she's hurting me with what she's doing. but she said ""i dont think im acting different, i think our dynamic has changed"" (which sure i get but she's not talking like herself fullstop), and i was like okay, i was just checking in, goodnight. we haven't texted since

but the thing is, i still love her - and i promised her and i mean that promise with every part of me, that i won't go and i'll always be there for her. i love her deeply. she's just been acting not herself at all - she found a new friendgroup of guys at the gym and she's constantly with them (even though they also stress her out a lot), she stopped talking to half our mutual friends, she's putting our spotify playlist back on her profile then taking it off again, and i'm just really confused.

i want to know if i should reach out again, or if i should stick to no contact. when we broke up, she said ""honestly when i think i figure myself out i'll want to reach out again, but that won't be for a long while"".

it's been 2 weeks of no contact. i'm scared she'll forget about me and i'm also scared she's self-sabotaging and avoiding processing her feelings. i don't how what to do

(also the no contact isn't to get her back - she just kept hurting me and i dont think she understood the consequences of that i guess? and talking to her hurts but not talking to her hurts the same. everyone said NC should help me so yeah)

i love her so bad and its been 2 months - i've never hurt this much over a relationship before. i really thought we could've worked it out and all she had to do was choose me and we would've figured it out. i want her back, but i also don't want to overwhelm her and in conclusion idk

BPD wife - Feeling stuck ,1715143942.0,"Hey, 

My wife & I had known each other as friends for over a decade. We were quite close but dated other people. She was in a long term relationship with a guy who she eventually married. 

Around 5 years ago, I was going through a bad breakup, and started seeing my current wife at the time a little more often. We had feelings for each other when we were friends, and we started having an affair. I was waiting for my relationship to end & didn't care, and she always insisted her partner never treated her right and she was deeply in love with me. 

During this time period, she was the most understanding friend, & partner. For a guy who always had difficulty opening up, she made everything feel natural, and brought a level of emotional security I had not experienced from women I had dated before. 

Early 2019, after I broke up with my then girlfriend who was living with me. I traveled to another country, and my current partner was traveling with her then husband to another country. 

As I was reeling from the drama of my ongoing breakup, my current wife started opening up about what was happening in her marriage. She told me she was being physically abused for years by her partner. She described in detail some incidents between them which escalated into him physically & sexually assaulting her. She would keep saying ""I would just be sitting there crying, and he would yell at me, abuse me"" etc. She mentioned every day with him there was abuse and she often feared for her life. 

I was completely shocked and taken back hearing this. Having had no personal experience with anyone going through physical abuse, hearing all the things happening between two people that you only see in movies was hard to digest. 

So as the days went on, she shared more and more details of all the escalations between them and how it would end up in abuse for her. I kept asking if she had shared this with anyone, and what support she has gotten. She would tell me she's never told this to anyone because everyone would think she's crazy etc. 

So one day, as I am in another country, and she's back in the US. She texted me that partner wanted to go out drinking and he's furious, and that she is fearful for her safety. At the moment, It seemed like she was in imminent danger, so I asked her to leave and go to a friend's place. She said she didn't want to trouble anyone, so I quickly called my roommate (my ex and I lived with roomies) and asked if she could come stay over for the night. He agreed since he knew her from before as well, and I let her know she could stay in the room me and my ex were sharing till she figures out a way forward. 

I was going to be out of the country for a few weeks anyway, and my ex and I were figuring out the breakup logistics, and my partner moved in and made herself home. She would tell me daily how much she was suffering, and how much my relationship with her meant to her. In between some painful fighting with her ex, she would send me sexy pictures, she would dress herself in my clothes. I would find some of this very weird, but seeing the delicacy of her situation wouldn't say anything. 

Then one day, she told me she had finished packing up all my ex's stuff from our room for me so I don't have to go through that when I come back. I found this to be super weird again, and didn't find the courage to say anything. 

So around this time she started talking of life with the two of us together and all the dreams we could built. My own fear of being alone coupled with the emotional void she was filling, I was also getting more involved. 

A few days had turned into weeks and she was talking of wanting to stay and move within a few days of me coming back. The day I came back we had a lot of sex, the next few weeks her love, love making, showering of affection everything was insane. I was swept away. 

One of the days, maybe a couple of weeks into us sleeping with each other, I remember her distinctly trembling in the night, at first I thought she was cold, but turned seemed like she was having nightmares. I tried to wake her up, and hold her, but she violently pushed me away, and told me not to touch her. I immediately got up a little shook at being physically pushed like that, and was trying to figure out what was going on. For the next hour or so, she was in this state, crying, slowly, saying things like ""is this how you love me, you hurt me, make me feel better"" and no matter what I said or did, the crying, and the message of I'm not doing something would follow. 

The next morning, completely perplexed at what had transpired, I was a little quite and slowly brought up the topic. She said she was triggered by something I said or did, and that's how it affected her. From that point, it's almost like her tone, demeanor changed towards me. She started telling me how I've always been insensitive, how when we were friends I never supported her, how I didn't understand all the indirect ways she tried to tell me what was going on with her. I was a little dumbfounded and unclear on how to respond, so I was trying to half defend half acknowledge some of those things did happen. 

This pattern continued for a while, where something I do or say or didn't do or didn't say would trigger her, and it would start a meltdown lasting the entire night. Any and all. Attempts at reaching her would lead to further escalation. She would go lock herself in the bathroom/closet/anywhere and cry loudly. For hours. And if I didn't respond or react, come out telling me how much I've hurt her, how much pain I cause her. 

At some point later, she told me her ex's abuse had affected her and she was dealing with it. But it was my responsibility to learn how to deal with a complex woman like her. (And I took it seriously at the time). My lack of self esteem, and want to experience the high of the relationship that existed before, I set out trying to put my needs behind hers. 

I'm trembling as I write this, I have no idea why I've put all this out here. I'll write the rest if there's something here. Thank you for being witness to a part of what's been the hardest moments of my life.

Would I be the asshole if I didn't tell my girlfriend I cheated?,1715142410.0,"I (20F) am a lesbian and my girlfriend is 19F. We have been together for over a year but broke up for some time in the middle.

Due to trauma, I struggle hard to make friends. Recently made a friend (say, her name is M (21F)) who invited me to party, and I ended up cheating. The guilt I'm feeling is honestly immense. 

My therapist listens a bit to Esther Perel on there being reasons that we cheat and that I had been complaining a lot about lack of emotional intimacy in my relationship. The friend, M, kind of swept in and started offering me love, connection, etc. and it's been a bit overwhelming/intense but I feel drawn to it and curious. I did set boundaries on us being just friends. 

My therapist says I don't need to tell her immediately because that would be acting hastily/selfishly. It feels wrong to continue the friendship with M if I do that but I don't wanna end it. I feel guilty and wanna tell her and maybe just see everything crash and burn but that might be the part of me that sees M as the person who's gonna provide me with the attention I crave. 

Everything feels confusing and I know it's my fault how much this sucks that this is not a good situation and all options suck. I don't wanna hurt my gf immensely which feels like it could/would happen no matter what I do. 

Edit: I think I have decided, I know I can't end up the hero in any scenario but what if I did the following?

1. Tell this friend we can't talk or hangout. (Unfortunately we have a difficult class together so I do have to see her at least 3-4 times per week)

2. Wait the 12 remaining days of school to tell my GF.

I feel like such a fraud & I hate it,1715128882.0,"Whenever I take a photo of myself, it HAS to be with a Snapchat filter. I absolutely hate how I look without one. But I feel like a fraud when I do that. I feel like the me in the photos is me. But I look in a mirror & I hate who I see. 

The filters I use on Snapchat I feel just heighten my appearance & smooth out my skin. But that’s it. I don’t photoshop my pics or anything else. I just feel so much more beautiful & worthy with the filter. Doesn’t that make me a fraud though? A catfish? Cause my mom even tells me that some pics don’t look like me but people I’ve talked to on FaceTime have told me that it does look like me.

 Idk what to believe & I’m so self-conscious. I don’t want to be a fraud but I hate what I see without filters. Is anyone else like this? Is this common with BPD?

It’s awful cause again I also want them to be happy but I’m bitter and hateful that their happy ending doesn’t include me and if I’m honest I wish everyday I could sabotage their new relationship so they can come back… I never would cause that’s awful to do or think about… guess they were right when they said I was awful.

"I quit pills and therapy, and I'm doing ok. I'm a little bit scared",1715127054.0,"Hi! I have been in therapy and taking pills since I was 15. Now I'm 23. Of course it wasn't easy; I had different therapists, psychiatrists and medication, several suicidal attempts and ideation. But last year I had to quit because I couldn't continue afford it. To do so I had to plan to stop taking the medication gradually. 

Months later, this February I had a suicidal attempt. But it was different. First, the months before I was maniac, i.e. made a lot of big expenses on unnecessary stuff. Second, the days before were really depressed. Third, and in consequence, it was not impulsive as always, I planned it and searched for help. The help didn't come, at least not as I expected, so I decided to ""sleep forever"" (that's how I used to referred to it). Finally, when the meds started to kick I realized that I was going to die, and I was so fucking scared, that I think that changed my entire perception of my own life.

For the first time in my life I had to face this situation all alone, before and at the hospital I was alone. And after I was kind of alone because only my dad came to help me, but he is... you know, not a supportive, caring dad. So I was alone too. My mom lives in another city, so she was present only by phone. And the rest of my family, that have been always be with me didn't do anything, not even call.

Context: I used to live alone because no one wanted to live with me in this city, which is where I study civil engineering. And that is because bpd.. you know what I mean.

After that, a lot of ""external"" things happened. The most relevant is that I went live with my grandmother, which was chaotic at first because I had to face several opinions of my family, but they didn't hit as always.

And now is when I talk about what has changed; I have been able to distinguish between what is useful and what just hurts me. Like opinions, family members and activities. i.e. 

- Now I only see ""the rest"" of my family once per month, I used to go see them a lot. Now I listen to what they say, but don't pay a lot of attention to it, at least when it starts to hurt.

- I uninstalled Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Which provides me another perspective of life. I know it sounds weird, but now I have more deep conversations with my friends via WhatsApp or in person.

- Not having that kind of social media also helped me focus more on school. My grades have never been higher.

- I take breaks when I need to, and have a healthy relationship with parties. Or at least I think so haha.

And now I wonder, Is this a real change? Like, Am I actually better? I don't want to wake up tomorrow not feeling good enough to make my life as normal as it has been since then. Literally.

Now my relationships are normal, I am even re-meeting a person, and I say re-meeting because the first time was a few months before all of this happened. It didn't work out then, but now the things just flow perfectly.

What do you think? Have you ever experienced this before? What should I expect to happen?

PD: English is not my native language so sorry if anything is confusing.

Sometimes I apologize for speaking or when I feel like I’m being too much. Sometimes I ask him if he’s okay or if I’ve done something wrong too often and it upsets him which scares me into thinking he’ll leave. I’ve gotten better at not asking as much bc it makes him mad when I ask so often, but sometimes I can’t help it. I think this is better at least than my last fp.

I am also bipolar and I’ve had a lot of upset and downs since that assessment and in some ways I am doing much better, but unfortunately this is not true with my BPD traits.

I think I appeared calm and reserved on the outside so I guess I coped with the actual interaction okay, but now what do I do with my anger and rage? I exploded at my partner who understands that I get seriously dysregulated and I guess being able to vent to someone I trust helps, but I just want this cycle to stop. Does anyone else experience this with family where they think you are just being quiet but actually you feel disembodied in their presence and full of rage afterwards no matter how the interaction goes?

At first I really tried to smile more,  look less cold and be more wise with my choice of words but I’m really tired now, I just want to be able to protect my peace and myself.

Is anyone else struggling with their identity ,1715063477.0,"Does anyone else just absolutely hate that they have no idea who they truly are? 

I genuinely feel such shame and anger when I realize I’m a grown adult with no clear depiction of who I am, or what I love, or my core values. I am constantly in a battle in my head of who I am or who I’m meant to be. 

I see people on social media, which yes I’m aware is a mistake in itself, but they just look content in who they are. They share their interests, they show off their faces and accomplishments, and I’m just existing. I probably look like a mystery to others because I never post  about school, work, friends, family, etc anymore.. but really it’s cause I’m ashamed of how little I have going for me, and I feel like a fraud. I’m not that girl with the filter or angles or good lighting. I’m not happy or doing cool things all the time. 

I’m having this huge identity crisis because I always adapted to the people around me, and I have a fear of perception so I just took on others ideas of me or interests. I can’t tell if I actually WANT a degree and house with kids and husband, or if I just think I do because I was raised to think that way. I can’t tell if I’d be bisexual or lesbian or straight. If I hate men or am just tired of being hurt. If I love a band because I genuinely think they’re good or if it’s because my ex loved it and I pretended to like it. 

Sometimes I don’t recognize myself in the mirror or in pics. I don’t feel real, I don’t look like a normal person. But then I think I’m so egotistical and selfish to even think of myself as different than others and about myself. I hate that I know people who just KNOW who they are and don’t try to pretend. They just know they like to smoke weed and play video games all they. They are content with working a barely livable income and chilling at home all day. They just know they’re meant to be a nurse and have kids. They just know they’re a transgender. I have NO freaking clue who I am. Who I’m into. What I truly love doing without change. Who I’ll be in the future, and who i was in the past. 

I miss the person I was when I look back at my past, but then I see videos where I was just as miserable and chaotic, I just fooled myself looking at it now thinking things were better. 

At this point I don’t know where I’m going with this, I guess I just needed to vent because I really wish I had a clear understanding on who I was and had a set identity. Or maybe deep down I know who I am, and I just hate her. I hate the indecisiveness and incapability of being more. Idkkk. Does anyone relate? Goodnight.

How to deal with being cheated on?,1715048614.0,"I feel like I’m losing my mind over this..

My boyfriend and I had a lot of ups and downs. Well, mostly downs.. he cheated (the girl I didn’t need to worry about 🤡), paid for “custom content”, and overall seemed to have some sort of porn addiction and paid a lot of money for that, even though we said no porn in the beginning of the relationship.

I even recorded him an 8 minute lewd video with all of his likes and kinks, just for him. I’ve put a lot of effort into it.. and shortly after that he wanted to commission custom stuff from some OF thot..

How do I deal with this? It’s killing me. I am so insecure about it.. why was my video and all the other pictures I always sent not enough? I have done everything for this man and I keep doing everything. I cross boundaries for him, I do stuff for him that I told myself I’d never do again. But it wasn’t enough…

He keeps saying he’s changed now, I am the only one for him now. But.. how do I believe it after all the lies and cheating?

It’s 4 am and I’m once again crying about this…all my life I’ve never been enough, I’ve always been the second choice. And no matter how calm I try to stay about this.. I cant. I just can’t. And the worst part is that no matter what he says about this, no matter how much proof he shows me that I’m the only one for him now.. I can’t shake off the feeling that he’s still doing it behind my back and just hiding it better now.

And of course I can’t break up! Every time I tried I crawled back to him because my heart just loves this man with every cell. I have forgiven him the worst he could have done to me.

A text I’m happy I was able to send my therapist recently:,1715023956.0,"I am feeling a lot better about everything, now.  

I had a deep meditative session yesterday. 

Then I listened to some of the Audiobook ""Untethered Soul"" (at .7 speed it's hypnotic, even when quite sober) and I had some nice closed eye visuals (photographically crips scenes; hyper-realistic.) 

I was able to find myself grateful for the wonderful things I get from all of my relationships while realizing t
hat it's pure ego for me to insist that others fulfill *any* need of mine that I can (in fact) meet myself.  

Or even if I can't, it’s still not up to me to assign responsibility for me to anyone without consent.  

No matter how small and reasonable it is, in my mind, or how it would be perceived by someone else.

It's ME assigning meaning to the actions that I'm hoping to force others to perform FOR me for me to accept that others love me. 

It's a little narcissistic.  

If I find myself having a hard time letting go of another person's ""failure"" to meet some pedestalized ideal which I voluntarily hold that they don't even understand I'm thinking of that way, through fears formed primarily by what I imagine I might think of others if they described tolerating the same circumstance I have in mind. 

But since that's voluntary, I can choose the alternative; to stop doing that.  

Yeah, I imagine I'd be happier if I could get all the little comforts I want, but I'd just want more.  The particular things I made so important and meaningful would fade and others would take their place.  

I wouldn't grow. 

Instead, I can keep tabs on my own reactions and delve into how to meet my needs, someone important doesn't take it upon themself to do some thing that I WANT but don't NEED them to do, when I'm being honest with myself. 

Which means that I'm still going around trying to justify my being dishonest with myself.  

I'm sure it will take some time to fully embrace these self-teachings, but now I don't feel like I have to feel guilty for ""letting"" my someone treat me"" in a way I felt I couldn't be proud of.

Weird night ,1715029296.0,"
Tonight has been kinda crazy so far. 20 mins ago I was crying my eyes out because one of my friends had been ignoring me for 5 hours yet was messaging in another groupchat, another friend I was messaging and they were responding instantly and I was scared they would get annoyed and just stop and leave, and another friend told me they had to go soon because they wouldn’t have wifi - I felt like I was extra sensitive to my abandonment issues. And then I noticed that the groupchat became very lively after I had stopped messaging in it because prior I kept sending messages and posts and stuff trying to start a conversation. 

And then it all changed literally within an instant. My friend mentioned to me that they were unable to get a walking stick because they didn’t have the funds. I’ve sent them stuff in the past so I had their address and I was so quick to get on to amazon to order a walking stick for them. I did it and it was only after I did it that I realised I probably should’ve asked if that would be okay as I had never ordered them stuff from Amazon before, I didn’t wanna creep them out. 

Anyways yeah they were fine with it and thanked me profusely. It felt very euphoric, it made me so happy to be able to help out my friend and it changed my mood within an instant. And then I was back to messaging in the groupchat and sending posts etc even though only a few minutes prior I had vowed to never talk in that chat ever again.

“When I am whole I am strong”.

Enough to carry

Possible hallucinations?,1715011544.0,"Anyone who has had hallucinations before, do you think it’s possible to be self aware that you are hallucinating, or that the things you’re experiencing probably aren’t real? In the past during high stress periods of my life, I’ve had auditory and visual hallucinations..and right now I’m experiencing a similar stressful time and I think they’ve started again. For example, three nights ago I was home alone while my fiancé was at work. I was in my upstairs bathroom peeing in the dark with just my phone light, and started to hear what sounded like a woman talking, kind of how it sounds when someone is talking on the phone off in the distance.. but it was as if it was right below my bathroom window. I then started to hear male voices, and I texted my fiancé asking if he was home and had maybe come back with some friends. He said he was still at work, so I started to seriously panic. Our closest neighbor is at least a football field away so I knew it wasn’t them, or shouldn’t have been them especially in my backyard at 11 pm. I started to get that feeling when you know something bad is going to happen, like the hair on your body stands up..and I was pressing my ear against the wall trying to hear what the people were saying but it was like muffled sounding. I was too afraid to turn on the light or look out the window because I felt like if people were trying to break in, they would see me. Idk that sounds dumb now lol. Anyway, my fiancé told me to call 911, so like thirty minutes later some officers came to look around our property and didn’t find anything (obviously that would be enough time for people to leave though)… my fiancé got home a little later and I was able to sleep..but the next night I started to hear the same thing. This time my fiancé was home and ran in the bathroom, but looked at me and told me he didn’t hear anything. He went and looked outside and there was nothing.. that’s when it occurred to me that maybe I really just was hearing things, especially since it happened last night too. I’ve also been seeing shadow figures in my peripheral vision, but when I look obviously nothing is there. I told my fiancé I’m probably just seeing and hearing things because of stress, but he said “idk I think if you were hallucinating, you wouldn’t be aware of it..you would be convinced it was real”. I get what he’s saying, and in the moment it does feel real, but does me being able to interpret what is probably happening make it not actual hallucinations? Hopefully that makes sense, and sorry for the novel. ",ManagementRelative96,,False,1clmryd,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1clmryd/possible_hallucinations/

Do I think people without BPD have a more painful illness than I? Not necessarily, maybe people with OCD..? I don’t feel like I’m in pain every single day, even when I’m in a relationship.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 3 years now, and lately i’m becoming a bit worried for myself and him as I feel like he’s the only thing on this earth that matters. If I didn’t have him I would have nothing and be nothing and just not want to keep going. It sounds really bad and selfish but that’s just how I see the world. However I believe i’m being too dependent on him and I don’t want him to think i’m clingy and crazy because of this. When I feel super depressed I get in my head that the only one that can help me and fix it is him and when I can’t see him for him to help me I get really angry and am close to hurting myself. I feel like because of this i’ve grown a really unhealthy attachment to him and I dont want to drain him and bring him down because of this.

I have recently left my husband. I told him I wanted a divorce and I was done. This took alot of courage for me and I have stewed over this for the last 2 years as I am a SAHM of our 3 kids. He has completely neglected me and our children for the last 8 years. I have managed our home inside and out this entire time.

I wish I was joking, but my situation is complicated and I can’t just go out and socialize because I don’t have any money and I can’t get a job because I’m on disability benefits.

She keeps triggering me to relapse in my ED because she says very hurtful comments that I dare not even say. But my ED helped me feel like I had at least ONE purpose.

Never complain never explain,1714969460.0,"Had a really rough weekend which should have been fun or neutral at worst. 

Was with my  parents sisters and my kids traveling for a weekend.  A lot of work on me (packing driving and basically little help with kids) for little payoff.  And it just didn’t let up. Lot of bad luck and a nonneglible amount of inconsiderate behavior. 

What I realized that maybe if I just never complained about any of it. (Mom insulting my parenting. Dad being very reactive and domineering. Sister throwing me under bus with her colleagues.) Yes I’d be disappointed, let down, insulted, treated poorly but that I’d be clean. I’d be happy. Instead of the one apologizing for my grumpiness (complaining being my bad behavior) I’d just be moving on and appreciating the good which is there.

How do I move forward with therapy?,1714964140.0,"Hi! I made a post here very recently discussing a problem I was having and got a lot of recommendations to go to therapy. I was very very against it and always have been but it was oddly nice hearing people feel sympathetic towards me and if that’s what I can get from therapy then I’m willing to try I think :)
I want to hear how I should approach therapy to not get scared away and to use it most efficiently. Also I want to hear what I should and shouldn’t tell my therapist, especially because my parents will most likely be told what I tell the therapist.
Real quick I also wanted to discuss some things that I do, just to see if this lines up with BPD. I’m not claiming I have it, or are even mentally ill but I’d just love to hear opinions on it. ❤️ I can discuss more in detail in comments as well if you have any questions I am very happy to answer! :))
I am 18 just to clarify, so hormones could play a role in the stuff I seem to btw!

—————————————
To start off my mood swings very rapidly, from being incredibly joyful and smiley to then being very down and not having motivation to do anything at all. I also have moments of “heroism” I guess you would call them? This is where I’m suddenly very cocky and get an almost savior-like feeling, and often sign up for work to help others and then regret it later when the feeling ends.

I would much rather spread love and joy rather than be sad of course, I’ll often try my best to hide the sadness so it doesn’t affect others. Though I think this is normal haha.

I sometimes forget who I want to be and can’f seem to remember what my personality is. I keep in my notes on my phone different things to help keep me in line. These could be characters I like from different media, moments in my head that I remember where I acted well and was praised, and just overall attitudes that I will make myself feel even if I’m a little out of it at that moment. 

My mood tends to switch very rapidly to the point where I’ll often wonder which one is the real me and I wonder if I was faking the other emotions earlier.

I don’t have motivation to do things if it’ll negatively affect others.

I like the idea of being a big brother to someone, but I know I would be a bad parent.

I find myself switching between wanting to help hurt children and wanting to be the hurt child. (sorry this sounds dumb I meant this in a metaphorical way.)

In my head I like physical touch but when it comes around I hate anything physical or in particular sexual. 

I can’t look in the mirror or it ruins my day because of how I look, despite the fact that I oddly do get asked out on dates.

I can’t ever be in a relationship. 

I feel uncomfortable around my parents though I know they love me deeply.

A hug from my mom makes me feel gross.

I got up this morning feeling AMAZING! I put tunes on and was jamming in the shower, I was dancing around and smiling and ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING OUT! ☺️ I was just about to start getting the kids bathed and ready when he sends me these texts (refer to media) asking if it’s bad that HE’S the one who doesn’t wanna go this time… 🫤

So we talk about it, and I told him before he told me this that I wanted to start getting ready at 10am so we weren’t rushing to get out the door like we always are! 😂 He tells me that he’s gonna talk to his friend and tell him that HE is the one who doesn’t wanna come and just doesn’t wanna leave the house, so I agree to the plan and I get undressed and settle back into comfortability! ☺️

THEN, as he’s playing video games with the person who’s house we were supposed to go to, it’s 4pm and I had messaged the group and let everyone know that he’s the one who cancelled, bc I have been trying VERY HARD to connect with his friends and have them feel like MY FRIENDS too… 😞 and he goes, “well they’re all yelling at me now so I guess I’m gonna finish this game and jump in the shower.” ‼️ and his friend can hear this over the mic and I HAD TO BE THE ONE TO SAY NO, WE AREN’T GOING NOW BC I TOLD YOU I DIDN’T WANNA RUSH TO GET READY!

I'm aware that this is insane and I need help,1714933504.0,"I noticed I do this thing where I try and adopt personalities/looks of tv show/movie characters as my own since I feel like I have none.
Like I watched something and my favorite always had a toothpick so I bought a pack of toothpick and always had one since he did. And after watching something new and finding a new favorite character it would be something else.
Two time it went kinda extreme because the characters had facial scars.
I cutted huge line across the right side of my face (it's healed now it wasn't that deep ) another were it was a side mouth thing (I know I'm cringe ) that hasn't healed yet and it's been 10 months.


But last thing I watched had a character that got their eye ripped out. I got really scared since that character was becoming one of my favourite.
I know this is insane once again. I thought wtf you're not doing that to yourself this is insane watch something else and find something else to copy that's not scar related. Yet that thought never really left my mind. I hoped it would like everything else but it didn't. I talked about it to my therapist and she was really worried she asked if I knew how dangerous and how losing an eye isn't like having a cheek scar that's gone the next week.
I told her I knew and thought about all that which is why I was really scared that I still obsessed over it.

I got myself an eye patch so that would maybe satisfy this obsession. The character had one too (admittedlty a metal one but close enough) so I thought no need to get rid of your eye that'll be enough and next week you'll find a new character to obsess over.
But it felt like it wasn't enough.
I wore that eyepactch even when sleeping just to make sure. But it still didn't feel like enough.
My therapist got really worried after I admitted to her that after having done something I lost my vision in one eye for about a minute. She sent me to the psych ward which probably was the only option at that point I'm not mad at her for it. 
The staff asked me why I was wearing an eye patch and I explained.

She (f27) needs time,1714930163.0,"          So my partner (f27) is bpd and adhd. I have bipolar type 2 and bpd. We haven’t been getting along at all. Everytime I see her we just fight. 

             A recent fight that has been going is over her best friend. They just started being best friends. They had a friendship kind of but originally my partner was friends with her best friends partner but the relationship ended between those two in a nasty divorce and my partner became close with her and is now best friends with her as she has been helping her get through it. She is currently helping her find an apartment. This honestly is all fine and ok I get the girl needs support and doesn’t have a lot of people.

            I originally liked this girl I thought I was friends with her and I have opened up to her and all that fun stuff, but then my partner vented to her about a fight 3-4 months ago and I found out she was saying nasty things about me like that I was a cry baby. She apparently has given her a lot of bad advice about our relationship. My partner of course follows it and thinks she is so wise all the time but in all reality she’s not, this girl is struggling and putting stress on my relationship. 

          Anyway, as you can see I’m not fond of her for those reasons. In the past months I have felt uncomfortable and haven’t always expressed it in the best of ways. I’m working on it. 
  
         Again anyway, I have been working on getting an apartment for me and my partner, it’s been difficult but I’m doing it by myself with no help from her and I keep telling her we need to do this but she puts it off and has no problem helping her best friend find an apartment. I had a talk with her explaining the behaviors I don’t like, I really thought she understood she really acted like it and said she would do better. I hate that I had to ask at all but I accepted it and wanted to enjoy my time with her.

         The day after she says can she look at the apartment with me a different day because she hasn’t had a break all week, it hurt because she had no problem going for her best friend but it was too hard for me so again I brought it up and she said actually I lied to you, my best friend wanted to see an apartment and I said I’d go. Apparently the best friend made these plans a few days ago and she forgot and then said she was afraid to tell me because I would get mad. So not only is she prioritizing her best friend she also lied to me. And so I told her how upset I was and how that hurt me and she lost it on me. And I told her to stop yelling several times. 

         Anyway because of that she needed time apart from me and claims it doesn’t matter who it is I’m always mad anyway. I just need advice on what to do. I feel it’s fair for me to be upset. Is it?

Today is the day I break contact,1714912647.0,"Well, here it is. It came upon me so suddenly (ha), but it feels like it's the right time

I've been no-contact with my mother and step-blob for roughly 7 years now. 

I'm just finishing my DBT program, and I hear from my aunt that my mom is moving across the country (and away from my city). I'm really happy for her; I never thought she was capable of making such a bold decision. She'll be near her own mother, which I think will be good for her because she has so many deep wounds regarding her own parent(s).

I talked to her on the phone. It didn't go well. She doesn't understand at all. She doesn't get why I had to do what I did to heal myself. That plane was crashing, and I had to put my mask on while she metaphorically asphyxiated next to me. Idk, that's how it feels in my head. I had to fix myself in order for us to have a relationship at all.

I always said that I am healing myself and I hope she is doing the same. She hasn't though. If I want any semblance of a relationship with her, I have to accept that she will probably never understand her role in my complex childhood  trauma. The day I became an adult in my mind is the day I called the cops on my parents and initiated NC all those years ago--the day I assumed the role of the 'bad guy' in her mind and severed all of my then-values about family, characterized by FOG.

I think maybe I don't need her to understand the past, but I do need her to understand the present and future. I will obviously have concrete boundaries going forward...but I have no fucking clue what they even are...

That my problem. That's why I'm posting. How do I know what my boundaries even are when re-establishing contact after so many years?

I feel like finally seeing her is honestly what is best for both of us, but it is such uncharted territory for me. I would appreciate any and all words of encouragement, advice, caution, humor, anything to take my mind off it really.

i destroyed my favourite person.,1714888844.0,"tw: mentions of suicide, self harm, etc etc

okay, i will be admitting to some things here that i do not encourage and that i acknowledge/understand are things i shouldn't have done. some things are places where i broke boundaries or was too controlling, and others were just plain cruel. i'm saying many things that will make me sound like a terrible, heartless person.

well, that's the whole issue.

i was so dependent, so attached, so possessive, so toxic to the friend i cared so deeply about, to the point where i traumatized them with my own problems and fears. i didn't ever directly state it, but it was obvious that i started cutting because of them, and that multiple suicide attempts were directly related to.... my perception of their actions or intentions. things got bad and i was super unstable. i would have near-psychotix episodes related to them and our then- friend group, where i  believed they were all conspiring against me to destroy me, to leave me behind, or that they were all planning some elaborate scheme to hurt me and leave me alone after they wouldn't find any benefit to having me around anymore. this friend group consisted of me, my fp, my other friend, and my partner. usually, my relationship with my partner is the most stable one (don't ask me how, i literally do not know how or why, but i am eternally grateful), but i had a massive split and completely pulled myself away from the whole group while implying suicide, and nearly broke up with my partner (which i would have passive impulsive thoughts about, but they never actually would be put into motion, so this was concerning for me). this was about a year ago.

things progressed, ig. i would get high and message my fp, despite knowing they were uncomfortable with it. i'd fantasize about being high out of my mind and having them care for me and give me attention, because i guess they'd feel guilty about not caring for me if i was vulnerable. (yes, unfortunately you can see a common pattern between the weed, the sh, and the suicide attempts. yes, i feel guilty about it and will never stop feeling the guilt.) i would exhaust them every moment of their life by trying to find stability in my own. i was a terrible friend. terrible human being, really. i pushed all my troubles onto them and was so fucking manipulative with their emotions all because i was scared of them doing it to me first. like what the actual fuck is wrong with me. to the point where their own anxiety got severely worse and they were starting to struggle in school and other friendships because they felt like they had to consider me or my reactions to every tiny update in their life. i am a fucking parasite

and after me begging over and over for them not to leave me, after constantly seeking the reassurance that they still cared for me after all the things i did, after even starting to seek professional help because i realized i was a problem, and after encouraging them to seek help too so we could both get better and promise to still be friends, i blocked them everywhere.

they stayed. i wish they didn't. i wish i cared more about myself in that time so i wouldn't hurt them with my own toxicity and unresolved issues. despite me also telling them that because i was so fucking clingy to them that it would be impossible for me to leave, i did it. i gave them no warning, i just fucking left them behind.

and well, to add to the list of reasons why i'm a fucking piece of shit, i went through my partner's texts today to see a conversation between her and another friend about my fp. and, they were talking about how i destroyed them.

i hurt my fp. i destroyed them. i traumatized them. i made them lose trust in other people.

i fucking broke them and i feel so fucking awful

i know i don't deserve any goddamn pity or sympathy because i caused this shit. i know i'm a hypocrite for thinking only about myself. but i really, really want the best for them. it hurts me to see them try to get better and move on past me, but logically i know it's not about me. i want to be out of their life so i don't have to keep plaguing them. but then to hear that whether i left or stayed, i wouldn't be able to take back any of the damage i already caused...


to read the words describing how i mentally poisoned them, i just 

don't even know if it's worth me trying to get better anymore. i destroyed a human being that deserves everything and more. they deserve life, they deserve to be happy, they deserve to feel true and unconditional support and love, and

fuck.

i don't even know what i'm talking about anymore

i can't take back the past, but knowing it'll still be with them in the future and i can't do anything about it

fuck

Am I being petty,1714887146.0,"Okay, I think I am ready to discuss what initiated my intimacy break. It was a few weeks ago and I am a nicotine addict who enjoys vaping. However, my partner is not a fan because it triggers them due to their parent smoking cigarettes continuously in front of them. They told me to stop, and warned me that if I ever lied about having a vape, there would be repercussions. Feeling weak, I bought a vape, but I tried to respect their boundaries by not telling them about it. One day, while I was using the bathroom, they saw me using the vape and asked me about it. I lied and tried to conceal it, but they caught me. This led to them wanting to discuss the issue when they returned from work. This caused me to spiral as I feared they might break up with me. I love this person dearly as they have supported me through family deaths. Instead of risking losing them, I reflected on why I lied and realized I may be a compulsive liar.

I understand they wanted to wait until they got home to discuss it, but I felt it was important to share my realization with them. They were upset and almost broke up with me. When they returned home and we discussed the situation further, they suggested taking a break. Prior to this, we had plans to visit family in Texas. Although I was born in Texas, I have no memories of it and have always dreamt of visiting. However, they essentially uninvited me after the break and asked if I would still pay for the plane ticket they bought. I refused since I was no longer going. Unbeknownst to me, they decided to test me by waiting to see if I would offer to pay before our trip.

I am currently on medical leave with disability, receiving $1200 a month, which barely covers my rent. They waited weeks for me to come up with a plan to go with them, even though it would be financially impossible for me. Eventually, they converted my ticket into extra miles on their account. Today, they called their father in front of me and suggested I leave if I didn't like it.

Realizing the disrespect and dismissiveness of my situation, I have come up with several options for them to make amends: 
1. Convert the miles back into a ticket for me to accompany them.
2. Convert the miles into a ticket for a later date for me to go alone, with their assistance.
3. Call off the break and move forward upon their return.
4. Waive my rent, utility bills, and car note for a month so I can save up to buy my own ticket to Texas.

Lost my world ,1714861115.0,"Yesterday marked the day that I lost my favorite person in the whole world. For some context, me and this friend have been friends since January but we know each other for maybe a month or two before but we just didn’t get actually get close till January. Now to preface they were well aware of my mental health issues at the start the friendship we actually bonded over that almost like trauma bonding. Now I know the title says it, but I  developed an obsession for them and they slowly became kind of my whole world. Every thought was about them, every moment I wished to talk to them… ect. They were my favorite person. And I know I wasn’t easy. I would split on them and say shit I didn’t mean but I really did try my best to do everything I can for them and to be better for them… they were my motivation to wake up and get out of bed a lot of the time. They always told me how they would never leave and they would make me feel so special to them and important to them. I believed him when he said I was crazy for having any doubts and crazy for thinking beyond what he says. Now here is the meat and bones of the story. They joined a new server on discord about 2 months ago and eventually got adopted into a polycule (not relationship wise but just became a close friend to them) they would play Minecraft and Roblox all day with them which would upset me but I always tried to encourage hanging with others he wanted to be with cause I never wanted to be controlling. 2 days ago they came to me asking for advice as one person in previously mentioned polycule officially asked them out and they wanted advice on what to do ( for context yes I was madly in love with them but out of respect for them and fear of myself I never told them). I told them to do what makes their heart happy and that I support them and they soon got together. Now the next day I messaged them about talking less as I didn’t want to be obsessively in love with them while they were in a relationship and in a typo that I now know of they put sorry we can’t talk anymore… that made me split and spiral. During our arguement they mentioned they were sorry for hurting me by saying we would last forever even though he knew he would “find someone more important and lose interest”

This broke me… my whole world fought on fire the moment I read that… I had never cried so hard in my life if I’m honest… eventually through tears and yelling they told me I was being the asshole and that I’m not the good person here cause we were both fucked and that neither of us tried for the other… everything I did was for them. They have since then been ignoring me. I cried as I felt every plan, promise, hope, and dream burn alongside my world. I’ve been abandoned many time but never so quickly. It wasn’t even 12 hours before they found them more important and lost interest in me. I’ve been able to distract myself and gaslight myself into thinking I’m over it… but in my lonely boredom it has struck back and I’m crying all over again. I’ve never felt so much hate but at the same time yearn to be by their side so bad and miss them so bad. I don’t know what to do anymore… my days feel so empty and look more dull now that they aren’t around. I’m lost.

How do you function?,1714859250.0,"GF and I are undiagnosed BPD.  I am seeing a psychologist who is evaluating me, and my therapist who have been seeing for a long time has already started me on CBT/DBT.  

I can recognize it in myself and accept it. She does not, and refuses any sort of therapy. 

We are going through an immensely rough time in our relationship, it’s a basic cycle of being good for a while and then it’s hell every three months. Any small thing or minor inconvenience. Remind her of every wrong I’ve ever done and it gets ugly.  

I’m just wondering how everyone here functions during times like this? I dive headfirst into work and compulsively clean and do things that are good for our shared environment. But then there’s certain things I just can’t bring myself to do. Neither one of us have put away laundry in months … It’s the point where she’s left our shared bedroom and set up her own bedroom in our house which is quite literally just full of piles of clothes and now she is back in our room

I am not really any better except for the fact that I work from home and every now and again I will either pay our cleaners to put my stuff away or I’ll freak out and do some of it.

I find myself struggling with a lot of the mundane things we all have to do… Paying bills… Maintaining or even checking mail… All that stuff. I let it pile up and get to a crisis mode and then I deal with it.

Favorite person in BPD,1714856632.0,"For individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), a 'favorite person' can play a central role in their lives and significantly impact their emotional well-being. The term 'favorite person' refers to an individual, often a friend, family member, or partner, whom someone with BPD considers their primary source of support, validation, and stability.

The relationship with the favorite person is often intense and complex, characterized by strong emotional bonds and profound dependence. For individuals with BPD, the favorite person can serve as an emotional lifeline, someone they rely on to help them cope with intense emotions, mood swings, and identity issues.

However, it's important to note that fixation on the favorite person can also be a significant challenge. Individuals with BPD may become excessively fixated on their favorite person, experiencing intense anxiety and fear of abandonment if they perceive any loss of support or connection. This fixation can lead to disruptive behaviors such as outbursts of anger or self-harm.

Acknowledging and understanding the dynamics of the relationship with the favorite person is crucial for providing effective support to individuals with BPD. Therapy and support focused on developing healthy coping mechanisms and strengthening emotional regulation skills can make a difference in the lives of those affected by BPD and their loved ones.

Additionally, it's worth noting that for some individuals, such as myself, the fixation on the favorite person can be particularly severe. In my case, my previous psychologist was my favorite person, and I have not been able to move on from this fixation, causing significant distress and difficulty in managing my emotions. 

Are there others here who experience this as well? If so, who is your favorite person? And how do you cope with it?",thisborderline,,False,1ckah89,30,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1ckah89/favorite_person_in_bpd/

Since the break, they have converted the extra ticket into miles. I am now experiencing feelings of abandonment and being left out. However, I know logically that this trip was not intended for me, but rather for them to connect with their father, who is not doing well. This situation is causing me to feel anxious because it will be the first time my partner and I will be in different states since we started dating. They have become my favorite person, and I am scared of facing a week alone. I can't help but think that whenever something good happens to me, I find a way to mess it up and have it taken away from me, partly due to my behavior. This feeling in my stomach is overwhelming, and the last time I was alone for an extended period was when I was by myself for at least 2 months with my family. I want to give my partner space and make them feel safe around me, but there is a selfish part of me that doesn't want them to go because I can't go with them.

How can I stop splitting? ,1714817960.0,"Hi everyone, this is my first post in this sub.  I've been reading posts in here and I relate SO MUCH to all of you. And I really could use some advice. 

So two months ago I had a baby, and it honestly really really affected my mental health.I had been in a relationship with my boyfriend for two years and we had just moved into a house together, I thought life was perfect. Everything changed when my son was born. I became angry and every little thing set me off. My baby made me happy, but he was admitted to the NICU for a week and that just made things worse. I was so angry and devastated and I fully started taking things out on my boyfriend, and if I'm being honest I did it because I truly just believed he'd never leave me. I have a tendency to project my own feelings onto others, I would never leave him no matter what, so I felt it was the same for him. That's not what happened. He got sick of my sh*t and he walked out when our son was two weeks old. literally just walked out the door and left us. And obviously it triggered my fear of abandonment and I just lost it.

So it's been almost two months since that happened and I'm just getting worse. I have tried so hard to just be civil with him because we share a child, and sometimes I'm able to. We can have a conversation and keep it about our son and everything is good. But then he will start saying things to upset me on purpose it feels like, and I lose control. I am so ashamed of the things I have been doing and saying to him... I've become an absolute monster. It's like I'm so angry that he doesnt love me anymore and I don't want him to be happy because I'm not. And I KNOW that's wrong and yet I cannot control it.. I've gone as far as to tell him I'm going to change our sons last name (because it's his), that I'm gonna take him away from him, just absolutely horrible things that I'm embarrassed to even admit. He told me he was talking to a new girl and it's someone that I was insecure about during our relationship because he had dated her before me and I always got the feeling that he still cared for her. So when I found that out I obviously split BAD and I went and messaged her all kinds of crazy things, telling her I wanted to fight her, I went as far as trying to find her address in that fit of rage. And then when I calmed down I just felt horrible and embarrassed. I look like an absolute lunatic and I just feel like a terrible person. My ex told me constantly that I am manipulative, and selfish and I think he is right. I don't like who I am. I'm ashamed of it. But I feel absolutely helpless to stop. 

What can I do? I'm on Wellbutrin, it does nothing to stop these splits. When it happens there's nothing that can calm me or stop me. I am stuck in it until it passes, and the damage I'm doing cannot continue. I have to get this under control immediately, I don't want my child to ever see me this way. I am such a loving, caring person when I'm in my normal state of mind. I would do anything for the ones I love and even strangers. I have a lot of empathy I feel, which is what makes it so hard for me when I split and hurt someone. I'm just truly scared of the things I am capable of in that state of mind. I have no control over myself. It's terrifying.. 

I could just really use some support and advice is welcomed. Thanks if you read this far. ",StunningReporter4712,,False,1cjx2hs,9,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cjx2hs/how_can_i_stop_splitting/

Turning Red is hitting different rn,1714795392.0,"There’s a bit of self harm talk related to the movie and my experiences. 

I think that this movie can relate to BPD in some senses. Mei’s emotions are so extreme, she turns into something she can’t control. This happens with both positive and negative emotions. She lashes out hurting people emotionally and physically. She can’t entirely control it, but she’s trying so hard to learn to manage it which includes hurting herself to try to stop it. She so badly wants approval from her mom that she’ll hurt herself and others to get it. She’s had to sort of parent her mom and teach her how to be less codependent. 

Obviously, my emotions are extreme too and I am barely learning to contain/ deal with them. I’ve hurt myself for being upset, emotionally numb, even too happy. I try to avoid lashing out at others, but can get pissy at times. 

I have a similar relationship with my mom. I don’t have to be perfect with grades and stuff, but I do have to be perfect emotionally and with maturity. I’ve basically been her therapist since I was a teen, started when I was younger.  Definitely overly attached and codependent. 

When we fight, it gets brutal. Last time it lasted a week on n off with screaming matches. But I so desperately just want to have a good relationship, and have hurt myself to get it. After our last fight, I realized (through talking to my aunt, the argument itself, and thinking) that I’d have to ignore my feelings and suffer silently to have a relationship with her. I had been pretending to be happy with her as she got mad at me for wanting a bit of space from her. So I can’t have space and can’t fake it. I hurt myself as a sort of reset (I had been clean 4 months before this) and it worked. I was able to pretend on the right level that she didn’t realize and things went back to normal. Mei throws herself at walls and slaps herself to stop showing her feelings and gain her moms approval. I relate to that so much. Like I have to hurt myself to reset so others will like me and my feelings don’t take over. 

I so desperately want to have a good relationship with my mom. Unlike Mei’s mom, mine won’t apologize or take accountability for things.

Questions about BPD ,1714771643.0,"Hi everyone- I have some questions about BPD. I don’t know for sure, but I suspect my ex-boyfriend has BPD or some sort of personality disorder, and I’m having a hard time dealing with this break-up and am looking for clarifying answers. I’m not a psychiatrist, so obviously I shouldn’t diagnose, but I am an RN and work with psych patients on a regular basis. 

So, this person has a history of many years using drugs. They have been clean for a few years, but have regularly engaged in THC since. When he uses THC, he gets very paranoid. I know that he also has a history of “drug induced psychosis” for which he spent a month in a psych ward for (his words, not mine). But, this psychosis and paranoia continued off and on well past what I believed to be just “drug induced.” 

Frequently he was paranoid about people from his past, or paranoid that people at work were against him, or people on the street were looking at him strangely and judging him. When I would say, “what are you talking about?” he would tell me I wasn’t “reading the room.” I don’t believe he has hallucinations. There was also a lot of religious hyperfixation (twice), and hyperfixation on working out (once, but that has died down)

There was also a lot of hot and cold behavior with this person- one minute I was everything they wanted in a female, the next day they said they don’t like me. One day they told their parents about me and how serious we were, the next they would stonewall me and not talk for days. Early in our relationship he blocked me for 5 months and didn’t talk to me at all. He goes from 0-100 in terms of stress and aggression. Many times I felt like I was walking on eggshells with this person because I didn’t know if what I said would tip him off. 

Then there’s the job instability, lack of control with finances, and rash decision making based on emotions and not based on logical decision making. The final straw for me was another 0-100 behavior where he basically told me he never wants to see me again, but during that breakup was getting very aggressive and angry, and refused to look me in the eye and repelled when I tried to talk to him or touch him. I was afraid he was going to hit me. 

Does this sound like BPD? Is paranoia part of BPD? Why do people who have BPD push away the people who love and care for them? I really truly love this person, and am concerned for his well-being and safety. But, I’m also heartbroken.

Running into ex,1714764700.0,"My ex and I are friendly, I knew we’d be at the same concert in a VERY small venue, but last second he dropped that he was going to be with someone there. 

I wasn’t really expecting us to hang out in the line or dance together, but it was ROUGH seeing him with someone, seeing them experience what we once did before. Hard not to compare yourself or hate a girl who you know nothing about. It was emphasized by the fact that people there had gone to the same concerts we had, everyone there was with someone while I was by myself, and my struggles to find someone to be close with. 

The music erased ALL of that emotion and I had a great time, but during the 3 hour trip home the next day it settled in again. I was so excited to share the concert experience with people who didn’t seem to care as much, make jokes on a very empty car ride home to no one. 

I just wanna get to the point where I don’t love or hate him, that I just don’t care. I wanna find someone SO badly that I can share things with, to be close with, but it just hasn’t happened in the past year. I had been doing okay, but all of the above triggered a ROUGH time.

BPD trigger and ED within family,1714762589.0,"TLDR:  I'm suffering from a mystery ailment causing me to be anorexic, while my son refuses help for a diagnosed eating disorder.  I'm struggling to keep myself together.

I (43F) generally, mostly feel like I've got myself relatively together.  It's been a long journey, but I'm still here for it.  However, my health has taken a huge decline over the past year and it is a Dr. House level mystery.  I'm severely anorexic and am in varying stages of constant physical and emotional pain over it.  My medical team, after every test known to man and 7 specialists, all say I'm 110% physically healthy.  My psychiatrist evaluated me for an ED and says nope, not at all.  My therapist shrugs and says accept it like I would any type of chronic pain, anorexia and binge eating are common with BPD, he says.  I feel physical health-wise everyone has given up on me and doesn't care.  My last doctor's appointment, no one even commented on it, except the counselor.  He asked how I was feeling and I said ""I'm trying to accept that my physical form is decaying and my spirit is haunting it."" He said okay and moved on.  Man, WTF?

In the meantime, my son (17M) also has a diagnosis of anorexia and a huge support team giving him answers, suggestions, resources... And all he does is fight them and then complain to me for hours (literally... Sunday he complained about his ED for 6 hours straight).  To ME!  The flipping Crypt Keeper in a wig that would kill for the answers and support he's getting.  It's to the point that he has become a huge trigger for me and I don't know what to do.  I'm so afraid of tripping out on him.  I know as the parent I need to be the pillar of wisdom and support, but I'm on the edge.  I've told him before that I'm in the same struggle and that sometimes it hurts me, but he had disregarded those comments.  I've tried all my DBT interpersonal skills, but I'm drowning.

I forgot to mention that a year after I broke up with my Sponsor, she contacted me asking me why did I remove her from my friends on facebook and told me they never dated. I dont know how that wasn't dating, as they went on a mini trip together, he would do costco shopping for her since she didn't want to go out during covid. He would bring her son out for golf.

"I don't know if this is just a me problem, but is anyone else having trouble making friends?",1714753738.0,"Hi, F(22) with BPD, C-PTSD, MDD, and DID. Which is my formal diagnosis. A little background on my life. All my life I've had a hard time making friends. I was bullied a lot in school, got in to a lot of fights. (I grew up in a majority white schools up until my sophomore year in high school) I was molested by 4 different people growing up. One of them being a family member. My mother has NPD. So of course she was extremely abusive to me and my sister. And anytime I made a genuine connection with anyone we would move or if they where family and then tried to say anything to my mother about the abuse they witnessed she would just stop talking to them and we would never see them again. And where was my father you may ask? Working 2 to 3 jobs to pay all the bills and living expenses for the family. He would be home for a couple hours a day and occasionally on the weekends. But I am grateful to my dad for providing for us? 100%. The lights never got cut off, there was always food in the kitchen. ( not like we where allowed to eat.) My father was and is a great man. But, he was never there to protect me or my sister. From my mother... And that's not even a eighth of what I've been through in my life. And I'm only 22.

I said all that just to say I've had relationships with people but it never felt real. It always felt like they would leave if I ever was a hundred percent honest with them. And I've tried a few times to lay it all out on the table with either romantic partners or platonic friends and it always ends in two ways. They either stop talking to me immediately or they find out how vulnerable I am and they abuse me. 
The only outliers to this is my current boyfriend. Though at times he really doesn't understand how deep my trauma runs. 
And one friend I made recently at a BPD group therapy session. ( but she only know as much as you guys.)

It's like as much as I want to make connections with people. And no matter how long I've known them. Or how much I feel like I can trust them I just can't seem to let that wall down... and I've been in therapy for about  2 year now since I was officially diagnosed with DID ( Dissociative identity disorder) ( if you don't know it takes quit a long time for a Psychologist to give you that particular diagnosis before sending you to a specialist) I've been trying to take my therapy seriously and do the work outside of sessions but, I'm just not seeing any results when it comes to making genuine friendships. 

So at this point I'm open for any suggestions or therapy treatments I could implement into my life to improve the relationships I already have or to help establish new ones.

How do I stop myself from obsessing over someone and making them my FP?,1714731756.0,"17M, AFAB, Bipolar 2, ADHD, ASD, BPD

Sorry, this is a bit long.

I have this person I’ve been mutual followers with for a long time and I’ve always been interested in them and happy to see them always like my stories and posts. This wasn’t really obsession, more like a passing thought in my day. I’ve always found them cool and sometimes I’d think about them as they seem to be lonely and feeling down often. We talked a few times before but not for long really.

I decided to send an anonymous message asking how they were and saying that I always wanted to talk to them but I was shy. For context, I came from a really bad funk and I’m starting to feel a little better now, but I fear this is leading into a hypomanic episode as I’ve had a lot more energy lately and I’ve been getting a lot of schoolwork done.

They posted it on their story saying I could message them as they’d love to be friends with whoever sent the message and I replied. I asked how they were and they said they’ve been feeling down and that they took a break from everything, actually similarly to what happened to me prior to the elevated mood during the last couple days. They said they were starting to better though now that they took a break and changed their therapist. Apparently they also have Bipolar Disorder and BPD so I shared that I was in a similar situation. After a bit of chatting I told them that I’ve been wondering how they were from time to time and that it made me happy to interact with them. They told me that my stories always brightened their day.

I directed the conversation to more casual chatting after a while as I don’t want this to be a purely shoulder to cry on relation. We’ve been chatting a little about our interests. 

I fear that since I suspect I’m going into a hypomanic episode, this will be another one of my hyperfixations on people and I don’t want that to happen. Yes, I’m interested in them as a person but I want to take things slow for this to be a meaningful relation. I’m trying my hardest not to obsess over them, but I can’t stop my brain right now from thinking about them a lot.

How do I deal with this? I want to build this relationship, but I don’t want to burn it out. I’ve always been interested in them, but I fear right now my state is starting to intensify that and I don’t want it to reach an unhealthy extent, but I can’t just stop talking to them if I want this relationship to be meaningful.

I 27F reaching out to 34M parents? ,1714695985.0,"To start off I have an extreme empathy for people with BPD, i genuinely wish they all find peace in their life.

I started dating a man 10 months ago in which it was the the best yet the most emotionally taxing relationship I’ve been in. Around the 3 month mark I started to notice patterns he was exhibiting that resembled bpd ( I am not licensed therefore I cannot pinpoint and say it’s just that) upon doing research, I developed a plan and executed on every opportunity I could. 

A few actions I took during our time to help him through what he was experiencing:

- Sunday Check-ins to allow a space for him to express himself: What’s working, how does he feel, how can I support better etc., and I was asked the same back. He deflected/mirrored my responses.
- Reassured I was appreciative of him being my partner and my commitment to work through issues. He deflected/mirrored.
- Encouraged meeting new friends and supporting him with his business ventures. He avoided.
- Encouraged a healthier diet, sauna detox’s and exercising. - He refused/deflected


Then came one day where he completely went off and discarded me out the blue. We had dinner plans and everything, he told me how excited he was that morning and by 6 pm it was done. I went over and explained this was a moment and tried to process the feelings with him. He settled and asked me to stay the night. I did, that morning he woke me up screaming “I’m having that feeling again” hopped out of bed and started pacing. I was emotionally exhausted I’ve he’s done this several times throughout our relationship.

I left and decided to give him space, called him 2 weeks later and he was still in the discarding mindset and couldn’t do this. I’m so confused because I recently introduced him to my family in which he was eager to meet as well he introduced me to his childhood best friends that he encouraged me to meet. He also said he loved me but when the discard happened, he advised he said it cause he”felt bad” 

Needless to say, I wrote a 2 page document addressing his parents who he constantly spoke to about me saying my concerns for him. This message does not focus on what happened in our relationship but expressing serious concerns for his mental health through his patterns and symptoms. I’m not asking for him back as I’ve moved forward but I really care about him and I know he is suffering. The question is would it be okay to reach out to his parents even though we have never met?

I’m in need a love and support. I’ve just started the path to recovery after destroying a beautiful three year relationship between my ex boyfriend and I. Is there hope for us? Is there hope for me?,1714682347.0,"I am a 21 year old male who was diagnosed with BPD around a year ago whenever I was in an inpatient use for self-harming.

I met my ex boyfriend whenever I was 18. He was my first true boyfriend. He was my best friend, and the best partner anyone could ever ask for. He is truly one in a million, and I fucked it up.

I went into our relationship with a lot of trauma, but I am a very sweet and good person, and I tried to hide my trauma from him. I showered him with love, gifts, and everything you see in rom-coms from the 90’s. That was how good our love was.

A few months in, I became very jealous of him. Both of his parents were together and alive, while my parents divorced whenever I was younger, and then my father died not too long after. My grandfather died after my dad did. I still grieve over both of them.

My ex boyfriend had the life I had always wanted. He had a lot of friends growing up, and he was the popular kid in school. He went to dances and got to experience so much.

I didn’t feel like I deserved him because I saw myself as some damaged bully victim who has to homeschool his senior year because of the severity of it, and I missed out on so much.

I always turned to risky sex and self harming to make me feel better. Sex made me feel powerful and wanted, while self harming was a punishment for myself because I thought what I went through was my fault.

Fast forward, my ex boyfriend stayed with me during all of this, and he helped me so much. He called me everyday whenever I was in the psychiatric unit, and he was always there for me, truly.

He loved me. He still does and I still love him.

However, as time went on in our relationship, I started becoming very distant with him and less intimate for some reason. I was craving attention from other people. I would go on Grindr just to chat, not to physically hook up, and I told him the truth about this and he forgave me.

Months pass and I said I was going to get better, but I didn’t. I swept BPD under the rug. I did stop self harming, but I was still wanting attention from other people, even though my boyfriend was giving me all of his love and attention.

Why the fuck wasn’t it enough? This type of person is all I have dreamed about and wanted. Why the fuck was it not enough?

3-4 days ago, I impulsively downloaded Grindr, and I  had oral sex with a random person. I hated it. I knew the whole time that I was supposed to have changed and not go back to that, but I didn’t stop myself.

The experience was horrible, and I told my boyfriend the truth the very next day. I told him that I wasn’t even aroused during it, and my clothes were on, as well as the other guy.

I felt a rush in the process, and I assume that’s why I did it, but I just can’t believe I actually followed through with physically cheating because of how in love I am with my ex.

My ex and I are leaving on very good terms. We talked about everything maturally for around 3-4 days. I made myself vulnerable to him, and I feel so sorry, and he knows this. I didn’t do it to hurt him.

I made myself a therapist appointment the next day, and she has put on a BPD recovery path.

I also made a vow to stay far awake from a sexual activities so I can heal. I bought a black ring to wear on my finger to remind me of how much pain my actions can cause others, and to think before I do something.

I don’t why it took me doing something like this to someone I love very much for me to open up my eyes.

I have taken full accountability. I also will be meeting with a group through zoom this weekend about BPD.

This explains why I always had mood swings with him and everyone around me, even though I wasn’t wanting to be mean. This explains why I would impulsively walk out of jobs. This explains why I self harmed. 

HOWEVER, I AM NOT BLAMING BPD ON ME CHEATING. Nothing can justify cheating, or any actions really. I’m just saying I can at least connect the dots.

My boyfriend and I had very, very intimate sex before saying goodbye. The fact that he still engaged in meaningful sex with me after what I did says a lot, and it makes me feel like he truly is the one.

I wrote him a poem because I used to love to write poetry for him, but as my BPD started to get out of control, I stopped doing the things I loved.

He liked the poem, and I will always be sorry for what I did to him.

It could be months or even years, but he told me that there is a chance we could be together again, but he would have to meet a new version of me, and luckily he got to meet that developing person yesterday.

We talked about all the good memories and fun we had, and we shared one last intimate moment.

Is there hope for me? Is there hope for us?

We’re over and now is the time where we’re not speaking to one another so we both can heal.

He told me he’s not mad at me, he’s just mad at the situation.

I am fully aware of what I’ve done, and how I’ve acted in the relationship. I refuse to let myself live a life like this.

That version of me died the night I did that, and now I’ve been reborn.

Me so she fucked up before this and to this day keeps saying shit even though I cut her out of my life but I'll tell you the whole ass story one day. but we had her over to make up Christmas and I was already struggling to get through. she was getting ready to leave so she was giving me a hug and my oldest cat was beside me and she just loves to point out how he's sick and basically living on borrowed time like I fucking know. she said oh I'm glad you're still here to my cat and she said the same thing to me too. but then she had the audacity to say ""you know if you would died, you would have gone to hell because suicide is the unforgettable sin."" the second she walked out I burst into tears

WHO IN THE ACTUAL FUCK SAYS THAT

sorry I'm trauma dumping on you but yeah wtf

Me well if you would know how she is maybe thoughts would be different lol. I mean if she was worried, when I texted her asking to take me to the hospital with the reason why and all she says she's busy and if I wait, yeah that situation can totally wait

My brother and I don't do well with loud sounds (cPTSD). My brother called the police because when we reported him to our leasing office (we live in an apartment) that's what they told us to do. Our building is wacky in that you need a key to enter the building and then you can enter the individual apartments. I went outside for a few minutes to let the cops in. In that short time, our housemate began screaming and banging on my bedroom door, which was locked and my brother was inside. He hit the door so hard that it cracked the door and permanently damaged it. I don't know what would have happened if the door was unlocked. Sadly, we were in so much shock we didn't notice the damage until after the cops left. He was not arrested but he was escorted to life skills for the night.

"I'm a compulsive liar, and i keep lying to my partner. Should i let him work through it or break up with him?",1714673264.0,"So basically, i keep lying to my partner. I may have a problem with compulsive lying. The most recent one was downplaying the number of times i had sex / the intensity of the sex with an old friend in the past to protect his feelings. My therapist and friends suggest that i tell the truth to my partner, and allow him to decide if he wants to stay or go, so that i can give him the choice to work through it if he wants.

The avoidant part of me wants to tell the truth and then force us to break up, because i think he will stay out of the trauma bond i have created with him. I understand people should be given the choice to stay or leave, but i feel like because of my partners own people pleasing tendency's, he will choose to stay and fester in resentment.  

Lying is terrible, and i do feel horribly guilty. I remember praying to god for a second chance, and i immediately blew it by lying again. I've come clean about other lies in the past, and he's been very forgiving and understanding, but its undeniable that its put a strain on our relationship. I've been in therapy for about six months now, and i really want to focus on healing alone so i don't hurt him anymore or anyone else in this relationship.

A third option is to not come clean about the lies and tell him i need to break up to focus on my own mental health, however i understand partners of pwBPD refer to this behavior as ""discard"" and it can be horrible for them to go through as well.

How to deal with office betrayal?,1714663300.0,"Hi,

I am a 30M, working with a semi-startup company as one of their WFH dev/QA. To cut the long story short, I entered the Google Meet link at 9:59PM when the meeting is 10:00PM and the director for development mentioned my name on a statement…

(Let’s cover up my name as Adrian)

“And Adrian… Ohh hey Adrian…. Uhmmm” something like that. I saw his assistant, and 3 other colleagues laughing to the point that one turned off his camera.

I am a very sensitive person. I was diagnosed with BPD with narcissistic tendencies just early this year after I took some extensive tests.

I know that I was backstabbed since I am asking the director for some guidance if the both of us are on the same page, but I am surprised that 4 other people are there. I am thinking that they are thinking that I am incompetent.

I began to feel uneasy and I palpitate, even now. I immediately vented out to my fellow dev/QA about the inconsistencies of what they want to do (I tried my best to not to overshare my feelings) via chat. I felt betrayed by these people and I immediately closed all of the messages that they had with me on our team messaging.

I feel I am very sensitive about this and irrational.

Am I splitting? How do I deal with this? Can someone help me? Are my feelings valid? Am I overreacting?

I will take my Quetiapine for now.

Has anyone dealt with being hypersexual with BPD? ,1714657293.0,"I find it incredibly hard to connect with people even just for sex. My mind is going when I am having sex, as usual, but then afterwards? Oh the tidal wave hits and you question everything. “Was it good for him? Was I awkward? What if he ghosts me now? (Etc)” You think of every bad scenario that could happen even though you’re probably fine.  

I had a…”meetup” with a friend from work and ever since I left I’ve been fighting to think about ANYTHING ELSE. None of my coping skills are really working right now. I forced myself to go straight to sleep but it didn’t matter because the SECOND i woke up it was like I never slept. The thoughts hit me immediately. Random memories that I perceived as bad but could be absolutely nothing.  I’m freaking out even more because I have to see him at work even though he didn’t actually give me any reason to believe that it went bad. Plus I keep getting told “you have a better chance at getting someone from your job or school”. He even gave me the first actual hug he’s ever given me right after and said “I’ll see you tomorrow” but yet the random silent moments is what’s stuck in my head. (He’s just as awkward as me but without BPD). 

However, my brain is telling me that I have to change jobs and maybe cities and drop all contact within the next week. It’s so intense. 

Does anyone have any advice (besides simply don’t do that), or atleast ways to point out, to myself, that I’m overreacting?

"Do I break up with my FP now, or wait until I’m stronger?",1714618192.0,"
In desperate need of advice. 

My boyfriend and I have been on and off for nearly 2 years now. From 15 to nearly 18. I struggled with intense mental health issues my whole life (bpd, autism, adhd, extreme anxiety etc) and I felt for the first time in my life, in his arms, my mind went quiet. He is my first boyfriend, first love, took my virginity and gave me a lot of new life experiences. He became my FP very quickly and I developed an intense and unhealthy attachment to him. Almost like a parental attachment as I never got much affection from my own parents. He became my only source of safety from my own mind. 

Some backstory on our relationship 

Even just the start of our relationship was very rocky and caused a lot of pain for me. He was unable to commit and date multiple months but would still treat me like his girlfriend (going on road trips with his family, having sleepovers for weeks etc, having dinner at his grandparents house, calling me honey and baby and so much more) He would sleep with girls, occasionally sending photos to me with them, telling me, when asked where he was, “you don’t want to know”. Only to then come stay at mine for nights on end. Repeat. The pain this inflicted was unbearable but I didn’t care when I was in his arms. Even when he was hurting me the most it was him who I wanted to run and cry to. This happened maybe 4-5 times until I told him I was done. He then decided that very day he was ready to commit and was in love with me, while also maintaining that his behaviour wasn’t wrong. Maybe I was too naive, maybe he was testing the waters to see just how much he could walk all over me. 

Our relationship was so intense. Almost a spiritual experience. I brought a lot of my own insecurities mixed with the ones I created during the first few months. We had broken up numerous times, 5 out of 6 being by him. Every break up was just as intense as the last. I begged him to stay, I promised to change, I promise it was a turning point etc. The hardest breakup lasted 4 months and I was distraught. We broke up about 30 minutes before my birthday. I spent my birthday trying to hold it together, until that night he posted a photo with the girl/ at the girls house he told me not to worry about. I was intensely suicidal unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. I couldn’t cope. I would cry until I vomited everyday for months. I couldn’t sleep in my own bed for a while as it reminded me of him. I couldn’t be present in anything, I neglected all my responsibilities. I turned to drugs, alcohol, flings, constantly stalking his social media, asking around to find out what he was doing, you name it. The pain was genuinely unbearable and I couldn’t see myself getting through it. I genuinely for the first time thought I was going to end things. 

Then I get a message. It didn’t come as a complete shock as a mutual friend was almost speaking to each other, for us. We are both incredibly stubborn and he refused to reach out unless he knew I would reply. Of course I did. This led to talking non stop, to hanging out, to being in a relationship all probably within the span of a week. I was ecstatic. I knew it was a terrible idea but I didn’t care, he loved me!!! He wanted me!!! 

Reality hit not long after, old habits became present quickly. I continued to have issues when it came to his habits of lying, not trusting him in the slightest, not being able to let go of the hurtful things, not feeling cared for or appreciated etc. I struggle immensely to know if these feelings are caused by BPD or are a reality. Lots of people around me see the way he treats me as wrong, but are they just saying that? He’s ingrained into my mind that I am the problem the whole relationship, which could be true but a lot of the hurtful things he’s done I can’t understand how they could be considered okay. 

Now where I need advice

He’s making a lot of progress in his career, which might entail him to move overseas. He’s been telling me this for a while but I didn’t accept it as a reality. But slowly, it’s gotten more real and I fear he will be moving soon. When the possibility of long distance was brought up he immediately shut it down. Saying he would not do it. I was shattered. I would do anything to be with him. I bargained, cried, pleaded. He said he would try and make things work if he was only going for small periods but has also made it clear he mightn’t like it and will end things. So many things go through my mind, does he want to be able to have sex with random girls again? Does he not love me? Is he not as committed as I am? He currently has no set timeframe on when he’s going or how long for. He told me he understands if I need to end things and left it upto me. It almost felt as if he was advocating for breaking up. Like he didn’t care, wasn’t fussed either way, like he expected I was going to. This caused me an intense panic attack. I’m terrified to go through the pain again out of fear that I literally won’t survive. I genuinely feel as if my life depends on this relationship, which is definitely unfair on him and I would never tell him that. 

I told him I would make it work while we still could and there was no sense of relief from him in the slightest. No excitement, nothing. All he said was “yea that’s what I’ve been saying” and went to sleep as I cried all night. 


Do I stay with him until he needs to go, given the possibility he might come back soon etc, even though he seems checked out and careless either way? Do I stay and try and make myself stronger so when the time comes I don’t fear my life? 

Or do I end things now, rip the bandaid off, induce potential years of pain and regret if he doesn’t move? 

I’m terrified of the pain I feel due to my BPD and I’m so conflicted in my mind of what is the best decision. Any help means the absolute world.

Can two people with borderline traits heal a relationship?,1714615194.0,"My ex husband and I had a really toxic relationship the last year we were together.  Essentially, things went straight downhill right after we eloped (we’d been dating 18 months at the time and we’re living together, so it wasn’t anything drastic - especially since his family being so messed up meant we wouldn’t have ever had a big ceremony anyway).  
He dove straight back into substance abuse after being clean for a while and generally just started behaving like an entitled teenager, plus he became bizarrely fixated on the fact that I had experience SA before we were ever together and had empathy for the guy who did it - he accuse some of cheating and said horrible, soul crushing things.  I started becoming reactive to the mental/emotional abuse and sexual pressure (we were either having crazy make up sex, or I would shut down because of the trauma, and he’d get angry and call me crazy).  Things got so bad - I moved out three times, twice in the middle of the night.  I also went back twice in the middle of the night because I missed him so much and he wanted me to come home.  
We’ve been divorced for a year and a few months.  I’ve kept him blocked for stretches, but it’s difficult.  I’ve been in therapy and recently started back on an SSRI that had actually really helped me in college.  I’ve not been diagnosed BPD, but I acknowledge I have traits, and my husband’s therapist apparently in listening to his descriptions of me suggested the same.  He has some major traits as well.  
I’ve had a healthy romantic relationship since we split, which really helped me heal.  But I can’t seem to fully keep him out of my life.  We hurt each other so deeply, but we also had such a beautiful life before that (honestly wholesome when he wasn’t drinking to excess).  I just couldn’t help but ask the question.

Over here severely questioning myself and my relationship thanks to TikTok,1714608785.0,"Hey, 19M here. I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend [21M] for seven months now, and it’s been a lot for both me and him. This is my first ever real relationship, and I’ve learned and grown so much from it. I’ve been very open with him about my mental health, and he’s been open with me about his in turn, and overall things have been really good between us. He’s very patient and tries to be understanding and supportive with me through all my issues.

The thing that’s getting to me is these posts I’m seeing, mainly screenshots on TikTok of Reddit posts from people who have been involved with pwBPD. I’m doubting myself all over again like I was in the beginning of my relationship. “What if I don’t really love him?” “What if I’ve been manipulating him this whole time?” “What if I’m delusional about my relationship?” “What if I’m bringing him down?” “What if he’s going to grow to resent me?” “What if he already does?” “I must be too much”. It’s all coming back to me. I understand that people with BPD can be very destructive in their relationships. My mother is an undiagnosed borderline and she is the most manipulative, abusive, and borderline (lol) psychotic person you’ll ever meet. But I at the same time I don’t see myself as the same.

 I know my triggers, I know the ways in which my BPD affect me and cause issues. I do what I can to keep those volatile reactions inside or at least try to vent them out in a somewhat healthy manner. I communicate openly and honestly with my partner. Being in a relationship has caused a lot of unforeseen issues to flare up in me, but I would consider myself self-aware and I do everything I can to better myself in spite of those issues. I’m nowhere near as codependent as I was two months ago when I first came to the realization that I was. I don’t want to believe that I’m going to be the ruin of my boyfriend’s life. I do genuinely believe that I love him. I believe this is the first form of healthy love I’ve ever experienced in my life and I’m so grateful for it. But what if none of that’s real? What if deep down I’m still as low-functioning and neurotic as I was at my worst? 

What if I don’t know what real love is, what if I’m just destined to fuck up anyone who ever gets close to me?

To start off, I (21) am very nervous writing this post. I am not sure if I have bpd, and I am not asking readers to evaluate whether I have it, but more so how should I go about being evaluated professionally?

The background shortened is that I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, EDNOS, and ADHD.

Not sure what to do...,1714545634.0,"This is a burner account.  My wife and I are poly and we met a woman who became our girlfriend for a about a year.  A few months in I started to notice a pattern of very aggressive behavior towards her family, but never towards us.  I just figured she had a bad temper and was blowing off steam.  She was never that way towards us until one day I made an unplanned stop at a bank to get cash and she just about tore my head off and said she would just walk home.

I started putting the pieces together and asked her if she had BPD, because I had seen this sort of thing before.  She admitted she did and she lied to be about it because of her fear of abandonment.

We agreed to stay with her on the grounds that she would get some help with it, and her family offered to pay for everything.  4 months after that, no attempts were made to get therapy and I found out that she had been having sex with other people and didn't tell me.  I'm not sure why she felt the need to lie, it was an open relationship and I didn't really care, but after that things changed.  I just asked her not to lie about it in the future.  Unfortunately, that's not all she was lying about.  She lied about her employment history, her living situation, owning a car, and managed to infect both of us with an STD she picked up.  Things started to unravel pretty quickly.

She started getting more and more aggressive with me, and her family.   I wanted to end the relationship but I was concerned that she would retaliate.  Finally, in the middle of one of her many rants I just let it slip that the relationship was over.  I couldn't deal with her threats and her lies anymore. 

She immediately accused me and my wife of SA and said she would report us to the police.she threatened to kill us and our animals before I blocked her. The next day she threatened to off her family and burn down her house (which she didn't actually own) and she was put in a psych lockup.

They released her without warning and she has stayed away from us, but she immediately went back to terrorizing her family.

I got word that last night she called the police, from another state, and told them that her former roommates had actually broken into her home.  They handcuffed them and put them in police cars until they could verify residence.

She has driven across the country in a stolen car with the intent of burning down rental homes her family owns.  She sent pictures today to her stepfather that she has entered the state where he owns property. I advised him to notify the police even though the police are absolutely worthless and do nothing to stop her.  I am concerned that no one is going to do anything until she hurts someone.  There are people living in the homes she is threatening.  She doesn't care.  She has declared ""war"" on all of us.

I told my family I was homeless and well they told me to get my ass back here. My friend and my mom's friend were figuring out something and I even thought of stuff as well. I had to leave here. My ex is in this town I live in trying to find me to apparently kill me. Plus another guy I turned down last week is looking for me now as well. I couldn't go to the place where all the homeless sleep and hang out cause they know that place and would look for me there. 
I leave 3a my time and arrive Friday 3a Illinois time. I get to take my dogs with me on the trip home. I'm happy about that one. 
I'm probably going to have a job when I get home and settled in.  
I will miss all of my friends here in Arizona to. But I'll be happy as well to see my family and my friends there as well. 
I'm nervous about going back home. Apparently my town has changed so much that I might get lost and confused lol so that might be interesting with that one. 🤔 
I'm actually going to miss this guy I see on and off. I was hoping to see him tonight but that didn't happen again. 😕  I hope he will stay in contact with me and maybe come visit me in Illinois.  We shall see on that one.  

Being homeless you really need to be strong and learn the streets. I did my best I could have done. But 2 ankle bitters and a knife at that place was certainly not enough for me to feel safe. 😕  it was the first time being homeless on my own. I did learn alot about the county I lived in. There is no resources at all there and no damn homeless shelters but only 1 there and the other is an abuse shelter. This is why our town Is filled with them. All I have to say is God bless them.

Please please PLEASE tell me the stupidest reason you have ever split… ,1714537926.0,"I just split on my FP and it wasn’t even bc of anything HE did… 😓 me and him are in a facebook group with his (yes HIS) friends, and one of his friends (we will call him Kenny) had posted a message telling their other buddy (we will call him John) to “next time you do the deed say yea like he does” talking about some wrestler LA Knight I think his name is, and to do it “like mid-pump or something” and my FP, also my husband, posted a gif saying “YEEAAAAA” and then laugh reacted to both of Kenny’s messages.

For a little back story, I have never been very comfortable with this friend of his bc my FUCKING PARASITE tells me that they’re too close as friends 😒 and bc it seems like every time they talk the conversation ends up being about sex. I have even went as far as accusing them both of touching each other and keeping each others secret while splitting bc Kenny is a straight DICK FRIEND… 🙁 they’re always falling out bc Kenny doesn’t know when to stop and keep his mouth shut and doesn’t respect boundaries that my FP has set regarding mine and his marriage and talking shit about me 🙄 And just the way Kenny talks to my FP like he’s his wife, bitching at him for not getting on the game with him and not spending time with him and always complaining bc he wants to spend time with US, HIS FAMILY… 😤🤯

So I split on my FP asking who Kenny was talking about imitating, and he told me he would send me a TikTok of who he was talking about. I told him to send it to my messages and he sent it to my TikTok and by then my adrenaline already spiked and my hands started shaking just thinking about so I snapped about that and told him HE was making a big deal about sending it to my messages when I really could have just went and looked at it… 😑 and then he says, “so what personality am I dealing with right now?

"I (24M) lost my job, my girlfriend left me, and I am friendless. It is all my fault...",1714522291.0,"Hi, so I've been looking for a place where I can share my story. I hope I am not wasting your time with this long story. If I do, apologies.

I have been diagnosticated with BPD since college. I was quite lonely growing up. My parents initially divorced a year after my older brother was born because they couldn't get along. A few years later they met again at a party, got drunk, and basically I happened. And they were forced to remarry out of fear for how their families would react. I come from an Eastern European religious society. 

But basically I was an accident. So growing up they got me toys, a TV, a computer, games, anything just to keep me busy and not deal with me. My brother did the same. My grandmother actually cared to spend time with me when visiting, but she died when I was 10. Heart attack, in front of me. I watched her die.

I was bullied in school. I didn't have friends. In high school I started having friends and learning self defense, but any friends I made, they eventually left. I had no one around and any time someone got close to me I was already too attached and any time they were doing stuff with someone else I felt abandoned and useless, like everyone else was better. 

After a failed 3 months relationship, I went into therapy during college and I learned I had BPD. But when I started making progress my parents removed me from therapy because they couldn't afford anymore and they thought I was getting better so I wouldn't need it anymore. Then the pandemic hit and isolation coupled with the fact that I was infected with covid ruined it all. 

At the end of 2021 I attempted suicide so I got again into therapy. Then a couple of months into 2022 I met the woman that is now my ex. Again therapy was working, I was making progress, that woman fell in love with me, but when I got into the relationship with her my parents again cut my therapy because it was too expensive and if I found someone why would I need it. 

She tried her best to help me and she actually succeeded, but she too had mental disorders (anxiety, bipolarity) and I too tried my best to help her. However, in my case I was kinda copying the way she was helping me, because I didn't know any other way. And that didn't worked. Which gave rise to arguments. Our relationship had ups and downs but we loved each other very much.

However, my abandonment issues came every time she was hanging out with her friends. They worse activated when one of them told me to not come with them to a party, and I snapped and attacked the person. My girlfriend took my side and she left the group. She told me she was better off just having me but later in the relationship she complained about missing them. Again I got triggered and had an argument. I felt sorry for ruining her social life and offered to make new friends together which she accepted. But still more and more arguments rose because of my BPD. I graduated as an engineer in 2023 and I got a job in an automotive company. Then after passing probation and saving some money to move in my owm house while also buying items I needed, I got back into therapy because I didn't want to lose her. And because at my workplace I had a hard time keeping calm under pressure or under yelling from my team leader. 

Again, I was making progress and I was starting to somewhat fix both my work and my relationship, even being told by my manager at the Christmas party to prepare for promotion on a new project. But in January of this year the same manager came to tell me I will be laid off without offering a reason why, when my tasks were completed and I had that promotion coming up. I was devastated and due to that I could no longer afford therapy. What I saved was not that good enough to afford it until a new job came, I had to keep my pocket full too now that I was jobless and I gave up on moving away. I was a mess, my parents offered only criticism and no support, and arguments came again with my girlfriend because she was tired of my depressive moods. I tried looking for a job, but abandonment issues hit again when my girlfriend was getting closer to some guys. I also happened to develop asthma in the years since covid because, while already existing dust and pollen allergies were already risking factors, the virus weakened me further. I saw its first violent manifestation during the onset of spring.

And then at the end of March my girlfriend broke up with me. Saying it was better for both of us but then admitting that she couldn't stand all this mental and physical health issues. 

I begged my parents to get me back into therapy but they refused. I didn't had enough money either. Whatever few friends I had left me too. My parents criticized me for not doing anything with my life other than grieving so I started hiding my emotions. I desperately struggled to find a new job, a new girlfriend, new friends, to also finish my master's degree, I tried focusing on myself and my hobbies, but one night while I was showering I had a severe headache and I vomited. My nose bled. My chest hurt. While I was trying to reach my room I collapsed on the floor. When I woke up in the hospital my entire body hurt, I felt like throwing up, and during my time being unconscious my body got a psoriasis outbreak. Turns out focusing on myself and hiding my emotions caused my nervous system to shut down. BPD was this time too powerful for my body and mind to handle. 

It took days to recover. To be able to walk, eat or be normal again. They still refuse to get me back into therapy. I could only visit a psychiatrist to get medicine to calm myself down. Those money I saved, whatever I could I used for medicine. I got back to my hunt for a job, friends and girlfriend. I met someone online but she barely talks to me. She is a nurse, probably working in shifts leaves little time to herself, but again i'm afraid that she doesn't like me because if she did, she could have replied while on the bus at least. 

I am lonely. I have an uncertain future ahead. Still no luck with the job, no luck with friends or a relationship. No way to do therapy either without a job. I do feel suicidal. I tried to convince myself that the sun will shine again, that I don't deserve to be alone or to suffer. But how could I not deserve this, when it was all my fault? I tried to fix things. BPD and my upbringing may not be my fault, but I feel guilty for my actions and even for BPD and how I was treated. I was an accident. I feel like I deserve my punishment.

Her boyfriend broke up with her and she is devastated. Recently another relationship she was in just ended, and I know she is badly hurt. 
I love her so much and I have been trying to learn more about BPD and how I can support her. 
I have noticed when she is going through a hard time, especially with rejection, she will reach out to me and we always end up fighting. I try to say supportive things and be positive and she gets bitter and always turns it around on me. It gets to the point where I can never say the right thing and I am just upsetting her more. 
She gets really mean and starts lashing out and says that I hate her and everybody would be better off without her and threatens suicide. If I tell her to call a hotline, she has said that shows how little I care about her.

It really breaks my heart because I just want to help her or at least support her and I feel like I am always doing the wrong thing. 

Do you have advice for how you want to be talked to when you are having a bpd episode? 

These calls have become so frequent now and I have a job and a young daughter and my own life and if I can’t drop everything and talk to my sister, she immediately starts blowing up my phone and says I should be happy that she is out of my life and she will never contact me again. She says  that my mom and I hate her and don’t care about her and she’ll be better off dead. 
Meanwhile, I am in the office in a meeting with my CEO and I literally cannot talk to her at the time. She will call me on the phone, make rude comments about how unfair it is that I have a boyfriend and then hang up on me. Then she’ll get mad if I haven’t called her back. 
It’s exhausting when I suggest talking to her therapist she always tells me that her therapist has fired her. I’ve suggested DBT therapy, but she hasn’t tried it. 

How can I be supportive of her while also drawing some boundaries?  
I am a person too. She never asks how I am doing or apologizes for the hurtful way she treats me.  if it was anyone else, this relationship would not have continued. But she is my sister and I love her so much it hurts.

She also lives several states away, so it’s not like we can hang out regularly.

I don’t know what to do with the FP cycle,1714493853.0,"My FP (42m) and I (41f) are super close, and I obviously adore them. We have a complicated history because we were best friends for years as teenagers and they had a huge crush on me which I was unaware of. I was besotted with them, they were my actual best friend (not my FP) and we were quite physically and emotionally close but they never acknowledged their feelings and I think I sensed that as an unspoken rejection so none the less pushed them away. Decades went past and we now live in seperate countries, connected by SM. We recently reconnected and our friendship, bar the physical, is much like it ever was. He admitted his past crush, I admitted my MH struggles, we are both in committed relationships (and mine I acknowledge isn’t meeting my needs which I’m also addressing seperately and I know is a whole other major problem). We talk a LOT, as much as work, commitments and time zones allow, on his part he says we’ve fallen back into the closeness/best friends that we had before. On my part, I agree but I feel like it’s fallen fully FP or maybe also some weird slightly less platonic thing on my part.

Apart from discussing our relationships (much like I do with close girlfriends) we don’t cross any lines. We don’t discuss feelings etc, other than he admitted he’d had a crush on me back when we were teens, which was decades ago. One time, a girlfriend of mine commented she thinks it’s weird we talk as much as we do and queried it being platonic which I relayed and got ‘well of course I don’t but there will always be a special place in my heart for you’ which to be honest made me want to be sick because I’m mental.

Anyways, I can’t work out what to do, I don’t actually want to lose him as a best friend because I’ve been horrifically lonely for years and he’s filled the massive gap really well. But I have the bad FP habits of taking things to heart, reading meaning into things that simply isn’t there, and hugely over reacting. Why wouldn’t someone happily in a relationship with someone else fall in love with me, a married unstable lunatic on another continent 🙈 I don’t even WANT him to. I just want the texts we share as friends! But apparently my head also wants to read everything into something more.

heres my story,1714478998.0,"i broke up with my really shitty ex boyfriend fall of 2019. i was 17 and had just started my senior year of high school. after that i just kinda went crazy. i started drinking excessively every night. and every night i would get super drunk and hook up with my ex in the back of my car. we stayed in communication until january 2020 when i finally felt strong enough to cut things off when he started calling me crazy, getting on his knees and begging me to tell him everything he did wrong (he sexually assaulted me multiple times), and told me that he only loves me because no one else will. i had to physically push him out of my house and i was close to calling the police because he wouldnt leave

he started therapy after we broke up. and his therapist at the time told him that she thinks i have bpd (this was before the diagnosis). i remember when he told me that one of the guys i hooked up with had a girlfriend i ran downstairs and self harmed. and he had to come downstairs and see what i did

after i cut off communication i realized i had hugeee crush on one of the boys in my class. we texted a lot and i took his virginity. the fucked up part is that he had a girlfriend, and i knew about her. i just liked him so much, looking back his was definitely my fp. i was completely obsessed with him, and would get drunk every night and just overshare everything to him

once that semester was over we stopped talking as much, until that spring when i graduated high school. 

summer 2020 i dated another really shitty guy. we dated through out all of summer 2020. he was emotionally abusive and even choked me out one time because he saw my self harm cuts

i broke up with him after i found him texting another girl, but again we stayed in somewhat of communication. 

one night when i was at my lowest and drinking, he left me on open. that hurt so much that i swallowed a bottle of pills and chased it with liquor

i was hospitalized for the first time after that and was diagnosed bipolar

i met my current boyfriend in october 2020, about a month after i was diagnosed 

we have had our ups and downs but overall ive never been happier 

last spring i really wasnt doing well and went into the hospital again (for the third time) and thats where i was diagnosed with bpd

throughout 2019-2020 there was a few other guys that had sexually assaulted me, and that only contributed to the alcohol abuse at the time

i got sober fall of 2021 after blacking out at my boyfriends party (i used to black out every time i drank basically)

when i turned 21 last february i started drinking again socially. ive had a few blackouts since then but its not the same as 2020

overall this is the best ive ever been doing. my boyfriend is so supportive of my mental health. im currently in dbt and am working on getting better

People are painful,1714478737.0,"I wonder if there are a subgroup of people who seek pleasure in causing pain for other people, hear me out. 

I often wonder if it is my fault or the other person for creating such a safe environment initially and then ripping it away.  

Most if not all of my romantic relationships end this way. I meet a guy, im slow to trust but allow myself to get to know them. They begin to create consistency, seeing me often, being the chaser and I give in, I say yes, I see them because I like them back.. and the suddenly they detach, start making promises for dates or seeing each other that they fall through with.  

I have been hurt by men so many times and also women that I am in the phase of my life whereas dating and being intertwined with other people is too painful. From my cowokers being controlling and hyper aware pointing out every little thing I do, from the facial expressions of people reacting to me walking down the street, to the attitudes of doormen and disregarding me..

I was on a date and I went to the bathroom, when I entered the bathroom there was no one there, as soon as i exit the stall there are so many people coming in, I couldn’t focus, I went from washing my hands peacefully to thinking about my outfit, to being rushed to finish washing my hands to standing at the hand dryer to being hit by the door 3 times because who ever designed this bathroom didnt think about the dryer being in direct line of the door. 

I wake up early to use the laundry room at work to change, its like 6AM, no guest is allowed to use our laundry room. I change and everything is fine I think I’ll have some peace and right as I open the door there is some strange man standing right outside of where I was changing, he doesn’t even work there. I was startled, my anxiety started and my entire morning at work was off. 

People can just decide to make you feel small because they feel small on the inside. 

Im so exhausted of people. More and more I learn that I am not “okay” or “perfect” the more and more I realize everyone else is not doing “normal” either and thats even more frightening sometimes, not knowing what issues other people are dealing with on the other end of you communicating with them, so not knowing how to properly assess the intention and interaction between it and the destruction it causes ",SnooPineapples5971,,False,1cgr6be,11,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cgr6be/people_are_painful/

I love her very much and i can imagine a future with her. My whole family loves her too and she likes to be at my house. But since march she has been acting really different. She told me she needed a pause from texting me and that she knows she loves me and she wants nothing more than to be together for the future, but right know she doesn't feel that. My whole world crashed when she told me that, i knew she had bod from the beginning (alongside with other stuff) but i kinda forgot because the time was really beautiful.

Now she is doing and saying things that i never imagined she could. For example, every little thing i do bothers her, she also said i am not changing in the way she told me. We are on a texting pause at the moment, but on the weekend she sends me snaps and even asked me to visit her for one day. But everytime she tells me i need to leave she get's really cold and ignores me, as if i weren't even there or helped her at all on the weekend. She also texts and facetimes a lot with here friend, but cannot talk at all with me. When i asked here why, she told me the friend is an external person and that she can forget all of here problems and can just shut her mind off. But what really bothers me is that in the beginning i was that person for her and it really hurts me. I am trying to understand her bpd and i am informing myself where I can. I just want to talk to her and understand what i can do to support her in those times, or what i can do tho prevent it from happening this bad.
She told me that she felt kind of distant with me since 8 months but didn't want to tell me because she was afraid of my reaction, i understand that she cannot process my emotions right now but if it's things with body or appearance that bother her, i cannot help myself but to get kinda sad.

A gift of BPD,1714426163.0,"I’m in a “lucid” state of mind after just having a two week long episode. I was in a typical deep spiral that felt so awful I was sure I would never feel “good” again physically or mentally. So today, as I’m feeling much better and more “normal” I was noticing how hyper-realistic everything looks and feels compared to the fog I had been in. So I was thinking about how it feels like there’s a film around you during an episode so you can’t see or feel anything clearly, like having plexiglass encapsulating your body so you’re cut off from the rest of the world. Literally the world just looks and feels different than when you’re feeling “normal”. After thinking about that it made me feel so so grateful for this day, to be having a good day of mental clarity, after such a rough time. Then it made me realize how much better this moment/day feels just because I know how awful it COULD feel. Like if I never had my really bad days, today would just feel like any old boring day nothing special. But having been in such a dark place, I feel so much love and appreciation for my home, my family, the sunshine on my face, and my own self. My gut wrenching BPD is actually reflecting to me just how beautiful life can be, when it is so easy to forget (especially if you’re used to it feeling “good”).

Responses desired ,1714424110.0,"My ex followed and unfollowed me on tik tok to get my attention so I’d check out their post about our relationship. It worked. They posted a silly picture skit of it where they unsurprisingly left out the part where they lied to me the entire time and treated me poorly. 

I’m laughing so hard right now because how can someone be so immature? Like seriously? At least I can acknowledge where I went wrong and i apologized for it. I never posted any of our arguments online where other people know about it (this is anonymous, they do it very much not anonymous). They refuse to acknowledge where they went wrong and ‘forgave themself for what they did’. That doesn’t fix anything. 

It’s also kinda saddening because I was holding out the slight hope I could get my old best friend back. That definitely is never going to happen. I find it so infuriating that they refuse to acknowledge their mistakes. 

The thought crossed my mind to make a similar post but I don’t even want to do that? It feels stupid and childish. I want to do something in retaliation but nothing makes sense to. Anything would be petty or giving them the attention they want. I don’t even use tik tok unless I’m looking at something someone sent me. I just hate sitting on this with nothing to do. It’s funny though because that means they aren’t over me either. They still want me to hurt for them

Twenty years later, he ended up with lung cancer. He never smoked. My parent both died of lung cancer after smoking for 50 years. 

My Mum and I were very close. I’m angry. I feel like my parents chose to smoke and leave us when they were 73. They could have lived longer. My Mum left me alone. She chose lung cancer over me. 

My friend that died, he had lung cancer at the same time my Mum did. He died a couple months after my Mum did. I’m shattered at the thought of him suffering the way my Mum and Dad did. He died a couple months after my Mum. It was medically assisted. I respect that. He wouldn’t let his sister call any of his friends.

Split black due to paranoia,1714418911.0,"What do I do when my bf who has BPD is splitting on me due to paranoia? He now basically thinks I’m the enemy. He says that “now he knows who I am”, “that my mask has slipped”, that all the love I’ve given him is “fake”, that “I’m trying to bring him down”…He is extremely angry and he sees all my attemps to reassure him that I love him and I’m not against him as “manipulation”. And he wants me out of his life.
We’ve had a really loving relationship so far but he always had a big problem with paranoia (he also has PTSD), so he always thinks people want to put him down or hurt him, and now he thinks the same way about me no matter how much I’ve tried to build trust.

Any tips on how to navigate this situation? Would love to hear if any of you relate to him. He’s split on me in such an extreme way back in February but we ended up working it out and then had a lovely 2 months until Friday…

How I figured out who I am,1714350726.0,"It's been a while since I've posted. Things got better the past month, with the fruits of mindfulness.

I want to share with the community my personal anecdote, with what was key for me and how the seemingly inert practice on those worksheets that psychs gave me has benefit.

The first key insight is that who I am is not a paragraph that I can write to you. It is not a story. It is not a roleplay. It is not my memories. It is not any idea of what characteristics I do or don't have.

This is because, those are thoughts. Who I am is not so fake and transient as thoughts. Thoughts are basically like farts and should be treated as such.

The second insight is that mindfulness is a safe space. Let's look at the status quo and then look at how mindfulness changes it.

Imagine a dungeon cell. In there there's you, and in a dark corner, you can vaguely sense a child. And the sad reality is that you abuse that child. It's existence is so abhorrent to you that you demand it stay silent and in the darkness, and you don't care how it feels. If it makes any noise you cause it more pain.

That dark imagery is fitting for how I was treating myself and am still conditioned to treat myself. It's shame. Deep shame is at the core of this.

Mindfulness, changing this status quo, says ""hey, I see you in there, and I'm here for you if you want to show yourself. I'll help you and take care of you because I want you to feel at ease."" This is the re-parenting therapists mention sometimes.

So I sit and watch for how I feel in my body and I try to embrace it like that. This is instead of self-abuse. And I've been able to connect with this disconnected part, and how it shows up in my body and mind.

So ""who am I?"" does not have an answer that can be written. But it does have an answer.

I speculate that the disorder of self in BPD and CPTSD is basically a conditioning to deeply shame the true self that's in that dark corner, and to look out of those iron bars at the passers by and try to become a child to them and be what they want, instead of being an adult to the child inside.

To put it concretely, take a look at polyvagal theory. Conceive of states of hyperarousal and hypoarousal as the pain of that inner child. And know that I was able to remediate this by being mindful without hate but with compassion.

The mindfulness is not ""I'm look at you so that you can shut up and get back in the corner and leave me alone.""

The mindfulness is ""I'm really here for you. I have space for you. I'll never leave you, we're together forever.""

Somatically, it caused me to relax like I had never relaxed before.

Hope that made some sense to someone. It's a personal anecdote, not advice.

Dating and BPD,1714338948.0,"Dating with BPD feels awful.

I’m a 25 y/o girl with high functionning BPD since diagnosis. In context, I am a high acheiver that has always academically gifted. BPD came out of nowhere in my life after I spiralled down after a breakup with a boyfriend at 21. I did DBT. It helped especially with the inner symptoms of BPD (impulsivity, empty feelings, paranoia, chronic suicidal ideation, self harm).

I’m at the point of my life where I’m ready to let someone in again. I dated a few people for the past years. Mostly situationships with men I felt were not a good fit for me. I thrived of the delusion of liking their potential more then the men themselves. My impulsivity made me easy. I slept with most of them. However, I’m deeply trying to put a stop to this. 
 
I’m talking to a guy I like. He is consistent. It’s been 2 weeks. My BPD brain wants to rush things, I want to be his girlfriend otherwise I feel like I’m spiraling down in my irrational thoughts. 

I’ve tried deconstructiong my irrational thoughts and cligning on to the facts like DBT thoughts me. How can I learn to be patient and just enjoy the process with spiraling down in anxious thoughts and self-destruction. The amount of anxiety I feel makes me want to cut off all ties with him.

FP: I don’t think you’re toxic and I don’t think you’re a frustrating person to be around at all. I just sometimes get confused what I did wrong or how I can help like if we are joking around and then you get mad at me I just don’t know what to do 

Me: Ok well I have issues u don’t have to see me anymore if u don’t want to I get it.

FP: Gracie what
That is not productive can you be rational. 
Of course I love you and am still your friend please stop.
can you just have a conversation about this please I just want to be able to help you when that happens without you getting upset.

Me: Ok well I’m sorry I just think that u dont wanna hang out with me now bc of how I act and I don’t  even know how to not act like that.
So I was trying to distance myself bc it’s not ur fault 
It’s me

FP: That’s not true I want to be your friend I just don’t know what I do wrong and I’m sorry. 
I feel like a bad friend 

Me: 
No your not a bad frejnd it’s just that I consider you one of my best friends so I just feel very insecure around u now bc I don’t wanna say anything that will make me seem like I’m a bad friend 
Bc of when I get in a bad mood.I don’t mean to always make u feel bad everytime we hang out.

FP: That’s not true 
Don’t feel that way please.
In those moment I just want to help because I care about you and want to understand what’s wrong you know.

Me:  Ok I have been trying really hard to change bc ik that if i keep acting like that ppl won’t like me.

FP: I  will always like you.
I love you I’m legit obsessed with you 
You’re one of my best friends 
I just want you to be happy 

Me: Ok good I’m really glad we had this conversation bc I really love you I don’t want to loose u bc ur one of the coolest pepeople I know and I don’t want u to ever think I DOTN like u when I am distant bc I’m just trying to stop myself from making me say something that I will regret 
Sometimes when I don’t take my medication I act abnormal.

FP: I understand 
Just talk to me
I’m never really truly mad at you 
If it looks like I anger it’s really just hurt in a way and I want things to be okay .

Me: Okay and I should probably go back to thearpy to fix myself 

FP: You don’t need to be fixed. 
That isn’t what I want you to feel like.

Me: No I do bc I’m immature and don’t take care of my mental disorder like I should and it will come crashing down on me
 thought u we’re never gonna like me again and I just panicked I’m really sorry
I won’t do it again

FP: no of course not

Me: ok good.

Sister gets annoyed and tells me she wished I die when she knows how much ive been struggling with suicidal ideation,1714316769.0,"I already posted on here already about my 14 year old sister, but I defintely want some outsider perspectives on her and my behavior as it helps me a lot. I walked in on my sister working and played the piano bc shes been studyin for the past 6 hours straight and i couldnt play. So i went i played, i knew this pissed her off but tbh i was annoyed at her for hogging the room for 6 hours and not allowing me to play so i couldnt care less in the moment. Also annoying my sister is something mutual, weve always annoyed each other since we were young lmao. 

So i come in and shes like ""get out"", i ignore her as i feel she has had her fair share of room time and isnt about to make any compromises the way i know her, so i continue. Then she goes on to say ""you do know noone likes you"", ""i hope you die"", ""atleast i go to school and dont sit on my ass all day doing nothing like you, cuz im not a failure... like you""- in short, everything she could possibly think of would hurt me and get under my skin cuz she knows exactly i struggled with both rejection, suicidal ideation, depressive episodes and physical health issues aswell making me feel more often than not unable to go to school. I have been struggling so much, i have fought through some of the worst suicidal epidsodes ive ever experienced almost completely on my own (when my FP left me) as i was at the time in between therapists switching so there was no proper therapy going on, i was on a school exchange at the time so away from family except for my dad whom i couldnt tell about this bc i didnt wanna get locked up, and also- I promised this girl i wouldnt involve anyone- so i fought it basically all on my own. I had one friend i occasionally talked to but this friend is very cold bc hes struggling w mental health too. To cut it short, suicidal ideation was something very real and very personal to me, something i struggled with mostly completely on my own especially during my school exchange. Especially cuz i vowed i wouldnt tell anyone, with the exeption being my cold friend that i stopped talking about it to cuz i felt worse. So hotlines were my only savior at times and at times they didnt pick up. It was horrific and im not looking for a pitty party i just want to bring across how hard of a time ive had to deal with this specific topic. And for someone to know that ive been in and out of mental hospitals since 16 and to spew comments like that, that she knows will get under my skin, just bc shes annoyed at me playing the piano, is something very frustrating for me.

Thank you to everyone—my last post here and reflection on my BPD husband (ex),1714312328.0,"My husband has expressed he no longer wants to be with me. He told me that talking to me makes him miserable and he has no intentions of reaching out. I tried my best to ask what about talking to him makes him miserable? I felt insulted because I’ve been so loving and so patient and I know it’s not anything I’ve said. I’ve been very careful with my words to him for ages…

He wasn’t clear when he left last year. He told me “i just feel like I need to leave, I don’t know why”. He flipped back and forth for the past year—taking me out on dates and telling me he wants to be with me so imagine my surprise when he says he doesn’t anymore. This is why I tried my best to exude patience, understanding (especially when he tried to harm himself) and love because I take my vows seriously—for better or for worse as I knew something was wrong. 

He wouldn’t let me talk to him on the phone as he said talking to me is not good for his mental health as he’s unable to manage his emotions, so I’ve been reduced to texts for a month or so. 

I called him out on his terrible treatment (emotional abuse) of me and dragging out his decision of whether he wants to stay with me. He told me that I just don’t like he’s not talking to me and I get like this. I called him out so he can talk to his therapist and how I’d want someone to calm me out as well.

I did it out of love as I just wanted him to know I’m there and I don’t want to abandon him, but it’s not enough for him. I told him he may be splitting …idk…

I still don’t want my marriage to end. I still love him dearly, and part of me does feel it’s my fault. 

Im going to increase my therapy appointments…and try to remind myself it’s not my fault.  

Thank you for everyone’s guidance. Part of feels deep down he’ll do a 180…part of me wants that and another part…doesn’t.

How to deal with a rude teenager sister that does rude things just for the sake of it,1714311024.0,"My sister is a teen now sigh. She turned 14 this year and has been acting shitty lately and i wanna deal with it better. These things tend to be on the rude, inconsiderate side and I want to not be so bothered by these things as it doesnt make me feel any better. 

Today for instance I was on my way home and felt alone, so I picked up my phone to call my sister. No answer (thats fine). I called home phone because i really wanted to tell my sister some things. No answer. I come home and shes sitting there on her desk working, with no headphones on. Im not gonna lie, i get she was busy and i know you will say this too, but she just sat there no shits given, doesnt pick up for shit (whats if there was an emergency) and then doesnt even say something like im busy. Like i can digest she was busy, thats fine, i get that, but the fact she heard it all and knew i wanted to talk and didnt even send a message like hey i cant talk right now or im busy and just sits on her ass and ignores it pissed me off. Just the there were calls coming in thta couldve been important and you just sit on your ass ignoring them, when you knew i was trying to reach you/ at least send me something, i feel so ignored otherwise. 

When i told her how i felt she was like uh yeah sorry i didnt hear it, and just went back to working.

Second time, i was telling her a story and i was getting to the main plot and was super hyped up. I was telling her about the club i went to and how i got hit on by this big buff german guy. I was so excited to tell her and then she just walked out on me to get her clothes from the other room while i was talkking about this important moment. I was just getting to the best part and she just walks out, no care in the world. i cant even describe how infuriating it is to have someone just be so rude and inconsiderate and then when you confront them its like ""what the hell its not that deep"", \*insert eye rolling\*. Anyways she went out to her room that wasnt so far away, she could still hear me, but still i felt as though she didnt care enough to listen and it felt so like ""what you say isnt that important to me"", its just- hurtful. 

The worst part is when i confront her about these minor little occurances, ones where she acts in inconsiderate ways towards me, she rolls her eyes and doesnt wanna hear it. Yes i tell her very assertively and straight forward that she hurts my feelings, but she thinks its not that deep and im just too sensitive. I do talk in a slightly passive agressive way sometimes, I do admit, i get so frustrated and i feel as though when i talk in a completely calm way she wouldnt get the gist and im letting her off the hook and i feel as though i didnt get even. And yes its childish, i know. But regardless of whether i talk in a kind of passive agressive manner she doesnt listen and rolls her eyes. And it is so fuckin infuriating. What can I do? Be honest, i know im still learning how to react in these situations and they arent ideal yet.

"PwBPD, how do you want to be treated after a split episode? ",1714309958.0,"My partner has undiagnosed BPD but he does agree he has it, he just hasn't had an official diagnosis.

We had about a 6 month stint of working well together in managing his episodes after a near divorce, but after some very challenging times he started to have more episodes and has gotten to the point of claiming to not even remember having conversations we had 2 weeks ago about getting back into working on reactions that he was fully supportive of. He is blaming me now for just wanting to change him despite me saying how much I love him and it's not HIM I want to change, just the reactions, something I thought would be understood at this point with everything we've been through. 

Anyway... I'm curious what the best approach is after a splitting episode. What is the best thing to say when they're in their apologetic phase that will have the most effective impact on making them feel supported and loved but also knowing that things need to change to sustain a healthy relationship? I'm stuck in a cycle right now where I think we'll have a good conversation, and he'll be on board, and then one to two weeks later ""forget"" he even agreed with me at all.

how to manage hypersexuality??,1714307445.0,"hi guys! from a young age, i had placed all of my worth in sexual attention from men. i felt that, no matter how worthless and annoying i was, if i could at least be sexually satisfying, it would make up for it. i’m sure this is probably the case for a lot of us.

over time, this has morphed into me feeling worthless if my fiance and i don’t have sex once or twice a day. i worry that he doesn’t find me attractive anymore and that i can’t satisfy him because i’m so repulsive.

i’ve been changing my meds just about every month, and between that, the end of my semester, and financial struggles, i’ve been feeling extremely depressed, which has ironically enough boosted my sex drive tremendously. i think it makes me feel better during and after, and it’s something i enjoy a lot.

however, my partner is starting to worry that i’ll be upset if he doesn’t feel up to it. i’ve never been upset with him for not wanting to, and i never ever want to make him feel pressured. when i brought up how my drive has been higher, he encouraged me to initiate more (i used to only do so very rarely), but i worry it’s coming across like that’s all i want when it isn’t the case at all.

Am I just a bad friend?,1714278640.0,"Long post and gratitious over-sharing ahead.

I (16M) used to be on good terms with many people in my class and my mind lived in delusion where they were going to be in my life forever. Because of my BPD-like symptoms, everyone started feeling distant towards me and I activated my people-pleasing era so I can win them back. And it turned things for the worse. After a falling out with a supposed 'friend' who was actually using me for money, almost everyone in the class unfollowed and bailed on me and it was the lowest point of my life. And it was right after I suffered a public panic attack inside the classroom. You know where this is going.

The only friend I have is a girl who was also a little bit socially awkward but we genuinely enjoyed each other's time together. We would laugh a lot, have deep talks, talk about our favorite singers, all that. Until one day, things started to change. She started interacting with the people who went AWOL on me and I started to get jealous. They would also give out invites to her while I just watched. I pulled her aside and angrily told her 'I keep telling you not to hang out with them yet you aren't listening!' and she gave me an earful about it. She reminded me about how I was getting close and overstepped the boundaries and that I shouldn't rely on her. It caused a strain within our friendship and I would begin to split and go into episodes of paranoria wondering if she was ever going to ghost me. But we would then fix things and clear the misunderstanding.

The next time, everyone in the class was presenting and everyone was always smiling and was attentive but when it came to me, no one was listening and everyone was on their phones and barely clapped. I threw a silent hissy fit and wrote an Instagram story during class ranting about how my old 'friend' flaked on me, how everyone betrayed me, angrily put down the ones who labeled me as an attention-seeker and concluded it with 'You and your friends are full of s••t. You always see the bad in the good. Go f••• yourselves.' Needless to say she saw the story and confronted me about it, gave me another earful and that was the last time we've spoken since. It's been two weeks. I ended up locking myself in the bathroom at my home and silently bawled. I was going pretty close to cutting her out my life but I realized that maybe I'm just the villain. I'm pointing fingers at villains, yet I'm one myself. But on a brighter note, I did heal myself by watching Kimi Ni Todoke.

I do admit, I have been a pretty bad person to her for a while ever since half the class flaked on me. Number one, I was always going to her ranting about how almost everyone in the class is so fake and how I was devaluing them. Number two, I keep advising her to not talk to the guy who used me for money. Number three, I started displaying passive-aggresiveness towards her and offered backhanded compliments such as 'They like you more than me. You should be happy.'

During the second earful, she said that she misses the old me and that I've gotten worse. Here are some quotes that still roam around my head from that day.

""You've gotten worse.""

""You've changed physically, but have you changed mentally? You used to be so nice and you were always interacting in the class group chat. You would even say a lot of good things about everyone.""

""I'm not gonna be in your life forever, and you can't rely on me just because I'm your only friend.""

""u/musicproducer07, even your mother is getting sick of what you're saying. I'm aware of what they did to you. But you need to move on and forgive yourself.""

What she meant by the second one is that right after the whole fake friend money incident, I ended up losing 15kg, changed my style from bright, cheerful to dark and gloomy and she started saying that I was becoming more spiteful. I overshared everything to her even the time I almost took a knife to my neck during an episode. I got so close to screaming at her during the earful but I decided not to because everyone else was outside.

It's not that she's a bad person. She's really sweet and is always cheery, but I feel like I'm being a vampire these days and just sucking the brightness out of her because of me being extremely negative. All because she started talking with the people who pretended to be my friend who right after maliciously excludes me from everything.

And that brings us to the end of this. A part of me is severely guilty. I just hate how I am unable to control my jealousy and it just completely sucks. It's not that I like her, but she's my only friend and I don't want to ruin another one because of this supposed condition. I got too attached like how I got attached with everyone in the class. I asked my mum about it and said that it was particularly my fault because of my increasing jealousy towards the people in the class. I hate how my mental health ruins things. I just want it to bloody end.

I hate how manipulative I am to the point where it's pushing the one person who truly cherishes my presence. I did everything to change, yet I don't even know if I truly am changing.

Anyways if you're still reading, thank you. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Please let me know if there's any things that I really need to fix. I want to fix things with her but I'll lay low for a bit I guess...thank you.",musicproducer07,,False,1cexuge,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cexuge/am_i_just_a_bad_friend/

Need help with BPD husband ,1714264112.0,"I dont know what to do anymore.   The littlest thing sets him off and he's angry at me, telling me I'm making him the ""Evil One"".  Today it was because he had an accident in the car - he wet himself because he didn't make it to the bathroom on time.   He texted and told me.   I said fine, it happens and he was going to stay out until he dried.  

When he got home, I told him to go change because supper is ready.   Literally all I said.   He was acting weird - when he's having a bpd episode, he gets really defensive, can't speak properly, can't walk properly and is extremely angry.  And me telling him to change set him off.  

We have an agreement when he's splitting, that I tell him calmly and so I did.   

He got back into the car, and drove away.  He told me I ""shamed"" him by asking him to change and I've turned him into the ultimate evil.  

Splitting happens almost daily.   He is so angry at me when it happens.   ""It takes two to tango"" and ""I'm not giving him mercy or grace"".   He goes so far into hatred of me and self hatred and can't see that he is creating this!

It's my birthday tomorrow.  All I wanted was a happy house.  Now I'm bawling in the bathroom and he won't stop texting me, telling me I'm turning our son against him.   Our son knows Dad is ""off"", he's 12 and has a really good idea that something is really wrong with Dad.  

I dont know what to do anymore.  Can someone please explain what is going on and what I'm supposed to do?   I also have some health issues and all of this stress is really hurting me and slowing my healing.

Instrumental attitude towards people after splitting,1714258360.0,"I’m not sure what’s the purpose of my post, it may be just chaotic venting. But I feel confused and sad and don’t know how to manage my relationships with people.

Recently (during last year) I ended two friendships. I’m not sure if I split on those people, as I guess splitting is mostly about FP? But the term “splitting” does fell right. Now I feel sad, but not that I lost two friends, but because I can’t hang out with them and fill my time, so I feel lonely. So I’m thinking about them instrumentally. Basically anyone could take their place and it would be fine with me.

I function quite well, I probably have quiet BPD, am successful at work and have a few satisfying friendships. But recently I have finished two of them. One was because I realized that it doesn't work for me. Some of her behaviours were very problematic for me as a friend: focused on herself each time we met, not giving me any support in times when I needed it, being oversensitive to even hints of criticism, etc. So in this case I feel like it was a good decision but I still think sometimes that it would be nicer if I would not be so sensitive about it and accept her how she is. We could hang out sometimes and I wouldn't feel so lonely.

The fact of ending second friendship should bother me but somehow it doesn't. She is a very intelligent, sensitive person, we shared many important experiences. But we had this absolutely stupid fight about a guy. After that I just went numb. I don't care about her anymore. I know I should feel sad about losing her, she was important for me, but I don't give a shit. The only thing I am sad about is that I can't talk with her about some of our common interests, but it’s not like I miss HER. Again, I started to think about her in a very instrumental way. It wasn’t like that when we were friends at all. I don’t really treat people instrumentally.

But tbh I wish I could. I wish I could just pretend everything was fine, bottle everything up or just don’t give a shit and keep those friends to spend time with, so I don’t feel lonely. Or keep relationships on a superficial level so nothing wrong can really happen, instead of going super deep, as I always do. Losing two close friends in a year is a lot.

And today I’m feeling like ending yet another relationship, although it won’t happen probably, cause it’s my neighbour and she cares about me. There was a misunderstanding between us, I was angry at her but today she apologized and we are “good”. But inside I wish she would just disappear. Or do something stupid again. It’s like being angry and conflicted with her was easier for me than current situation, when I feel guilty that my anger worried her. And here’s another issue of BPD: I don’t trust my feelings, part of me assumes I “overreacted” and the guilt comes from this place.

I just can’t manage relationships, they overwhelm me. If anything wrong happens in them, I just want to ghost people or kind of wish they disappear or that I die and I don’t have to deal with this burden. Because relationships feel like burden.

Blocked FP and ex best friend who also has BPD after hearing about them together,1714254587.0,"I feel like absolute shit so I just need to vent. Met this friend around the same time I met my FP. Me and this friend bonded over us having BPD which she found out from her asking if me and my FP were together and I said that “I don’t know but I usually stay away from relationships because of my BPD.” Later down the line, my FP was basically leading me on, to the point where everyone around us thought we were together and it was a mutual attraction. When I confessed feelings he friendzoned me. Which ya know, wasn’t great. But through all of this I had my friend who had BPD who I could go to because she understood the feelings I was feeling. I went to her crying over this guy to her and she was supportive and everything. Later down the road I noticed my FP and this friend of mine hanging out more and excluding me from things. Hearing from other friends that this friend of mine makes comments about my FP like “oh we’d make a cute couple, we’d have such cute babies” while also joining his gym, joining his church (she was non religious), and her and him having their Dnd characters being love interests. Just doing shady things behind my back that made her interactions with my FP just coincidence, but not because they liked each other.

This came to a head yesterday when one of my FPs friends told me they made out at one point and that a few days ago that she called him crying that she got locked out of her app and that she stayed at his house. 

I’m absolutely shattered and I feel so betrayed. I recognize that my FP told me he wasn’t interested and I shouldn’t care what he does with his personal life because of that. But the fact that this friend, what seems like now from the get go was using me to get to him is getting to me. I blocked their numbers yesterday, blocked their socials, and blocked anyway for them to contact me without any explanation. I feel guilty for not explaining myself I feel so shitty. Why wasn’t I enough? What did I do to  have someone do something so shitty to me? There was never a moment that I let off anything externally, anything I struggled with I kept to myself so why do I deserve this? I just don’t know what to do or feel.

"just need support or advice, haven’t been nice lately and feel awful :/ ",1714239320.0,"soooo back story ish, i kinda fucked up my mg of my mood stabilizers a few weeks ago, i want to say around 3. i was taking 100mg of topamax for a year, and then my psych wanted me to take an extra 50 in the morning but i ended up not liking it so i THOUGHT. i got rid of the 50mg tablets and kept using the 100mg tablets, but i got rid of the 100s and kept using the 50s. 

so i was on half my dosage for like a month, that sucked, but i finally read the bottle and figured it out and started the right dose again. 

however its been the 3 weeks of taking the 100 again, i know meds take a second to get into your system, but i dont think its working the same? the topamax was REALLY helping me lose weight before. suppressing my appetite, i was pooping all the time, i had hella energy, i lost abt 5 pounds a month give or take and it was intentional, ive been on a weight loss journey for abt a year as well. i also have felt incredible for the last year, stable, happy, just normalish with occasional depression or anxiety yk? 

now taking it feels like nothing, it feels like my meds just aren’t working. i usually can watch like stupid takes on tiktok and be unaffected and like not comment an insult or argue on twitter and not be like,,, affected irl but lately ive been getting that feeling in my brain during those things of like.. i need to punch smth or scream or im going to pass out like its BAD. i haven’t felt that in SO LONG. i also have been so, so mean to my boyfriend and i know i have. i adore him, but it feels like i have no feelings for him anymore at times. it isn’t the truth, i absolutely do, but some days i literally don’t want to hear him speak. i miss him. i just lash out at things id brush off or entirely ignore before. do i just need a higher dose, do i wait it out, do i hate my bf, like what do i DO? even just some words of affirmation if you don’t have experience with this would be awesome 🥲 love u guys, hope ur well🩷

My (28f) Boyfriend said I love you (28m) before ending things.,1714236316.0,"*mentions of self harm*

He was a friend of 7 years. I did not notice any issues and we had lots of laughs over the phone and in person. He wanted to try to date me last year.

Fast forward to recently.
He took me to a beautiful local park, and after the walk, he ended things, leaving me devastated since things were improving. He broke up three times around the same period last year in March/April. I saw him with fresh SH wounds so I left. We stayed close while he underwent therapy. He fell for me again and we had 5 good months from my view. I checked in with him and hw said he was happy. 

I accidently triggered him when I lost his promise ring. This time, I cried and prayed out loud for him, said he got a lot better because he communicated instead of hurting himself and I'm proud of him, then he acknowledged I was right to try, so he took me home.

He held me close, thanked me for pulling him away from the ledge, and said I was his rock, his voice of reason. He expressed his love for me, and we attempted to work it out for two days. We practiced communicating feelings and role-playing situations. However, he confessed he still felt unhappy despite everything seeming great on paper, I was his dream girl, but he felt the need to create space. He apologized for running away and insisted on treating it as a breakup, expressing that he was in a lot of pain, more than I was, which I found hard to comprehend.

I asked if he wanted me to leave his life. He cried, picked at his nails, and shook his head. So we agreed on a date for him to come back, settling on two months when I initially offered four. I don't care for the relationship, I love him as a person and want to be there for him. I am able to balance my life well, and I found comfort in his companionship. His parents and friends think I am an amazing influence on him, and he made me a better communicator. 
He doesn't have anyone else who is aware of his splitting tendencies. 

My text messages go through, and he hasn't blocked me. I send him positive, caring words.
I was a mental wreck and hurt myself in my sleep the first two weeks, but therapist and friends getting involved helped. I've been reading books on BDP to help me understand him more, and that helps me cope with this shock.
I've been living my best life with a countdown on my phone for the day he comes back to me. I don't have many people to go to because they will be quick to tell me to abandon him. Usually, it's black and white, but with him, there was a grey area where he fought this disorder to stay with me. I've been conflicted but want to give it my best shot. That is my good friend after all.

so fucking empty without them,1714187489.0,"(tw: mentions of sh and suicide)

i cut my fp off nearly a month ago, and it's been... a little more stable. kind of.

i was able to cut them off because i had a massive devaluation / disillusionment split on my fp. so, in a way, it made me feel GOOD to get rid of their bullshit. but, it only lasted for so long. yes, they made me feel AWFUL, but they were also my only source of validation or reassurance. despite their unpredictable waves of love bombing and unavailability/avoidance, the good moments were GOOD. i felt real. i felt happy with them in that small 1% of the time. now i'm alone and i struggle to feel much of anything. i'm empty, i'm dealing with constant dissociation, i feel so dull. so lifeless. 

i know i can't go back. when they weren't talking to me or around me i would reach my absolute lowest points. the worthlessness i felt was so bad that i attempted suicide multiple times because i felt abandoned. i cut myself because it was distracting from the suffocating pain of being forgotten, of not being enough for them. of them not needing me. in some sick and twisted way, i hoped they'd see my scars and be worried about me, give me affection, care for them, care for me. now, with them gone i just feel apathetic, every single day. i can't really call it ""neutral,"" despite what my therapist says, because when i feel that nothingness, i feel incomplete. i feel numb, not normal. i feel like i'm already dead.

i miss being able to feel anything, but i don't want to hurt myself. i don’t want to give them that power over me ever again. but i can’t connect with ANYONE anymore. it’s like i’m involuntarily distancing from every single person so that i never end up in the same situation. and yet i want to feel it again. i want to feel real again, even if that connection was anything but real. i hate this. i hate that i think like this. i hate that every moment since i left, i’ve just been sitting, idling, on pause, as if my life is on hold and i’m just waiting for meaning to return. i can’t do my schoolwork, i can’t even keep up with my hobbies anymore, i can’t focus at work, i can’t do ANYTHING. i sit at home frozen in my emptiness, wasting all the hours of my day. it feels so fucking pointless, so fucking empty. i don’t know what to do.",stripedbee,BIPOC,False,1ce4ehl,9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1ce4ehl/so_fucking_empty_without_them/

We are capable of relationships!,1714128370.0," I’ve been seeing a lot recently on social media of people saying dating someone with BPD is the worst thing they have ever been through. And while i can understand that, it really sucks seeing people think that individuals with BPD are not people who you can have a relationship with. I struggled with my first two serious relationships. and i was by myself between relationships for a LONG time. Doing reflecting back on your past relationships and see what you can change to make yourself a better person. As someone with BPD relationships tend to be tough. You overthink, do some self sabotage here and there, split sometimes, and that’s okay!! It takes trial and error and that’s really just what life is. Communicate with your partner, tell them how you are feeling and don’t bottle up your feelings. Give yourself and them space sometimes. 

 Yes if you date your FP it can be super challenging and difficult, but i cannot stress enough.. Communication is SO important. I am currently in a relationship with someone who has seen me at some pretty terrible moments. What’s helped us is me actually telling them about BPD and helping them understand it. Educate your partners!! it helps so much not only for you but for them so they know what can be triggering for us, or how they can help us when, or even just know to give us space sometimes.

BPD/ Serotonin Syndrome/ Malignant Neuromuscular Syndrome,1714117638.0,"Hi All, 

I want to share my story in hopes that maybe someone can help or relate to what's been happening with me. 

I have impulsive borderline personality disorder and I was struggling with substance abuse for many years. Most of the years I was addicted to smoking weed, while the past year I got addicted to gabapentin in high doses up to 3,600 mg per day, and I got addicted to crystal meth as well. 

During the past 3 years, I've been on 20 mg Prozac (Fluoxetine), Prexal 5mg (olanzapine), and 100mg of Topomax (Topiramate). These medications were prescribed to be on the basis of having General Anxiety Disorder, some OCD symptoms such as skin picking and cheek biting, and severe mood swings. 

About 2 and a half months ago, I went to a new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with impulsive borderline personality disorder. I've been treating my substance abuse with him and I have been sober from these substances for 65 days now. 

My new psychiatrist decided I did not need olanzapine nor topiramate and took me off of them instantly. As for the gabapentin, we tapered down for about a week and then stopped it also. I was kept on 20 mg fluoxetine which was increased to 40 mg two weeks later and Seroquel 50 mg XR (Quietipine) was also added. About 6-8 days later, I developed a low grade fever of 37.6-37.8 and I could feel my body heating up especially my face. I also had chills and episodes of extreme sweating. The next day I had muscle rigidity in my left calf, and muscle tremors started the next day too with an increased resting heart rate of at least 100 bpm and elevated blood pressure . This is when my doctor was suspicious of Serotonin Syndrome or Malignant Neuromuscular Syndrome.  He discontinued both the Fluoxetine and Quetipine. 

A few weeks later I was put back on 20 mg of Fluoxetine due to my mood swings and depressed mood during and before my period. 

8 days into taking 20 mg of Fluoxetine, the same symptoms started developing, low grade fever, high heart rate, and muscle rigidity. I think it's important to note that before the muscle rigidity started I was in a highly elevated mood ( I described it to the doctor as feeling euphoric), that lasted a couple days till it turned into agitation and the muscle rigidity began. 

My psychiatrist doesn't seem to believe this is serotonin syndrome nor malignant neuroleptic syndrome because my symptoms are not ""severe"" and I am not experiencing any mental disorientation or seizures. 

I am a pharmacist, and I am very knowledgeable about all these medications. I can't seem to understand what is happening. Whether this is actually serotonin syndrome or malignant neuromuscular syndrome or even malignant catatonia due to the withdrawal of antipsychotic olanzapine or the withdrawal of gabapentin. But I'm thinking if it was withdrawal it wouldnt go away for weeks when I stopped Fuoxetine and Quetipine. 

My psychiatrist wanted me to switch to another SSRI escitalopram, but at this point, I am refusing to even try SSRI because of the fear that this could actually be serotonin syndrome or Malignant Neuromuscular Syndrome. 

He finally suggested I go on bupropion. And I'm not sure how I feel about that. 

I am just wondering if anyone has ever experienced anything like this or anything related to this and can help me. ",Royal-Response7494,,False,1cdflav,5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cdflav/bpd_serotonin_syndrome_malignant_neuromuscular/

My partner did something that severely broke my trust almost 2 years ago. We split for almost a year, and now we’re back together.

I’m currently the worst off mentally that I have been in years. I despise him, and literally everything he does pisses me the fuck off; I’m constantly imagining him breaking my trust again. I envision it happening multiple times a day and it makes my stomach churn. I do weed and alcohol behind his back to cope with this anxiety.  Not even sure why I’m still pretending and saying “I love you” when I know I don’t. 

The worst part is, he does everything “right,” he wants to talk to me about what happened, he treats me with love and patience, does little things for me,  never blames me etc. I just can’t get over how much hate I have for him.

Maybe it’s selfish of me, returning because I’m afraid of being alone with myself; maybe it’s selfless, returning because me leaving put him into a deep depression- he seems happy when he’s with me, and I don’t want him to harm himself.

Why are we here to suffer?,1714084181.0,"So i’m friends with a girl and our friendship has been blooming for a long time. I helped her get away from an long distance relationship with an abusive ex that used her and have been helping her recover and show her how a somewhat healthy relationship should look like. She honestly is super amazing and we connect really well, and we talked about the future and how we wanted to spend it together. She wanted to do couple things when we meet in person (long distance) and We even decided to marry eventually and live together and discover nsfw stuff for the first time together. We even talked about growing old together on a cozy little farm with flowers and crops with chickens.

She started first about most of this stuff so i thought she was into me cuz eventually how the hell do you do couple stuff without having feelings for each other?


Anyways yesterday night something bothered me so i got triggered (well not fully triggered but enough to not think logically) and i sended her a message that what happened bothered me with the sentence “And i’m gonna be honest i have feelings for you and i think that’s why it bothered me ig.” I didn’t think this through and it’s a shitty confession i know.
But i woke up to the message that she wasn’t sure if she loved me that way (We already love each other on normal level and have openly expressed it to each other) and she complimented me and told how she admired me etc. But that she wasn’t ready for a relationship but she was afraid that i would’ve lost feelings by the time she is ready. And i’m glad she communicated and all but we’ve talked about so many things that are couple or love related and even marriage, living together and growing old together.

She did tell me she wanted to be exclusively naughty partners cuz we do talk about nsfw stuff and share pics related but still. Which caused me to realize im in a fucking situationship. I’m just so pissed at myself cuz i managed to lose the entire feeling of love and now she helped me to break that wall and be vulnerable but im just pissed at myself why i gave up the ability to not care and now im not even sure what to think anymore.

Therapist said I attacked her… please help,1714073627.0,"I left today‘s therapy session feeling distraught. My therapist (psychodynamic, have been with her for three years and three months) started the session by telling me I repeatedly attack her and choose not to protect the therapeutic relationship. She said I do this by questioning whether she truly cares about me even though she shows and tells me that she cares. The session before, I told her my ex boyfriend had said to me that she‘s only being kind to me because it’s her job, not because she actually has feelings for me. My therapist said that she thinks it’s not just my ex who has this view, but me too, and that I talk about what my ex said to indirectly express my own hostile attitude towards her. She then told me about her old supervisor who had recommended saying to clients in such situations, “Ouch, that hurt.“ So I must have hurt her. She explained that my attacks have been going on for a while now, are very problematic and “pack a punch“.

I felt enormously guilty, ashamed and sad when she said all of this. The word “attack“ hurt me so much. I had no intention to attack or hurt her. I didn’t think I was attacking her. I don’t intentionally question whether she likes me and cares about me. I honestly struggle to believe it (I struggle with this in all of my relationships). Also, I‘ve been dealing with strong, painful maternal transference recently (she knows about this), and my inner child isn’t satisfied with the kind and amount of “love“ and attention she‘s able to give me as a therapist. We‘ve talked about this issue, and my adult self is of course fully aware of the boundaries of a therapeutic relationship and why they are important. I‘ve never explicitly or intentionally blamed her for not being there for me enough or not caring enough. In fact, when talking about the voice or feelings of my inner child, I always make sure to add that my adult self knows very well that she does a lot for me as a therapist and that she can’t fulfill certain needs or desires my inner child has (like being hugged by her, spending more than 50 minutes together etc.) because it wouldn’t be ethical or possible. 

I feel so bad about myself. I care so deeply about the relationship with my therapist and attacking her is the last thing I want. I immediately apologized to her and explained I wasn’t consciously attacking her, but I didn’t feel like we could resolve the issue. I left the session feeling shattered. 

Please tell me what you think of this situation. I‘d be grateful for any suggestions regarding what to do now. ",Myechomyshadowandme,,False,1cd0cju,15,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cd0cju/therapist_said_i_attacked_her_please_help/

Your top tips and insights?,1714073039.0,"Hi everyone

I thought it might be interesting to have a post with some of our best tips and trips for managing BPD, either practical advice that we’ve learned from others here or tactics we have come up with ourselves to find some relief.

I’ll start -

1. Pack an ‘episode bag’.

When I am under considerable stress and emotions overwhelm me, my first instinct is to flee. I now have a bag in my car packed with essentials so I know that as long as I have my car keys and phone I can take off for a while to clear my head.

2. When I’m struggling with my sense of identity I write and draw some key names, words and pictures to help ground me and give me something tangible to focus on.

I'm so happy I have some BPD reddit users to relate to and with. I feel like I'm a bad person for having it...,1714069642.0,"I posted this in another subreddit, but the relief i feel when i see people on here relating to how I feel is amazing. I hate that i feel like I need to hide that I have BPD from people.  I'm 100 percent on board to do anything I need to get past this disorder.  The more and more I learned about BPD, the more I realize that my hopes of being misdiagnosed are not looking great. Like ""Nawww I don't have that. Look I'm fine. Those symptoms were just from depression or anxiety, or my adhd and ocd just tricked them into thinking I had this disorder.""  
So far.....I have only been able to reinforce the fact that I do I fact have and struggle with it. The more I learn bpd, the more I see how much it's attributed to the issues and struggles. I was reading and learned about splitting because I didn't know what it was....well shit...yea that makes sense. Never before have I hoped to not completely relate to something, but toooooo bad. The intense emotional experiences, specifically any negative one. The horrible fear of being abandoned, frequently aligning with what splitting makes people see things as, becoming insanely attached to someone and giving them all your attention and then finding out what a Favorite Person is in BPD. I mean it's good that it's my wife. No better person to make my FP.  Emotional disregulation, experiencing total emptiness and feeling like I'm an empty shell of nothing that is seen as having blank amd empty eyes when it gets bad, shutting totally down, and all the other dumb stuff I hate knowing are symptoms that not only I notice....but my wife and therapist both do too. Well...damn.
My therapist told me this isnt something that had to last my whole life and that I can beat it.  How are all of you with this? Do you feel yourself improving? Have you or anyone you know beaten BPD? How long have you had it?
Do you talk about it with people? I'm scared to talk about it with anyone other than my wife and therapist. I was terrified to tell my wife, but got myself to do it.  She doesn't treat or see me differently, but the negative stigma society had with BPD just makes me really freaked out for anyone else to find out.

This subreddit, my wife, and my therapist are the outlets I have for talking about it. So I appreciate everyone in here for that.  It eats me alive many of the days I experience something relating to it....which is basically everyday I guess. Solidarity between everyone here made me feel better. Seeing and reading all your experiences with it and relating has been so damn helpful for me.

 You have much to offer the world,1714025659.0,"I left a partner with BPD recently. I would like to share my positive thoughts on something very special about how a non bpd partner and the bpd partner do share a deep, life long love after a separation. 

How I came to grips with my painful decision to move on from a woman I loved more than anyone I have ever loved before. 

I don't believe that people come together without subconsciously knowing why they are committing to a relationship that has many bumps, sharp turns, uphill climbs, and, red flags. 

Leaving this women was the hardest depiction I ever had to make. And needed to cut it straight out. I blocked all contacts fir her to retort or reply. 

I think that during our time together I had expressed every ounce of love I could. There was no need to argue or quarrel, to go back into it. 

In my recovery stage I went through sadness, deoression, anger, empathy, longing, missing her, acceptance, and all the rest. 

When I left, I felt that I was being manipulated. 

Over months of resreach, reaching out to therapists, going back over everything that she did and said, and how I reacted, I realised that he only way for me to move past this intense feeling of love and loss, was to accept what she was trying to tell me the whole time. That I needed to build my confidence, I needed to accept her compliments, i needed to stand up and face my fears of succeeding with my seemingly impossible dreams and personal wants in life. 

We met as polar opposites in our life's choices. She had experience and failures and sought inner peace. I lacked experience due to fear and I had never dared to  attempt to approach my dreams for myself, for fear of failure. 

I can only talk from my own angle mostly. Maybe someone could fill me in on how my most cherished BPD may have dealt with me leaving. 

I sincerely hope she goes on to live a long and happy life, and finds the strength to reach out for help as much as I have. 

My trying to help her towards support was the only way I could express my ongoing love affer i left, in our little journey together. Something that she could take away and hopefully act upon whilst dealing with my departure. 

Although her love was fractured in nature through the relationship, jumping back and firth in time, mentally disengaged sometimes, extremely caring at other times, seemingly mean at other times, it all makes sense if one us willing to invest the time to not dwell in anger, confusion and sadness. 

She fulfilled her duty of love to me when all is said and done. In her own way, she needed me to hear her, to accept her, she was trying to express her love even when it seemed she was angry with me. 

Nobody has ever had the ability to reach deep down inside of me and pull me out of my pain like she was able to. 

Although it ended when I felt we had gone 1 full circle on our journey, and the third guy came into the picture. I now understand much more about why she dud what she did. It was never about manipulating. It was as much my inability to be able to handle the amount of information that contained clues as to how to accept all the love she needed to me to offer to her.

I know at least, that she found me equally as perplexing in my way of expressing my love. 

This love was something that could only be fully realised and understood on the journey apart from each other. It was never meant to be a long term, back and forth arguing, leaving, coming back, arguing, leaving, coming back relationship. 

We didn't waste each other's time at all. We didnt argue. We didnt understand each others behaviour well. Our time together was 3 months. And that was what it was meant to be. 

I don't think anyone other than someone like her, a person they call a borderline, with a personality ""disorder"" could have given me as much live and guidance towards my true self as she did. 

I've had other relationships that really had no meaning at the end of the day. 

This one was special. And I wish with all my heart that she found what she was looking in me as much as I did from her. 

Modern life is a complex thing. Please be kind to yourselves. Know that the people who seemed to have abandoned you only did so in body, but they will always hold your spirit for the beautiful complex, intelligent thing that it truly is.

Numbers on BPD,1714015767.0,"I was just curious, so I searched the web for some numbers on BPD. I thought these might interest you too, so I decided to share them here. However all of these should be taken with a grain of salt since they come from different studies and articles and one of them is from a self help organization, that does not even name their sources.
Feel free comment your own, if you found some related statistics.

Prevalence:
In the US, 1.6% of the total population were found to have been diagnosed with BPD. It is asumed that the real number is higher. 75% of these were female (found pretty much the same share for other countries). However, this share is probably biased, since females are much more likely to seek out treatment. Among clinical patients in the US 20% were found to have BPD. 

Suicidality and self-harm:
According to data from a Germany 2023, the suicide rate among people with BPD is 5-10% (quite high), with its peak within the age cohort of 20-30 years. They also found that 60% had at least 1 suicide attempt in their life (70% according to US data). 69-80% injured themselves on purpose at least once.

Trauma and abuse:
40-70% according to the same German source have been mistreated and/or abused during childhood. 60-80% claim to have been subjected to sexual abuse. 

Employment:
50% of BPD affected people manage to find employment. Among those, 20% manage to keep their job and stay finacially independent for longer than 12 months, which equals a total of 10%, who stay employed. 

Prognosis: 
Nearly 50% of patients who recieved treatment did no longer fit the diagnostic criteria of BPD after 2 years. After 10 years it was 88%.

Am I the only BPD person who gets triggered dating someone with kids? HELP ,1714011274.0,"
So I’m a woman with BPD who just started dating a guy with 2 kids from a previous marriage. It’s not that I don’t like kids but it feels like he’s using his kids as an excuse not to text as much as he used to. He started out texting back within 15 mins now & acting excited to talk to me now it’s taking him hours to text back and I ask him if he’s changed his feelings about me and he says “ I have 2 kids remember they need to talk to me too relax “. It just feels so condescending since I don’t have kids of my own.

Open Letter/Rant to Ex Friend,1714010730.0,"Dear PUNK,

You made so many promises, some of them were ones I *needed* you to keep. But you didn't keep most of them. You decided that someone who only ever spoke from a place of trauma and pain wasn't worth it. You said otherwise, assured me otherwise. But what did your actions say? It was you who told me to see if people's actions match their words. I remember saying, ""But their actions *don't* match their words."" You made excuses. You encouraged me to go against my instincts. How *dare* you.

In the end you were just like HW. You know who I mean. Difference is you had a semblance of a heart. You did help me with HW *two weeks* after I asked. The amount of pain I had was suffocating.

You're disingenous. Maybe you never told a proper lie but you were disingenuous. It was interesting that your colleague was only ever ""back in the office"". I missed our talks, deep dives into cool topics but it was always, ""Heez back in the office."" Convenient.

You gave more grace to a failed homewrecker than me. Your poor partner has to live with the fact that you're still friends with the woman who tried to steal you. I never once said anything out of line to you. I never called you names, cursed you out. I never made wild accusations. I was only ever constnatly lonely. It sucked the way you made my pain about yourself and your feelings. It sucked seeing you ignore me while talking to everyone else. It sucked the way you pushed me down the priority list after promising you wouldn't. You told me ""that's not happening"" but that's exactly what happened. The gas was lit alright.

I can do some amazing things with meditation and you'll never know. You never gave me a chance to show you my true potential and ability. How sad for you.    
Or maybe not. You preferred light meditation anyway.

Part of me hopes you'll find this, PUNK.

Dancing with Demons,1714006871.0,"The following is a short essay depicting the significant emotional suffering and mental agony that I as a borderliner go through:

In the quiet, shadowed corners of my existence, where mystery and misery dance a slow, haunting waltz, I find myself a reluctant participant in a story too complex to fathom, too painful to bear. Schopenhauer, in his wisdom or perhaps his despair, once suggested that life itself might be an error, a cosmic joke of sorts. I cannot help but agree, for the path I walk is strewn with the debris of dreams and the echoes of screams that seem to find no exit from the labyrinth of my mind. 

Each day unfolds as a chapter of torment, a narrative woven from the darkest yarns of emotion. My thoughts, those treacherous scribes, have inked my consciousness with tales of woe, spinning endlessly into riddles without answers, into tales without end. It's a kind of madness, really, to be trapped within a mind that devours itself, feeding on the poison of its own creation, a serpent biting its own tail in a grotesque display of self-destruction.  

I am a wanderer in a land of abstract nightmares, a realm where my own mental constructs tower over me like monoliths, incomprehensible and cold. The agony of being so acutely alive, yet unable to articulate this torment, to find no bridge across the chasm that separates my inner world from the reality others inhabit, is a peculiar kind of isolation, a solitary confinement within the prison of my own skull.  

The realization dawned on me, bleak and unyielding, that the puzzle of my psyche is one without a solution, a maze with no exit. This endless cycle of suffering, self-inflicted yet beyond my control, is a storm that no harbor can shelter me from. The guilt-trips that haunt me, the soul-eating and burning flames of shame, the relentless erosion of my sense of self—these are but chapters in a book that seems destined to end in tragedy.  

Yet, it was only when faced with an illness of monstrous proportions that the final act seemed to write itself. After years of battling demons both within and without, the thought of surrender to the sweet release of oblivion became a siren song too seductive to ignore. But even as I stand at this precipice, contemplating the end of all things, I cannot shake the fear that this act of finality might not be an escape but rather the beginning of a new, more terrible narrative.",fellowsopher48,,False,1cceyqn,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1cceyqn/dancing_with_demons/

"What do BPD people mean when they say they ""feel empty"" or that they ""don't know who they are?""",1713995754.0,"When it comes to people's experiences with BPD, I hear both these phrases (“feelings of emptiness” and “not knowing who I am”) a lot, but I find myself puzzled about what these phrases actually mean. Could someone help clarify these experiences for me? The closest sensation I can relate to is the profound grief I feel when someone close to me leaves, creating what feels like a painful void in my heart. However, beyond this context, I genuinely struggle to understand what is meant by feeling ""empty.""

I resonate with many other aspects typically associated with BPD, such as impulsivity, mood instability, low self-esteem, and a fear of abandonment. Yet, I've never experienced this sense of ""emptiness."" On the contrary, I often feel as though I'm brimming over; my personality feels so expansive that it seems to overflow, spilling on those around me. This overflow can be overwhelming for others, which I fear leads them to distance themselves from me, which tends to reinforce my feelings of shame and low self-worth.

But the notion of feeling ""empty"" or being unsure of my identity confounds me. To me, I feel like my BPD symptoms are wrapped in having a *too* robust/distinct sense of self, which I find difficult to suppress, even when it might push people away. So when I hear others describe their experiences of ""emptiness"" or a lack of identity, I struggle to relate or even understand what that would feel like.

Does anyone else feel this way, or can anyone explain what these feelings involve?

Why do I feel selfish for saying no more? Why do I get left and treated like I’m this monster who deserves to be shunned and made to feel like I’m unworthy of love?

Just realized that I've been attracted to older women due to trauma.,1713978748.0,"CW for abuse I believe.

I've just realized this yesterday and it honestly makes sense. It makes a whole lot of sense now. This is going to be a long post so there will be a TLDR in the end if you don't want to read this all.

I've always been attracted to older women, the earliest I can remember outside childhood amnesia was when I was 6-7 with my 1st grade teacher. Outside of that I've grown attracted to boys, *but* they often faded away quickly. But I just realized this pattern. You see, one of my main sources of trauma wasn't my father, despite the fact that he's currently causing trauma now. It was *my mom's side of the family,* primarily of women, from my grandmother, to my aunts, to my mom herself. They all caused me significant trauma, despite my grandma's not being intentional as she just died when I was 16, while I was still coping with losing my other grandmother not even 3 months before her passing.

My Mom, while loving, was physically abusive as she thought it was discipline. It was always when we acted up, but she beaten us (me and my brother, then my younger sister) with a belt. When I was 12-13, going through a depressive episode, me and my brother didn't clean our room and she yelled at us, grabbing the dog leash and beating us with it. It left bruises which my mom said would go away. She got in trouble with services however it wasn't due to me, nor my brother, it was because my autistic cousin fell. My mom died not even a month later after my grandmother, which left horrible scars on my psyche. My dad would use her sometimes to guilt me or threatening to abandon me bringing her up.

Outside of this, my grandma and aunt brought a pedophile around me because I “sounded like a white girl when I cuss”, I was 12. My other aunts, who are in an incestuous relationship which to freaks aren't considered as such as they're adopted siblings, starved me when I was 11 and left me and my family homeless when I was 16. My Dad's girlfriend let her whole family, including her mother mentally, verbally, emotionally, and psychologically abuse me, which worsened my trauma as a whole, and worsening my BPD to the point where I splitted on her and my father, TWICE, with fucking up my grades in 4 months in my senior year. Her, along with her daughter even caused me an eating disorder, threatened to beat me, and so much more. With those chores, it's much worse as I'm autistic, and have been diagnosed, but they didn't care and my dad's girlfriend said how her coworker said me struggling was me just being lazy or an asshole. I left that house a few days after graduating high school to live with my godmother, who is nice, just annoying at times.

Now I'm turning 19 in less than 2 weeks. I was always attracted to older women, especially ones that are several years older than me. I'm nervous about it but I want to date one, which would be okay with my boyfriend as we're in an open polyam relationship. I want to date one that would take care of me, help and congratulate me for learning basic things as I've never been taught or have been verbally abused into learning which lead to more abuse as I did it wrong or was so stressed that day, I want to be treated like a princess to her. I want to be adored by her as much as I would adore her. I just want to be held, be told that I'm loved by her. I'd do anything for that to happen. My boyfriend, while we're long distance, tells me how much he loves me when I do simple things and it makes me want to cry every time. But I also want an older woman to love on me. Something that I wish I had when I was growing up, I want to date, an older woman capable to taking care of me and loving on me. Is there something wrong with me???

TDLR: I've always been abused by older women in my life, particularly by my family. From my mom beating me, to my grandma and aunt bringing a pedophile around me, to my other aunts starving and abandoning me and my family, to my dad's girlfriend, mother, and daughter verbally, emotionally, psychologically, and mentally abusing me, I've grown to be extremely attractive to other women who could take care of me.

Getting discouraged by therapy,1713961162.0,"I have diagnoses of bpd, autism, PTSD, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I have described my therapy journey at length here in a previous post. Let me summarize the last three therapists I've seen and their attitudes towards my diagnoses:

1.) Did not believe I was autistic because I didn't come across like I was ""funny about textures""--I am, but why would I share that if not asked?--and also did not believe I could have bpd because I'm too self-aware.

2.) Definitely believes I'm autistic, but doesn't believe I have bpd because people with bpd, per the dsm criteria (according to him, and he's wrong), must attempt suicide to manipulate people.

3.) Believes I have autism but that it doesn't matter, and I don't think believes I have bpd but won't say anything because I've complained that the first two were so invalidating. Insists on doing CBT with me now.

I had a follow-up with my psychiatrist yesterday; it was two months after she reaffirmed my bpd diagnosis. I was disappointed to tell her I'd gotten nowhere in therapy except three therapists telling me that I'm either too self-aware for bpd or, I guess, not evil enough to have it. She was frustrated on my behalf and encouraged me to find a therapist to do dbt with me. (Naturally I can't pursue the therapist she recommended or the group he runs, because we know each other for personal reasons. Thanks, small towns.)

I do have a recommendation from a bpd friend for a telehealth therapist, but I'm getting so fucking discouraged. Should I just expect *him* to tell me I'm too good and smart and self-aware to have bpd, a disorder reserved only for wicked witches? I also am having a hard time, as a b-story, coping with the implication that all these three therapists have given me, which is that bpd is a disorder for ""bad"" (i.e. not self-aware, deliberately violent) people, and therefore I can't have it.

looking back i think im crazy,1713959410.0," so basically i was in an abusive relationship for a little over two years. i broke up with him september 2019. i was 17 at the time and looking back i was showing a lot of symptoms of bpd

when we broke up we didnt cut off contact. we still texted and hung out and everything. but it wasnt the same, when i was upset i would lean on him for support, and when i was okay i wouldnt talk to him. his therapist actually said it sounds like i har bpd based off what he told her

i remember one time i hooked up with a guy and my ex told me he had a girlfriend. that hurt me because my ex cheated on me a lot. i ran downstairs and immediately cut myself, and he came down and saw what i had done. for the next year i binge drank alone every night because of the sexual trauma my ex put me through 

fast forward about a year i just got out of a different abusive relationship (i know right). but again, we kept hanging out and talking. one night i was drunk (by myself) and at my lowest. and i see that he left me on open. i took a whole bottle of pills and ended up overdosing. that caused me to be hospitalized for the first time

even now i sometimes feel crazy. i check my boyfriend’s location constantly, even though hes the exact opposite of both my exes and is really caring and supportive. i get super dysregulated when he goes out with his friends and it causes me to have breakdowns basically every time

I was going through a lot at the time so i visited the therapist and after 3 weeks i was diagnosed with BPD.

Once my therapist explained to me what is BPD and what we need to do to control everything and try to heal, i started realising a lot of things that now made since. 

I couldn't accept it, especially that I'm still living with my parents who are the reason of me having BPD, and they are still abusing me and making me get worse and worse everyday, so i stopped visiting the therapist because i strongly believed that as long as I'm still being traumatised I won't be able to heal.

Today i booked again to go visit my therapist, I'm so in need for help even if it's not much, at least someone to listen to me and help me understand myself more and what to do to control my feelings in moments of pain, because it is really hard to control the thoughts of me wanting to k!ll myself once my family abuse me. And i have noone to save me from it.

I started to accept my BPD and that it's not my fault I'm like that, but i feel emotionally in need and i feel the damage getting worse. So i hope i can be saved as all those inspiring stories i read here.

After because I was so upset I ended up asking another guy to the event we were suppose to go to, because I already had the tickets. Well....that also didn't go well because after he didn't want to come inside after. (Super tired, just got off his oil rig job)  I ended up feeling unwanted. So that also triggered another reaction.

How do you make a hard decision?,1713926192.0,"Why do decisions have to feel bad? Like letting someone go when they’re clearly not happy and it’s selfish to keep them around? Were long distance (over 40hr drive), east and west coast. I’m here hating where I live. He is in a new location. New job. New people. Busy getting moved in and settled. He doesn’t have a lot of time to talk, and even before he left, we tried to end things a couple of times but I guess I panicked and asked him not to. He’s such a softie when it comes to me. 

But I’ve also realized how incredibly selfish and unfair I’ve been to him. He hasn’t been perfect to me either, but he’s only stayed this long because I think he’s worried about me. 

We’re in a weird limbo where we’re not together but we are, we’re not seeing anyone else, and we’re trying to figure out if we want to continue to attempt to make this work.

He has so much on his plate, and so do I. We both have trust issues. It seems like the kindest thing to let him go, and to let him be “free”. But the thought literally tears my heart apart. He’s my favorite person. He feels like home. I love him more than anything. I can’t imagine him with anyone else. I’m terrified of losing him and him being gone forever. 

But it’s not fair for either of us to be in this situation. We barely have talked since he moved and it’s really exacerbating my abandonment issues. My trust issues are starting to act up too. I feel like I’m losing my fucking mind. 

He’ll be distant sometimes and then not. I just want him to think about what HE wants. What would make HIM happy. I don’t know if he thinks I’m going to kill myself or what? He always said he’s worried about leaving me or me being alone. 

I don’t know. My mind’s a mess and I don’t want to be the one to make the decision but fuck I can’t take it anymore.

2 years after FP and friend group left,1713916680.0,"I made a post here about 2 years ago venting about my fp and my friend group leaving after I had moved, and how despite being the person who held out the longest, eventually my fp left too. It was a horrible time that I could only describe as hell. It was like I was proven right all the times I was paranoid and all the times I worried that they would leave after I moved. It felt like the world was against me and I hated it. After my fp left I would cry every single day, dissociating, re-living memories, and mourning. I felt so alone and isolated from the world. I had anxiety years before this point that would make me feel as if there was a hole in my chest I could physically feel,which caused a great deal of pain, but now it felt as if it grew throughout my entire body. I would have dreams every night about my old friend group, the school we went to,and my friend's house where we used to hang out, only to wake up, realize where I am and what happened, and feel the worst mental and physical pain ever. It got to the point where I was scared falling of asleep, and would keep myself awake as long as I could so I wouldn't experience the pain I felt every morning. I developed severe insomnia that I still have to this day as a result. I later went to a mental health clinic where I was then diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety, and started taking medication. The cycle I went through everyday, the loneliness, isolation and pain persisted for months. Then one day I was out with my family and I realized that I felt free. By this point the dreams i had were much rarer and happened atleast once a week or two. I no longer had any thoughts or plans to commit suicide. I no longer had the anxiety of my friends leaving, or what my fp was doing, colors got more vivid, I could feel the air around me and it was a sudden feel of euphoria as if it was finally over. The pain and weight I felt 24/7 was finally gone. I then realized just how bad my anxiety was as a kid before even reaching middle school. I had always felt alone and isolated, like if there was something I didn't know about, like if something was wrong. The feeling of something not being right that was present throughout my entire life was finally gone. I realized that this was how normal people see the world and how they feel. For once in my life I felt genuinely happy and I didn't need anyone for it. I'm turning 20 in a few months. While I was alone for most of my junior year of highschool, I made friends my senior year and found a best friend too. I graduated, have worked a few jobs and still keep in contact with the friends I made. I not sure if i still have BPD but it's not something I could confidently say since I haven't had a crush or interest in anyone after my fp left. One of my best friends that was in the friend group reached out to me, and we made amends, which made me happy. We didn't keep in touch but I'm sure we're both okay with it. I occasionally still have dreams of my fp and old friends, and those dreams do still hurt, and while i still don't think im completely over them, I'm okay now. I know medication isn't the answer to everything, and I know how lucky I am that this was enough for me to feel fine. But I now know that I'll be okay if I do find someone special again.

Can you outgrow having an FP?,1713896379.0,"I guess what the title says. I don’t mean healing/learning healthy coping mechanisms to form healthy relationships. I’m only recently diagnosed (39F) and I tick every box but I cannot wrap my head around this whole favourite person thing. It’s honestly puzzled me so much until this week when I realised it may have been something I did as a child into very early teens but has not happened since. When I was a child I would become obsessed with specific adults in my life, like a friend of my mums at one stage. Looking back it has all the hallmarks of what people seem to describe an FP being, pretty sure I experienced splitting too when she took my sister to an event that I was apparently too young for. I had similar experiences with another few adults in my life. Looking back as an adult, I’ve always put it down to the fact that my parents were so abusive and neglectful that I was desperate for any positive attention. But now I wonder if they were various favourite persons… is it even possible to have BPD symptoms like this so young? And is it possible to grow out of having FPs?

How should I address my gf when she splits?,1713896257.0,"So this is my first time using redit so forgive me if this isn’t formatted properly. 

I really need some advice on how to address my girlfriend when she splits. When she splits she often just puts up a wall and walks away or says whatever. I’ve done a lot of research into bpd and I know it isn’t her rational thoughts but it’s hard to not let it affect me. I don’t want to bring it up to her that when she splits it’s hurtful because I know she can’t help it but I’m having a hard time not feeling like an asshole even though I know I haven’t done anything wrong. 

Some instances that caused her to split are…
• I told her I have to get up in 5 min for work after she just laid down with me. I wasn’t in any way saying I don’t want her there but a warning I was gonna be getting up in a moment. 
• I was cleaning my car and she came outside and tapped my shoulder from behind causing me to jump and say she nearly gave me a heart attack. She immediately said that she shouldn’t have come out and went back in. 

Little instances like this where I would love to reassure her in the moment but she shuts down and walks away.

I feel cheated out of the life I wanted,1713891925.0,"I go thru periods of insomnia. I have gotten better at accepting it and not being mad, but I feel cheated. 

Monday this week, write off didn’t sleep. Same today Tuesday. I’m trying to get off of sleeping pills (zopiclone) that my dr prescribed me 3 years ago. I was taking care of my Mum while she was dying and died from lung cancer. I have been so traumatized by that situation, it has to be its own post. 

If you have ready some of my other posts was prescribed oxy after gallbladder surgery. I got addicted. Now I’m addicted to these sleeping pills and they mess up my sleep so bad. Also, was not told how addictive it was by the Dr, and received no information. 

I did go to see my Dr about this. I was angry, but tried to keep emotions out and just talk about facts. I asked her why she hadn’t called me, (I was her first patient, we became very close)to get me to come in and talk to me about the oxy. I got myself off of it, but have been on suboxone for two years. 

I can’t keep a job. I do volunteer, they are very understanding if I can’t come in. My kids were taken from me and given to my ex. Loooong story there, I’m blowing thru my inheritance on two years of legal fights for something that should have been one session of mediation. The stress of this adds to the insomnia. I can’t function today. This happens every few weeks. The legal issue should not have taken this long. My ex ‘s lawyer has no reason to settle. His Mum is paying to have me separated from my children. 

Is every person with bipolar and/ or BPD having the same experiences?  I’m 51, my kids haven’t lived with me for 6 years. I don’t care about having a partner or getting married again. I want to be a Mother to my children. 

I’m starting to cry just typing this. I’ve been divorced for 13 years. WHY AM I STILL IN COURT?  His Mum sold her cottage, her house and moved in with her daughter. Who does that?!  She is 85-87 yo. What Mother tries to keep another Mother from her kids. She messing with the mental health of her grandkids to make me mad. This what I find so frustrating. Why do the courts allow this?  I’m be abused by the legal system and my ex is the puppet master. 

This is a rant. How many times do you have to Re wash a load of laundry multiple times before it goes in the dryer. It’s stuff like that. 23 years of abuse. I want out. 

Please make whatever comments you want. I had to reach out to people who understand. This is the one social his 56 yo sister isn’t cyber stalking me on.

My FP has a girlfriend... ,1713883214.0,"This might be one of the craziest stories but i really want to see if anyone here can relate or have been in the same situation as I'm now, also what's your advice about it.

I meet again with a friend after a year of not seeing each other, he was serving in the army and we did not do much talking online.

Some how when we went out together it turned from friends outing to a date, not literally but it felt like it. He held my hands while walking and was being nice to me and we had a fine time. 

At the end of the outing we sat down and he looked me in the eye and said do you consider this a date? I said kinda yes. We talked and then he told me i don't want to hurt you, i can see it in your eyes how excited you are around me and that he doesn't do relationships, he also said the ""you deserve better"" thingy.

I kept looking at him talking and it hit me, i said: there is someone in your life that's why you saying what you are saying now. At first he denied but then he told me about his 8 years long distance relationship with a girl he never saw in real yet.

I kinda accepted it, held myself from crying Infront of him, made sure he doesn't feel that I'm bothered and listened to him wishing he can go to her and how difficult it is... 

At the end of the day while saying goodbye, he asked for a hug. I didn't hesitate and rushed to hug him then we went our separate ways. He kept repeating how happy he was that day, we talked and called but not daily, then he decided that we should go out again, this time he wished to hug me again. 

I had a very bad day and i needed to go out alone to run away from my issues at home. That day he had a 3 hours road to come and see me only for 10 minutes just to make sure I'm okay. That day i gave him a kiss on the cheek as a thank you for being there. 

He told me he likes me and that he enjoys being around me, and that i should enjoy my time with him without thinking of anything, he also believes that we can be how we are acting like lovers at first he didn't want to name what we have and recently he says we are best friends and he likes me, but once he make it and travel to his girlfriend he will make sure I'm fine first and that he will not just throw me away. 

Talking about it makes me realise how stupid it sounds, but then me being around him is like my safe zone, i totally forget about everything and just enjoy my time with him, I'm afraid that I'm getting attached to this person, more worse i think I'm in love... But i will keep denying it because I'm not the type of people who steals someone else's boyfriend. 

Tried to stay away from him but i always find myself needing him. It's like a forbidden love, and to be honest i envy his girlfriend for having him, it makes me feel like I don't deserve to be loved, even though I'm here, I'm not to be loved ever.

a few days ago I had a panic attack and it got somewhat severe, the took me the psych department of our hospital where I'm undergoing treatment (we're both med students), there he told me his head hurts when I have a panic attack, later he says he can't manage them, he doesn't know how to help me and stuff, even though he talked to my therapist about it as well and he too explained what i need, he asked me to just be friends, actually like friends with benefits, untill this gets resolved, later when I told him that he needs to be either all in or just as a normal friends and not just keep me as a backup and then he decided that he would stay with me but not be there when I have a panic attack, since then whenever I feel low I feel even more alone cause my friends in college aren't very supportive and I feel I can't even contact him, I told him the next day of when I had a panic attack that i did and he said okay and changed the topic, he said, though in a sugarcoated way that he feels that I'm a burden to him and he's worried that I'll be all alone if he leaves and now I feel like he's only staying with me out of obligation, or he just wants to stay in my good parts but not the bad ones and everything feels so different and weird and superficial now and I don't know how to look past this or move on, please help.

update: he said that he only said that stuff because he wasn't able to study and he hated that (we don't even have exams or too much workload to study rn) and that he wishes everything was normal again and he'd take care of me and but he'd need a few hours where he'd be studying and asked me not to contact him during that time unless it's extremely severe, like if they're taking me to the hospital, he said he'd skip gym, hanging out with his friends and everything so he'll have time to take care of me

I am very embarrassed to post this as it is extremely vulnerable for me to do so, but I guess here we are. 

I (NB 23) struggle with ""white lies"", that I often get caught up with. I started doing it at like 16, where I would lie to Uber drivers about my life, or lie online about my life to get attention on forums. Then it escalated to real life lies, that often rely on how people talk to me. 

I will often stretch out what people say, to make it appear as they have hurt me, or been disrespectful so I can get reassurance and attention from my friends and/or partner. I victimise myself a lot, saying that people are mean to me, that they said problematic stuff, when it is not technically not true, but amplified a lot.

I could really use some advice. I don't know what to do about my (adult) children. ,1713813173.0,"This will be long... 
I have ADHD and BPD. I've had problems with depression since I was 8 (I'm 59 now) and problems with anxiety for 'God knows how long'. 
I have a son and two daughters, ages 34, 32, and 29. I also have 4 grandsons, and 2 more on the way. 
I wasn't a perfect mom. I have regrets and wish I could go back and do some things differently. I was, however, very involved with my children. I took them to practices when they were in sports, I went to almost every game or tournament they were in, every parade. I made sure they had fun birthdays with special cakes. We had dinner together as a family most nights. I also planned family trips for us.  
My husband and I were married for 35 years and finally divorced about a year ago. There was a LOT that was wrong with our marriage, and I finally left. 
All three of my children have college degrees (one also has a Master's degree). They're all happily married and own their own homes. I live only a couple of miles from two of them; the other one is about 30 miles away. 
They don't let me babysit or ever have any of the grandchildren. They don't come to visit, they don't call, and they don't text much anymore. 
About 4 or 5 years ago, one of them asked me if I'd do daycare for them when they started having children; I said yes. Now they 'don't remember saying that'. The one that asked that is expecting their first child soon. The couple has decided to have another sibling (this sibling has a 20 month old and another one on the way) do daycare for them two days a week, and then have the other grandmother do daycare the other two days (4 day workweek). The other grandmother lives about 85 miles away; I live two miles away. 
I didn't beat my children and they were never sexually abused. They know I have mental health issues, but they also know that I have gone through lots of therapy, been seeing psychiatrists for many years, and that I take medications every day to help with my disorders. 
I don't know much, but I have been told that the other grandparents were abusive when their kids were young. 
This has been causing me SO much pain! I've tried to talk with all three of them lately (on the advice of my psychiatrist). Two of them said that it would be too stressful and the other said they were too busy. 
I'm at a loss. I know you guys know what it feels like to have BPD, so I'm sure most of you know what rejection does to people like us; to me. 
Does anyone have any advice? My children and grandchildren are my FAVORITE people to be with! My parents are gone, so I can't get any help from them. I have had a boyfriend for ~4 months now. He's incredibly sweet and understanding. But I feel bad about how my sadness affects our relationship. 
I'm sure this will come up, so I'll say now that no, I don't currently have a therapist. I've seen many over the years and don't feel like I've ever really had the right one.

What are your experiences with favourite people? How do you perceive them?,1713783917.0,"For me, a favourite person can change. I often feel so connected to people I just meet, just by talking to them and finding out they're the type I'd love to be friends with. Most friendships of mine didn't last for long, the people either left me or became too busy to hang out. It was painful, but after a while I adapted to it.

There was also a situation, where my best friend used to be my favourite person, but then it changed to someone else. My perception of the new FP changed and I fell out of the friendship but then - I came back to being emotionally codependent on the best again. 

A favourite person for me is someone I'm being paranoid about. It's someone I like/love so much I don't want them to ever let go. They influence my entire days, whenever they're happy and show affection I'm the happiest person on the world, but when they show even the slightest hints of being tired of me or annoyed I burst into tears.

How to stop obsessing over people?,1713783907.0,"First off i would like to thank you people in this sub soo much.

It has helped me understand and vocalize a lot of the things i could not talk about before.

So my wife dumped me recently, and used my BPD as an excuse for her cheating on me and subsequently leaving the relationship in the course of 5 days.

She even said no one could love someone as broken as me. Great.

So i reconnected with an old friend, we hadn't talked in years, since i shut out all female friends in my relationships, so i don't invite jealousy.

Turns out, in the meantime she got her diagnosis as well, and is in therapy.

She is the most kind and understanding person, and we reconnected in the typical, very fast and intense way that is natural for me, but weird for everyone else. Ususally.

She knows and understands more about me than anyone else, since we and our triggers etc are very similar.

Both our therapists said this could be a good thing, and it is.

My biggest problems are abandonment issues and problems to initiate physical contact (that is not sexual).

I'm a pretty tall guy, so it rarely happens that someone thinks about cuddling the 6ft 4 guy.

But she just sees whenever i need it, and takes me in her arms.

All this without any sexual tension between us, which is very weird and new for me.

We both just know what the other is thinking, and what the other needs in any moment. Which is wonderful.

She is good with setting boundaries, for example, she just tells me flat out when she needs space, and that this is not a sign that she will leave me. Which helps me a lot.

She keeps pushing me in the right direction, so i tell her things i would be scared shitless to tell anyone else, for fear of them leaving.

This week she's on vacation, and of course i miss her. I knew when her flight left, and wondered when she would land.

After i found the flight information on flightradar, it hit me like a brick. I am freaking obsessed with her.

I don't want to - i can not - fuck this up.

Therapy im Brazil ,1713777441.0,"Hey all

I'm(24m) currently living in Germany. I've been struggling with borderline, ptsd and depression since I was 11. I've been hospitalized 3 times ans in therapy for like 6 years or so. 
Last year, my parents decided to return to Brazil. I was born there, but have been living im Germany for 22 years. Even though my life here is...let's say it isn't the best, but I have all my friends here and from a therapeutic standpoint it wasn't the best idea to leave with my parents, so I decided to stay.
I've been trying to manage most things, like I found a place to stay and all the bureaucratic stuff, but it's just so exhausting. In addition to that, nothing works out. The bureaucracy is terrible in Germany. They can't do anything right, they take ages to address your issues, but if you can't meet their deadlines, you get with jail. 
In my private life, nothing is working out aus well. My whole plan I set up to build up a life in Germany on my own has been crushed to pieces within few weeks. I just feel like everyhting is weighing me down and...okay I'll stop ranting and get to my question.
I'm close to deciding to go to Brazil. Not because I think life is much better there, but because I feel like I've ran my course here in Germany. Maybe I'm not suited for this environment. Maybe I can handle things better when I'm not constantly being pulled down by everything.
But as you can see, I still need therapy. So I wanted to ask, if anyone could tell me how life is in Brazil with mental health issues and how easy it is to get good therapy there

broke in my exs apartment complex drunk and blacked out in his bed,1713774294.0,"he broke up with me a couple weeks ago. most of our problems was because he cheated on me and i just kept getting triggered by it and he said i kept being rude talking about it. since he broke up with me he keep saying he will talk to me eventually but that i need to give him space, i kept texting him and he ended up blocking me :( .

well i have been feeling like i ganna die and im genuinely in so so much pain and anxiety.
two nights ago i had a mental breakdown and kept creating fake numbers after he blocked  me and cursing him out (saying some really really fucked up shit to him like calling him an insecure piece of shit) for things im hurt about from our relationship (the cheating, the fact that he broke up with me for being triggered cuz the cheating, the day that i was having a panic attack and he got mad at me saying i didnt want to tell him what was wrong but i was just legitimately having a panic attack). 

the same night i had a mental breakdown i got extremely drunk and broke in his apartment complex (even used they heated pool😭) and so i ended up knocking on his window after leaving a bunch of voicemails from fake numbers. he opened the door... i dont remember everything but i kept apologizing and trying to tell him how im having a hard time, and trying to tell him things that happened in my life, but obviously i was shittfaced and i didnt make much sense. but he asked ""did you get a new haircut?""(which was nice) but he also told me to not to touch him..
 next thing i remember was me trowing up in his bed and so passing out in the bathroom floor. i woke up laying down in his bed with him waking me up to drive me home because he needed to go to work(his bed was weirdly clean? because i do remember trowing up there) i dont even think he slept in the bed with me. 

when he dropped me off i said ""im sorry for yesterday, do you hate me now?"" he said  "" just dont do it again, i will come back eventually just give me my time"".

well was nice of him for taking care of me while i was drunk? and not calling the cops on me :( but i regret so much not being able to tell him everything i needed because i was way to drunk...i have so much to say. i dont know if he said he will come back eventually just to be nice. i feel like he hates me now.

i miss him so much to the point im so fucking anxious and depressed, i been painting and writing poetry for him everyday. 

i genuinely need help so bad i lost my health insurance and my bpd just be getting worse and worse, i feel extremely paranoid and psychotic every single day, my anger its huge and out of control, and so my god complex. im all over the place. my ex was so supportive and lovely with me i miss him so much.

he broke up with me because he said it felt like i was allowed to hurt him because he cheated , he said every time i talked about it (the cheating ) i was rude. and now i keep oscillating between my who being hurt for letting a cheater break up with me after taking him back, and now he has reasons to call me mentally unstable, and i love him to death it was all my fault i need him back.",hasura1001,,False,1ca5hpf,0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1ca5hpf/broke_in_my_exs_apartment_complex_drunk_and/

You think you've had a bad stroke of luck, or your just not good and shouldn't really be speaking up when you know it's you who's wrong. - Let me explain scenario wise. You are at your close friends house, it's a double sleepover and your best friend and that family and your own family, just a few people whom you care for. Your excited to hang out and all chill like an inside calling trip. First day; your on best behavior being calm and helping everyone, the day wears on on a few hours and your mood evens out everyone comfortable and there's a few good convos nothing going on. Your right it with it talking and responding and doing things, nobody's particularly paying attention to you it's all good. Lunch time and you've maybe finally gotten a game together with everyone or something and the groups moved onto afternoon activities.,your changing the diaper and cleaning up since you and them are guests and your the string that makes the particular people here in the first place. People start gaming together and switching turns and talking. And yoy chime normal times not a noxiously or anything at all. Everyone's doing something together, you happen to be left out which means your the only one left to tend with the kids if they need. You go along but after awhile maybe try and get in somewhere conversationally or game wise, but they don't get it and I go back and decide what I need to do. I'm nice happy helping talking, not talking about myself not being rude or out of the norm. They don't get it and just do there own thing, maybe you cross paths since your here to and such all the spots and activities have kind of been taken but your here so you try and add in by mentioning turns again or just talk but they somehwat cold sholder you.

You go to bed fine and wake up, day is an exact copy. Your much more comfortable and use honesty with your socializing and you come up a bit. Day continues with no change, and yes unfortunately your a bit gkum, noones willing to play with you more than once or twice and don't seem to be willing to put up with your presence much more. The event is drawing to a close, you try to open up and be calm and ok and nornak and nobody bats an eye, I just be crazy. Try again, no, again, again, again, again. Nobody cares. Your sad by now and just exist again, nobody cares and asks you to do something for them or complains about whatever I did. It's fine. Then boom they get up, no mention if when or how we leave (carpool)They announce they Re leaving and they don't say if you are coming but you assume of course you eould. Pack fast and your ready, oh.

What worked for me to be nearly symptom free for over 1 year now,1713743759.0,"Hey y’all
I used to struggle with oversharing, avoidance, social anxiety, paranoia, delusions, hypomania, jealousy, anger, black and white thinking, splitting, suicidal ideation, identity confusion, impulsive/risky behaviour, dissociation, emotional outbursts, and alot of feelings of regret, embarrassment over my behaviour, hostility over friendships, and yearning and fomo

I learned eft tapping, dear man through dbt, built a positive experience list, used the acronym “accepts” alot from dbt, did alot of behavioural chain analysis’s, and have been on quetiapine 300mg, with strattera 100mg for over a year now, and have been practically symptom free and now I have more friends, a better sense of identity, understand social cues a bit more, and don’t fall into spirals I can’t control, and don’t deal with suicidal ideation as much unless it’s situationally triggered

Everyone is different but this med combo worked for me best as someone with bpd, adhd (more hyper than deficit), and bipolar mania/psychosis, social anxiety, and slight traits of ocpd

I like this med combo best because quetiapine rebalanced my dopamine and serotonin instead of giving me more or less

I also like strattera because it’s a non stimulant which treats by raising norepinephrine instead of dopamine, because raised dopamine can create more anxiety and psychosis.

Without an FP for the first time in years and I'm reeling,1713737900.0,"I recently cut off my last two FP (one was a serial cheater and one was an ex using me for attention) and now I'm left with no one. This is worse than normal because in the past, I'd just find a new partner right away, the city I was in was huge and I'm not a bad looking guy, but I've since moved. And where I am, dating doesn't exist (and if it does, im just failing miserabl). I'm in the retirement center of Florida, where everyone is either married with kids, retired, or geriatric. I'm 24, and it's hard to find connections with anyone. Or just find someone my age in general. I have a good group of guy friends, but I need female companionship to have value in my life.

The stuff that brought me joy like painting, gaming and my cats now just remind me of better times. Without an FP to attach to, I'm not sure what to do. I'm in my last year of college, about to graduate, so at least I can try and move out of this place. But lasting that long would strain my sanity pretty hard. I regret cutting off my old ""suppliers of worth"" (exes) but I know it was best because all I felt towards them was pain. But at least they sometimes acted like they cared. I just don't really know what to do other than try and make myself my favorite person, but me telling myself ""I'm worthy of love, It's okay, you're a good person, you're alright"" doesn't cut it.

More breakdowns and triggers after diagnosis?,1713735558.0,"I have struggled with symptoms and issues, since I was 6-7 years old. I was labeled anxiety, depression, you name it. Cycled through dozens of therapists. 

I admitted something to my therapist about a month or two ago I never admitted to anyone else before. It sparked an aha moment for her and she talked to my psychiatrist. When he realized it as well we went through the steps to get an initial diagnosis (he was also upset I hid it from him) 

Anyway, since recieving the diagnosis, I've been having alot more breakdowns. 

When I first heard it, I felt like my world shattered. I'm the quiet internal type, I don't ever get angry, I just cry and feel like my insides are falling apart and I just breakdown sobbing and grief. My mom is diagnosed as BPD as well, but she has the aggressive mean abusive yelling kind. So when I got the diagnosis, I felt like I was like her. 

Since then, I've been breaking down alot more. I'm getting ""triggered"" at least a few times a week now. And I hate it. I feel like the diagnosis just made it worse. And a part of me feels guilty like I'm giving myself an excuse to act crazy or something. Like I'm giving myself the freedom to cry over nothing. And I shouldn't be. 

I don't know, I feel like I'm a mess, and I hate myself for it.

Ex Moving On,1713731988.0,"My (30F) wife (28MtF) left me in January without any warning. She told me that I 'made all of her problems about me' and that 'she hadn't been happy in a long time.' I had been working so hard on myself and my BPD for a year at that point; I didn't have my diagnosis before then and had been going at therapy and medication all wrong. She didn't want reconciliation, therapy, or to even try fix things. We had been together for 11 years.

Today was the first time I've talked to her. I thought I would be okay. I really thought I could keep it superficial and that seeing her wouldn't bother me. I had flipped that switch from love to what I had assumed was indifference. 

When she told me she was moving into an apartment in the city we were supposed to move to together, I felt absolutely gutted. It feels like her life plan never changed, like she was able to toss me out and keep on moving. And I turned that inward, like I always do. I hate myself right now for not being stronger, for not moving on like she has. I hate myself because I was never going to be good enough for her. 

I hate that she fucking pities me and still pays for some bills I need her to because she makes 1.5x my income and I have no idea how I'm going to make it on my own. I hate that I feel so fucking alone. I hate that I feel like no one is ever going to love me and that the woman I wanted to spend my life with never loved me in the first place, so much so that she just decided things were over without giving me a chance.

She's living the future we planned on, just without me in it. And I don't know how to handle that. I thought I was okay. Clearly I was wrong.

Catastophizing because I feel like my wife has unfair expectations of me,1713730113.0,"I’m 30F and my wife is 41F. She has a 13 year old daughter and we all live together. My wife and stepdaughter are from the Philippines but have been here for several years. 

Last night, my wife and I were having an argument about the amount we pay for dental benefits (about $200 per month). These benefits have paid almost entirely for my orthodontic treatment btw. She had mentioned that $200 is a lot to pay for benefits every month, and I made a point that it’s worth it because I still have to get a couple fillings and a cleaning this year, and that it’s there if the three of us have a dental emergency. 

My wife then suddenly accused me of being self-centred and asked me why I never book for her or her daughter to get a cleaning at the dentist (wifey has been here five years, stepdaughter two years and neither have seen a dentist). I told her that she never mentioned wanting to go to the dentist and I don’t know what’s going on inside their mouths so how would I book them an appointment they never asked for? She proceeded to tell me that I’m creating a divide by eating on a diet (I’m obese) rather than eating the Filipino food they eat. 

Sometimes I think my wife doesn’t want the responsibility of being a parent, and wouldn’t rather push that responsibility on me. It’s her responsibility to know if her kid needs dental work, or to at least tell me to help them schedule an appointment. 

Over my 30 years I have learned to keep my composure, but I felt myself getting really angry about the situation and wanting to just walk away from my wife. I also had a moment where I thought “what if I just die?” which I very much do not want but I felt so upset that the person I love most thinks so little of me. 

Whenever we fight, it’s so easy for me to just start thinking that she doesn’t love me anymore or doesn’t want me. Then I spiral. I love my wife. I’m tired of feeling hurt all the time or like I’m a bad person. I have my BPD under good control in a lot of ways but I still cannot handle conflict and I’m terrified that she’s gonna leave me if I cannot fulfill all of her exepectations.

Can someone help me understand BPD?,1713729211.0,"For those who don’t know my story: my husband has BPD. He had an episode last year and proceeded to abandon me and our home out of the blue. He came back once I told him he was about to lose his wife. He dated me and  is now getting the help and therapy. He’s been better but hesitant when it comes to saying “I love you”. So when I try and express how proud I am of him, he talks to me like I’m a colleague in an office.  

I’m starting my life over without him but I’m waiting for him to be in a postions to talk to me. 

I guess what I’m asking is with Bpd are they unable to feel emotions or just regulate them? He can talk to me about stupid things. But when I asked about possibly talking on the phone he states how he needs to think about his mental health (he clarified saying he hasn’t started BPD treatment but his depression meds have kicked in)

My dad told me him being with me is separate from him mental health. I feel like in this case it’s not true?

I (20 nb) reached out to an ex (20 f), we hadn't talked in like 4 years. I knew her before I could stand up for myself. Our relationship was a classic anxious (me) x avoidant. I thought things could be different this time, or at least I was willing to try. I knew things could go poorly, I was prepared for that. Things had been going well though, we were becoming close friends. We had been talking for about a month and a half. She seemed a lot more emotionally mature. We were calling one day, she was telling me about a spelling bee she hosted for her friends. It was really cute. She randomly hung up and I assumed it was to go make food like she had mentioned. She left me on seen when I sent her a meme a few minutes later. She had always responded to my memes individually, with at least a sentence. 

Huh that's weird, I thought to myself. She's probably just busy. A few days past, but it's fine because sometimes she gets busy with school. It's final season. She usually tells me though. It's fine. 6 days pass and I check our chat and I'm blocked ??? It's so out of the blue. 

She was fresh out of a breakup, maybe 3 weeks. She told me she was gonna meet her ex on thursday to talk about things in person. Being around her ex made her really sad so she wanted to go no contact. My only guess is they got back together so she blocked me. It's just crazy. No explanation, no nothing.

I don't know what to do. The only other way to contact her is through email, so I sent one just telling her it's fine if she doesn't wanna talk, but I'd at least like to know why for my own peace of mind. Other stuff too, etc. Etc. Idk if she'll respond or unblock me eventually. I don't know anything. I have no control over the situation now.

Why do I have this need to tell my parents about my diagnosis??,1713714218.0,"My parents and I have a very strained relationship. My father hasn't spoken to me in two years. My mother and I both try but it's tense.

When I was diagnosed with ADHD, I felt such a sense of relief - suddenly, so many of my adolescent behaviors that I had never been able to explain could be explained! And it wasn't because I was lazy! When I told Mom, she ignored me. Left me on read.

I let it go. I know they don't understand modern ADHD and that it doesn't always look like the overactive kid who can't sit still. 

About six months later, we were having a conversation and I mentioned ADHD behavior. She stopped replying. This happened several more times over the next six months.

So I stopped talking about it. 

And I realized that maybe this is why I internalize everything. I don't talk to people about how I'm feeling or what's going on inside me. I just keep it in until I explode. 

I feel like I need to tell them about the BPD diagnosis but I also know it will just bring more anger and hurt. Part of me wants to tell them and make sure they know this is their fault. That I'm broken because of *them*. 

Why do I want to make sure they know this? The projection of blame will hurt my mother. It will anger my father. It will drive the wedge between us further. But I want them to know that the neglect, the constant derision and criticism, the manipulation...it broke my mind. 

I want them to feel the pain that I do, for them to know they weren't enough in the same ways I never was, never am.

"Help, I'm madly in love with a stubborn guy who withdraws from me",1713713285.0,"I (24 F) met a boy (24M) online through a mental health server on Discord. We became friends. We have this crazy chemistry together. We've known each other for 6 days now, but it feels like forever. He feels the same way as I do, and he's very literal, so I know he's telling the truth. I have BPD. I told the guy and warned him. He stayed. I was very glad. But he implied that there was no future between us, not because of my BPD (which he's fine with) but the fact that we belong to different communities and he's very loyal to his family and they have certain expectations of him, and he feels indebted to them because they struggled and fought to give him the best life that they could. I was even more attracted to him now, because of his strong moral character. I told him I would take whatever he gave me, even scraps, because I was, and am, too much in love with him to leave.

I have a certain belief system which is very important to me. I told the guy that I would never accept a husband who did not accord with my beliefs either. I did this out of some misbegotten effort to get him to fight for me, cajole me, make me feel wanted. Instead, he said that my condition was a ""deal-breaker"". I felt rejected. But he said that this didn't mean that we couldn't talk, and that he hadn't stopped loving me. In fact, he said that he admired and respected me more because of my set of principles, but he had a different direction in life. I told him ""this is goodbye"" and apologized to him, and left the chat.

The next hour and half of my life was the most painful one I have ever experienced. I hurt myself a little, then I decided that I would say goodbye to him and enter rehab for my own safety and protection. So I reached out to him again. I discovered that he had been crying, and he had been hurt very badly. He said he'd ""wet his screen with tears"". He explained to me that he had not in fact rejected me at all, and that *I* had rejected *him*. I felt so sorry and so bad. I had thought because he carried on being a mod, he wasn't hurting like I was. I realized that I had played him like a yo-yo. I felt horrible because this is exactly the way people had treated me in the past, and I knew exactly how much it hurt. I told him I wasn't going anywhere, that I was in love with him, that I eventually wanted to marry him, even though it had only been 5 days. I told him that I was ready to give up my former ""conditions"" for him. He became overwhelmed and confused by my words. He withdrew, promising me to write after some time. He promised to talk to me, he said he just needs some time to process. He said that he has such strong feelings for me, that he missed me when I broke up with him so much, that he was going insane.

Today, I tried to be chill. But somehow I wrong-footed it, and he felt hurt by a comment that I made, that I didn't know it drained him so much to talk. He then sent me a message saying that he is overwhelmed and he doesn't want to talk to me for the rest of the day. He says a lot of his energy has been taken up by all the shit that has happened to him this week, and that I was “sitting there and telling him what he was”. The worst was when I asked him to forgive me, and he just said ""goodbye"". I don't know what to do. I feel like everything I say, I'm somehow saying it wrong. I know I am rushing into this so fast, its just that something inside me is screaming that he will leave and I will lose the man of my life. It hurts me that he can't leave his family for me, just like I'm ready to leave everything for him - and I know how selfish such a thought is, because how can I expect him to leave his family who have done everything for him, for me, who he just met? I feel like he's such a good man. I don't know what he's going to do next. I feel like he’s unpredictable. He's stubborn, and he can't change who he is. I know that. It hurts me that he withdraws when he is overwhelmed. I feel so abandoned and depressed. I can't be the ""cool girl"" who pretends all this doesn't affect her. I promised him I would stay, before. I don't know how much of this is my fear of his abandonment, and how much is true love for his sake. I don't know the difference anymore.

How do I make it hurt less? How do I make *him* hurt less? What do I do?",olailamajnoon,,False,1c9kmix,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1c9kmix/help_im_madly_in_love_with_a_stubborn_guy_who/
