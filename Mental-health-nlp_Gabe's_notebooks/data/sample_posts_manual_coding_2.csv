i feel like i’m losing my battle and nothings helping,"i’ve struggled with depression since i was about 12/13 and over the years it’s progressively got worse and lead to a bpd diagnosis and what not. recently i’ve been doing really well after a really tough year with all the things you expect someone to go through (attempts, losing friends, addiction etc). but recently i’ve been breaking down so much and i honestly don’t know what to do. my parents are scared for me and i feel like my friends would be but i don’t tell anyone anymore when i struggle, it’s not worth it and i don’t want a pity party. my boyfriend helps in his own way but he doesn’t provide the comfort and reassurance that i’ll be okay, he’s more straight thinking and gives logical reasons to the problems and issues i have and i know it’s his way of helping but it doesn’t provide give the same help that a ‘i love u, it’s gonna be okay u have me’ would give. and i feel like no one takes me seriously when i am genuinely so fucking depressed and i don’t know how much longer i can do it. please help me. or just someone to talk to, i have so much going on in my head and it’s slowly killing me again after i though i was finally getting better",1643064417,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-24 22:46:57,1,0,
The Way Social Media Assumes Things About and Is Portraying BPD is So Fucking Harmful and Frustrating,"like i’m a rare case of bpd developing at a very young age, i’ve dealt with it fo at least 14 years most of which were unknowing on top of a laundry list of other co-morbid problems and disorders.  the current social media narratives around this disorder is so fucking scary for me to see.  

i see teenagers on twitter and tik tok self diagnosing and talking about their “fps” with heart emotes and asking for advice on how to tell them.  like it’s just an intense fucking crush and not a horrible obsessive fixation no healthy person with good intentions towards you would be comfortable with/want you to have towards them for both you sakes.  one that it is your responsibility to manage and not put on another person who didn’t ask for it.  

it’s either romanticized enabling bullshit that mirrors my internal dialogue i used to justify some of my worst behavior moments that ruined relationships or are still affecting my life today.  and treats mood swings as a quirk instead of an incredibly invasive and overwhelming experience that feels like it retraumatizes you a little every time.

or it’s infantilizing and demonization.  “they can’t control themselves, they’re naturally manipulative, they have no idea they’re doing it and can never change.”  i am extremely aware of myself and my issues constantly.  to the point i have to also worry about accidentally gaslighting myself as a coping mechanism on top of regulating my fucked up emotions.  i work so hard to be self aware, manage my mood swings in a way that doesn’t lash out at others, limit pushing other people’s boundaries, and argue with myself and play devils advocate whenever i’m splitting on someone.  

this condition has permanently altered how i function as a person and made my life so much harder than it needed to be.  and despite mental health being such a “hot topic” for people to throw attention to and improve the narrative on?  i’ve never felt more misunderstood by the world than the last few years.  and it’s so fucking frustrating.",1643064326,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-24 22:45:26,1,0,

(LONG) Looking for any kind of help regarding a friendship/relationship with someone having bpd.,"hello everyone; this is going to be rather long so thanks to everyone actually reading over all of this, i really appreciate it, english is not my first language and i am very confused about a lot of stuff that's going on so i am really sorry if there are any passages that might be confusing or hard to read/understand, i'm trying my best.

i met this girl (online)  somewhere around june last summer; she was in a relationship when we actually met, with no intentions of anything more than friendship between us. her (extremely toxic) relationship was basically over already at this point (which i did not know at this point of course) and the break-up was basically a few days after we first had contact. 

she had her best friend/favorite person which was basically there for her all the time, but apparently she found me very interesting as well, so we had quite a lot of contact during this time as well. i'm a generally very empathic person and am always happy to help or be there for someone if i'm actually able to help them feel better, so naturally i did. she grew attached quite fast and we basically had contact every day without exception, (via chat at first, calls/talking via discord later on) due to her mental state at this point, she opened up very quickly to me(about her having bpd as well), talking about basically everything and i had absolutely no problem with this. i was actually happy for all the trust she put into me. 

all of this was very interesting to me, and mental illness is something that is very interesting to me anyways (i had depression for quite a while, as well as some other mental health issues; still in therapy as well, but i'm at a point where i'm actually stable without any limitiations to every day life or anything similar) and she actually suggested me a book about bpd since i mentioned that i was openly interested in understand her and the illness. we grew attached quite a lot over time - still: as friends only, but we would have some cheeky flirting going on all the time, nothing serious though. over time, this had become more and more though, with her even telling me that ""she would probably have fallen in love with me, if she wasn't right in the middle of lovesickness"" which was obviously very flattering for me, but nothing more than that. at some point we even went over chat logs with her ex, for her to realize that she wasn't the (only) problem in her relationship and only at this point she actually noticed how terribly toxic her relationship and ex-bf actually was (i was sincerely shocked over how cruel people could actually be.). obviously she wasn't completely innocent how her relationship went but this was nothing one-sided at all. 

due to this she could finally conclude the relationship and any ""chance"" to ever actually get together with him ever again.  this is where it probably started getting complicated as i slowly started developing feelings that involved more than friendship and it was quite obvious that she did as well. this all happened around 4 months after we got to know each other and at some point she actually opened up about how she was feeling as well and that she actually fell in love with me. due to her only coming out of a 2 year relationship and the distance between us (around 7 hours) we didn't go that much further into this and just went on with how it went between us anyways, doing stuff together online, the usual flirting, watching movies together, etc.

fast forward, in november we started planning to actually meet up and we did actually meet in december. this was a huge thing obviously (her therapist; she started therapy in late october that year; actually scrutinised this heavily and i was actually unsure if she'd actually pull through, with all of this, but she did and we met up)

 the time was amazing, with her getting to know my family, me getting to know hers, we had tons of fun and an amazing time together. there were so many signs of how great we actually fit together; all the stuff like her mentioning that i actually made her feel good and beautiful for the first time in her life (she did have some terrible relationships, she was actually completely confused when i started adressing compliments to her, as she never experienced something like that in her life.). we actually were together for a few days, when she realized that this was all too fast for her and she was not ready for a relationship at this point, which obviously made me very sad but there was nothing i could do at this point that would actually change anything so i could only accept this for now. we simply carried on as before as... ""very good friends""? i guess. 

there has been a lot back and forth since then with her saying that she definitely wants to see me again, that what we have actually is a relationship, just without calling it like that because she's afraid of it. her saying that she has no time/power/strength for a relationship but on the other hand. her telling me that i should stop having any expectations or hope as she is unable to actually ""love"" or ever have a ""healthy relationship"". her having her priorities everywhere but about having a relationship at all. at one point she actually mentioned that she wants to see me again, but that i shouldn't have any kind of hopes about ""getting together"" at this point, that she just wanted to see me again, that she just wants to have someone be with her.

i honestly sometimes have no idea at all what of this her bpd is and what's actually rational thinking of her. this permanent uncertainty is really nagging on me and is sometimes making me feel really terrible (especially her mentioning the fact that she cannot have a relationship at the moment, feels really bad.).  

there are so many contradictory signs where at one point she tells me about how we do actually have a relationship, i just shouldn't see or call it as one, as this is what she's struggling with; her telling me how she's completely trusting me and how important i am for her but on the other hand the fact that i should not have any hopes or expectations as she's way too scared of not being able to ""fullfill""? them and losing me altogether. 

once again, i am really sorry about how complicated all of this might sound (it is extremely complicated in my head, so it is actually really hard to write this all out.) and i'm really hoping that everything is understandable to a certain degree. at no point ever have i ever thought about ""ending"" this or to stop working on all of this as she really is everything i've ever wanted in a partner, i truly am in love, as complicated as it might be, i honestly do not care and am happy to push through all of this, hoping for a positive outcome. it permanently feels like she does not know at all what she actually wants or needs herself even though how obviously i am ""enhancing"" her life and making everything better and easier for her (this is not supposed to sound arrogant or pretentious in any way: this is actually something she has told me very often). she has terrible (mental-)scars from her former relationship with some of them that haven't even started healing yet at all (though, i really hope, that therapy is going to help with this) and i would be more than happy to show her, that there are is another kind of relationship than the ones she had until now.

 i am sometimes struggling though. all this back and forth is - sometimes! - very exhausting (there's times where this is worse, times where everything is a lot clearer and easier as well though). times where it's absolutely clear that she definitely wants a relationship and all of this, and other times where it feels like there is no chance for us to ever get together at all. this uncertainty is extremely hard to bear for me from time to time.

i am unsure what kind of help or support i'm looking for here, but at this point probably anything and everything is going to help. just writing all of this down (as confusing as it might be, i am really sorry) was already helpful for me. anything that i could read, learn or do, any kind of opinion about all of this, honestly everything is probably going to help me so i am happy about whatever there is to say.

if anyone actually bothered to read all of this: thank you. if there is anything unclear (of which i am sure there is quite a lot of) i am absolutely happy to answer any kind of question, thanks for reading this and thanks to everyone that might try to help me out with all of this.",1643060608,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-24 21:43:28,0,0,

i am just about done with my constant need for validation  and attention. stuff that my birth givers should have given me but failed miserably at and are seemingly unaffected by. why should i suffer when they aren't? what did i do to deserve this? my life is a fucking warzone filled with trauma and pain that can never heal. 

i am dissociating right now and typing shit to placate my inner child who wants some sort of an answer for all this suffering. why? why me? what did i do to deserve this illness? why do i have to suffer?

i know that i am not alone and there are several others in situations worse than mine. however, i can't help but be miserable because to heal i need to get therapy and that very important shit is expensive. 

life probably sucks in worser ways for others and i am not trying to invalidate their experiences or sideline their struggles.

Having BPD is just super tiring and I’m struggling to cope,"my life is a mess at the moment. every little thing turns into an argument with my partner and i can’t stop myself, we’ve been arguing for two days and i just don’t have the energy to anymore. i don’t mean to turn every mountain into a molehill, but i just can’t help it - i can’t control myself.

i’ve tried to get support the best i can, but literally no mental health services will see me, i’ve exhausted every charity and my university’s sessions of therapy they can give me and i just don’t know how else to be proactive and get help. im on medication, which takes the edge off, but i’m still nowhere near stable and all they can do is up it, which doesn’t help.

i really need a clean space to keep my thoughts and feelings from being overwhelming and chaotic. i’ve tried to explain this so many times but he says because of his own mental health, he cannot force himself to do things he doesn’t want to do. for example, if he’s already in a low, the thought of doing a chore/task is unfathomable for him and ruins his entire day. in response, i told him that i hear him and i will try to understand. but i feel like he hears my needs but doesn’t try to understand or accommodate me. i’m not asking for marie kondo’s house. i just need a safe place for me because everywhere feels unsafe.

Going to be evaluated for BPD,"hi, 

i’m hesitant to post this purely because i know there’s mixed opinions on minors receiving bpd diagnoses (i’m 16f) but i want to do it anyway.

i went through severe trauma in my childhood and suffered a lot since. the last time i saw a psychiatrist was at 14 and he said i did have very clear traits of bpd but that he wanted to see if it would go away as i got older. i got a bunch of diagnoses including unspecified bipolar disorder but it didn’t fit. i received cbt and emdr and to treat my trauma and other diagnoses and a few different meds but it wasn’t effective at all. 

it’s recently got to the point where my behavior has spiraled out of control and neither my mother, current psychologist or school or really anyone in my life knows how to handle me anymore. so tonight i have an appointment with my psychologist and she told me they’ve been in touch with a place that specializes in personality disorders and can help treat my symptoms and possibly diagnose me if they are certain i have it. 

to get into all my symptoms would make for a very long post but if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask. i’m just very anxious because i don’t know what to expect and i wasn’t even aware of how much problems i was causing with my behavior.",1643033749,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-24 14:15:49,1,1,

My best friends I was very dependent on left me and I have no idea what to do,"i’m a girl who just turned 16 a couple days ago. i had 2 friends i knew and messaged everyday for almost a year, we had a gc together and we would just infodump everything about our lives to each other. i vented there a lot about my mental health issues, mainly my bpd. i also feel like i created a fake character just to be liked by them. i was so dependent on them and their love and praise. i had no other place to vent and they seemed to be understanding of my issues so i thought it was all fine. i think a big part of the reason they started to dislike me was that despite being so mentally ill and unhappy i’ve had a rather privileged upbringing compared to them and supporting parents. i’m not even sure how most of my mental health issues developed, i believe it was genetics or because the schools i went to as a very little kid had terrible teachers who damaged me mentally. i already felt like this made my problems invalid but of course i couldn’t change my brain or how i felt. 

it was my birthday a couple days ago and they both wished me a happy birthday, i felt a little ignored by them though. we continued on as normal until i posted a screenshot of me achieving something in a game we all played and friend #1 suddenly blocked me and left the gc. i asked friend #2 why friend #1 blocked me, they said they had no idea and they probably just wanted a break. i then said i was scared i did something wrong and friend #2 said they didn’t think so, so i didn’t worry and just moved on with my day. i was worrying they would both leave me, but i denied it bc they both knew about my extreme abandonment issues and that they were some of my only friends so why would they do that to me? then i saw friend #2 unfollowed me on all social media, that’s when i panicked. i decided i would leave them before they left me to avoid the feeling of abandonment so i unfriended them on other platforms before they could. then i got a very long message from friend #2, they explained that we can’t be friends anymore. they were aware of my issues and said that i need to seek professional help, and that they can’t help me and they’re afraid they’re enabling me and making it worse. they also told me i need to grow up bc i’m 16 now and can’t be a kid forever, they think i haven’t changed the whole year they’ve known me and act like a dumb attention seeking child. they brought up some behavior and things i’ve said that were rather stupid and damaging but i didn’t realize they were. then they said they still care about me and they want me to find better friends and be happier. i cried reading the message, i wasn’t even angry at them i was just sad. i wrote a reply apologizing and wishing them well too, but it didn’t go through because i assume they blocked me. then i got a message from friend #1, they called me spoiled and ungrateful and said some other nasty things about me. 

i couldn’t stop shaking reading the message and i wanted to believe it wasn’t real. i wanted to believe none of this was real. i wanted to stay with my friends but it was over and there was nothing i could do. they were just celebrating my birthday a couple days ago and it felt so unreal. this was only a few hours ago and i can’t stop crying, i really don’t know what to do and i feel super lost. i feel like a spoiled brat and like all my issues are invalid. i only have a few other friends besides them and this guy i had a crush on left me about a month ago and i miss him like hell too. it also hurts knowing that both of them are still friends without me. i know friend #2 wants me to get professional help but i tried therapy a couple months ago and it didn’t work out or help because i have a lot of trouble opening up to adults. i feel like i wasted so much time talking to those 2 friends and caring about them for nothing. i’m just so lost and i can’t stop crying but at the same time i feel guilty for it bc of how “spoiled and ungrateful” i apparently am. how can i cope with this and move on? 

tldr: my best friends left me. one of them was nice and mature about it but the other one was nasty and made me feel like shit, to them my problems aren’t valid bc i’m a stupid spoiled ungrateful brat who needs to grow up. i don’t know what to do now because i was so emotionally dependent on them and i can’t stop crying. i need help coping with this and moving on.",1643019705,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-24 10:21:45,1,0,

this morning comes and he comes to talk to me. it begins another argument. all day i have been feeling worthless and depressed. i've stopped my medications, and i don't feel like this is a reason to start them back up yet. i know i'll be okay again soon. but even at work tonight, i just flashed back to the arguments, and i just had a really down night.

wise mind says it's an argument; he's over it, so i should be too. emotional mind is telling me i need to leave him so he can find someone better for him [this is always my thinking during a borderline episode]. i know i'm overreacting, so why can't i pull myself out of it? why am i so in my head? i really hope after some sleep i'll be okay, but i woke up in a shit mood this morning... idk what to do.

i left my career over a  year  ago to be a stay at home dad, we were basically working just to  have  kids in daycare. i love my kids with everything i have. with out  going  into detail lets just assume we have gone through the full gambit  of the  bpd life all compact in the last year, there were signs prior  but  really triggered full the last 6 months.

she   did finally agree to go into treatment and they do specialize in   personality disorders, trauma, depression, and anxiety. their program is   geared to help, but it is only a month to a month and a half. i love   her from my depths, unconditionally. i have overlooked  some of the  negatives because of ""love"".

i  am  learning so much through this and other groups, i need to set hard   strict boundaries, and take care of myself too. i don't know if we will   even get that far. i want to wait till shes done with the program first   to talk about separating, then only discuss it after with a family   therapist, and at a 3 month point really discuss if this is what we   want. give it time, don't make a rash or emotional choice. i'm sure you   all understand how my partner would take this.

my  partner has pushed literally everyone in their life away and is pushing  me away now. they  want to ""co-parent"" after divorce, but we have never  co-parented. its  all been on me majority of the time. if we do divorce  it would not go  like they think, both sides of the family will speak  on my behalf, i am  the caretaker, i tend to all family matters. they  are in a facility,  have taken a few leaves from work do to mental  health. i really don't  want my partner to ruin the life they have, and  have worked really hard for,  but it feels like they are set on it with  out realizing it. mental  health issues suck.

i  am  willing to work hard, but more i read here and other places i know i   need to start thinking hard about the kids and myself. its why i like   the idea of waiting to see where they are at the end of the program,   then set mile stones after.

i   don't know what i'm asking... is there hope? should i even hold on for   hope for the family? do i just agree, but what does that do for my  partner?  any input at all is appreciated, this is all new to me, i feel   blindsided by most of this, in hindsight there were flags but i just   didn't know.",1642974366,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-23 21:46:06,0,0,

Therapy,"i honestly don’t know what to think/do anymore. i’ve been researching my issues on the web and i’ve ended up so utterly confused. some people don’t even think bpd is a real disorder. then you have dbt and i’m just like what’s the answer? i lay in bed all day, have no friends or interests to get me out of bed and i am triggered by every aspect of my life/surroundings. i am having a panic attack. it just doesn’t seem like i’m ever going to get better and i have reading material on the web which talks about therapy is bullshit and, honestly, i can’t really argue with that. i went to a therapist 10 years ago because i felt like my life was over. i was 31 years old and had just lost my faith in god and was devastated by the fact that i convinced myself for so long and invested so much time and energy in something that was all bullshit and now i’m wondering if i turned around and did the same thing with therapy. i mean, i’ve tried cognitive behavioral therapy and i try to come up with thoughts that replace my cognitive distortions, but i just end up believing my “distortions” anyway and it feels like i’m losing my mind trying to argue with myself. it’s just like i’ve lost every reason to believe i can get better. yesterday, while trying to come up some solid strategy for how to deal with my cognitive distortions, i came across an article on psychology today and it said to not fight your thoughts and to “surf the wave.” i could only guess what that meant and it just seemed like total bullshit. “surf the wave?” “don’t fight the thoughts?” what the hell have i been doing with cognitive restructuring? it just seemed like the entire field of psychology had their thumbs up their asses and were bullshitting the masses. i just looked up thought suppression in my dbt handout manual and it told me to “imagine cuddling up with my thoughts.” it’s just like, “what the fuck? where did they come up with this shit?! how the fuck am i supposed to imagine myself cuddling up with a suicidal thought?!?!” i mean, i’ve been trying to fight my depression for 10 years and i feel more fucked up and out of control than i ever have been. i’m just supposed to somehow believe that i’m going to get better after all these years and all this effort? how? why would i? it’s only gotten worse the harder i try! 

anyway, i’d love for someone to come along and say that magic thing that’s going to make sense of all this, because i’m at a complete loss.",1642972990,TRUE,BPD,2022-01-23 21:23:10,1,1,
A positive post about losing an FP,"hi everyone, just wanted to come on here and write something about how i’m feeling, i hope it might resonate with some of you. today my most recent fp, a fwb situationship thing i had going on, ended things. he wasn’t mean about it and it was fairly amicable, but still hurt. i hadn’t admitted my true feelings for him and stuck around because i felt like i would rather have it than be lonely.

usually i would have had a complete meltdown. i did cry after it happened of course, that’s normal. i called my mum to talk to her about it as i couldn’t stop ruminating, afterwards i felt so much better in myself. i’ve reflected on the fact that as much as i feel i’m getting better within relationships with communication etc, i’m still not focusing on me out of relationships.

i still rely on them to make me happy as i have a lot of struggles making friends. i’m 21 and moved to a small town, about an hour away from my family, for work. i love it here but there’s not a huge social environment which makes it hard to make friends. i do get lonely and started to rely heavily on my fp for time away from home, for something to do. i knew from the start he was probably fairly emotionally unavailable due to a recent breakup but told myself i was too, so it didn’t matter.

i soon realised i had feelings and that maybe this style of relationship isn’t right for me but that’s okay. it’s okay to want someone for the long term who will want me back. i don’t want to keep begging people just to see me. i’m still learning to not constantly give myself away to people just to have them around for a little, as it feels like second nature to me. i also want to try and do things for me. so many times i’ve started to realise i put things on hold for people. for example, i was hoping to get a cat at the beginning of this month however i put it on hold because i was travelling to see my fp so often. it starts to feel like i can only leave the house for them, it’s just not healthy. 

i know many of you probably feel the same and i just felt like airing it here. we are worthy of the same healthy relationships ad everyone else. we deserve love and to put ourselves first in life. i’m proud of myself for being able to think this after what would have been devastating to me before my diagnosis, it just shows me how far i’ve come. big love to the bpd fam, we got this!",1642972558,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-23 21:15:58,1,0,
A BPD Poem,"i run hot or i run cold.  
tears stream down my face because my emotions are too strong to hold inside.

i am loving  
i throw my all into what i am doing

and other times it ends up hurting me,

Ghosted by my coworker FP,"i’ve had a sort of on and off fling with a coworker, and he turned into my fp. we stopped talking for a while, then i impulsively asked for his advice on something and he was super sweet and helpful. one day i jokingly told him my friends told me i should hook up with someone, and he jumped at the opportunity to say we should. i was hesitant because i wanted to be his friend and didn’t want that to get ruined but he said he’d never just ghost me and that it would be chill so eventually i agreed. i told him i just wanted to be friends (i didn’t think he was good for me romantically) and since then that’s what we’ve been. whenever we’d talk he’d say he was always here for me and that he cared about me, so i thought it would be okay to ask him to hang out. but he saw my message and didn’t reply so i took that as i bothered him and tried to leave him alone. he never responded but at work he’d go out of his way to talk to me or say hi so then i thought maybe i misinterpreted things and asked if we were okay and he said yeah but if i wanted to we could text about it later. so i did, and i said i just wanted to check in with him, and he saw that message and didn’t reply too. so now once again i feel like i am just being weird and bothering him and i’m kind of panicking.

Help with ex with BPD,"cw: sex 

i need opinions, because i feel like i’ve been in a nightmare since i met my now ex.

he pursued me heavily (i was just ending a relationship with someone else), asking me all kinds of questions about myself, my interests, my past exes. two weeks into talking he wanted to be boyfriend / girlfriend. i told him we were still getting to know each other, but that i liked him a lot. he took this as rejection and brought it up repeatedly in later arguments about how i don’t like him as much as he likes me and he’s not good enough for me. he would bring this up a lot especially if i was upset with something he did or i expressed myself in anyway about how i was feeling. that he was a failure and would jump to conclusions about ending things and him abruptly leaving my life. he also would talk about sex incessantly with me, but he seemed almost terrified to actually have sex with me in the beginning. his words not met by actions.

he was never wrong about things. anytime we argued (usually provoked by an insecurity of his), i would end up apologizing just to get him to calm down. he would go silent on me, gaslight me to punish me. he never ever apologized or took accountability ever for his actions.

he then met another girl, who he at first said was his friend. he started mirroring her (suddenly was interested in things she was to copy her like he did with me) and triangulating me, comparing me to her all the time. when i would say how i feel, he would blame shift and say things like i was being ridiculous, but stilll continued hanging out with her. when i broke up with him and deleted him everywhere, he lost it and started posting everywhere bragging about her to make me jealous (within the same day )

he is with her now, but trying to get me to talk to him. he said i am his favorite and he cares deeply for me.",1642967729,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-23 19:55:29,1,0,
CBT has never benefited me and medication only muddles my symptoms.,"i’ve been in and out of therapy since i was ten or eleven. i have a therapist now who i’ve known for almost 12 years and i like him a lot. but cbt does not work for me and never has. i don’t want to stop seeing him, though. i did look into dbt therapists in my county and none of them so far take my insurance. i don’t even know if my insurance would pay for the sessions because many don’t when you have a personality disorder.

i also have a psychiatrist (i’ve had quite a few). i’ve lost count of how many medications i’ve been on. i had my monthly session with him yesterday and he was visibly frustrated. not at me, but because no medication i’ve tried or am currently on is working like it should. he really wants me to continue therapy because he told me, “i don’t know how else to help you”. i know that he means medication can only do so much and therapy is what will help the best. but it still hurt. he also told me that bpd is extremely hard to treat (which i already know). it really me a lot and now i feel more hopeless and helpless than i ever have, i think. 

i don’t even want to make another appointment with therapist. if my current one can’t adjust his techniques, or i can’t find a dbt therapist, what am i supposed to do? what if i *do* find a dbt therapist and don’t get anything out of that either? why won’t my medications just work?? i have so many unanswered questions and i’m so angry i just want to give up on treatment altogether.",1642967539,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-23 19:52:19,1,1,1

Is this normal?,"hey guys, this is my first post. 
i have been seeing guy who is depressed, and was obsessed with me from the start. i thought that our relationship would be the best, because he was always giving me attention, telling me he misses me, we saw each other as much as possible (we are living quite far away so it was 2 times a week). from all this i thought that i would give him a chance. now two months later he stopped giving effort. he doesn’t see the purpose of texting all day, he never says he misses me and we haven’t seen each other in 2 weeks. i am of course crying all the time because i am sure he is leaving me and he doesn’t want me anymore. 
so i told him how i feel about this and it annoys him, he is saying that he just doesn’t wanna text all day, and he mentioned that he once said that we would see each other next week. so today (two days later) i asked him when we would see each other and he said that he maybe comes on wednesday, but he is not sure. btw, we are seeing each other in city halfway from both of us. and i told him (again) that it makes me sad that he is not giving an effort. and he is annoyed with me again because of my sadness when he is not giving me 100%. 
i should also mention that when we are together he is really loving, but now is exam season so we are really “far” away (3h is not far for me to se a loved one).

we aren’t dating, but we’ve been seeing each other for over a month now. i’m scared he’s seeing someone else even though (again) i have no reason to and it’s been made clear numerous times that neither of us are seeing other people.

a few weeks ago he mentioned my mood changing. he didn’t say it in a mean way at all. more of a joking manner. he dropped it and we haven’t spoken about it since. he’s an easy going person. he likes to see where things go. he doesn’t have a care in the world it seems and just lives his life. it blows my mind and that scares me too. 

sometimes i think he could be spending his time with someone else. someone more driven and happy even though that’s what i pretend to be. i feel like i’m lying to him. i want to be honest with him though. i’ve been thinking about telling him about what i struggle with. maybe not flat out “i have bpd”, because that’s a lot to put on someone and i don’t want to scare him away…

An appreciation on a new perspective,"hi everyone, i'll be honest and say before i met my friend with bpd i didn't know a single thing about it, much less even question it, but after learning more and more, both by asking her questions about how things can be for her and seeking as much information as i could about the the terms and topics that both came up from talking and from what i discovered while exploring around on the subject, ive learned to look at people in a different way, maybe sometimes when i saw a reaction i thought previously was a little extreme or something that just didn't click in my head how someone can be, it made me consider if more is going on with people, it made me think how ignorant i was to this fact of life for some people, where sometimes they don't have that ability to control how they felt around others or a situation, ive done my best to keep on being supportive of my friend and to be patient and understanding with her since ive known her and i hope i can always continue learning about bpd and continuing to to show her and your community more support everyday, and i just wanted to say thank you to everyone, for enduring and prospering when sometimes you didnt believe you could, and for doing what you do every single day to help better yourselves through a very serious thing that really does need more attention out in the world.",1642956245,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-23 16:44:05,1,0,
How can I help my gf to not feel bad every time I had an emotion?,"so when my gf and i got together, she was very understanding and open to learning about bpd and understanding my feelings and where they come from etc. but i think it kinda went too far? 

basically, my gf has been struggling for like the last six months because every time i have an emotion, my gf feels it too. if i'm sad, she's sad, if i cheer up, she cheers up, then gets confused about the quick change, then is exhausted from how fast my emotions can change from one extreme to the other. she knows my emotions aren't always rational, and she's educated so it feels like absolutely nothing i say to her is helpful because she knows it already? 

i'm trying to hide my emotions from her now so that she stops struggling with the intensity, but that upsets her too? and it doesn't even work most of the time, she can tell when my emotions change literally from the way my eyebrow moves even if i try to not show anything. 

and i said she should maybe try reading more about being with someone with bpd, and dealing with the rapid emotion changes etc, and she said she doesn't want to, so that's confused me too because i don't understand why she doesn't want to fix this issue. but she's also at the point where she's not happy in the relationship because of this. so i really don't know what to do?

psychic connection with my ex partner who has bpd,"for those of you who believe in this stuff, i'm pretty sure i have a psychic connection with my exgf who has bpd traits.  it's been two years since we broke up and i went no contact because she hurt me pretty bad and was devaluing me because she was unstable at that time.  i let her go and it was the hardest thing i have ever done.  i haven't dated anyone in 2 years (the pandemic helped with that/ but i just wasn't interested).  to be honest, i always hoped she would heal and somehow our paths would cross again.  from time to time i would see her birthdate pop up as the time on my phone.  no big deal right.  but then one time last year i woke up in the middle of the night and had this intuition to get on a certain dating site and i didn't know why.   as i scrolled through the pics, there she was.  i didn't send her a message- i was in shock.  then about 6 months ago something that she had given me fell and broke.  i felt that something had happened.  i meditated on it and the word ""engaged"" popped into my head.  i wasn't sure if it was real, i had no way of verifying it because she cancelled her fb account after we broke up.    which btw i felt was weird because she had done things to hurt me so why was she trying to hide?   anyway,  this morning i woke up in the middle of the night and had an intuition to search for her.  i call these psychic hits because it's like the thought to check something just comes to me for no reason out of the blue.  i hadn't thought of her consistently for a couple of months now so when i get these i follow up on them.  i literally saw something in my dream about marriage so i went and looked it up and sure enough she just got married !   i was freaked out and of course had the gamet of emotions.  i felt happy for her but sad for myself.   i guess i got my closure.   i have heard so many stories about people with bpd typically will reach out to their ex if they loved them but this wasn't the case for us.  i hope she has healed and will have a good life.  just sad right now that things didn't work out for us.",1642943717,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-23 13:15:17,0,0,

"I know I'm self diagnosing, but its the first time in my life I felt like my problems made sense","i've struggled with depression, suicidal thoughts, very poor self esteem, etc for as long as i remember. i always thought i was just regularly depressed but i never understood why my emotions were so unstable, why i could go from feeling like a king, to very depressed and hopeless in hours. why i overthink everything and blame myself for everything.

You are a hero.,"“we survived some tough sh*t”

the universe is like a simulation, a tale, so let’s compare our trials like a video-game or a book.
you are a character that technically faced some of the hard bosses before the main quests, without upgrades, without experience. 

you won, you were just a child and you won. even though it feels as if you lost a few battles and gained a few scars. we look at the npcs and see their attire as “flawless or unbroken”

you forgot you gain experience points, valuable life lessons, we depend on of defensive gear to face small threats, because the game is now wired to expect more bosses. learn to not react, but observe.

darling, you are the wisdom of an over powered player that’s misunderstood. you’re inner child feels like frodo but you are gandalf the white. 

don’t let these small threats defeat you, you already won. be patient, accept the hardship, the injuries that make you feel defeated. that was a wicked journey in the past and you’re the most bad*ss hero. 

you faced this universe early with nothing to give, in return it gave you so much more.

the ability to feel empathy to the roots of a soul, to detect when something doesn’t feel right. you know the patterns most people ignore, and we punish ourselves because society doesn’t understand us yet? it’s a shame on them. how could hobbits understand the trails dodo faced? don’t surround yourself with people to refuse to honor your survival. 

you are destined for an adventure.
seek it.

be patient, love everything your inner child faced, they may not have seen the trauma the way you do and so stop shaming yourself. your inner child saved you because they did not know, they were flexible, brave and survived for this comeback you deserve.

I think I might have BPD and I Screwed Up Tonight,"hi everyone,

i’m really desperate for someone to talk to but none of my friends will understand so i’ll just vent here if you don’t mind.

i spent the last 4 years of my relationship believing that my partner had bpd and blaming that for all the difficulties we faced and the way he acted. he might still have it, i’m not sure. what i failed to realize until recently is that i might have more of an issue than i thought.

i’ve always had extreme anxiety and obsessive thinking. i’ve always had mood swings and am easily irritated or angered. i’ve always struggled with self-harm. i’ve always done absolutely anything to avoid being abandoned or would act in very shameful ways when i felt threatened.

anyway, tonight i think i messed up. my ex and i broke up about 7 months ago but remain friends. we usually talk almost every day but haven’t spoken as much this week. my car died in a parking lot today while i was running errands. i called him for help and was already really stressed and upset about the car. i jumped down his throat asking why he hadn’t been speaking to me lately and then started panicking about the car. i was so angry he didn’t immediately jump in his car to come rescue me.

after getting a tow truck sorted, he texted to check in and i told him i was on my way home and would call in a bit.

about an hour later, i tried to call. he answered but he was on a date. i absolutely lost it and hung up on him. then i texted a paragraph about how he obviously didn’t care about me any more and that this was the end of our friendship. i knew i was acting dramatically but i was so angry and so hurt that it felt like i was out of control of my body. i sh’ed for the first time in months and it was bad. i couldn’t stop crying.

it’s been a few hours and i’ve calmed down a little bit. now i’m just filled with shame and regret. i’m terrified i’ve finally messed things up for good. he can see the real me now and i feel like every outburst drives him further away. it’s no wonder he doesn’t want to speak to me- everything is a fight or dramatic.

Memory blocking off FP/SO,"i can remember a lot of little details people don't expect me to, and i find it easy to do tests without having to study stuff over and over again; that makes me think maybe i have an above-average memory.

the third time i got an fp/so, it was with a guy; after about 3 weeks of talking, i realized i had forgotten his name and the country he was originally from. he got upset when i asked both things, and i kept forgetting so i had to open a notepad and write it down to check every time i forgot.
then i misplaced the notebook and couldn't remember when his birthday was but i knew it was getting close only because we started talking just a couple of days after it and it was in winter, so i had to ask again. i don't remember his birthday anymore or almost any of the stories he told me and we just stopped talking only 2 years ago.

Free DBT handbooks,"good evening fellow bpd redditors! 

apologies for how long winded the post will be, there is a minimum character length so i will just waffle i guess. 

i realised whilst reading the comments of another thread in r/bpd that some people on this sub may not have access to dbt therapy. 

i saw that in some cases people can’t access dbt because it’s not covered by insurance, issues with affordability or general inability to access the right services. 

i’m from the uk and am currently enrolled in a group dbt therapy course via my district’s nhs mental health practice. i was referred there for diagnosis via my gp last year and they have supported me since i’m the form of the group sessions that take place once a week. the entire course is is 24 weeks in total front start to finish, with weekly 90min sessions via zoom.

the main content that the entire course is focused around is the dbt handbook. it contains all the necessary content including skills practices. 

if anyone would like an electronic copy for free i would be more than happy to share

i feel very guilty because we had a party two days ago that we hadn't cleaned up yet and now he has to do it by himself, also i know i wasn't right with the disagreement either. but i acted like a child and just fucking ran away from my problems like i usually do.

i just needed a sense of control so i left, and went to a pharmacy to take out a bunch of sleeping pills that i was prescribed a while ago but never bought them. the simple thought of having them around me calms me in a weird way, like i am here by choice and not because i don't know any better.

[20F] shame for overreacting. i need advices (recently diagnosed),"i understand this story will not be either particularly intriguing or uncommon, but i need advices, because i’m worried i may ruin a relationship i deeply value.

one of my best friends is also my “friend with benefits”. 
i was under a lot of stress during this month (exams) and some days ago i had to leave for a trip with my family. a trip, which is supposed to be something fun. however, this only brought me even more stress, because my family isn’t easy to deal with and they genuinely drain the life out of me. i love them, but a week is… difficult. 

i was supposed to see this friend the day before leaving, but he forgot due to a couple of reasons (some personal commitments + finished internet connection on his phone), and he also forgot the day after was the day of my departure. this deeply hurt me and i sent a couple of pitiful texts to him and also called him on the verge of crying. he apologised, but later in the day he texted me something on the lines of “i think you overreact a bit, enjoy your trip”.

now i can only think about how a burden i am for the people i love, how little i consider them, how paranoid i am (this wouldn’t have happened if he didn’t finished his internet). he is clueless, not sly, and i have always known it, but somehow i burst. 

i feel shame, so much shame. i won’t see him till the end of this week, maybe even later, and this thing hurts. in a different situation i would have tried to “get back on the horse”, explain myself, spend some good time to faint this shameful memory, but now i can’t and this follows me. the paranoia, in particular: i cannot help myself but think how much easier would be not to have to deal with me at all.

btw as i read about bpd i came about many horrible comment, articles, videos etc. about how you should avoid people with bpd and how they will ruin your life. please don't listen to these things. im sure you're all amazing persons, some people just can't see past a condition.",1643632541,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-31 12:35:41,0,0,
Stopping Medication,"i was taking lamotrigine 100mg twice daily and lexapro 10mg daily, but i had severe memory loss and migraines the entire 9-12 months i was taking these. with my psychiatrist retiring and not being replenished, i've also not had a way to have an adjustment in my prescriptions since the fall. 
i've pretty much weaned off the lamictal within a couple weeks and my memory's back, but i'm extremely paranoid about everything again. i dissociate more frequently and am isolated due to a surgery i had at the end of last month. basically, i fear the world's collapsing anytime i hear my neighbour start their car early in the morning, or i sit in the dark and peer through the blinds tensely to make sure i'm safe when there are noises. everything's scary and unpredictable and nobody's a real person. 
and my therapist doesn't believe i have bpd even though i've been diagnosed by two separate psychiatrists. frankly, i'm not sure if i'll stop going to seek help altogether. 

i feel like every cry for help is ignored.

How can I help/adapt to my partner who has BPD?,"i (m18)recently got together with my partner(f18), who is the love of my life.

we have been together for about 3 months now and we live in 2 diffrent cities about 3 hour drive.

one day she told me that she had bpd, this was very earlie into our relationship. i had no idea what that was so she told me and i asked her how i could help her as i did some research on the subject.

so when i asked her how i could help her, or atleast make it easier, she told me that i cant.

so my question still stands, is there anything, really anything that i can do to help her or adapt to a certain way or anything that i can avoid thats a trigger?

""hey, i know we don’t talk to each other but good luck with what you got going on. i hope something great happens to you, you deserve it.""

Sobriety and Relationships,"d become sober for my boyfriend; i realized i was putting strain on our relationship, so on his birthday i decided to get rid of all of my substances, and despite the hardships i had in those 6 or 7 months, i managed to stay sober. 

i broke my 6-7 month sobriety because my boyfriend told me he was disappointed in me for going to a party that had weed. i get that weed was bad, but definitely not as bad as what i had been taking. there wasn't any weed left when i had arrived at the party, and i told him that. he told me he was disappointed in me for still going, and it shattered me. i tried so hard to get and stay sober for him, and in the end it didn't matter. he didn't acknowledge how hard i tried. that night, we started arguing and he triggering me and i ended up hard relapsing with drugs i managed to scavenge on my way home. it was terrible. 

the next day, he pretended like he had never been disappointed in me. he even got mad at me for making it seem like it was his fault that i relapsed. i didn't want to sound mean, so i had to pretend that he wasn't the reason i relapsed. i don't know if he ever forgot that day, but i never have. 

today, i sent him a tik tok about going to na meetings since we've been watching euphoria. i told him that i related to rue, which was a mistake because he ended up telling me that if i was rue, then he was everyone that cared about her but couldn't get through to her. i felt bad, i didn't know how to respond to that. i tried to stay sober, and it didn't mean anything to him. and now that my life is falling apart and i have been wanting to do drugs again (i don't think he knows i feel that way), i feel like he's trying to seem like the overly caring boyfriend that wants to take care of me and love me when it's become too late. 

i feel really hurt. we were talking, and i feel like he didn't respond to what i was really saying, just bits and pieces or not at all. i brought up the party, and he didn't respond to it at all. he shifted the entire conversation from it. i mentioned it a lot because it was a super distressing situation for my recovery journey and he wouldn't respond to it. it made me feel unheard and ignored, despite him telling me that he hears me. i'm so tired. i feel exhausted. i'm in that 'let him hurt you' mentality so that i can just stop caring about him and what he thinks because i'm just done. he's hurt me so much, and i'm tired. i've been trying to be passive lately, just trying to get through the day with him. we've been arguing a lot, and today i finally worked up the courage not to give in and vent and talk to him about what's on my mind because i know if we talk about what's on my mind, we'll end up in another argument and i just can't take it anymore. he's really high functioning, and i'm not. i missed 3 days of school because of him last week because of another argument. i'm getting tired. i am tired.",1643609450,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-31 06:10:50,1,0,

my thinking is like it’s good to be obsessive bc it keeps me focused on him. like almost everything i do is for him in some way, i work to make money for gifts and stuff for him and i work on my physical health so he doesn’t have to stress over it. i focus on school so i can get a good job to support us. im even looking into therapy (even tho im very scared and dont want to) bc he said i should get help.

i don’t have week long (let alone month long) mood swings, and i barely raise red flags on the bipolar diagnostic survey. however the bpd survey has me marked for every single symptom there is. i’ve started seeing a specialist and am taking group dbt through her shortly.

does anybody else experience this sort of thing with the psychiatrist? it’s not  that i feel i have to have bpd written down, and i do like her, it’s just that it seems she’s trying to convince both of us that it’s not what i think we know it is. seems kind of an odd approach.",1643601356,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-31 03:55:56,1,1,
My FP is leaving for a spontaneous month-long trip around Europe in the middle of our attempt to heal our friendship.,"so i’ve known my fp for about two and a half years now. we’ve been roommates for a year, and i’ve grown obsessed with him over that time. the thing is, i don’t think he understands the degree of the obsessions that i have for him, and he often does these small things that cause my anxieties and fears to flare up dramatically, often causing me to blow up at him or make a fool of myself trying to explain how i feel. he’s very emotionally distant with me, and it plagues me.
recently, i’ve been trying a new method of communication with him where we write each other letters to detail how we feel about certain things, as part of an exercise toward healing and understanding between us. the letters can get very intense, because we both reveal things that the other didn’t quite realise. he’s mentioned in his that i have a huge stake in his life and that he takes the letters very seriously, but it’s been a week now since i gave him my most recent one, and i haven’t heard back from him.
he’s leaving for a month-long trip around europe in a week, which was a completely spontaneous decision that he made about a week ago. i’m excited for him, but i’m also very anxious about the impending loneliness and the fact that i probably won’t get a letter back from him before he leaves. i’ve asked him to text me pictures now and then of where he is and what he’s doing when he’s there, just to keep in touch, but i have this seething fear that he’s going to neglect to do that.

I'm so obsessed with him.,"i don't know why and i hate it. well, i do know why, but i shouldn't be this obsessed with him after so long. he was so kind and so easy to talk to. i poured my soul into our conversations and it was everything. i stayed up until 6am each night just so i could see him. 

context: he's my ex bf's(a) best friend(b). a and i had only been dating for a few weeks when he introduced me to his best friend (b). at first we were friendly, and it was great. us and some other people would hang out regularly and all was fine. until i started catching feelings for b. so me and b started hanging out sometimes. nothing ever happened between us, but i could feel something there, and i think he did too (we talked about it very briefly and put it behind us, he neither confirmed nor denied anything). i figured the next best thing to do was break up with my bf, as i obviously didn't love him. 

fast forward to now,  a and i are still friends but i don't talk to b because a gets jealous (even though we aren't dating). but i can't help the urge to reach out. it's been months, i think since november or september or something. i want to so bad. it's gotten to the point where i'll check his location throughout the day, and when he's at home i consider sending him a text. i never do though. i always fantasize about what our lives could be like together. 

in all honesty, i just need a rejection from him to move on. i know he'd never like me, i'm a bitch who's ""hormonal"" and ""over- emotional"" and i suck at everything. i also think i fell for my fantasy version of him, not him. i wouldn't know because we haven't talked in a few months and i've fantasized about him more than i've talked to him now. 

it just sucks, you know? i think about him so mucoh and it hurts. it hurts to not be able to talk to him, and it hurts knowing he'll never like me like i like him, and he'll never know how much i like him. 

for weeks, every weekend we'd go driving around at night. i'd be high as hell and we'd just talk, about anything and everything. it truly was an amazing experience, and i'd do anything for it again. absolutely anything. 

i'm just stuck running circles in my own mind. i could reach out to him so he could reject me, but then it might circulate back to a and he'd never forgive me. i could just live with this myself, but it eats me up and i hate it. i could try casually talking to him, until i trust that he won't tell anyone. i don't know. i overthinking way too much. i'm just obsessed with this god damn man and he won't get out of my head.

You are not your diagnosis…,"you are not your diagnosis.

you’re bpd is just the way you respond to stimuli. you are “normal” within your own parameters. all your diagnosis is is just an explanation for why you react how you do. these reactions are valid, your feelings are valid. the most important thing is becoming healthy for yourself. 

when i got diagnosed i feel like it helped my symptoms get worse, but i don’t have a disease, i just react to things with how my brain wants to.

now i feel so much more healthy and in control of the “person in the drivers seat”. because i realized that person is me. i get to control my life and live the way i want to just like everyone else.

I think I’m starting to shut down,"like the title says, i think i’m starting to shut down emotionally. over the last two weeks, it feels like everything just keeps piling on. and i don’t really know what to do anymore. i haven’t been able to catch a break, and i don’t really know what my breaking point is. i talk to my therapist tomorrow which is much needed as so much happens between my appointments with her, it gives me time to talk about what all has happened. which reminds me i need to make a list of things i’d like to bring up as so much has happened. 

i feel like i’m starting to shut down emotionally. the smallest things will set me off which then leads to a meltdown happening. i’ve maybe had 3-4 small ones since thursday night. which i’ll take, seeing as how i once rapid cycled and had 7-8 meltdowns in about 7 hours.  that was so emotionally and physically exhausting. i’m wanting to detach myself from more people than i have already. i know i can’t shut everyone out, but part of me wants to, only as a defence mechanism.

Getting diagnosed,"hey, i’m 18, 19 in a few months. i’ve been trying to get diagnosed for the better part of a year.

i have quite literally every symptom and it’s effected me from a young age, going back as far as late elementary school. 

the issue is, they won’t.. actually diagnose me, due to my age. i’m receiving treatment in the form of medication and therapy geared towards borderline personality disorder treatment, minus the label. while it’s helped some it’s certainly still an issue. 

what should i do? i feel gross saying i’ve probably got it without a diagnosis, but.. it’s really the only thing that explains everything, and quite literally the only reason it isn’t diagnosed is my age. 

while i know it’s not a major issue, it does stress me out quite a bit; it’s ruined my life even when i’m careful and again; everyone i’ve seen has brought it up as a likely cause bht won’t diagnose me as i’m too young.

i also want to note- while i have seen multiple professionals, all of them were through two connected programs and communicating with each other. i’m not seeking out doctors in hopes of a diagnosis; i’m moreso just getting passed along.",1642398480,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-17 05:48:00,1,1,
Found some old screenshots and that was not a good idea,"was looking through some pictures on my phone as i had taken a screenshot of a cookie recipe from back in 2015 and went looking for it because i want to make them this upcoming weekend. i found two different screenshots i had taken. one back in 2015, and the other back in 2016. reading what was on both was not a good idea.

both were from two different people. one had been involved with from 2014-2015, and was toxic. we both knew it was, we both admitted it went on longer than it should have. he acknowledged many times that the way he saw/treated me was unhealthy. the one that i found from him had something similar to what he told me one night over the phone which was “i don’t see you as a person, but just a toy i play with”. it did a serious mind-fuck on me. i’m starting to address how much of an impact it had on me in therapy. and it’s been brought up many, many a times with my psychiatrist over the last five years. needless to say, it did a fair amount of damage. 

the other one was from someone who i’ve been on/off with via e-mail for years! who i refer to as the accountant. not a spicy accountant, but it’s what he’s been doing as a job for the last 20+ years. we’ve known each other since 2015z and unfortunately for part of it i was unmedicated, and when i was, there were zero emotional regulation skills that were being used. so needless to say it goes without say that the screenshot i found from him was him being ultra dismissive and using words against me. that one hurt as well. 

reading both of them triggered me somehow and i had an hour long meltdown. i remembered that back then i had zero respect for myself and would let others hurt me emotionally because i could. i’m slowly working on not letting that happen anymore in therapy.

the accountant and i are in another back on phase right now, and it’s so much more healthier than what we had previously. i was going to email the accountant the one screenshot i found and be all “hey, remember how toxic we were back then? found this and we were not good each other then”. i had the email composed but didn’t press send. because i know if it did, it would bring up a lot of hurt on both our ends. 

i went through some emails we’ve been sending each other the last two years.  i’ve done a lot of self-growth over the last few years both mentally and physically. i ended up making a note on my phone of all the times he’s told me he’s proud of me. and these are two that he’s said to me that mean the most in the last six months.

-i’m very proud of you for the progress you’ve made with your personal and social development.  your progress is very much out there and much appreciated honestly.  way to go - and i can appreciate that it hasn’t been easy for you.

-you’ve come a long way, you know

i have apologized to him and held myself accountable for how my words and actions hurt him over the last couple of years before we started talking again in 2019. he’s proud of the amount of progress i’ve made with both therapy and meds the last few years. and i really do hope i continue to do small things that make him proud of me. it really is the small good things some days",1642397677,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-17 05:34:37,1,1,

Honest question - possibly a long one?,"okay, let me list out the following:

1. let's say i've been feeling the scope of how much i'm not a priority in people's lives. which, is okay i guess - for the most part - because i'm in a different time zone to most, and they all have families, etc. i think everyone i know prioritises family, and i don't understand that too much, as because of my life, friends mean everything to me. disparity is there, fine. so, i have been quite understanding of less and less contact. but, when i actually ask for help, fight all instinct and thought to tell them maybe i need a bit more monitoring, or more presences...it doesn't really happen. 

2. i am quite tired of being more active in checking in on  them. bridging the gap, as it were. trying to have a chat, etc. it feels all the more difficult because of my mental state. 

3. it has got to a point where the communication with the people i consider friends is more of a surprise when it happens, as opposed to something i can count on. i should say that i don't talk to them about all the bullshit, just want to have the company - so it isn't always a serious conversation. and i always ask, if it is a serious conversation, if they have the space for it, and definitely tell me when it's too much, which they have done. 

4. i'm feeling the old need to distance myself from people. i am in a bad place, so i am aware that it might just be a symptom showing up. but, at the same time, is it a bad thing? if a need is not being met, and i am counting on it, isn't it better if i learn distance again, and just get by on my own? like i am left to do anyway, feeling that much more alone and isolated? 

5. i guess my question is, is my thinking so skewed that it's a terrible idea to take some quiet time from everyone? i mean, i have already told them that if i am quiet for 3 days, that they should probably reconnect because of what i just recently learnt about emotional permanence and the other thing. i have no reason to think they'll do it, and it's usually me who thinks i should do it so i don't delve deeper into my aloneness.

Should I let go or should I stay?,"my girlfriend with bpd (19f) and i (24m) have only been dating for 2-3 months. the 1st month was bliss and we would be together for a couple of days every week. she was open, affectionate and available. but i’ve felt that after our first trip, she’s been cold and distant. 
it started as saying she can’t text, can’t call, then she can’t stay over anymore, can’t see me on the weekends. holidays rolled in and i’d only get a text/call every other 2-3 days. she would tell me that she’s busy so frequently even during the holidays, she would often say that she needs time alone which i’ve always respected. when i brought up that i felt she’s been drifting away, she told me that i can leave if her schedule doesn’t work for me, i’m taken aback by how reluctant she is to meet me in the middle. she would be the most responsive when she needed to borrow money and/or having a terrible day.

having dealt with family problems on top, i snapped(in text) and told her that she doesn’t do anything for me even when i try to be there for her when she needs it. i apologized the next day having realized that i snapped while she was in class. she told me that she’s on the fence about our relationship, and that when people snap they mean what they say.
after i apologized, she told me she needed time alone. i haven’t been the best at this as i kept asking about ground rules for example, if we’re still exclusive; to which i would get the same answer, she needs time alone. 
because of the lack of something concrete between us, i told her that i won’t message until the weekend only to check on her but also that i’m open if ever she messages first.
we’re having minimal contact now and it’s just me checking up on her as she got covid recently. weekend is up and i’ve been letting her now how sorry i feel for her, that i’m here if she needs me but she’s mostly replying in one words and gets irritable (which she does so often now, but were so talkative in the beginning of the relationship).

i’ve been reading about bpd ever since she brought it up on the first date, and it seems to me that she’s splitting (i really don’t know).
a couple of days back i’ve realized that i can’t really pin my reason to stay on the hopes that the person i’ve met in the beginning would come back. and that i need more communication and physical affection in a relationship, which we’ve been lacking.

"If I’m not invited, I feel unwanted.","i know it’s probably completely something to do with like fear of abandonment or something. 

but a lot of the time if i go to go do stuff, i guess i always feel the need to invite people to stuff specifically? for example if i want to hangout with friends i don’t ever ask “who wants to hangout” to a group of people, rather i ask people one on one.

so sometimes when people don’t do it to me it feels like they don’t want me there, so despite how desperately bad i want to include myself in situations i find it impossible to unless i am asked to join directly? 

and i hate it because i don’t even think it’s that hard to message someone as ask them to do something? like i do it with everyone else so why can’t people do it for me? you know.

this usually ends up with me feeling like i’m the only person that ever asks to see or talk to my friends which results in me withdrawing from them for a few months only to wind back up in the same spot later?

"Opened up about my mental health to a guy I was seeing, he became distant, then I see him in a relationship with a different girl on fb","so i have depression, anxiety and ptsd. i'm almost certain i have bpd but i'm yet to be diagnosed 

i thought i met the guy of my dreams a few months back and we talked non-stop, enjoyed dates together, made plans. after so many shitty relationships and guys, i thought i lucked out. 

i get depression episodes and i've been getting better at getting through them. i was so scared to open up to him but i realised i needed to when i was in the middle of an episode 

i told him what i've been diagnosed with, mentioned my ptsd is from a previous relationship (absolutely no further details) and even though i'm working hard at getting better, i still have my off days. 

i tried to keep it as vague as possible and didn't trauma dump him either. 

but since that moment, it all changed. he'd respond to me less, from texting all day and until late at night to one message a day, then days without a message and then just radio silence 

he messaged me on christmas day weeks later wishing me a merry christmas then radio silence again.

then about a week later i see on his fb he's in a relationship with another girl. i don't know this girl but from the photos on the post she's drop dead gorgeous 

i am...kind of broken. 

i am constantly worried i am not enough and i'm too crazy, mentally ill to ever be loved. 

every other guy previously would outright tell me there's other women they'd much rather be with than me and ghost me after sex. 

i've settled on the decision that i'm just broken and i need to do everything to hide how ill i am. i am just not capable of a loving romantic relationship.

did any of you went through something like that? i'd appreciate any comments sharing your experiences.

is it me or are all breakups like this?,"posted on like 2 other subs but im so desperate for answers/advice/thoughts and it’s pretty much entirely bpd related because im fucking crazy lol

tldr: i had a messy breakup and now i don’t know what to do because they’ve changed so much and i no longer know where i stand or what i should do. 

i’ve had three serious relationships and they all had the same blueprint. i wasn’t really interested, they confessed, i gave it a shot, i fell in love, my mental illness(es) (depression, anxiety, bpd, the full works) hurt the relationship, messy breakup, they end up hating me, the blame falls on me (though to be honest they weren’t angels either by the end of it). 

all of my exes were (imo or to the best of my memory) really sweet and innocent and i really truly loved them but after the breakup they all changed to the point where i don’t recognise them anymore. like it feels like i didn’t even know who they were, and now that i see them again (irl or on social media) it’s like ??? were you always like that? were you like that when we were together? 

i don’t know if it’s worth mentioning but all of them relied on me in some sort of way wrt mental health (talking them down from panic attacks, helping them figure out how to handle anxiety/depression) because i’ve had a shitshow time with mental illness so i handle it well and i handle their breakdowns well but when it comes to my breakdowns, they can’t handle it no matter how much they promise to stay or stick it through with me. i can handle myself but it most often means shutting down and well consensus is that people dont really enjoy being shut out (which i completely understand). 

am i just fucking these people up like i’m so guilty for what i’ve done (breaking up with them or generally allowing my mental illness to ruin the relationship) even though i rationally know that they didnt exactly do everything right either. 

what hurts the most now is that i still very much love my most recent ex and i know leaving them alone is the best for them, but i still really want to work things out and i want to tell them that i’m really fucking trying my best to be a better person for them but they’ve changed so much like i don’t know what to do anymore because it seems like they’ve moved on. but the last i remember we agreed we were on a break. i really dont want to reach out and ask them about it when i’m not ready yet bc then it’s just another round of hurt for them and if they’ve already moved in then i should just stay away. i’m really just i don’t know i already hate myself enough i don’t know what else i can do to punish myself or let them know that i really am sorry for how things turned out.",1642354120,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-16 17:28:40,1,0,

BPD barely existant outside of relationship,"hi! so i got diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 2 years ago, and my doctor very loosely said i could have bpd as i suggested it, and now im actually getting an appointment to be tested for it thursday. since that day 2 years ago, i've been paying attention to my symptoms. i even explained it to my ex gf, and she tried understanding me more because my bpd/behavior was basically controlling our relationship.

my bpd ""traits""/all of the symptoms emerged a little after i got into a relationship with my now ex-gf (it was super tough to leave but after like 40 breakups within 3 years, it broke off for good). im guessing because of all the trauma, cheating, lying, she did which made my mind completely fucked... bpd, relationship ptsd idk

anyways, its like a checklist with how spot-on everything is considering bpd. when i found out about bpd, i felt so much relief, despite it being the worst thing to ever come into my life. i believe i have genetic predisposition to bpd and that trauma from my relationship ""woke"" it up??

my worry/tldr: my symtpoms have since mellowed out ever since our relationship ended... and since im getting tested for bpd this thursday, i feel like an asshole/really anxious/upset bc theyre nearly gone now.

question: has your bpd mainly/only showed in relationships? mine practically emerged from mine

Proposal: What should I do ?,"hello,

i have been dating an amazing girl for 11 months now. i suspect she has bpd. last august, she lost her brother (who she described as her father figure), and since then has been unstable. 

last december, she pressured me saying that we cannot continue the relationship without a future, and that if i'm not planning to propose, she would not continue talking to me. so last week i decided to propose. she said that she has to think, because she's not sure about our characters compatibility. when i told her that this was a no, and that i'd rather break up and move-on; she didn't let me go, and said that she didn't say no, that she still loves me, and she was happy to see me. 

i am disoriented and confused. before proposing, when i used to call her, i found her talking late at night on the phone. she swore and promised that it was her sister, but i still have trust issues. my friends shame me for accepting such a bad situation, because ""obviously you're her plan b"". 

i really love her, many friends tell me i should break up and move-on and quit, that i deserve better. anyone who has advice ? 

any advice from people who have bpd ? 

thank you,",1642348910,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-16 16:01:50,1,0,

BPD in the UK - help please?,"hi guys, my gf is undiagnosed but she's very sure that's what she has, after much reading. what is the process for her to get help? she has been to her gp before but it has not resulted in a diagnosis.

if she manages to get a diagnosis, would that then enable her to get free dbt therapy?

Is avoding relationships a symptom of BPD?,"i have not been diagnosed with bpd, but i am seeing a new therapist in a few days.

in the past, anytime i made a friend i would be really into it for a little while. then i would get bored (and also insecure) and start ghosting them until they stop reaching out to me. i'm very insecure and would have to dress up in makeup just to hang out with friends. it felt like a chore, so i eventually ended up ghosting all my childhood friends. i haven't made a new friend in years. a married couple at my job keep inviting me over (like everyday) and i say no everytime. for no reason.

here's the catch: i don't really like people that much. i don't find them interesting. i'm an introvert and i prefer to spend time alone. however, my mom died when i was only 10 years old. so maybe that made me afraid? i'm scared of the mask mandate being dropped because then my coworkers will see my ugly face for the first time. i might even quit my job when that happens and look for another one. i hate the idea of someone thinking i look a certain way, and then being disappointed when i take the mask off.

could these be symptoms? also, how long did it take for you to get diagnosed?",1642341052,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-16 13:50:52,1,0,

Enmeshed after break up (living together/social circle). How can my ex (BPD) and me avoid a catastrophy?,"what do i tell her? go no contact forever? be direct and honest why i broke up, keep it short and simple? motivate her and be extra nice or does it make it harder?

i read everything about bpd now, but of course that does not solve all my limits while interacting within a month: 1. my avoidant style triggers her 2. me sobbing and telling her all is good and so on will not help her move on i guess. 3. me wanting to help her wont work i guess (co-dependent issues).

have you ever had an amicable break up? what helped you? we search for flats but might live together a while.

context:

i broke up because i was at mental and physical limits and couldnt help myself otherwise. didnt recover from a fight and talking about it made things worse. its pretty tragic and we have very strong feelings for each other

i went to another country for a few months, but we now have to have contact again and bring everything to closure. i think neither of us wants to hurt the other person anymore. but the emotions will make it hard. its definitely not a normal breakup, i have never felt like my life would never be good again.

me:
also sensitive person with add &amp; depression which flared up again due to all. i kind of f'ed up my college plus job. i am definitely not over her and cry every day. i know we wont be part of each others life anymore and wished it all went different. i had no profound information on bpd, only went to counseling on how to handle her abandonment issues. i did not understand the rest.

her: 
has a new job and just moved the city last year with new sc. no support from family (toxic people), keeps her problems secret from friends. she works on her anxiety, but has (accountability problems due to shame i guess?). she is texting very diplomatically and seeks closure, wants to know why i broke up (which i do not get because we talked a lot about our problems and that i am at my limits)",1642331949,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-16 11:19:09,0,0,

Seeking Support,"sorry if this is a bit long winded. i'm in uk if that helps

i spoke to my gp about going for a diagnosis of bpd and c-ptsd, and while i had to explain everything to him (which triggered me a lot) he said that i fit all 9 criteria for bpd and i definitely experience the symptoms of c-ptsd too. in our first phone call he said he would refer me to the mental health specialist team (mhst) who would direct me in the right place to go and speak to a therapist which i welcomed as i do want help.

a few weeks later in july i had a telephone call with the mhst and the guy on the phone said that, again, i fit all of the criteria for a diagnosis for bpd and c-ptsd, but said that he doesn't want to put a label on it because his ""clients don't like it"". i was a bit taken back by this because as much as i hate having this disorder i would prefer to have a solid diagnosis so i can get proper help. instead, he said this and told me i would be put on a waiting list for anger management and that i would be joining that course at the end of september. 

now, i do understand that mental health services are under pressure but i haven't heard off them since the july appointment and i haven't had any letters inviting me to join the course. i'm stuck at this point in what to do because the letter about me being on the waiting list specifies not to ring them up about the appointment but because it has been nearly 6 months since the call i'm worried that they'll think i don't want the treatment in case they did send out a letter and i didn't receive it.

I feel like im the devil itself in my partners eyes,"my partner and i have been together for 5 months and we have had a whole lot of ups and downs. 

in the beginning he seemed to want to hear me out on why i am the way i am. he atleast tried to listen to how i feel. but i think i put him through so much shit that he has given up on listening to me and calls it all bullshit. 

i know that i act out badly alot of the time. and i try to apologize and explain what i was feeling. but i dont feel like he listens to me at all? when im trying to express myself he goes straight to calling me names... like dumb b*tch, toxic, whore or curses at me in every reply. or just saying im making stuff up and calling is bullshit. i feel like he doesnt want to understand my illness and that he just thinks im straight up the devil. 

this makes me feel even worse than before the conversations. i want to genuinly explain myself and apologize. instead of ever hearing me out he goes straight to saying im making excuses and completely dismisses my feelings.  its like he had labeled me as a toxic girlfriend and thats all i am. that its all in black and white and there could be nothing good coming out of my mouth. 

i am starting dbt-therapy in 2 weeks. i want to share my journey with him and ive tried to talk to him about it. but he simply doesnt care. he just says ""theres nothing i can do, its about you not me"". he doesnt want me to talk about it. like yeah, but id like to have a partner i can talk to about all this stuff. someone supportive of me getting better. someone that cares. i dont feel like he cares. i realize its my issue but i want him to just atleast listen to me. and care. just be there you know?

alot of the time i feel like he makes my issues about him.. like if something is going on outside of our relationship that im upset about. he makes it about him. in a way were he is ultimately the victim no matter what. if im that terrible and only toxic, why even be with me anymore :(

i’m not sure… i asked her if this was just a bad day and she told me that wasn’t the case. i have no idea what to do because… did she really want me to go? did she want to push and keep me away? and i don’t know whether i should actually stay away or push back. i’m worried that i’ll mess up even more. i know that i want to stick with her for as long as i can.

what is it that makes you sure you’ve got the right diagnosis? 

i think i have cptsd and insecure attachment (anxious), making me so vulnerable and afraid to being abandoned. i don’t have that rage and throwing things or hating on people. my symptoms only show up in close romantic relationships.

Does anybody know of any good workbooks that deal with BPD and feelings of worthlessness?,"hey folks. first time posting here, was diagnosed late last year (i'm 32) after many years of being treated unsuccessfully for what was assumed to be just chronic garden variety depression and anxiety. i tried a new therapist for a little but the sessions didn't really seem to have any direction or focus, or to go anywhere/achieve anything. i also couldn't afford to keep going with it.

so i'm looking for a self-treatment workbook type of thing, particularly one that focuses on changing deep-seated feelings of worthlessness and deficiency, because this has probably had the most disabling impact on my life and ability to form relationships, and is probably the most prominent feature of my struggles with mental health.

do I have BPD?,"i am aware that this is no place to get ""diagnosed"", but i am probably never going to see a therapist so i just want to know if i may possibly have it or not from people who actually have bpd. so basically, i am a very moody person. my moods can shift quickly. for example, i can feel normal/happy which then can quickly transform into anger and then sadness/depression. i can also be irritable alot of the times and that irritation causes anger. i get angry alot and it is difficult for me to manage it and the simplest things manage to trigger me. one major thing i realized was that whenever i am talking about my problems with someone, i may trust them one day, but then the next day or week i will see them as a liar when they did not do anything to betray my trust. my brain just randomly tells me that someone cant be trusted and so i stop believing in everything they say. one day i can see someone as a friend/ally and the next i can see them as an enemy. for instance, this happened recently where i had became friends with someone and i was happy that we were officially friends. then literally like 2 days later, i do not see them as a friend anymore and i think that they were just lying when they said we could be friends. that same person also told me that i could come talk to her about anything that bothered me and i had trusted and appreciated her the time she said that, but now a few weeks later my thoughts tell me that she was just saying that and was lying to me. there is no one i can trust permanently. it feels like everyone is plotting something against me which is why i just randomly stop trusting people. i also have suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm. i have not harmed myself in any way yet, but i am sure i will one day. i feel empty and hopeless as a person as i have no purpose in life.",1642299757,TRUE,BPD,2022-01-16 02:22:37,1,0,

All my friends get help except for me. Neglected by gp.,"i’m from the uk. 
reached out to a friend who sent me a message days ago bc she saw my “cry for help” post on my instagram. we were talking about when we met and she said “that day i was in a manic episode because i stopped taking my antipsychotics.” 
this made me so sad because she is given antipsychotics medicine which would benefit me so much, when all i’m prescribed is antidepressants. 

she has been diagnosed with bpd a few months ago and she knows i have it. 

now this is the part where you will likely judge me and think less of me by not being officially diagnosed by a health professional. 

when i reached out years ago i was laughed at by the gp and told “this is very hard to diagnose. you do not have it.”
when she said this i stormed out the room because she made me so angry how she was so unnecessarily rude. 
 
now, i am about 3 years older (25) and my mental health is worse than ever. my symptoms have worsen. 

you might think this is strange but i had have 3 friends in total with a bpd diagnosis/ working diagnosis (whatever that means) (1 isn’t part of my life anymore) and this is irrelevant but i just want to say they’re white. i am latina, and you know the stereotype “are very feisty/ south american anger”.  i do believe this stereotype gets in the way of me getting a diagnosis. 

i have multiple diagnosis of mental illnesses. i have bought an essential book that has everything about the disorder because i wanted to know if i have it since i’m always neglected by the gp. i have 8 symptoms that impact my daily life. i am not making this up. years when i found out about this illness i was like “wow i can’t believe there’s a name for all the things that i experience in my life.” it was comforting to know. but my symptoms weren’t as obvious. years go by and i get worse and worse. more self-destructive, irritable, reckless. 

i’ve made these friends years after i knew i had bpd. 

my first time talking to anyone about me having a suspicion about having bpd, after that terrible encounter with the gp that left me feeling worse:

my friend that i had who has bpd i remember one time i told her (i didn’t know she was being diagnosed with it) i told her i think i have it and she said “yeah the other day when you told me // (something i told her about how i act horrible with my partner) // -  wanted to say that because that is not the (my name) i know. 
she was shocked when i told her and something so simple left her thinking i have it.

none of my friends (whom think i am diagnosed with bpd) doubt i don’t have it. 

i understand everyone experiences mental illness different no matter the diagnosis. however i feel so unheard by public health professionals and neglected it makes me wanna k1ll myself. 

i’m so done. if i can’t get a diagnosis for my illness i have no hope because i’m neglected emotionally. what do i do? do i go ahead and seek private healthcare even though it’s much more than i can afford? do i try getting help from the gp again after all these years, and still being given the wrong medication?",1642282890,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-15 21:41:30,1,1,

Question regarding cheating with BPD,"hi there -

i (22m) don’t have bpd but i’m asking about cheating because i found out my (now) ex boyfriend (22m) with bpd cheated on me throughout the course of our relationship of just under a year with many other people. 

naturally, i got upset and upon finding out broke up with him but since he has messaged me saying things like it’s because of his bpd that he was trying to sabotage the relationship and provoke me to break up with him to punish himself and also that it was meant to liberate me from the relationship because he doesn’t deserve me.

i’m also upset because i found out he cheated earlier in the relationship. it destroyed me and we had a lot of conversations about it - i thought it was a one time thing and expressed to him that if it happens again i’d leave. at the time he also blamed it on his bpd saying he was “testing himself” or something like that and i worked really hard with him to regain my trust in him. however since, i’ve come to learn that he was just manipulating me and continuing to serially cheat. whenever i’d ask him about a guy because he was acting suspect he would be so great at talking to me and putting my mind at ease when in reality my suspicions have turned out to have always been correct.  

my question is does this make sense? i don’t want to believe it’s all due to his bpd because he never told me about the cheating (i found out from a third party and proceeded to look at his phone) and it was continuous throughout the relationship so i can’t imagine he ever actually intended on telling me. 

long story short i’m just confused and ultimately don’t want to believe that this was just a symptom of bpd because he’s blaming everything on his diagnosis and making himself the victim. in my mind i find it hard to believe that he would betray me so much and so willingly to provoke me or free me when he was actively hiding it from me - it feels like he’s just using his diagnosis as a scapegoat for getting caught and had no intention of ever telling me about his infidelity - like he wanted the comfort of our relationship (which on all other accounts was actually quite stable and felt fulfilling and interesting on my part) while also sleeping with other people on the side. 

i’d really like the insight of other people w bpd on this - does this make sense to you? obviously you don’t know him but what is you impression of the situation? i don’t know what to think.",1642279205,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-15 20:40:05,0,0,

"I see so many articles about ""dealing with someone with bpd"" but not any for the one who has it when their partner uses it against them?","i'm not sure he even realizes he does it. since it's been put out there, i feel like he uses it to explain irrelevant things or invalidate me when i'm upset because it's just the potential of bpd? 

when i am venting about trauma, he has the tendency to say some invalidating things. we had a conversation recently where i wasn't too upset, wasn't crying, just felt a bit clingy and vocalized that. he made a comment that my childhood couldn't have been all that bad and some other things he thought were comforting. they were not. i told him ""you might think you're helping me, but you are not. please stop"". instead of stopping he felt he needed to explain his reasoning. i, again, told him ""you're making me mad. stop"". this ended up being a whole argument, he just ""didn't want me to spiral"". despite the fact i was clearly communicating and rational prior to him not listening or respecting when i asked him to stop. 

i am so tired of having my emotions weoponized against me when he is just acting like a jerk or insensitive. i dont know how to make him realize he's doing this to me. 

he's typically a great partner. every other aspect of the relationship is good. but i don't know how to deal with this. he, very geniounly, doesn't think he's in the wrong when he does things like this because his intention is good (and i believe he thinks he's helping). i make such a strong effort to communicate my needs, feelings, and so on clearly but he never listens and later tells me he didn't know.

Why can't I love normally,"i was talking to my friend, and he was telling me about how he planned on asking out his friend. it's been a few months since they met, it seems pretty clear that there's at least something there, and he's planning on asking her out. he's nervous, of course, and concerned about the possibility of rejection, but it feels like he's handling it normally.

me, on the other hand--- i have been sitting with this disgusting feeling for 6 months straight, doing absolutely nothing about it, hating myself every second. everything she does is significant to me, i can't think about anything other than her, and my mood is entirely determined by how i understand her to perceive me. i'm too afraid of rejection to do anything or say anything, i'm too concerned about her feelings to make things awkward, and i'm too delusional to pick up on any signs, positive or negative. i feel empty, furious at myself, and depressed all the time because of this, and i can't do the one thing (confession) that'll allow me to move on because i'm just too scared. i don't even care about a relationship. i just want to stop feeling this. i have never been in so much mental pain in my life.

i just... i just envy people with the ability to deal with this shit normally. to confront the fear of rejection yet do what's best for them. to have infatuation and crushes be an overall fun feeling. it's not fun for me, though. it's just agonizing. so unbearably agonizing.",1642654543,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-20 04:55:43,1,0,

New fp + my BPD backstory,"i thought i was safe from having another favorite person for a while after i got over my ex-boyfriend, which took months to do and required so much hard work pushing him out of my everyday thoughts and so on. it was two days before my birthday when i basically forced myself to be completely over him, knowing it would ruin my birthday if i woke up expecting a ""hbd"" text and didn't end up getting one. it ended up being the first birthday for as long as i can remember where i didn't sob uncontrollably for no particular reason. for some reason the night before, i decided to take one of my friends along with me to meet this guy who she was friends with after we'd exchanged a few texts about potentially seeing each other individually since we had so many mutual friends. as the night progressed, i began to realize how attracted to him i was, which i tend not to take lightly because of how rare it is for me to catch genuine feelings for someone. on a regular day, i'll feel completely asexual until months later i'll randomly meet someone and start to like them. a lot. like to the point where they are all i think about and i become completely obsessed. anyways, we haven't seen each other since then. but he is now without a doubt my new favorite person and has been for almost a month. i once had an fp last for going on three years, and it wasn't fun. i mean, to say the least. i turned down almost every advance i received, even if i did like the person i was getting romantic attention from, it felt as if i was betraying him even though we hadn't spoken in years and he expressed no interest in getting back together with me. i lived my life every day feeling like he was watching me, and could hear everything i said including my internal thoughts. any time i would say something slightly embarrassing even if it was to myself when no one was around, the phrase would repeat in my head until i felt complete and utter shame due to the fact that it always felt like he was watching over me, judging me. i experienced the same thing with my most recent favorite person, and the second i realized it was recurring with the guy i like now, i kind of started to freak out. because we barely know each other. i told him i found him attractive and he seemed excited to go out with me, but for some yet-to-be-discovered reason, i always tend to catch feelings for extremely mentally ill people. like myself, i guess. i thought he was perfectly well, which caused me to mask my true personality in order to seem healthier for him, but he dropped the bomb on me that he went into a depressive episode and doesn't want to accidentally push me away because of how overwhelmed he would get when getting to know someone while feeling like this. i don't know what to do because i am in need of constant reassurance, and i cannot expect that from someone who i recently found out doesn't even consider what we have to be a talking stage. i don't wanna lose feelings for him, as freeing as it would be, this feels so innocent and better for me than any other relationship i've been in. i just want him to feel the same and be expressive of it. i feel so trapped. sucking in my stomach even when no one is looking and feeling like i need to look cute while brushing my teeth because i feel as if he is watching my every move like he's god or something is so dehumanizing even though in a way, i am doing this to myself. sorry if that was rambly and all over the pace but anyone who understands what i am trying to say, can you offer me any help? what advice do i need in order to stop my life from revolving around this?",1642654186,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-20 04:49:46,1,0,
How long does your splitting episode usually last?,"i've been diagnosed bpd by 3 separate psychiatrists so at this point i've come to terms with the fact that i probably must have it. 

but i just can't help but shake the feeling that it's still wrong or a misdiagnosis because some of my symptoms are just very different from what other bpd people apparently go through.

first of all i'm quiet bpd so nearly all of my symptoms are inward, and even when i split and ""lash out"" at someone, i keep it to my thoughts which may sound like a blessing to some of you but i guarantee you it's the worst feeling in this universe. 

especially because my ""splitting"" episodes tend to last for very long stretches of time. sometimes it's resolved within a few hours or in a day or two, but often it lasts for weeks or even months at a time in which i'm actively and intensely resentful while outwardly pretending that i'm completely fine. then of course i feel like everything is going great with this person and they're amazing and whatnot for another few days/ occasionally weeks (never really months in my experience for the positive side).

i... i had a really bad point last semester where my insomnia got so bad i went into the hospital for 5 days... i hadn't been diagnosed by then as borderline but it was so horrible; it left me traumatized and my eating disorder (which was getting bad) literally got boosted. i lost 5 pounds in those days. they treated us pretty shitty in there. there was not even a threshold of control over my life and i was losing it. the stress was so big that they put me under the highest dose of temazepam and i still didn't sleep through the night.... i pretend shit was find to get the fuck out of there. and then. after a few days i finally could sleep a bit. drug-heavy sleep, but sleep!!!!!! i was so happy!!!! and it was ok for a few days, even weeks. then the stress lowered and then went up. fast forward a few weeks i started getting sick because of the medication. the dose was too much for my body but there was nothing i could do but wait for the next appointment with my psychiatrist &amp; psychologist. the same ones who were like ""u don't have bpd lol, we've been treating you for years, we would have known"" 🤠

why do i tell you this???? well. my insomnia has been getting bad again and the stress is really getting to me so the medication is not enough. it's really hard for me to go about life these days. my ibs acts up when it wants to. can't fucking sleep.

Ranting about my distant girlfriend,"i hate when my so feels distant...

this so hard on me, and i can't rely on telling her that. i feel like im just needy and dependent on her. so i try to just keep it to myself. but as this goes on, i just feel myself splitting. i convince myself that i don't care, and i try not to go around and send her random messages along the day. slowly i fade into  reality (or at least what i make of it) that she is just ignoring me. i get annoyed and i tell her. i feel ashamed of chasing her response and coming around needy...

this repeats through out the times this happens (around a few days at a time). as i express more and more how i don't like that she is distant, the shittier the situation gets. i feel like and absolute ahole for having to remind her of me.

this fades away as she understands we are in fact distant, and things shouldn't be this way. we get to talk as normal. 

this leads me into a few days of doubt and i feel hesitant to message her. i hate this feeling.

deep down i understand that she is busy studying, family, sleeping(as she does short naps throughout the day). but i just can't really deal with my emotions in the short term and tend to close myself. going through it rn and it sucks, i'm in the phase of ignoring her messages after saying that i felt she was being distant (im in shame tbh).

of course i still just want him to answer me. but what i want even more is not to feel like a worthless little girl. when will this stop? most of my symptoms are gone after i went to therapy. i can regulate emotions way better than in earlier points of my life. but i feel like i will always look for validation in others and not getting it is so painful. especially from someone i started to like. i just wish i knew why i‘m suddenly being treated like this, i don’t see an apparent reason why he would do that besides from “he doesn’t like me after all”.",1642627332,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-19 21:22:12,1,1,
My BPD diagnosis confuses people who aren’t psychiatrists,"telling people that i have bpd causes more confusion than clarity - even among therapists that i’ve had. apparently my flavor of bpd is uncommon. i wish that there was a clearer label than ‘bpd’ that i could use to communicate to people.

i know that there are a few labels for bpd subtypes. ‘quiet borderline’ would most likely to apply to me simply because i appear calm on the outside. the idea behind ‘quiet borderline’ is that they have similar emotions to other borderlines but that those emotions are directed inward. i don’t think that this describes me either.

there are hundreds of permutations of bpd symptoms (if you use the dsm4 criteria). so of course there will be people who have bpd who are different. one of the consequences of having an uncommon flavor of bpd is that i often doubt whether i even have bpd. i’ve thought about this a lot and i can’t come to a decision.",1642626325,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-19 21:05:25,1,1,

the thing is when he comes back, he's always super casual and acts like no time has passed and nothing bad transpired between us. i would love any insight on this situation. is it a memory issue? is he just pretending everything is okay in hopes that i will too? something else?

It's really hard to act like I know I should,"i came here to vent, maybe someone has something which can help me.

i have a boyfriend who is currently my fp, i have diagnosed bpd but have been in therapy and it's better. i live in another city for a few months, so my boyfriend and i can only see each other on the weekends.

monday we wanted to talk over the phone, but my head hurt so i said ""maybe tomorrow"". yesterday i kinda lost track of time and my roommate wanted to watch a movie so when it was evening i asked my boyfriend if he wanted to chat, obviously it was too late. 

now he is hurt because i gave him the feeling, that i have other priorities. i always try to make him my top priority but yesterday i kinda lost focus on that and got lost in my own world (was drawing all day) and thought we could talk later or today. i shouldn't have assumed it, it was careless and now i feel awful.

if the roles were reversed i know i would be hurt, so i don't understand why i am like this.
i have been crying the past half hour because my brain won't shut up and i instantly jumped to the conclusion that i am too much of a burden to him...
it was my fault and yet i can't stop acting like a victim.

In response to a comment about splitting,"there was a post by someone asking how they can be more supportive of their pwbpd. reading thru the comments, i came across one that i just wanted to respond to because it's something i struggle with and feel strongly about. i'd like to get some feedback on this if you dont mind.

the comment was giving advice about how to handle splitting. the pwobpd suggested that when an episode arises and the pwbpd starts attacking verbally to ""learn when to...just ignore and let it blow over."" i don't want to use the wrong term and offend, and i'm definitely not saying it doesn't work sometimes, but i think that mindset is lacking emotional intelligence and very unhelpful if not highly damaging to both people.

splitting in bpd is something i don't think most people really understand. overreacting, spitefulness, being an evil psycho bitch, that's what it looks like. but it's not just getting mad and getting even, and it's so much more complicated than black and white thinking. it's the reaction to intense and confusing negative emotions, to feeling persecuted, betrayed, neglected, abandoned. it's so much more than feeling disappointed, let down, ignored, criticized. it's feeling broken and lost and alone. it's hopelessness and frustration that builds into a frenzied desperation to get it out to make it stop to...make it go away by giving it back. it's a culmination of grief, resentment and fear that's directed outward. 

the things that come out of our mouths during an episode.... i have said some really vile, disgusting shit that makes me sick when i think about it. the cruelty and hatefulness i've unleashed on people that i love is something that i'll never forgive myself for. some of them tried to believe me when i apologized, tried to believe that i didn't mean any of it, that it wasn't me but the bpd. but patience wears thin, confidence starts to fade, trust gets broken, love is lost. the willingness and ability to forgive diminish because the disrespect can't be forgotten. splitting can be incredibly destructive because it hurts both people. it's easy to see the damage caused by the pwbpd, but i don't think many realize, understand or really care about how deeply it affects us. 

in a recent relationship, my fp wouldn't feed into my bullshit when i was splitting, he expected it and would wait til i stopped. but the only thing that stopped was the outward expression. i internalized the grief, resentment and fear, added guilt, shame and self-loathing. i hated myself for hurting him when he was trying to understand and accept and love me. i hated myself for loving him when he was causing me to feel that way. it started a chain reaction of self-sabotage. my fears that he would get tired of it and leave brought on crazy paranoia, the thought that he could leave me when i obviously needed him more than ever caused anger that made words not enough. i did a lot of things that i am ashamed of, i lost a lot of respect for myself, i damaged myself. i lost someone who had given me so much, i destroyed pieces of him that he'll never get back, i hurt him in ways that changed him into someone he didn't want to be. 

this is why treatment and therapy are so so important for both people in a bpd relationship. trying to not take everything someone says personal is good advice, but what if they take it personal? ignoring the problem, thinking it'll just blow over and eventually get better doesn't help anyone. without treatment living with bpd is like being stuck in a tar pit, the more you struggle the faster you sink and anyone who tries to help without the right tools will fall in and sink too, and you'll be stuck in the darkness, separated from everyone and everything, and so will they. it's important to know the tools and how to use them to help someone climb out and make sure you're both okay after.

If you ever feel alone in your diagnosis… just remember,"pete davidson also has bpd. 

you can have amazing relationships with people, and even be a celebrity with bpd. 

there is literally nothing you can’t do, please please don’t let this stand in your way. 

it’s hard and it fucking sucks, but we all have the power to overcome this shit.

they don’t call it remission for a reason, 
 it’s the psychiatric cancer. 

if people are leaving your life and not coming back because of your bpd, then they’re just terrible people. good people understand why you acted the way you did — you may have hurt them yes, but this is different then intentionally inflicting pain. they may take space from you, but they should not write you off because of symptoms which at times you basically can’t control at all. 

our disorder and pain are hard to understand because they are invisible. you don’t where the pain exactly comes from or how to make it stop. physical illness can at least pinpoint a body part or a physical descriptor (as those are more objective).

my advice to all of you is to tell your friends, a professor, or trusted person, call a hotline or tell a stranger, write on here, other subreddits, start a podcast i don’t care, just talk about it. you can be anonymous, you can be a quiet supporter, hell you can donate $1 a year to a bpd foundation for all i care. 

the more we speak about this disorder to people until they widely (or at least half decently) understand how bpd (and did, bipolar, and other mood/personality disorders) works, manifests, and hurts ourselves and others. people do not know the strength it takes to walk every day living like this. i think we can all agree that it feels like we are living in a forever hell.

apologize for your symptoms, often. thank those who help you along, tell people what may or may not happen. hope for the best, prepare for the worst. don’t shy away from this. because the more we do the more it consumes us. 

we are our own best advocates. the more people know, the more they will be able to help. 

we have to fight for awareness and visibility. 

you are not alone. 
we are not alone. 

we just need everyone to know is that sometimes all we know is how to be alone. 

loneliness is our biggest cry for help. 

mental health is getting so much more attention and importance placed onto it every passing day, and we deserve to be a part of that increased awareness. 

we deserve love, compassion, laughs, hugs, smiles, happy thoughts, and eyes always looking up towards our futures.

we can do it, we can make a world that will be more kind to those who suffer with bpd.

How to break up with someone with BPD?,"without getting too into detail, i’m my partner’s fp and we’re in a long distance relationship. the relationship is starting to negatively affect my mental health in a way that can’t really be fixed, it’s just we both have a lot of needs that neither of us can meet. i try to meet my partners but it’s extremely difficult for me, and i don’t want to communicate my needs with my partner because they’re things they can’t do. i’ve made up my mind that our best solution is to break up, but i don’t want to hurt them when i do so.

My best friend of 8 years turned her back on me.,"she’s a super important friend of mine - the kind that helps me move house at 2am, the kind that took me  in when my father chased me out years ago. (of cos i’m just naming the two specific examples and it doesn’t means this is our usual dynamic)

after we started working (and due to her extremely introverted nature) we can go days without talking, then weeks, then months….

on may 2021 i met her and everything seemed fine, but we went home and she just started fading off again - i thought it was normal.

but september came when we were supposed fo collect our graduation gowns together - when i texted her she just said she alr collected, and when i asked why? she didn’t reply. i also asked if she was free for dinner and she simply said no.

i guess i was hurt, then october her birthday passed i didn’t say anything.  by november she changed her netflix acc and that was that.

knowing her she’s the kind to avoid confrontations, and i missed her, so i decided to just pretend nothing happen - last week i sent her a random pic of this pen i got her last year (our inside joke but never had a chance tk pass to her). she didn’t reply. so yesterday i texted her casually asking her to go to the movies saying i’ve extra tickets, and lightheartedly said let’s go next week! 

she simply replied “nope i don’t want to go”.

ouchhhhhhhh……… i don’t usually get close to peolle and the few friends i have i cherish. but i’m not sure what has happened here.

i don’t wish to confront her either knowing she won’t reciprocate - and this has triggered my abandonment issues so bad. abrupt as it may seem (since nth happened) deep inside i knew that maybe she was tired of me and this was accumulated. maybe i’m just too much for her.

reminded me of the times when she used to just “disappear” when i get emotional (such as going through a breakup etc) but i always told myself that it’s fine, perhaps she just hates such emotional situations and she’s always there when i needed real help.

but to just turn her back completely on me right now.. :’(

Some insight?,"i made this account recently. might not be able to reply to comments. me and my ex broke up about 6 weeks ago. together for 6 years. married for 4. and we have a child together. she's broken up with me numerous times over the years. and there was almost always another man involved during the course of our break ups that pretty much never lasted more then 3 or 4 weeks. this times a little different and i'm a little worried. 

she moved on immediately after the break up. which honestly i'm used to. but it's ramped up quite a bit. she's been with him just over a month, planning on moving in together, and she's actively trying to get pregnant. since i've met her she seems to have a small episode every 4 to 6 weeks. and every 6 to 12 months it's a much larger, world turning upsidedown event. 

her and i (moreso me) really started digging into what bpd is during our last breakup about 4 months ago. she was going to start working on herself but didn't follow through. shes throughly convinced what she's doing is in no way bpd related, she won't regret it and knows what she's doing. but she's always said that. i've been trying to be as supportive in what she's up to as much as i can but i'm afraid she's spiralling out of control and i'm just letting it happen. 

i mean she does seem happy. and i know there's nothing i can actually do. i don't even know what i'm looking to get out of this post because i'm pretty powerless in making her see things from the outside looking in. but at the same time it seems like enough time has come and gone and if it was another episode she would have snapped out of it by now. she's been pretty consistent the last 6 weeks minus a couple unexpected behaviors. i just want her to be ok and not ruin her life.",1642586863,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-19 10:07:43,0,0,
Roommates happier when I’m not with them,"hello,

i was wondering if anyone has experience dealing with roommates who are happier when you’re not around? i know it’s typical for us to believe people are happier without us, but ever since i started shutting myself off from them (around a week ago) i hear so much laughter in the communal areas, people are more active in the group chat, and one person who almost never leaves their room is almost always in the communal area. i could go on for concrete examples of how this isn’t just my bpd saying they like it when i’m not there, but i think you get the point.

i just feel so alone in my room, but in a way i’ve never felt before; it’s a different type of loneliness when i can hear them laughing when they wouldn’t if i were there. i try to get out of the house but the acknowledgment that i’m running from the problem doesn’t come long after.

i’ve went through ways of talking to them to reach a common ground, but every situation i imagine just leads to someone being upset.

anyway, all advice is appreciated! hope everyone is doing well :)",1642583411,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-19 09:10:11,1,0,

Living with my BPD wife is getting harder by the day.

my own mental health has gone to shit to a point where i cry almost everyday. i want a divorce but at the same time i want to help her through this. but one thing i know for sure is that i cant live like this anymore.

I think I might have BPD,"ive been doing research on bpd lately and taking tests (i know the tests aren’t accurate but they’re giving me a good idea of what i might have) and i think i might have it. of course i won’t know for sure until i am professionally tested, but i already have depression and anxiety so i’m pretty bad as is. i’m just wondering if i have bpd because for the past couple months i’ve been going through mood swings and things that aren’t normal even with my depression and anxiety. 

so i have this person i really like, and these past few months i’ve been back and forth between absolutely hating them, like everything they do makes me hate them and i don’t even want to talk to them, and then an hour or so or even days later i’ll love them again. this happens with everyone i talk to, but mostly my online friends since those are the only friends i have. but even though it happens with everyone, it happens the strongest with that one person. i feel so bad but i can’t help it. 

another thing i do is cry, and i always cried all the time before but now it seems i do it more often. my mood is constantly either super great or i feel so down.  it feels different from what my depression usually makes me feel. my depression does that but now i feel manic and i’ve been doing things such as stabbing my blankets and laughing while crying i just feel so off. 

but yes although this all weirds me because i’ve never really been this different before, the one thing i really need to know is why i feel such a strong change in my mood towards people, especially that one person. thanks for anybody who read and is willing to help! :)",1642578038,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-19 07:40:38,1,0,

Don't know who I am after a breakup,"about two years ago i started to try and be a person i liked. i dressed the way i wanted, i started creating things, and i tried to find hobbies that brought me joy. it wouldn't be right to say i'd totally sorted myself, but i was at least on the right path. then around a year ago i got into a relationship, and it seemed like everything was great. honestly i was kinda hooked on this person from not long after we met, every little thing about them fascinated me. despite this, at first my life felt at least somewhat balanced. 

then slowly i felt everything start to revolve around this person. i lost friends, i stopped pursuing hobbies, and i forgot about my interests. sometimes it kinda felt like almost everything was just in pursuit of spending time with them. the issue was they were happy to spend all the time in the world with me, but it kinda felt like they started to thrive from it, while i just kinda stagnated.

anyway i had a bit of a crisis a few months ago and broke up with them. i've never felt so hollow in my life. the only way i can describe it is feeling like an empty puppet. i still have all these external and superficial qualities i had before, but there's nothing driving me inside if that makes sense. every time i try and pick up an old interest there's no real spark.

i need to rebuild myself but i don't know how. i'm at uni and the workload is quite intense, and it feels like there's no time left over to work on myself. but then when i've got nothing to do i just kinda wallow. what doesn't help is that this person is still this perfect figure in my mind and all i can think about is how much i want them back.

"I am trying to communicate and I don't want to send mixed messages, however I am trying to convey a dialectical.","i am trying to reply to a girl who ghosted me for a little over a week and then reached out explaining what happened after i asked.

she says sorry for being mia, she was figuring things out with someone she's been seeing on and off for a bit. he wants to be exclusive with her all of a sudden. she offered to be friends and would understand if i didn't want that.

it's been a day and a half, going on two days that i have been pondering this and experimenting with word choice. it's rather difficult to convey what i want to convey because i was really hurt by how she treated me and i need time to get over it, but i would want to be her friend at some point. i also don't know when i'd reach out to her or when she'd reach out to me or what this would even look like going forward.

i don't want to be her plan b in case her guy who came out of the cobwebs doesn't work out. maybe she was the flaky one and not him, who knows. but that's irrelevant to this problem solving.

we learned about problem solving in dbt class today. i gave this scenario as an example and we came up with options. the best one was ""examine all the things you feel and want to say and then use wise mind to figure it out."" i'm not very good with wise mind and this is a really hard conversation to have.

**here's what i think is confusing and needs work (the last paragraph):**

&gt;that said, i do need a little time to process things. but in the meantime, feel free to send me memes and reach out when you’d like to connect again.

how can i convey this dialectical to her without making her feel guilty or confused? where can i improve what i am trying to say? i may just remove it entirely. i am pretty sure my goal is to communicate my feelings effectively... i forget the rest of what we came up with in class and the therapist sent me the google doc but my gmail account wasn't granted access to it at this moment so i'll find out tomorrow what it says exactly.

This cycle is terrible,"i'm having a really rough time. once, a while ago, i had a great relationship that fell apart pretty suddenly. they handled it poorly, i handled it poorly, and in the end because i didn't know how to handle it properly, they were able to convince everyone of our mutual friends (every friend i has at the time) that the lies they spread about me were true. i lost everyone. now i'm in this terrible cycle. i'll get a friend, allow myself to care about them, then if something changes or starts to differ from how it was, like all friendships do, my mind will make me think they have secret resentment for me or are starting to dislike me. they'll then get annoyed by me asking about it, which will cause me to worry even more and cause my worries to become more frequent until eventually the whole friendship falls apart. it's a self fulfilling prophecy of a cycle where each time reinforces the next. it feels awful every time, but worse is the effect it has on the people i cared about. it's horrible seeing how frustrated, angry and upset the whole cycle makes them. and i can't even tell them how sorry i am because i can't stop these things from getting worse instead of better after every talk we have about it. 

i've been through 4 of these cycles and am now at the close of the fifth. this person is the best friend i've ever had. we only knew each other for a year, but we became very close quite quickly. she did more for me and put up with more from me than anyone could ever be expected to. we supported eachother through hard times and laughed through great times. she's an amazing person who deserves a friend so much better than me and i love her so much. maybe it was the speed at which we became friends, but i've been worried for a while that we'd fall apart just as quickly. and sure enough, my mind jumped at the opportunity to make me panic and soon, the talks we had to reassure me got more and more frequent to the point where it was an every day occurrence. soon, she started to feel like i was blaming her for things she didn't do and eventually she was just tired of the whole thing. and somehow, the worst part for me is that she still cares about me even through all of this and i can't stop making it worse. the only thing that would stop it is to do nothing, but every day of that causes me nothing but stress and anxiety. i just want things to go back to how they were before i stopped believing the friendship was stable and before she had to worry about being careful about literally everything she said around me. we just recently had a huge argument that lead to us not seeing each other for a week. part of me is hoping that this will give me a chance to refocus and maybe make things better next time we talk, but part of me is worried that either she'll realize how much easier things are without the constant need to worry about me, or that i'll feel like we're more distant than ever when this is over and not be able to handle the change. i want to be better, i want to make things better between us, but mostly, i want to stop causing the most genuinely kind and wonderful person i know, the person who i fully believe most deserves happiness, to be without it so often.

it took about the usual three months for me to realise that maybe i’m not in love with him, but the idea of him. i had the usual period of feeling empty and numb, i loved the affection and intimacy but did i really love him? i kept going with the relationship because he was actually nice to me and i craved positive affection. 

well yesterday, i realised that i am actually very very in love with him, like i love him, not just the idea of him, and he loved me. at this realisation i almost started crying, because i was scared, and overwhelmed. because if i truly love him, then i’m very vulnerable to having my heart broken, i’m open to having the first time i’m actually in love taken from me. i’m so scared of this vulnerability that i don’t know if i should break up with him.

Going to therapy this Wednesday and I’m Terrified,"i haven’t been to therapy in a while. last time i saw one i got the feeling she was just downright lazy, because she would never do or recommend anything. my two other therapists before that one were ok, but i didn’t feel like i got much out of it.
recently my dad’s insurance switched because he got a new job, which means we had to switch psychiatrists because i’m still on his insurance. the new psychiatrist listened to me explain my past and at the end she very urgently suggested i see a therapist asap, and got me booked with one in her same office.
i’m very nervous. first of all because i rely on my medication to help me with adhd, and i’m afraid they’re gonna talk to each other to find a reason to get me off my meds or try something different when what i’m on has been working just fine. things like this have happened to me before.
i’m also just really terrified of opening up. even answering some basic questions about my past with the psychiatrist yesterday made me want to cry. i have finally achieved some level of stability by working through my problems on my own, with reassurance and support from my partner. i don’t want some random lady digging into my past and making my life harder by having me remember shit when i’m not ready. i hate that about therapists. they act as if it’s some kind of special relationship. bitch i’m fucking paying you. and you will forget me the second i stop paying you. also, from my experience they just sit there and expect me to do all the talking? like homie i can fucking write in a diary if i wanted to monologue. how about you actually give me answers when i ask you questions instead of making vague statements that are supposed to mimic support? 
as you can see i have a bit of residual anger left from my previous experiences. i do respect the therapy profession, even tho it may not seem like it in this post. my sister has had some amazing therapists and she herself is working towards becoming one. so i’m not hateful towards all therapists. i’m just scared. i don’t want to do it. i don’t want to remember things. i don’t want to feel pain anymore. nowadays when i feel pain, i can manage it, because it’s measured at my own pace. but if i have to talk about it all with a therapist, it can make my life harder when i leave the therapist’s office. because i have to work. i have shit to do. i don’t wanna have to leave work bc i’m having a breakdown bc my therapist and i decided to talk about my relationship with my parents that morning",1642548102,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-18 23:21:42,1,1,1

"I know I'm handling this appropriately, but hooooly moly is self-doubt a thing.","my kid attended a 4 day leisure program a few weeks back over the break. she struggled when she was there, but i was being told conflicting things. for example, one person said she had covered her ears and screamed a couple times during the morning while another said she had been hysterical all day. i was told she had a great day one day and the next day i was told that she had been crying every single day she had been there. i was obviously upset to learn this at the end of the week and said that i needed a clear picture, please.

i talked to someone in management when the staff were unable to provide me with a written copy of what had been happening and the write up i was permitted to see only and not copy was full of ambiguity and conflicting information any way. the manager was helpful and we came up with a plan -- they would get me a quick little write up of the week's happenings so that i could bring it forward to a doc or counselor to get my kiddo the supports she may need since we are only just getting her in to social settings like this as the pandemic eases up. she has special needs, so now is when we can see what sensory and attention issues are happening, and i want to make sure we can provide her with what she needs to be comfortable and succeed in what she wants to pursue in life. this is the second time she has struggled during a drop-off recreational program- different companies- so i know that we should be looking at what is going on or at least be tracking it. 

i have left four voicemails over three weeks since, and i was finally answered to be told that they needed another 6 days to provide me the information due to staff absence. i've heard nothing since, so i left another voicemail with the manager reminding them that my daughter's doc appointment was coming up- something i mentioned when we spoke... and nothing. so i've left a voice mail with the owner. and i am stressed. 

i know that i have been handling this well. i've been making sure that i'm keeping my correspondences polite and to the point. i keep saying that i understand times are chaotic right now with the pandemic. i've explained that i just want a timeline of when this information will be available to me so that i can book the appropriate appointment with my daughter's pediatrician. i've had one come and go already. i paid the doc just to let her know that information will be coming because my daughter had a very rough time in a social setting. 

it's just so frustrating because i am doubting myself constantly, and my paranoia is flaring huge. i'm scared they're going to throw us out of the other programs she and i attend through them. i'm scared that because we pay a subsidized amount that they are going to treat me rudely. i'm scared of... i don't know. everything? so i just want to walk away from this because the unfairness of this is making me want to explode in rage and i just... don't want to bpd all over the place, you know? but i need to figure out how to remind myself that i'm not wanting to keep myself ""in check"" - i have every right to be pissed off - it's just that i am wanting to stay effective in handling this. and i know i have been, but all that self-doubt makes me spin - why bother the owner anyway? so then i beat on myself for not being mature enough to handle this or causing a big deal when there isn't one... except that i am handling this very, very well... i think... i don't know... and i think this is a big deal. i wish i trusted myself more. frick.",1642547730,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-18 23:15:30,1,0,

People with BPD are not narcissists!!,"ugh, it just makes me so sick when people say that.  or when people say npd and bpd are cousins. ugh! 

i understand that certain actions we do might look similar, but it's completely different reasons why we do things we do than them.  we dont do things because we have some inflated opinion of ourselves, its the exact opposite of that! we do things because we're insecure and live in fear of our people leaving us everyday! we don't want admiration, we want reassurance to make us feel secure, so we know you won't leave! we don't feel self-important,  we have a lack of emotional permanence so we don't understand bond, so we actually dont feel important to anyone and that's why we seek that reassurance out, because want to know we mean something to you!

for example, i like people who are very clingy and obsessive to me, not because of full of myself and like the attention. its because they makes me feel wanted, it makes me feel secure like they really care about me. if they are this clingy, then they definitely would never leave me! everything ties into that intense fear of abandonment, not arrogance, not narcissism. 

that search for reassurance can be extremely toxic, but that doesn't mean we are narcissists! we are complete opposite of them in mindset. alot of us think we actually don't deserve love and that ties into the fear of abandonment, because why would someone put up with us? that's a question in my mind all the time. 

we constant think people are tired of us, or stop loving us because of us. this doesn't sound like a inflated narcissistic person.",1642545079,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-18 22:31:19,1,0,

Gosh darnit!,"i feel like crap lol 
for story context : my parents live next door. they own both apartment complexes, we rent one of them and we haven’t had the best relationship with our upstairs neighbours. it’s a couple of lebanese grandparents that live with their son (25ish? youngest) but since they have lots of grandchildren, family comes and leaves their kids often. results: lots of noise 
they also never shovel. which sucks for canadian winters. the people that lived here before us were the owners, of course you’d expect them to shovel. but here, we’re both renting .. anyway i’ll stop there or i won’t get to my story lol
i was petty after the latest snowstorm , so i shoveled all the stairs and the path to our door. i didn’t shovel their entry.. which isn’t a huge thing either, it was more for the statement that i wanted to leave it 
anyways, i came back to find a mountain of snow on the stairs, im not sure how it happened , but their entry is clear so i was sure it was them
i was certain it was them .. so i threw a huge fit, blasted metalcore (which i’m not very sure they listen often to) and was just yelling.. i called my so, which was at least their to hear me vent .. it calmed me a bit 
i found out later that my dad was the one trying to pile up snow for the machine that will pass tomorrow on the side of the streets 
i hate it .. why am i like this

BPD and quitting nicotine,"hi guys,

i’m not sure if anyone has dealt with this or has any advice, but i need some support.

so basically i’ve been vaping for about 6 years. i’m about to turn 20 in less than a month and i’m not trying to go into my 20s with this stupid addiction.
my boyfriend and i decided that we would both quit together while we go long distance for a few months. so the day of his flight was our quit day.
so i quit for about 5 days and then caved today and bought a new vape.
i feel guilty about it, but i was seriously struggling the last 5 days.

the cravings weren’t even that bad, but i couldn’t deal with not having i guess what has been a comfort item and coping mechanism. i started slipping back into old negative habits, like not eating, not taking care of myself, not really doing anything.
it threw me back into who i am in deep depressions. 
i was splitting so hard and having crazy mood swings and yesterday i couldn’t even get myself out of bed to take a piss. it took me until i was literally in tears of pain from holding my bladder to get me out of bed.
so basically, what im hoping for is maybe some tips on how to quit without it turning into that. i’ve worked so hard through all of this covid stuff to become a good person who is in control of her emotions and reactions and be a generally happy person.
in the past 2 years i went from everyday being a 2/10 to everyday being almost a 10/10. there has been so much progress with my bpd and i really really don’t want to lose that over quitting vaping. 
so please, if you’ve gone through this or have any tips on getting rid of a negative coping mechanism, let me know!

"He Was My Comfort Person, and Now I'm Scared of Him","we haven't been talking for long (almost three months now) but we managed to hit it off right away. we share a similar, distinctive sense of humour and we were a natural fit in each other's lives. for a long time, i felt like i'd known him for forever. he has his own mental health issues, so i was comfortable opening up about my bpd diagnosis early on. i made sure toot  disclose to him — in particular — the pattern of attachment i usually experienced; i let him know that it would be intensely annoying, but i would always be seeking some sort of validation and that i became easily obsessed with people i felt comfortable around. that a lot of people in my life had become irritated by these things in particular. he told me his exes were ""worse"" and that he could handle it, that he *wanted* to handle it. but recently, he broke and became angry with me. i don't blame him because i know it isn't necessarily something that is easy to continuously deal with. but he did things like call my breakdowns ""tantrums"", and i told him off. like, an entire essay of spewing. he's apologized a couple times since, but i've been so scared of him recently. i know he's trying rekindle what we had before — he even asked me if i was willing to talk to him over the phone yesterday. but i declined (faking an excuse, of course) because i can't even imagine hearing his voice again without bursting into tears. he used to be a place of comfort for me (and i already know it was my fault for putting that intense of a label on him so early on), and now i can't help but start sobbing whenever i get a notification that he's texted. i can't get over the idea that he hates me and that he's merely trying to patch things up because he thinks it's shitty to attack someone for something they have a hard time controlling. i miss him so much, but i can't even think about going back to the way things were. i'd be too scared to even face him once again.",1642530840,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-18 18:34:00,1,0,

Angry but choose not to do anything,"yesterday i had a very triggering moment with my ex. we met another couple at a party awhile back and made plans to meet but never got the chance. they texted us in a group chat asking to make some plans. 

he (hasn’t spoken a word to me in weeks) but wrote a draft of a text to send them and wanted to ‘clear it’ by me.
in it he wrote something like ‘we’ve split but we’re on good terms and hope to meet individually…’ 

i impulsively snapped and wrote back “you can take out the ‘on good terms” and then he didn’t respond.

i felt so angry. he hasn’t spoken to me or made an effort at all to know how i’m doing- but to strangers he wants to play pretend that all is good and well. i almost wrote a tirade of text messages echoing this exact sentiment but at the same time something clicked in my brain that said ‘you can be angry and choose not to do anything’.

so i washed my face with cold water in the bathroom and finally just felt that space in between thought and impulse. i can feel anger and still choose not to do anything.

it’s been a full 24 hours and no tirade of text messages yet. pre-dbt me would have cracked at midnight and spent all night writing some intense accusatory letter but post-dbt me is chilling.

Taking break from FP,"last night, my fp did something that made me split pretty badly. we had been playing video games for like several hours when he told me that he was going to go play something with his other friends. this has happened before and usually it doesn't affect me this bad, but last night was not very good. luckily i didn't freak out at him, but for the rest of the night i was pretty miserable. i don't think it was helped by the fact that throughout our time together, he was talking a lot about his other friends. one of the worst things about me is that i'm a very jealous person, and some days when he talks about his other friends, it makes me terribly jealous. it makes me think that he'd rather be hanging out with them than me. 

anyways, the whole reason i'm writing this is because i need some advice. whenever i get these sort of feelings, i feel the urge to distance myself from him. i know it's a bad coping mechanism for people with bpd, but i also feel it could do me some good to take a few days or a week or however long away, and then return when i'm not feeling as bad. is this a bad way of coping? i did it several months back where i took around a month away and when i returned everything was fine. i'm just scared that if i do it a second time he'll hate me. i think when he left to play with his friends, i may have come across as upset but i'm not sure if he picked up on it and i don't want that to be the last impression. any input would be great.",1642528434,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-18 17:53:54,1,0,

Struggling With My FP,"disclaimer: i haven’t been diagnosed with bpd yet but do exhibit many of the symptoms. i go to therapy to unofficially treat it with dbt and many of the bpd coping mechanisms have helped me tremendously. 

the one thing i still struggle with is the concept of an fp, i have always struggled with these intense attachments to certain people due to my isolated childhood, abandonment, etc… after years of mistakes, i now understand that my intense attachment to these people are not normal thus certain actions i think about should not be taken however it doesn’t dampen my attachment either. 
my current fp is an online friend i met about two years ago. he’s such a kind and wonderful person who i have a lot in common with. a few months ago, i expressed my romantic interest in him and was politely rejected but i can’t seem to get over him. i don’t even think i want him romantically anymore but it’s clear that my emotions are attached his actions. when we talk, i’m happy and feel content but when we aren’t, i desperately crave his attention and start to feel more depressed the longer we don’t speak to each other which i know isn’t normal. 
it’s very confusing because i want him to crave my attention as much as i crave his but proceed to feel disgusted with myself because i know i only feel this way due to mental illness. i want to be his best friend but also know that i probably won’t be more than just “one of his many online pals”. it’s either we are each other’s world or he doesn’t even see as more than passing entertainment he’ll eventually get bored of. i’m so tired of these relationships feeling so one-sided due to this illness, tired of obsessing over him even when i try not to. 
i’m not sure how to cope with all this other than telling myself it’s “all in my head” essentially. should i tell him he’s my fp? would that scare him away? can anyone please spare some coping mechanisms?

"UPDATE ON POST ""NEED PERSPECTIVE""","i don't know how to explain this but, a month ago i made a post about my toxic relationship and some things that happened between us. after i posted that and took time for myself and i made my decision, we broke up that time and it was hard for me but i did what i could for myself. around dec 7 i found out i was pregnant, after informing my family i decided to let him know since he is the father and he has the right to know. i asked him if he wants to be out of the picture completely or if he wants to co-parent, he said he wanted to be part of the whole thing. at first i was hesitant because of our history, i didn't wanna expose my child to any of that stuff that happened between us. but then i gave him another chance thinking that it will be different this time. things were still the same, he didn't change, he's still the same person, i don't know how to cope with this with my pregnancy hormones. i get so frustrated easily, i get panic attacks almost twice a day when we have these fights, and i'm afraid i'd do anything that'll harm my baby.",1642521632,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-18 16:00:32,1,0,
seems like my bpd ruins everything :(,"my last two relationships ended very similarly, with them both feeling like they couldn’t talk to me about my bpd symptoms affecting our relationship and bottling up all of that pain inside, only to blow up and break up with me suddenly without me even knowing what’s going on. it’s hard for me to know which of my emotions are worth holding on to or are valid, and right off the bat i tell people who i start dating about this and to tell me when i’m getting to be too much because a lot of the time i genuinely can’t tell. but what if i just end up scaring the people i love too much to the point where they aren’t comfortable sharing how they truly feel with me? i feel like my break ups would have been avoided if my ex partners were able to tell me how they felt. i would have understood and done everything i could to change things and to learn and grow. i just. i’m so tired of pushing people away. 

i even told my last ex partner before we started dating about what happened with my ex before, and how he ended up bottling up emotions concerning my bpd symptoms and how my emotions weighed on him and then broke up with me suddenly without working through things with me, only giving symptoms of my bpd as reasons (even when he promised me he would never break up with me due to my mental illnesses). i told my last ex how i wanted to avoid that and he promised me he would tell me if things got to be too much… and then he didn’t anyway :(

i’m feeling pretty hopeless right now. i really wish i didn’t have bpd. i miss both my ex’s and i really don’t think i’ll ever get over them. idk if i can take more of this pain. i feel like i’m gunna end up alone because of my bpd. if i didn’t have bpd i would probably still be with either of my last two ex’s. i’m so broken because of this stuff and i just. don’t want bpd to affect my relationships like it has been anymore. i just want to end up with someone forever and be able to communicate freely with each other and that seems to be impossible for the people i date :(

yesterday my last ex told me i made him into a monster and i made him into a worse person because my emotions were so unstable. i just. i don’t know how to deal with that. i have nothing but love in my heart for him and i care about him so much… i don’t know. i’m doing a lot better than before and i’ve gone through dbt and i’ve been working through my issues and trying my best… but i still managed to fuck this up and push away yet another person who i love the most. 

i know i deserve better over all and i deserve people who will be open about their feelings to me instead of bottling them up until it’s too late, i just hate that this has happened twice with me now and i can’t do anything about it. and i get so attached to the people i date and i just want to stay in my room and cry all day because they don’t love me anymore. i still can’t believe they don’t love me anymore :(

I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired.,"this probably won’t make a lot of sense, but i just need to rant.

so i was diagnosed with bpd 2.5 years ago and was in and out of the psych ward for most of that time.

i’ve not been home for almost 12 months and i can feel myself falling back into depression. my last depressive episode was the beginning of december and i’m just f*cking over myself.  i’m so tired of being tired all the time. i’m tired of the cycle of depression. i’m tired of losing interest and motivation for things. 

i started a new job on dec 31st and i’m already ready to quit. there’s a few things within the company that i don’t agree with, but i enjoy the job itself. but i’ve still lost complete motivation. 

i haven’t made the effort to see my best friend in weeks. so i feel absolutely terrible about that. do i reach out to her? no. i let myself wallow in fucking misery.

i’m getting back on the verge of wanting to end it all again. im 26 years old and feel like my life is going nowhere. i just want to replace my head. i hate myself and the way my brain is wired. i hate that i’m not “normal” and i’m just exhausted from having to continually work on adjusting my behaviour and feelings. 

im just so tired of everything. i don’t want to do this anymore. people keep saying “oh, it’ll get better and easier” but when??? ffs. i don’t want to do this anymore. i don’t want to keep fighting. im exhausted and tired. i don’t want to fight anymore. but then i’ll be a failure who gave up. even though i already feel like a failure.

nine moves in nineteen years. three schools in one year in two different countries. and the only thing that accomplished for me was a never ending sense of instability and never developing lasting friendships. what was the point of making friends if i was going to be saying goodbye to them in a short time anyway?

even in the place we lived the longest, i never found a sense of belonging or community. in college i got something of that. but one car crash destroyed that for me and i left that place forever to never look back.

I don't even know... like... I just don't,"please don't hate me for this

ok so i have never been to therapy (talked to therapists, but no consistent therapy) and am undiagnosed but there are several serious things going with my mental health, for at least 6 years now. i could spill the words depression, social anxiety and more, but like i said i am undiagnosed and i do not under any circumstances support self diagnosing.

and the thing is: i am struggling so so much, for so so long now. over the years i gathered a lot of knowledge about psychology, i've read books and research papers, had friends with depression, anxiety, ed, bpd and more, i am part of internet communities where mental illness is discussed and please don't hate me for what i am gonna say... i am very sure that i have bpd. i do not consider myself as a person with bpd, i do not support self-diagnosing and i do not claim to have bpd. i am just desperate to the core. there are so many reasons why i dodged therapy for at least 6 long years now and i am well aware that therapy is the way to go for me, there is no other way, i know. it's just so difficult, every single day is a struggle, i am overwhelmed, i don't know who i am, i am scared, i am confused, i feel like i am not sick enough to deserve treatment, i am longing for safety, i hate myself, i can't admit the fact that sometimes i don't hate myself, i am so so so tired. and i don't even know what i am typing here, why i am typing it and what comments i expect. i just don't know.

content warning/possible tr**ma dump:
&gt;! major issues with my body and confidence, self harm, unaliving attempts, mood swings on a daily basis, so much confusion, can't talk to strangers, am scared of social interaction and scared to be judged, am a perfectionist to the bone, unhealthy eating (like i straight up starved myself for for weeks in december/november 2021, am still eating unhealthy, but there's minimal calorie intake), so much impulsive behaviour, a lot of feelings i don't unterstand, the slightest things trigger the weirdest strong emotions like??? what???, literally no motivation to live, sleeping so much (14+ hours per day) but also staying up until unholy times, relationship issues like the second i am alone i am convinced i am hated and so much more, i manipulate myself into hurting the few loved ones i have left, i feel like i am super sensitive to everything and everyone and i hate it, i have severe trust issues, i fear being abandoned - that's why i don't even enter new relationships and destroy the ones i have, checkmate! in the past i was bullied for years, my egg-donor absued me emotionally and blames me for basically everything and also tells everyone i am the monster here bc i finally abandoned this woman for good and now she's hurting, she manipulated me, gaslighted me, lied to me on a daily basis, cheated on my father but denies it to this day, she never believed me and always favored my older brother (who bullied me every day but she obviously didn't saw it like that), she straight up blackmailed me, spreads lies and personal information, once threatened to have my apartment door broken up by the police if i don't open to her, she told me i'm fat etc. etc. the list goes on and also why am i even typing this what am i doing, literally...!&lt;

in love with my older married monogamous friend.,"i’ve had bpd symptoms my whole life &amp; was immediately diagnosed once i began pursuing mental health care less than a week after my 18th birthday. i’m 22 now &amp; have been rediagnosed(?) about a million times. thankfully my symptoms have improved a lot through therapy, a better support network, psychedelics &amp; general healing.. but i find myself becoming obsessed with people quite easily, mirroring their personalities subconsciously without even wanting to, fearing abandonment constantly, etc. a few years back i met a wonderful couple, both of these people are incredible &amp; i hope to be able to call them some of my best friends for the rest of my life. but soon after spending more time with them, i realized i was insanely attracted to the husband. over time i fell in love with him &amp; it’s gotten to the point where in the past year or so i really can’t get him off my mind. i just want to learn everything about him &amp; spend as much time with him as possible.. he’s definitely become my fp (my spouse (we are polyamorous) is also my fp but i’m madly in love with both of them).

about ten months ago my spouse &amp; i moved about four hours away &amp; i haven’t been able to really spend much time with this couple, maybe once every couple of months. we all used to hang out like one or two times a week sometimes, so it’s a big difference. it seems like they’re pulling away but i have no idea if i’m just imagining that. my spouse &amp; i are not well off whatsoever but we try to save back as much as we can to go visit them &amp; some of my family in the same town every month or two, or just whenever we are able. when we’re in town, they seem a bit more distant &amp; our interactions sometimes seem forced. to be fair, these people are pretty busy as they each have tons of friends &amp; family, work lives, etc. i’ve tried really hard to keep my attraction to the husband a secret from the couple because obviously i don’t want to ruin our friendship &amp; they are monogamous &amp; have been married for 15 years, so i can’t imagine i’ve done anything that would make it blatantly obvious that i’m into him. we have all always had good conversations &amp; visits &amp; i have searched every corner of my brain trying to figure out why they may have pulled away. my spouse who doesn’t have bpd has even brought it up, so it makes me wonder if we’re both just insecure or if we are indeed reading the situation properly. either way, it feels like my heart shatters every time i think about it, &amp; when we moved i cried nonstop (even though i almost never cry). this family has reiterated many times that my spouse &amp; i are like family to them &amp; we all became so close, but i’m so terrified they’re going to leave. abandonment is one of my greatest fears &amp; i don’t want to do anything to push them away.

the whole situation is weird &amp; complicated &amp; idk what to do. has anybody else been in a situation like this, &amp; if so, got any advice? i’m desperate for answers, i can’t hold this grief in forever.",1642888337,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-22 21:52:17,1,1,

Is it normal to feel nothing for your FP?,"every therapist i've seen lately has been nothing but an exercise in incompetence, so i figure i'll ask the peanut gallery. 

my girlfriend is my favorite person, and i've managed to lower to pedestal she stands on to mere centimetres.  both she and my esa cat are the two things keeping me from sweet sweet release. 

but i don't feel any real positive emotion for either of them. i feel all the fun negative emotions, (mild) jealousy when i get no attention, miss them both terribly when they're not around. and when the bad feelings stop, it's like a drug being without the pain. 

when i actually try to let my walls down, it's like some jerk is shoving a chainsaw into my chest and it's set on 'frappe'.  i figured, eventually there'll be an end to the tears and i can start feeling positive feelings for them.  

well i'm still waiting. i do all the nice things one should do to make your girl happy, but i can't actually share in any of it. as long as she's happy, everything will be all right. seeing her cry utterly destroys me and i go into full on momma bear mode. the thought of not being home in time to give my kitty her daily gooshy food will (and just did) send me into tearful conniption fits.

we broke up because of how my unstable and manipulative tendencies were affecting us both. at the end of our relationship he started getting into drugs and told me it was his way of coping with the stress i was causing him. 


he was also manipulative in the relationship and i recognise that he has chosen to cope in this way, i in no way condoned his coping methods. but surely it’s no coincidence that each time i break up with sober guys they end up going to drugs, i feel so guilty.

Shame at spiraling,"i recently went through a big friendship break-up and i am having a hard time dealing with the heart break. i feel so stuck in the past and i wish i could return to the way things were. but what hurts even more is the guilt and shame i feel about the way i behaved. it's difficult to go into the details of what happened without writing a novel bit everything was so complicated. what happened first was that my best friend led me on romantically; she told me that she had feelings for me for many years and that she wanted to be in a relationship with me. we were romantically involved for about a month, but it wasn't a relationship. she told me she wanted to wait until she got her ocd under control. then her ex showed back up in her life and two days after we had sex (it was my first time) she went back to her ex, without telling me she was no longer interested in me and wanted to go back to him. i was extremely hurt but i was compassionate, she has bpd also and i understand how we split on people often. anyway our friendship became very tense as she distanced herself from me to be with him. a lot more events happened later on but basically she did and said some things that targeted some paranoias and anxieties i have due to ptsd. i became very angry and reactive and began to spiral out of control. the way i reacted was really embarrassing and shameful. i tried to apologize many times, but i can't do anything else now as she doesn't want me in her life anymore and her boyfriend told her she is no longer allowed to speak to me. it's so hard for me to forgive myself for my many outbursts and the way i treated her, when i am not being allowed to make amends. i just feel very embarrassed. part of me believes that if i had been less reactive, we would still be friends. but at the same time, i know that our friendship was damaged as soon as she led me on and abandoned our friendship for her ex. it's all been difficult for me to process. i wish i had better emotional skills to handle this. i'm trying to practice radical acceptance and accept that i behaved badly and i no longer have her in my life, but all of it so painful.",1642879106,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-22 19:18:26,1,0,

later that night i woke up at 6am and saw that his bestie uploaded an instagram story. she was sitting on top of him, they weren't cuddling or anything but still, it's kinda weird and felt bad about it but tried to no think about it and sleep for a little bit more. i had a nightmare about him liking them more than me (won't go into details it's long af), and now, the next day i told him about my nightmare and my jealousy and he said he will be more careful and not upload that kinda things. completely fine i guess but in which world you decide just after hearing your partner having a breakdown and talking about their jealousy, that you're gonna upload a weird story about just what bothers me? i always try to make him comfortable and be better for him but, does he even care? i told him many times that his friend makes me jealous, but ehy would yo keep posting weird shit online, even knowing it will probably bother me? 
i don't want him to stop hanging out with them, i don't want to be a toxic person, what else can i do? i think anyone without bpd would feel like shit if this happened to them, it's not my fault really. i found it really disrespectful, it's like they are the couple and i'm his friend, i don't know what to tell him anymore without sounding controlling or toxic or manipulative or shitty.",1642860061,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-22 14:01:01,1,0,

I’m finding myself in another BPD relationship after the first person destroyed me,"so, back in 2020 i broke up with someone who was later diagnosed with bpd. they had cheated on me multiple times with their friends and had really brutalized me because of their self hatred and self destructive habits. they used me as a pawn in their self harm game. i told myself that this would never happen again. fast forward to now and i’m now in love and in a 7 month relationship with another woman who i’ve realized has bpd. and it’s starting to get bad.

my new gf was able to control herself for a few months before getting bad. she breaks up with me at least once a week and will remove her pictures of us on her social media. and she will block me from her stories and post who knows what. i just think it’s really toxic and i thought she was being malicious and manipulative. it’s so embarrassing to me because i pick her up from work and her coworkers are probably seeing all of this happen. she has security at her job and i’m sure they’re happy to see her remove pictures of her boyfriend and post hot selfies of herself when she’s splitting ….

it turns out that she actually seems to have bpd. she will split on me and say crazy things like she wants nothing to do with me . this weekend she is currently splitting on me because she’s being ‘selfish’ and wants me all to herself but i had promised my mom i would drive her to an airbnb. my mom has always wanted for us to get her an airbnb by the beach and she’s i’ll now so this is important to me so i put my foot down and told her that this is important. she blocked me. and then she unblocked me and i made plans with some friends because she’s literally stressing me out and ignoring me. i’m trying to convince myself that it isn’t intentional but it’s so hard. 

on one hand i truly love her and respect her condition. it’s totally not her fault that she’s having these intrusive thoughts. she thinks i will abandon her. but i don’t know maybe i just need therapy. i’m so scared that she’s thinking of other men when she splits. i’ve stalked her instagram and see she likes pictures of other men . i feel like i can accept her mental illness but also my insecurities are creeping up. when she tells me she doesn’t want me anymore, i can’t help think why she’s liking her followers selfies. she says she wants to swell nudes when she’s low on money. it’s stressing me out, she swears that she just gets triggered and loses control. i think i do believe her and i love her so much. i guess i’m just looking for perspective, thanks guys.",1642824083,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-22 04:01:23,0,0,
"if someone were to ask me what it’s like to live with BPD, this is what i would tell them.","i’m not living with bpd—i’m trying to survive it. most days i’m scared i won’t. bpd is not just being happy then sad. it’s not just feeling anxious sometimes. it’s not just hating goodbyes. 

bpd is paranoia. wondering what everyone is thinking about me, how they feel toward me. if they can see right through the disguise i have on when i’m around them. it’s sometimes even thinking that there are cameras in my apartment, and i’m being watched, judged. 

bpd is being genuinely terrified of abandonment. all it takes is for someone to show me an ounce affection or validation, and i become literally nauseous at the thought of them leaving. yet i put expiration dates on almost every relationship i form, and sometimes even push those i love and care for away simply because i want to beat them to the punch.

bpd is feeling homesick. it’s sitting in my very own apartment, in my very own bed, and thinking to myself, “i want to go home”. it’s me longing for a place that doesn’t seem to exist. 

bpd is not knowing who i am. i don’t know my own interests, beliefs, morals, or values, because i am a chameleon. i change who i am depending on who i am with because i want to be liked. i want to be loved. i will people please until i’m exhausted from overextending myself. but if means they will stay, then so be it. 

bpd is feeling hopeless. hopeless because there is such a stigma that even some therapists and/or psychiatrists would refuse to treat me. hopeless because there are insurance companies that would refuse to pay for that treatment because they label bpd as “untreatable”.  bpd is me feeling hopeless because i don’t blame them.

i have two concerns about that. i want to talk about them with my therapist but our next appointment is in almost a week and i keep thinking about it, and i don't think my friends would understand or give good advice. 


first, because i've been invalidated by others and myself &amp; have been ignoring everything wrong with me for almost all my life, i don't believe i'm in ""bad enough"" condition to take meds, i feel like i should be able to cope another way even though the logical part of me knows that i can't function. 


the second one is that i'm insulin resistant and i've been trying to lose weight for 6 months. i've lost a lot of weight, and i'm so scared that i'll take it back because of the meds and i'll get back to where i was (or in worse condition), and everything i did would be for nothing. i'm having periods of binge eating and periods of starving myself, but they've stopped a lot since i went on a diet to control my insulin resistance and lose weight, and i'm afraid they'll become like they were before. i've also seen some other side effects that scare me but not as much as gaining weight

"It's so hard to do anything with the gaping, unending emptiness all around you.","the emptiness comes and goes in waves, but has been persistent for the last few months. a lovingly crafted combination of the throwing away of a friendship that gave me hope and fulfillment, the dental pain that never seems to go away no matter how much debt i go into at the dentist, and finally, a bodily injury that's led to me being out of work for the past week and probably 3 more.

without work, as much as i hated it, i wake up way later than i used to. i used to wake up at 5 am. the days felt longer, i felt like i got more out of the time i have with earth. but since being out of work, and being alone, it's incredibly hard to wake up before 9:30/10a.m. coupled with the dental pain that keeps me up, sporadically, at night, and the injury incurred with work, my sleep quality has nose dived. putting me into a daily dissociative fog.

i'm finding it hard to do anything. cook. clean. breathe. i'm a 30 year old dude, 3 years into working retail in this pandemic. the burnout is so real i'm starting to smell cooked skin. everything feels so pointless, because i don't have hope anymore.

i used to have hope. a small hope. but the world is so different now. for work? i've tried applying for better, non-retail jobs (i have a degree, but psych) for years, to no avail. even with a stint interning in hr, nothing panned out. i used connections with friends to find some opportunities, and always failed the interview.

for a relationship? this is the one that hurts the most. i can barely write about it because i can feel the water rising in my chest, about to choke me. the world just isn't the same anymore. it doesn't work like it did when i used to successfully date. i tried online dating, and it's not the medium for me. if refusing to adapt and use online dating means being alone for the rest of my time, i'll make peace with that.

i just...with this truth that i'm going to be alone every single day. for the rest of my life. as i have been for the last 6 years. this truth makes it all so pointless. who i become. what i do with myself. if the only one that ever sees anything i do is me, then what is the point?

i can't pick up my guitar anymore. i can't read. watching tv shows feels like i'm wasting away alone. about all i can do now is hike, just walk and keep walking. listen to the birds. watch things skirt around my feet. it's about the closest i can feel to alive now, but once i get done with the hike, there i am again. just me. and each time i do it, the prospect of hiking again becomes even harder.

at this rate, i don't even have the motivation or energy to even *think* about ending my own life. i just know that when that moment comes, i'll be okay. because i lived, i experienced the things that mattered to me most even if they were brief, i'd rather accept it and quietly end my story, then to try to cling to life hoping that one day, maybe one day, i'll experience human connection again.",1642801801,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-21 21:50:01,1,0,
What to do with unexpressed affection?,"hey all, i don't know if this is a common problem amongst people with bpd but here goes anyway. basically i have a really serious crush at the moment. we went on a date, i thought it went well but he didn't want another. we are on good terms though - good thing too as we have to see each other every day - and one thing that's worth mentioning is that he is extremely affectionate with everyone, myself included. while it's nice that he is affectionate with me, on an emotional level it is probably kind of confusing as it can make it feel like he's reciprocating when he's not. like, when we say goodbye he full on kisses me on the cheek and lets me do the same to him. he's doing it because he's like that; i'm doing it because it's him and i'm practically in love with the guy.

i haven't seen him in two weeks - different to the usual 5 hours every weekday - because he's had a bereavement and has been away because of that. so as a result of not seeing him and also feeling sad for him and worried about him, i really really really want to give him the most enormous hug ever. 
 
knowing him, he will appreciate a massive hug but i'm worried that i might go overboard somehow. i don't even know what that would entail, but i'm worried about it happening.

i'm also worried that, having not spoken to him in person for so long, i'm going to accidentally pile on the compliments too much or declare my love for him or something like that.

i guess what i'm asking yous for advice on is, firstly, how to have some self control and not get carried away and mess things up, and also, how to deal with the uneasiness when i'm alone of wanting to be affectionate with him, spend time with him, talk to him, or text him etc when i have to try and go at the speed he's going at, so not really going very far at all...",1642799158,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-21 21:05:58,1,0,

So tired of dealing with my battles,"long story short - my 6 years bf broke up with me on october 2020 because he couldn't handle my intense emotions and splitting (black/white. love/hate). back then, i wasn't diagnosed with bpd so none of us have a clear understanding of it.  i was diagnosed with bpd in the summer and did dbt therapy and it really helped me understanding bpd and the tools they taught us.

i was doing perfectly fine for 4 months until my ex reached out to me and wanted to meet up for coffee. we ended up sleeping together and i was under impressed that he wanted to get back with me because we slept together. he told me straight up after that it was a mistake and he does not want to get back with me because i caused him some trauma in the last six years. to be fair, i said some really nasty stuff to him in the past. he was scared that if we get back together, i might be that person again. so he said sorry and how we shouldn't have met up.

that made me go into depression/suicidal spiral and i ended up binge eating and drank crazy amount of alcohol, deleted all of my social media accounts and turned off my phone for 2 days straight. my parents were worried about me and passed by my apartment to check up on me and my mom stayed over night because she thinks i'll attempt again. i'm just so tired of being like this. i wish i'm like others who dont have bpd. it sucks :(",1642785213,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-21 17:13:33,1,0,

Just got 'dumped' by my reddit friend (who also has bpd),"last year before i finally went to therapy, i asked my local reddit community about this particular therapy place that i was interested in going. 

my reddit friend entered my chats and long story short we both not only have bpd but we also go to the same therapy place (our sesh are usually scheduled on the same day too) and we both have the same fav spot. 

i was very grateful for her. words of affirmation is not my love language. i do not trust people and their words. so anything anyone says, its full of shit to me. i dont know how but.... she managed to get to me with her words. i genuinely believed her. trusted her. 

last year (just last month), i had plans to off myself and i genuinely was about to go through with them. she knew how serious my plans were so she proposed we met up at least once. and we did. im grateful that we did. she was a nice and funny person and we vibed well irl. 

a couple days after our meetup i was supposed to do it. but things started to happen which got me distracted and made me postpone my plans. im in january now and im struggling so much to stay afloat. its not even the end of the month and i have had experience incredible highs and also very shitty lows. 

i have bought an extremely expensive camera. i got scammed for almost $400. i have recently sourced out for dr*gs and im extremely dependant on my dr*gs/meds. i have started to develop a substance ab*se issue and went down this wormhole of all things related to dr*gs which made me distant and cold. this made me 'accidentally' ignored/forgotten to reply to her msgs. 

today i received this text from her: 

""hey man, i just wanted to message you before i do this: i need to delete my account again and just disappear. i did this a couple of months back as well, and i genuinely thought you wouldn’t notice or care. you were the trigger for the deletion. i’m sorry i didn’t tell you this then, i couldn’t tell you, it felt like i was “too emotional” or “too sensitive”. i do apologise that it triggered your abandonment stuff back then and i apologise if it does that again. 

let me explain why i have to delete and just leave. i think the reality is that i am too sensitive. i am a bpd patient, i am extremely sensitive to rejection. i do get affected when i feel like others simply don’t care and unfortunately, that’s how i felt with you. it would trigger me when you wouldn’t reply to my messages. i tried to be okay with it, i would tell you it’s fine to not reply because i didn’t want to pressure you into replying. 

i get it. sometimes, i can’t reply to messages with my friends either and i always feel pressured and guilty. i didn’t want you to feel that way. however, while i struggle with replying to messages, i do get very triggered when people don’t reply to my messages. it’s similar to the thing with your ex when she’d be late, you’d be upset; but when you were late, she’d patiently wait. this is one reason why i tend to stay away from people like myself, because we can end up triggering each other. it also felt like i didn’t matter in any way to you. 

i felt like you saw my value not in the friendship but in … just having an objective opinion, if that makes sense. that’s not to say you weren’t helpful to me, because believe me, you really, really were. when i needed help, you were always there. but, it’s difficult to explain what i mean when i say that i still felt unwanted. i think i valued you in some way. and it didn’t feel mutual. 

you have your greek friend and you value her. i can see that you truly care about her. 

so this is all just stuff that ended up triggering for me and made me leave the first time as well. even now, i wouldn’t be able to tell you this if not for the fact that i’m deleting my acc. i’m not confrontational or open about my emotions, those things are difficult for me. but i don’t want to just disappear without giving you a reason. 

i hope you don’t feel abandoned. my mind is telling me that you won’t care. but just in case it does trigger stuff — i am sorry. but, my mind is also telling me, you do have people in your life. you have your greek friend, you have your scorpio friend, you have (insert my psychs name here). and maybe other people you value too. those are your friends. i am not sure what i ever was. maybe it’s just my own issues with feeling unwanted, i don’t know. 

anyway, please take care. i hope you’ll go for therapy, it’ll help, i promise it will help. and don’t give up. sometimes looking too far into the future is not a good idea, sometimes it’s just better to take one step at a time. i believe you’ll be okay and you’ll get the future you want. you’ll be a mother, a wife, you’ll have your own cats and kids. just don’t give up. bye bye, it was nice to know you. honestly."" 

it hurts a lot. i dont blame her for doing what she did. she has bpd too. but it hurts to know that her last thought of me would be how i dont care enough for her or value her as a person. i never thought i would make friends thru reddit but i have successfully made some friends here. out of every friend ive made, shes my fav friend. she was the reddit friend i trusted the most. i dont have any other way of contacting her. the only means of contact i have with her is via reddit. shes extremely paranoid and secretive, hence why she never told me her name, where she stayed, her socials or phone number. i respected that and never pushed her to give me more details. she reminds me a lot of one of my close friends irl. theyre both very paranoid and are full of anxiety.... honestly i dont know where im going with this. im just upset. frustrated. hurt.

Relationship + in need of help,"i'm constantly having mental breakdowns because of my overthinking. much of these breakdowns are also related to how lonely i feel. 

i don't really know why my mental state has become this terrible, and i think i'm genuinely quite scared of how rapidly my mood changes.

i'd also like to mention that i am currently in a  relationship with someone, and almost every other day, we're arguing. whenever we do so, i'm so affected by the hurtful things my partner says to me and i don't think i can really get past that. in a way, i believe that i'm depending on him in some way and because of how angry he gets at me, i get affected too. 

my partner says that i'm acting quite different and that sometimes i'm plain rude to him. i don't realize it and when my partner points it out, i'm  confused about it, because i wasn't intentionally trying to be rude. i just think i'm talking the way i normally do with him. and because of the way i'm behaving, my partner has stopped being nice to me and constantly says mean things about me and when we're on call, they ignore me when i call out their name and don't always answer back when i ask them something. they also tell me how boring i've become and tbh, i just don't know what to talk about and nothing i say or do interests them anymore. i'm constantly told that i'm in the wrong and how they wished i was funny like them.  its becoming a lot more pressurizing to keep a conversation going. i'm no longer fun.

BPD ruined what could’ve been the one relationship I always longed for,"my boyfriend of almost two years broke up with me today, and i can still remember the day i first met him. he was the chaser and i was just looking for a friend. he considered me the one girl he was always looking for.

we started off as friends, and with each passing day i grew closer to him, opening myself up, learning to love someone truly for the first time. we were in love, but i was constantly questioning everything.i’m retrospect, i always loved him so much, but i still said such hurtful things. we had multiple fights, and each time i felt like that wasn’t me who said all those mean things. i knew exactly what i was doing, i was hyper aware, but i could not seem to control my emotions, no longer how hard i tried. then came the wave of guilt for acting out, which would stay with me for days after each fight, slowly eating away at my self worth. 
all this while my boyfriend, now ex, was losing feelings for me. and i’m not stupid, i knew what the consequences of my actions would hold for me, but i could never, ever, control my reactions to situations. i gave it my 100 percent, that i’m sure, but it could not undo the damage.
in the last few months, (the last leg of our relationship) i had drastically improved, and he said so too. i had been going to therapy and working on my core beliefs. and bam, he announces that he had lost feelings for me a long time ago. i knew deep down he was slowly losing it for me, while my love for him was growing stronger. i cannot begin to express the pain i’m in, knowing all well that it is because of how i am. i hate myself thoroughly for this. i just lost the most amazing person i’ve ever met.",1642747187,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-21 06:39:47,1,1,

I feel like i'm losing it...,"as a bit of a backstory, i was always considered a more unusual/weird kid. from anger outbursts (quite frequent, might i add) to daydreaming to anxiety to depression later in life. i most probabaly had/have adhd too but i don't want to self diagnose so i'll keep it as a probability.

i am 20, almost 21 now and i still can't consider myself as an adult. i try and i try and i try to do everything right but it seems like i'm failing

everything that comes out of my mouth seems either way too rude, naïve or cringe and everyone seems to judge me for whatever i'm saying or do, especially here on reddit.

i don't know if i'm making everything worse than it already is and i definitely know that there are a lot of people who just love running their mouth about everythink. maybe i'm focusing on the negatives way too much, but it fucks up with my brain way too much, to the point i just want to stay in bed and listen to music. and at the same time keep up with school, my parent's expectations, because i obviously have responsabilities, and also trying to still talk to my friends.

i've been bullied quite badly in the past, to the point of getting hit and breaking down crying in the middle of class and being considered an outsider even in highschool (i was literally kicked out of the class groupchat) 

i try talking to my friends, but they always seem to think it's just another episode or another outbreak. for once i just wish someone could listen to me and take me seriously when i say i feel like shit.

i tried finding solace in music, especially kpop lately, more specifically, k-r&amp;b, a little k-rap and k-rock, trying to know myself more through zodiac, mbti and other personality tests, but i still feel empty. i tried filling this void with so much and nothing works.

retail therapy would probably make things 10000x times worse since i am a bigger woman and i would break down trying to find clothes that fit

i tried going to therapy but i was scheduled quite rarely and it didn't really do shit (although i tried) but she basically told me that i am exaggerating and that i should give people another chance (completely disregarding my obvious trust issues and my avoidant attachment style, if you're familiar with it). i opened up to her, my therapist knowing damn well i have bpd (which i had to realise myself, since my paper didn't clearly state borderline, it said emotionally unstable personality structure, which i later found out it was another way to say bpd)

speaking of trust issues, i barely had a one month relationship. i am always the one who flees the moment something seems wrong, especially if someone points it out. i could see myself getting way too attached, but to be fair, i barely had some minor crushes that i would forget the moment i don't see them. so nothing to really suffer over, even if i kinda get attached. i am scared of commitment, not gonna lie, and always feeling like i'm falling behind, since i'm kind of a late bloomer. 

i just...keep fucking up and i'm sick of it. i'm so sick of myself that i can't even look in the mirror without wanting to break it to pieces.

2. i want to reach out more and become more social. the pandemic has made us all forget how to be social and i've become comfortable isolating. my plan is to take in-person classes and join the creative writing club.
3. i would like to begin an exercise routine slowly and safely. not to lose weight, but to be overall healthy. my test results said i'm at risk for heart disease/heart attack and i'm 26, so i either nip it in the bud now or risk it. i realized we only get one body, temporarily. i want to treat myself better.

seeking help for not meeting expectations and procrastination,"i need help with my shame-procrastination problem.

whenever i have to admit that i haven’t met expectations in one way or another, i become filled with overwhelming panic, especially when i fail to meet expectations because i procrastinated. 

this is especially problematic when i have professional obligations, such as when i don’t get any work done during the day (usually due to my procrastination) and have to change a deadline. usually, i lie about how much i get done and when. this has lead to enormous problems, such as lying for days on end and then having to admit that i need an extension. this pattern has put my employment in jeopardy. 

clearly, my issue is of avoidance. i don’t take responsibility for my actions and choose to hide them and hope panic-working for 24 hours in a row will get the project done. sometimes it does. most of the time, it leads to me turning things in an hour late, which is a problem. 

i know i am messing up when i’m procrastinating. when i am procrastinating, i don’t sleep. this has extended to multiple day-long stretches where i am hallucinating, but i still refuse to sleep because “i have not gotten my work done.” but, i will still avoid my work, by being on my phone/internet, random chores, staring at walls, etc. while kicking myself. encouragement doesn’t work either - thinking anything like “you can do it” or “just do 1 hour” or “you still have time” are ineffective.

when i try to work when i am procrastinating, i drag my feet, and work very slowly. or, i experience this deep mental pain that feels like i’m bending my arm the wrong direction in my head. even when i eliminate my distractions or am under pressure (turn my computer off, phone in phone jail, everything’s clean, books away, it’s due tomorrow) i will still. just. sit there. terrified, maybe disassociated, ashamed. 

i am just persistently, not, getting things done. and feeling bad about it. and then still. not. working. several therapists, friends, and partners have said i am “not even trying.” i become *very* upset at that and i apologize for not trying. “your apologies mean nothing. you will just do this again.” they are right, and i feel horrible. you’d think i would get my shit done to solve the problem - but no. i hate myself for that the most.

i don't know if i'm making everything worse than it already is and i definitely know that there are a lot of people who just love running their mouth about everythink. maybe i'm focusing on the negatives way too much, but it fucks up with my brain way too much, to the point i just want to stay in bed and listen to music. and at the same time keep up with school, my parent's expectations, because i obviously have responsabilities, and also trying to still talk to my friends.

i've been bullied quite badly in the past, to the point of getting hit and breaking down crying in the middle of class and being considered an outsider even in highschool (i was literally kicked out of the class groupchat)

retail therapy would probably make things 10000x times worse since i am a bigger woman and i would break down trying to find clothes that fit

speaking of trust issues, i barely had a one month relationship. i am always the one who flees the moment something seems wrong, especially if someone points it out. i could see myself getting way too attached, but to be fair, i barely had some minor crushes that i would forget the moment i don't see them. so nothing to really suffer over, even if i kinda get attached. i am scared of commitment, not gonna lie, and always feeling like i'm falling behind, since i'm kind of a late bloomer.

Drama with my lifelong best friend... again,"i'm exhausted, angry, and sad.

my best friend and i met when we were both four.  we're both twenty-one now and have been best friends ever since.

unfortunately, the past few years or so have been a rollercoaster.

i made a new friend in 2018.  we were super close, and i eventually introduced him to my best friend.  they soon became friends.  unfortunately, in 2019, this new friend began consistently verbally abusing me, put me in risky situations, and sabotaged a hundreds of dollars weekend getaway that myself and my parents invested in.  i ended up ending this friendship.

my best friend remained friends with him and defended my former-new friend's actions to me, several times.  he said i exaggerated the story despite me having multiple witnesses that can claim otherwise.

in an effort to ""get back"" at me for a few drunken jokes i made in 2019 that i immediately apologized for the next morning, in 2020, when i wished my best friend a happy 20th birthday, he asked me how i was doing.  he knew for the past few weeks that i was just dumped by my girlfriend of half a year i was suicidal, barely eating, abusing cannabis and alcohol.  when i told him how poorly i was doing and how i didn't want to live anymore, he told me i deserved to feel that way and be alone the entire year as ""payback"" for the drunk jokes i made at a halloween party about a flirtationship he had, which again, i apologized profusely for and never did again.

i'm not sure why given that after he said these things to me it sent me into such a mental health crisis that i needed to contact an emergency therapist, but i ended up taking him back as a friend.

several months later, i reconnect with a former friend from long ago that my best friend also knows.  i introduce her to my best friend, and soon afrer i find out that my best friend was badmouthing and mocking me to this old/new friend of mine.  a month later, i find out both of them were smearing me with blatant lies and labeling my other friends with lies as well.  this old/new friend ended up hurting me deeply financially and insulted me horribly, so i ended that friendship with her.

once again, my best friend 1. remained friends with her and 2. defended her behavior to me.

in july 2021, my mom was driving to get coffee and saw 1. my best friend, 2. my former-new-friend from 2018/19 and 3. my former-old/new friend from the previous month all together hanging out at an intersection.  my mom was making a left turn and glanced at them, my best friend saw her, looked away, and my mom went to get coffee.  she told me when she got home what she saw.  i mentioned in-passing to my best friend about this, but told him that he can be friends with whoever he wants as long as they don't discuss anything about me while hanging out.

fast forward to today.  after a period of about 9 months of consistent, monthly fights instigated by my best friend, usually about something i said wrong (for example: he didn't like how i said ""what's up?"" when starting a phone call), my best friend accused my mom of ""harassing, stalking, and intimidating"" my best friend from the july 2021 day my mom glanced at the three of them hanging out.  enraged, i told my best friend that he has no right to accuse my mom of such a thing, and i told him how hurt i felt that he remained friends with two people who hurt me so badly in the past.  i asked him how would he like it if i was friends with his ex-flirtationship-person (his words) or some other person who wronged him.  he didn't answer.  i then told him that his ex is engaged, which is true (i admit i shouldn't have said this). i told him to stop making accusations and that i was tired of everything.

if you made it this far, i'm impressed.  it's 5am and i'm exhausted and stressed and sad.  i think i need a break from this ""best friend"" given that he's come up many times in therapy and i've realized that many times i don't have positive interactions with him anymore.

any advice would be helpful.

 like it seems so basic and natural, the way that other people talk to each other. everyone else is so funny and cool and interesting and i'm just this boring husk of a person. i try to be better but it feels like trying to talk in a different language i cant learn, and it hurts to know that no one will ever really like me or choose me because i'm so much... less than everyone else. i hate myself because no matter how hard i try, i just can't do this one thing that pretty much everyone else can do.

"Two of my best friends have BPD and there are things I accidentally do that are triggering for them, trying to be supportive but have boundaries. Advice?","hi. title basically explains it, two of my best friends have bpd and i accidentally trigger them. examples of what they’ve said: 

• if i leave them on read/don’t respond to a message in a timely manner. i began to turn my read receipts off and try not to open messages if i can’t immediately respond, but, i work full time and am in college full time, also have had an adhd diagnoses since i was 8. i am forgetful and a very busy person. i have told both friends it’s never malicious and that i love talking to them, just that i’m not always on my phone. the response is usually something like, “well then why can you check social media but not answer texts?” to be quiet honest, this response bothers me. 1. because there’s no boundary. 2. because social media takes a different type of mental energy than responding to a text. 3. social media is an escape for me and it feels rude to comment on that. 

•i don’t text enough or check in enough. i try to check in with friends once a week at least. i thought that was a reasonable amount. heck, if they call me, i’ll stay on the phone for an hour is i’m available! i just don’t have the mental energy to text literally anyone all day. my bf and i don’t even text really. both friends are very extroverted and i’m introverted

•they feel abandoned if we don’t talk for a few days. 

• this one hasn’t been said, but i know it to be true. when i start dating someone, my friend will distance from me and kinda seems like they think i’ve abandoned them by entering a relationship.

i don’t know what to do. i give my all to my friends, i’d never want to make people feel like this, but i’m not sure these are things i can change. should i just end the friendships if i can’t help this? if not, what else can i do to help? i try to give reassurance and show love and be supportive, but tbh i work in mental health myself and there’s only so much energy i have in a day to give to everyone. any advice would be great, thanks!",1641533183,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-07 05:26:23,1,0,

Worried about long-term Dissociation,"i’ll try to sum this up quickly. i should mention in addition to bpd i am also diagnosed with bipolar, generalized anxiety and a lot of substance use disorders (sud)

i haven’t been off drugs consistently for a long time. mostly the last couple years though severe use of powder cocaine/adderall/benzos/painkillers/psychedelics/inhalants/dxm/marijuana/ecstasy and alcohol. the alcohol quite often being a fifth to myself on a daily basis. i have been off everything including marijuana for 5 months now.

the problem at hand is while i used to get dissociative rarely over a short period of time, i am now dissociative everyday for hours at a time and i am scared and feeling also as if people who are concerned for/love me will think i am on drugs/alcohol again. i did have a recent med change a couple months ago shortly after getting clean/sober. 

i’m just worried that the cause of all this is that my mental health is rapidly declining and i will soon be in long term care or group home environments. but then i think it might be meds (i have and will continue to talk to my doctor about that) also sometimes i tell myself if i were to get drunk or something that the uncomfortable dissociative feeling would go away but i don’t. could be from long term drug use (kinda) long term for me means starting at 14 and getting bad at 15. i am now 27 so i guess if we were to say 15, it’s been 12 years of pretty constant use. i feel so very dissociated and in a state of derealization often, though i am able to get through the day and am not in a psychotic episode/hallucinating or delusional. i could have done significant damage of course

It's been 3+ years and I'm still not over my ex. He's been in a new relationship but still updates the playlist he made for me and shades me on instagram.,"i just need to get this out, somewhere. it's been over 3 years and i'm still not over my ex. i haven't been in a relationship since. i go through periods where i do or don't think of him much, and right now it's one of the times i'm thinking of him more. i just can't help but feel like he's breadcrumbing me in a way? 

he made me a few playlists and they've all been updated ranging from 2019-mid 2021. the one updated most recently in 2021 was the first playlist that he made for me. 

then the instagram stuff. this is gonna sound fucked up, cause it is, but because of my past/trauma, at one point i accused him of being gay/bi. obviously this is wrong and i shouldn't have assumed his sexuality, much less accuse him of being a different sexuality than he presents. anyway. when he first got with his new gf, he made an ig post of them together mentioning being gay with his new gf. in his bio too he mentions he's gay for his gf. 

i feel like the mentioning being gay for a girl is a dig at me. like, maybe i'm reading too much into it, but... it was a large point of contempt towards the end of our relationship. 

it's just like.. ugh.. i thought maybe he was over me and hated me this whole time but the fact he still updates my playlist and (maybe) throws shade at me on instagram makes me think otherwise. i wish i could message him but i honestly want him to be happy and i don't want to interfere with his relationship if it's going well. 

i just don't know how to feel. i should really just let it go and stop obsessing but godddd it's fucking hard lol. 

i don't even remember the last time i saw him, i don't think. i blacked out most of the last few months of our relationship. technically i was the one to end things because i thought he didn't like me. i was so fucked in the head though. i look at notes i wrote from 2018 (when we dated) and i had very little empathy. i couldn't put myself in another person's shoes for shit and i know i didn't take his feelings into consideration much, despite trying. i just can't help but wonder if things would have been different if i could've managed to be chill and normal and not lash out at him all the time, which i did frequently.",1641523227,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-07 02:40:27,1,0,

being in the same community as my ex/fp,"my fp recently broke up with me. ive been dealing with a lot of pain and anxiety over it, but that's exacerbated by the fact that we still exist in the same community. ive been trying to unattach myself from him as my fp (even though i dont really know how to do that) but im still very much attached to him and i know that because ive convinced myself that he hates me despite there being no evidence of that. that's basically how splitting manifests itself for me with my quiet bpd—i internalize all the rage and direct it at myself, and when he doesnt pay attention to me or communicate with me (which he hasnt been since we broke up) i just assume he probably hates me. as you can probably surmise its a really difficult situation being in the same community as him because literally everything he does i take as a sign of his dislike toward me. 

the problem is that the community we met through is a massive source of support and affirmation to both of us. the last thing i want to do is leave the community because some days it feels like it's just about the only thing keeping me afloat. but recently the pain it has been causing me has just been so overwhelming that ive been thinking about just leaving. 

i don't really know what to do here. do i stay and endure the pain of being in proximity to my ex/fp while that attachment to him is still intact and unfulfilled? or do i just leave that community and hope that i can find some relief from that pain even while i struggle with the loss of that support system? or is there some way i can communicate this all to him without overstepping the boundary this breakup has created or reaffirming my attachment to him? im feeling really lost and unsure about this so any advice would be appreciated",1641518977,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-07 01:29:37,1,0,

\-  i did a therapy session and watched a ton of therapy session videos on youtube. 

\- i have been trying not to go outside like at all right now because of covid and all that, i did do walks and runs a lot, like today i probably spent 2+ hours running in total. social interaction though, it has been hard because of covid. i had phone calls with people in my circle and i tried to engage with people online as much as i could.

\- if i found myself ""sinking into negative thoughts"", then i watched meditation-videos where they specifically also display psychedelic images to break myself out of that loop.

\- i made a card and i put it in front of me yesterday. it says on different lines: breathe, i am feeling...,, why do i feel...., it is acceptable to feel, describe how you feel.",1641518605,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-07 01:23:25,1,1,

so my boyfriend had been planning on going away to switzerland with his gbf and 5 others, i was last minute invited because my bf felt bad about leaving me at home after our own vacation was cancelled. 

it’s day 3 or 4 of our trip, we are all living together in this girl and her brother’s chalet. i’ve been picking up this weird energy between my bf and his female best friend the whole time, they have this weird husband &amp; wife dynamic.  she keeps constantly talking about how much my bf’s parents love her and stuff.  i went to the supermarket with them and i legit felt like i was their daughter. 

then tonight, me and her had a bit of aperol and she got up and danced and shook her ass in my boyfriends face for a good 10 seconds. 

i’ve been in my room ever since literally hyperventilating. my bf says he didn’t like that she did that and assures that nothing has happened between them (they’ve been friends for 10+ years)  but my brain is making up all these scenarios about what could’ve happened if he hadn’t last minute invited me on this trip. 

im freaking out big time and i just wish i could calm down. i have never really been threatened by her as she’s always been so lovely to me but being on this trip with them both as just made me go crazy, they literally act like a couple cooking and watching movies and teasing each other.

i feel like i’m sabotaging maybe? idk!!!",1641507405,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-06 22:16:45,1,0,

LDR Trouble,"i am at a loss for what to do anymore and i just sent the most painful text i’ve ever written; for context, i’m in a long distance relationship and i have been having breakdowns because of distance even though i know it’s selfish to since neither of us (me and my partner) can do anything about it, and i’m probably going to have to move back with my father because of how unbearable my current living situation is. 

he doesn’t have internet or anything so it will be incredibly hard to keep in touch all the time and this makes me anxious beyond belief. i cannot fathom spending hours or days without them and add in the distance, it’s like a recipe for disaster.

i have felt like they would be so much better off without me, especially when i cannot stop having breakdowns like this. they have been incredibly patient and reassuring and i’ve given them nothing but trouble. i cannot even acknowledge that they are real because we’ve never met and we aren’t necessarily within driving distance. i have gotten envious over people who have relationships irl and who are able to actually see and touch their significant other, causing more problems with my own because i get upset at them for it, and they haven’t done anything wrong.

no matter what we do together, it still feels so lonely and whenever we call, i end up crying and having to leave before i ruin the mood. i have felt like i need to be hospitalized again before i’m able to get any better. i’m able to show that i’m changing and then something happens and i manage to fuck it up again, only to hurt them in the process. this isn’t fair to them, yet they tell me it’s okay when i know it’s not, even if i can’t control it.

it feels like my world is ending at all times and nothing makes it easier. i want to be loved and cared for, but i make it so hard for everyone and i cannot stand to do it anymore. i try my best to support and care for them and somehow i mess it up…! i have been crying for almost two hours and i feel as if i’m going to spiral again. i wish i could just be normal and not have to live like this, it is a constant guessing game with myself and what i’m feeling, i don’t know why it’s so hard to differentiate what is best from self sabotage. i regret ever sending a goodbye text because now i’ve ruined it again. i feel so empty.",1641500922,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-06 20:28:42,1,0,

BEWARE OF GETTING TOO COMFORTABLE WITH SELF-DEPRECIATING - SUICIDAL JOKES,"this post is inspired mainly by ""bpd memes"" you can see on instagram or other subreddits. 
talking about our struggles and feeling that we are not alone in our pain is important. 

there is a line though, in which what initially started as a coping mechanism to laugh about something tough, evolves into cheering each other on as you hammer unhealthy concepts deeper into your mind. 

reinforcement is the process in which a behaviour, through the consequences it entails, becomes more frequent. that reinforcement doesn't need to be something that feels good. a lot of thing that we don't like that can act as a reinforcement for our behaviour. 

there are many things that can act as reinforcement and for what some of us x will be reinforcement, for others won't. 

but there is a universal reinforcement: attention. not positive attention, any attention. with anything that we post on the internet, the likelihood of producing the same type of content increases if we get attention in form of likes, praise or karma. you can see this trend from tiktokers that reproduce the same joke over and over again with different people because that one video got viral or folks that talk about politics on twitter who end up being monothematic. 


words have power. don't poison yourself with words. you are not worthless. it's worrisome the amount of memes that emphasize the false idea that there is no hope for your future and that you are damned beyond repair. 

*(i am not, by any means, trying to invalidate how someone expresses their pain. my point is that if you are someone who has been consuming that type of content for quite some time, i want to encourage to seek other healthier sources of support - being seen)*.",1641499322,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-06 20:02:02,1,0,

Can you change FP feelings into a healthy relationship?,"not sure exactly what to flair this but i really need some advice! 

in my day to day life i've managed to get myself to a point where my bpd barely affects me anymore, but fps are my biggest weakness. i've been single for some time now, but i've been just casually dating around for a few months and it's been fun! i hadn't had any strong attachments to any of the guys i'd been seeing and i'd been very good with just doing my own thing, not caring much about if i'll end up in a relationship or not and just living a pretty stable life overall.

however, one of the guys i met i've become absolutely smitten with, i didn't get any fp feelings with him for the first few months and i just genuinely really liked his company and wanted to see where things could go, but now we've gotten to a point where a relationship seems highly likely, all of that obsessiveness i thought was gone has suddenly hit me like a truck. 

we both like each other a lot and i don't want to feel this crushing obsession for him but i'm already noticing that i'm splitting him in my head if he takes longer than usual to respond and i can't focus on anything but him. i have uni assignments due all next week and i've just been sat here staring off into space thinking about him instead of working!!

i thought to myself, okay i'll take a break from trying to work and do something i enjoy instead, but even then i'll end up daydreaming about him and wishing i could be spending time with him instead of doing literally anything else. he's consuming my every thought and it's honestly so frustrating! i don't want to throw away my entire life and personality for another person again but i have no clue how to stop it :(

Idealization and using people for emotional regulation,"i have a mother with bpd. she was emotionally unavailable and since childhood programmed me to somehow always strive to regulate her, understand her, make her feel comforted and erase what i feel inside. 

i also have bpd. around me people didn't really validate me because of lots of problems-i was shy, we were poor, we didn't have a good house and so on so i was kind of striving for validation. 

now i'm 22, i've studied psychology, i'm generally kind and empathetic person, artistic and aesthetic, with calm manners. people often, often idealize me. most of the people who initiate contact with me are in awe of my artistic skills, my character, my loving nature and so on. most of those people have emotional issues of their own, unavailable parents, being bullied at school or being unpopular and so on. i would say majority of them would have bpd and anxiety. 

now, what they do is that they are completely in adoration of me. they want to be like me, they value how much i've grown emotionally and so on. and what happens is that they immediately start sharing their very intimate and private traumatic issues with me. i sympathize with them, but  when i notice it is a pattern i start to protest that they never ask about me, it's always about them and me being supportive. but they argue that everything is about me in the relationship, i'm the main, they are completely dependent on the influence that i have on them. but truly, there's nothing like it and i feel very alone and disappointed. 

i have a feeling in those scenarios that they refer to the idealized image they have of themselves, projected onto me cause it's also suitable and everything in the relationship is them getting validation from someone so great as me (in their perception). so i'm just a reflective tool. 

what delays me to get away from those relationships is that i'm waiting validation myself and get obsessive with them cause at first they payed a lot of attention to me. 

another thing and the main one is that those people are good. they are not aware of their manipulation. they are emotional, lonesome at their hearts, wounded, sometimes i sympathize so much because i know how they feel and i don't want to leave them alone. they are very talented, write or paint well and just need a way out of their darkness. and some of those people i've known are kind and polite, trying to help everybody. 

but being a ghost in a friendships or relationships, it is a core problem. 

if you have bpd, have you ever done such thing, or felt that you had relationships out of those motivations. share your insights with me. now i'm very heartbroken because one person treated me exactly like this again and i want to figure out what is happening.",1641496146,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-06 19:09:06,1,0,
What Distinguishes BPD Identity Confusion From Average Young Adult Self-Discovery?,"tl;dr when does identity disturbance cross the line from ""normal"" adolescent instability into borderline territory?

i'm in my early 20's and it seems that every few months i'm a different ""version"" of myself. i have had many fluctuations between gender identities, sexualities, and political alignments that have been quite sudden. i can get incredibly invested in a community of people or an ideology just to completely abandon it out of bitterness. i can go from incredibly principled and passionate about morality to a complete hedonist who doesn't care about anyone or anything, indulging in things i condemned not long ago.

this has also made it incredibly hard for me to settle on a college major. at first i wanted to do animation, then theater. now i want to pursue psychology, but i'm on an anti-psychiatry kick right now and i hate the idea of pathologizing other people. these shifts were all within the span of a year, by the way.

a particularly alarming event is when i made myself incredibly feminine to impress a guy i liked a few years ago, thinking about him constantly, altering myself in any way that i thought would impress him. i have also changed my entire appearance to imitate others that i was obsessed with.  it's hard for me to tie myself to any one lifestyle or aesthetic. 

i'd say my self-esteem is higher than it used to be, but when i think about myself or see pictures i just feel so...fake? cringe? like i'm a character rather than a person, a cluster of neurons in my brain attempting to be a cohesive personality. 

i've been told that this is normal and will probably even out as i reach my mid 20's, but i'm not so sure given the intensity of my phases. it seems like most of my peers, even given the instability of young adulthood, have at least some idea of what they're about and what they want to do with life.",1641493444,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-06 18:24:04,1,0,

Tips on how to handle bpd in a relationship?,"so, my bf and i are on a month break just to work on ourselves mentally. we both decided we want to spend our futures together. so we gave ourselves a month to get better (even more time if we need it) and then we’ll get back together.

Our sensitivity: the double edged sword,"this has been with me my whole life, but i never accepted it until now. just about all of us here are extremely sensitive people, whether we like it or not. that's just how it's always been. when we're with people, it's like we feel everyones emotions but our own. this can be extremely heavy. i just want to share my story in hopes that someone can find understanding/acceptance of this part of themselves, because it really is beautiful.

i never fit in, from day 1. i knew i was different, i didn't know how though. and when i say different, i don't mean better, but i just felt like i didn't belong. i began to interpret this negatively naturally because i didn't make a ton of friends and when i was little, bullies would pick on me because i was sensitive and definitely was a lover, not a fighter. i would cry when i felt others emotions, and whatever i felt in my own emotions, i felt them very intensely. i'm a man, so as a guy, your friends bag on you for crying calling you all types of names. this was mostly in middle school, so you can guess how that was with a bunch of middle school boys hanging out and one cries, and when he doesn't you can tell he's holding it back.

i'm 22 now and about to graduate college, soon (hopefully i get in) to grad school to be a psychologist. i've learned a ton about myself at college, more than i ever have, but no matter how much i understand myself i feel like there's this huge chunk missing. i worked on being mindful, on managing my thoughts and emotions, meditating, surrounding myself with loving people, etc. what's missing?

i, like many of other borderliners, have a very addictive personality. for reference i tried a small amount of an opiate one time and months later i still think about it. i've quit and relapsed on nicotine at least 8 times. i smoke weed daily. i've been taking adderall 6 days per week. i've never understood why i take so many drugs, and even as much as i'm ashamed to admit, why i love drugs so much. i've never gotten so addicted it destroyed my life, but it makes shit really hard sometimes. i'm on the tail end of quitting nicotine for the 9th time, and as my emotions are becoming prominent once again, i'm realizing one of the big reasons i do drugs is to avoid that sensitivity. all of these emotions will come up and absolutely flood me and overwhelm me, until my mind numbs itself. i may as well make that numbing feeling good, right?

however, this takes us away from who we are... i don't know about you, but the strongest connection i have to my body is my heart. sure i overthink literally all the time, but there's just such a powerful surge within me when i breathe deeply into my stomach and heart. it's so fucking strong, at least 25x stronger than anything i've naturally felt anywhere else on my body. 

for many of us, we feel tortured by our sensitivity. we don't feel we can get away unless we take something or lose ourselves in a conversation, show, video game, etc. but embrace this. please do not run from it any longer because this is a part of the void you feel. it's definitely not all of it, but it's a chunk of it. you are beautiful, inside and out. no matter what you've done or been through or how shameful you are; understand why you did what you did and feel your sensitivity to the situation. feel your chest tense up, feel the tension in your body, and release it. you've carried too much for too long, friend.

we must manage this double edge sword, taking time to feel your emotions and whatever else you're carrying. feel what you need to feel, think what you need to think. allow it to happen. do not make this mistake anymore moving forward though:

do not mistake your sensitivity for weakness.",1641489656,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-06 17:20:56,1,0,

I hate that people make a disorder into not a disorder,"i’ve seen so many posts especially on tiktok and instagram (directly and indirectly) about how bpd doesn’t make you act badly, that’s it’s not a disorder, and that it shouldn’t impair your life. but it’s called a disorder, it negatively impacts everyone who has it in some way or another. seeing these things as someone with bpd ironically makes me feel awful (even though the “goal” of the post is to “destigmatize” it), while not everyone who has it is manipulative, the posts make it seem as if it’s this horrible thing to do to other people and nobody with bpd does it ever and everyone who manipulates is an awful person. obviously manipulation isn’t good, but we need to learn why people manipulate instead of demonizing it. i hate these posts so much, because it indirectly makes people not want to open up about their symptoms or hate that part of themselves even more. we already have to deal with hatred towards ourselves for having this condition, and seeing people “destigmatize” it by demonizing the symptoms and behaviors associated with it only makes it worse. i wasn’t sure if this post counted as a diagnostic opinion, but if it does or it upsets someone let me know and i’ll take it down.",1641469289,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-06 11:41:29,1,0,

Relationship falling apart with friend w/BPD,"my friend has bpd.

i have npd. (narcissistic personality disorder).

i of course have my issues but i've worked so hard on being healthy because having happy relationships with the people around me despite my disorder is very important to me.

but she doesn't do like.. anything. she doesn't communicate, she doesn't ask for consent when venting. and she does things that trigger my npd heavily, and that outside of triggering my npd, are just cruel. like criticizing fun art projects i have or even the things i eat. 

she has major mood swings and it makes people my discord server uncomfortable, she ended up blowing up at a 14 year old who made some dumb decisions and as a result, got me roped into a situation that wasn't fun and was very exhausting.

i've communicated with her that she needs to do better and that she's making my server unsafe. she knows about my npd and that things can trigger me. but it's like she doesn't care, or she does but she doesn't think.

she also can split on people very easily. i'm very worried that if i leave her, she'll use my vulnerabilities, secrets, and.. photos.. against me. because she's been very malicious to people she's split on before.

i feel like i'm stuck. i'm also pretty sure i'm her fp. i'm not going to go into detail but theres things she does and says that heavily imply it. and i feel like without her helping herself, it's making our friendship worse.

Seeking Advice. Should I go for DBT as an inpatient or do non-specific therapy as an outpatient?,"i (23, f) have a decision to make and i am extremely overwhelmed right now. 

i am faced with the decision of going to a dbt ward for another 9 weeks as an inpatient. or outpatient therapy twice a week and try to return to everyday life with additional outpatient help. 

unfortunately, there is no outpatient option for dbt here.

i was previously an inpatient in a psychosomatic clinic for 3 months and was diagnosed with a severe depressive episode and borderline. afterwards, i spent 2 months as a partial inpatient, which unfortunately didn't really help. 

after the clinic, my problems were only really tangible. all of a sudden my emotions really threw me off track, i had to deal with enormous fear of loss and failure like never before. i am completely blocked for many things. i can't judge for myself how unstable i am right now and what i need. 

now when i could start this dbt place next week i can only see someone for an hour a day because of corona, no time off or weekends.

the feeling of being locked up and even more forced distance from my boyfriend and few friends is extremely upsetting and frightening. 

my job training (germany) would have to be extended by a year as a result. 

in the scenario with outpatient therapy... 
in the best case scenario, i would be able to finish my job training in time. but after that, i'd be right back at work. and i have no idea whether i would be able to do that. if i could manage anything at all.",1641456410,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-06 08:06:50,1,1,1

I feel so selfish (TW - loss of a loved one),"hey there. i just need to get this off my chest and i don’t know if i’m being irrational and selfish or not. 

a close friend of mine recently passed away. her funeral is on friday, there’s a limit of 60 guests, and i wasn’t put on the list. my sister, brother in law, and everyone else in our small friend group was, but i’m the only one who wasn’t. they just kinda forgot i exist and that i was close with her too.

my sister tried telling me that because i didn’t attend the meetups our friends and her family had after her passing, that they all maybe assumed i wouldn’t want to go to the funeral either. but that’s such a load, because another close friend of ours has been just as distant as me and he was put as a priority to attend.

How To Comfort Yourself,"title says all. i can feel myself creeping towards a dark place again. i’m deeply afraid of spiralling, but my episodes have been growing more and more intense lately, and i am developing an extreme paranoia of everyone and everything around me. i feel almost powerless to put a stop to it.

a flair for the dramatic no doubt but after everything i've read about bpd i don't know how much to believe and how much is exaggerated like my story above. through my search, i've discovered demons that i was unaware of that i was bringing to the table that certainly trigger her. all this to say i don't know how high or low to keep my guards and how astute should my vigilance be.

now keep in mind he actually works at my job just one day a week though he got off today and called me right away. we talked about his day and my day and then he said ""i don't know what you were talking about there being no packing materials there! i found so much stuff! so i don't know what you were talking about!"" then started listing it all off. 

the way he stated this made it come across like he thought i was blind or just willingly not getting things for him. i'm sure that's not how he meant it so i responded in my defense but he kept talking so i raised my voice to be heard. the phone call ended shortly afterward because i had upset him by raising my voice.

he called a while later to talk to me and ask a question. everything was fine. then he brought it up again and i let him know he said something that made me feel like i had to defend myself and he could've worded what he was going to say better. but then he rebutted with saying i should've had a better response. this is kind of the typical formula for our fights in all honesty.

he'll say something where i feel like i have to defend myself and i want to defend myself right then and there. sometimes i'm able to but he'll still try to interrupt and as a result, i'll raise my voice to be heard over him. he interrupts like crazy. but then it turns into i shouted at him and reacted inappropriately. then when we talk about it and i mention what he said that made me feel like i had to respond to that he tells me my response was inappropriate.

i don't know if i'm fucking insane but i feel like i'm not shouting at him i'm just trying to be heard. it sucks to also feel invalidated anytime something he says triggers something in me-my defensiveness i guess. and for him to tell me i should've responded better-it makes me feel like i just need to shut up and keep my thoughts to myself.",1643578689,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-30 21:38:09,1,0,
"Husband unintentionally stopped taking his meds, but now won’t start them up again","my husband has bpd, which, until recently, has been very well managed. he’s in therapy, found a good medication regime that really worked for him, has amazing communication and he really puts the work in to taking care of his mental health. 

we just moved out of town for my new job and the mail got all screwy and he couldn’t get his meds sent to him on time. he felt physically ill for a couple of days, then his mood started to change drastically. i’d say still “normal” like 80% of the time, but then out of nowhere he’d be mad at me over something that happened years ago or that is just not even a big deal or something that would typically bother him.

at first he was really eager to get his refills back so he’d feel better, but now that he’s back to his pre-treatment brain he’s now resistant to it, convinced that me and his doctors only want him to take it so he’ll be more “subdued” and “manageable” and “a doormat.” which is not at all what he was like medicated, but right now he’s so convinced that everyone is trying to manipulate him and don’t actually care about him. when he’s not in that negative moody mindset, he acknowledges that the way he’s reacting to things isn’t good, that he hates feeling this way, wants to get back on track, but then once that switch flips again he canceled the refills and gets mad that i’m “manipulating” him and trying to “control” him. 

i just don’t know what to do right now. this isn’t him right now and i miss *him* and want him back but i don’t know how to get him there. when he’s jekyll he agrees with me but then he goes hyde, so i never know how to bring it up because i never know which one is going to respond to me.

Splitting,"i don’t even know if i’m borderline, i just know i constantly change how i feel about people. the constant splitting is the only trait i have &amp; me being paranoid of everyone’s intentions. i do have a way of overreacting but so far those are the only traits. i do always want revenge. but i don’t self harm, i’m not suicidal, i don’t disassociate, i mostly zone out from my add.

right now i have this urge to throw things, hit something, yell at someone... etc. i'm picking her up from work in a couple hours and i have this urge to snap at her and ignore her. this sucks because we were supposed to meet up with a couple of mutual friends tonight but i think i'm going to bail on that since i'm splitting on them for no reason... maybe it's because i'm splitting on my gf and those friends are connected to her? no idea.

it’s been four years since i had my breakdown. i harmed multiple people with my behaviors. i apologized. the person i harmed first forgave me, but i could not forgive myself. eventually, i landed in a hospital.

i think about those people all the time. i have been in therapy weekly for the past year and a half. my therapist attempts to frame me in a more positive light, and i don’t believe her. i try to improve, but it’s been slow. 

i try to isolate as much as possible, so i don’t hurt people. i’ve ghosted almost everyone except for one person. i don’t know how to handle the shame and the guilt. 

i’ve heard from my therapist and others that self-compassion and self-forgiveness are key factors in recovery, but how can someone do those things when you remember how hurt those people were? i feel like i don’t deserve to be compassionate toward myself. 

i think another aspect is that progress is going so slow that i truly think that i won’t change enough for it to be impactful. i’ve heard from people that individuals with bpd don’t change, so if that’s the case, i’m not sure what to do.",1643519808,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-30 05:16:48,1,0,

Advice needed! I feel my worst when dating someone,"hi there. i'm really desperate for advice so i've posted this in the cptsd subreddit too because i'm not sure whether i have cptsd or quiet bpd. anyway, here goes:

i am a 21 year old man whose never had a girlfriend before (i'm a virgin, too). i've grown up with a narcistic for a father (who i no longer speak to) and a bipolar, suicidal mother. i met a girl at a party on new years eve and we've been texting a bit since. she asked me out and we went to a cafe and then on a walk. the date went really well and she wants to see me again but i feel awful and it has nothing to do with her. when ever i'm talking to someone romantically it's like suddenly every wound i have ever felt is triggered at once. i feel so overwhelmed by my emotions that even something like waiting for a text makes me feel extremely depressed and suicidal. i feel so embarrassed of feeling this way, too. she's a great girl and has so many of the qualities i'd want in someone and it feels like this could be what i've waited for for so long. but ever since i've started texting her, i've felt consistent emotional pain and depression. i'm usually very upbeat, positive and ambitious but lately i've been feeling extremely negative and nihilisitc; like i don't want to exist at all. i suddenly feel completely worthless and broken. it's not that i'm idolising her when she's just a human, it's that i'm not even seeing myself as a human anymore. keep in mind, this has nothing to do with how she is acting, it's just a product of my own psychology and past traumas.

so my current dilemma is this: do i let things advance with her in spite of all of the constant, unbearable, emotional pain because it might lead to deep healing through the power of a stable and consistent relationship. or do i stop things with her now because i am no where near healed enough yet (for example, it's only been in the last year where i finally feel like i have a consistent friend in my life. furthermore, i am only recently learning how to set boundaries and feeling like i have an identity)? i'm definitely leaning towards the latter but it feels like such a shame because once i am healed and return to dating, i would be looking for exactly what i have now. the only way i see myself sticking with it would be if i'm able to get some therapy asap, however, the pain is so unbearable, i feel like i would struggle to wait the week or 2 it would take to get into a therapy appointment. if i were to end things with the girl, i would need to sever it completely to feel better. so i would probably send a text explaining that she hasn't done anything wrong, this is just a product of my mental health, i'm sorry for wasting her time, and i wish her all the best. i'd appreciate any advice!",1643500867,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-30 00:01:07,1,0,

i’ve been in my current relationship for almost two years and my boyfriend is my fp. things have been rocky but we’ve been okay. he’s pretty introverted and so am i so my attachment on to him is pretty severe. lately i’ve been encouraging him to make friends and socialize with people because his mood has been really down. it’s really helped but i can’t help feeling …idk territorial? my fears get out of hand and i try to calm myself down but it’s hard. he told me today he wants to spend the night at their house next month and of course i supported and encouraged him- my stomach is just in knots and my head is reeling with “what if’s” like what if he cheats on me (he wouldn’t) or what if he decides he likes them better or realizes i’m just really messed up because of the bpd and wants nothing to do with me? you know ? is there anything that helps you guys through this so it doesn’t feel as crushing even though literally nothing has happened ?",1643498127,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-29 23:15:27,1,0,

I feel like a burden and a failure to my partner,"lately things have been really rough, and my bpd has been acting up more. it's getting to the point where one negative remark or little change in tone from my partner spirals me into a horrible state of mind. all of this is even causing me to split on him sometimes and it just hurts so much splitting on someone you love deeply. i am in therapy and i'm seeking dbt but at the moment i just feel hopeless, dramatic, negative and depressing. no one knows how bad things actually are in my head. it's really taking control of my life. i can tell things are regressing, i'm just getting worse. which is so depressing to admit because i was getting better for a little and i saw a glimmer of hope but now there's no hope in my mind. i'm sorry for the incoherent rambling i just needed to say something or else i felt like i was gonna go insane.",1643495970,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-29 22:39:30,1,0,
Distant bf is making me feel lonely,for the past few weeks my long-distance military bf (and fp) has been distant ever since he told me he had been feeling depressed. i keep texting him sweet/motivational things and seeing if he’s okay but he only responds once every couple of days and his messages lack energy. i’ve also noticed his snapchat score has gone up by 200 in the past 6 days so it feels like he’s ignoring me. at this point i’m convinced i’m being abandoned and that he doesn’t want to be around me anymore. i don’t know what to do.,1643495828,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-29 22:37:08,1,0,

having a hard time being in a friend group,"ill try my hardest to not make this post too long. i havent been able to create a solid relationship with anyone in about 10 years until quite recently a few months ago when an acquaintance reached out to seek help. i'm trying to keep things lowkey as to not scare them away but also not go crazy over this person because they're very nice and i know i will push them away and disappear if i give in to the urge of going all in (and it'd be very awkward as we attend the same classes at uni). long story short, this person wanted a friend group for some reason, not to be borderline but we all know what i'm thinking at that point, and we've befriended some people that, while being totally cool and stuff, don't really seem to be like absolutely obsessed with us (well, me). we can goof around and such, i've always been a sort of a quiet class clown because i crave attention, but i don't really feel a connection with them. there's this one person that always inserts themselves in everything and genuinely feel like i'm going insane every time they start talking, they just make me so mad sometimes. there's also my ex fp in there, a one 100% based on fantasy only but still, i do not know how to feel knowing i've imagined a future with that person barely knowing anything about them. anyway, i feel like i'm being replaced, i do not feel important or needed, and it hurts especially bad since i felt like i genuinely built a solid friendship with my friend because i helped them through a very bad period of their life. the fact that i'm in a friend group itself gives me mental breakdowns literally every single week because it is scary when you've been avoiding any sort of real relationships for so long. there's no way of running away since we go to uni together. i just want to quit, i feel so alone and unimportant, i don't even know if i'm making sense at this point.

now they're comforting someone else in the group chat, i haven't said a word in almost 24 hours, my friend's the only one that cares but also i just know it won't take her long to stop. should i leave? i don't know what to do. i'm going to hurt myself tonight.",1643486486,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-29 20:01:26,1,0,

Question for pwBPD,"have any of you ever broken up with your partner in order to 'save them' in your eyes, from bpd? ofc they would be surprised bc they truly loved you. 

do these feelings of bpd ever hit you suddenly one day out of the blue like when you have been close to them..almost like out of body?

when the partner  didn't give up, did it ever anger you and therefore you lashed  and pushed them away or blamed them  bc they wouldn't leave and you were stuck on not being able to be in the relationship w bpd (your opinion)?

This is a poem about my bpd.,"* this is about fights i have with my partner because of those times i overanalyze his expressions and believe that hes expressing hate or that im being deceived im some way. its about the power i feel when i wrongfully assume i have caught on to some big secret that im only being tormented, tje glory of thinking they wont get me this time, and the ending is about realizing i am the one being hateful, out of defense, and splitting back to the reality. realizing i might have been wrong.*

here it is

“your head cocked in that way, your pupils are crosshairs, two crosses ablaze.
dead in the center, i lay in your gaze, while frigid flicks lick over my face. 
i dare not beg, i dare not pray, i know your sharp-tined tongue pitches 
hate with perfect aim. surrender, 
my feet are sinking into the clay. 

and when you deliver the decisive snicker, 
it seems just as easy as pulling a trigger, 
without a trace—“the devil takes my place”

he reveals to me that trickery, those subtle shifts called slight of face.
in cryptic tones that cry my fate, the hinting squints that quash my faith, and all the sordid shit i sift through in this 
charlatan’s parade. 

i must have sold my soul today, 
perhaps i made a grave mistake,
for once i let him don my face,
there sat an angel in your place. “",1643464949,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-29 14:02:29,1,0,

all this time everyone i’ve ever seen regarding my mental health, my doctor, three psychologists, two psychiatrists, several peer support workers, six employment providers, and one counsellor, everyone has always said things along the lines of “this constant low mood is bc you don’t have anything to occupy your time, you need a purpose, a reason to get out of bed when you wake up and not just lie there scrolling mindlessly through your phone until midday, maybe shower and then sit on the couch mindlessly scrolling through your phone for a few more hours” (they wouldn’t say it like that but you get the jist).

so i went and studied, that went shit (whole other story smh), i got a job in the industry i studied ‘pending certificate’ but really they don’t care too much about the qualification. i’ve been working here since november and don’t get me wrong, i do love the job, i love the people i get to see and work with, the stories i hear, getting to know people and look after them.

but now i’m just coming home exhausted. i don’t have the energy to be enjoyable to be around for my partner, i don’t have time for things i enjoy, the few things i do manage to squeeze in feel more like chores than hobbies bc i’m pushing myself to do it even if i don’t feel like it bc it’s so ingrained in my mind to ‘do things you enjoy’ when you’re feeling low.

i admitted out loud to him that i’m not happy or satisfied with life, and i feel like an outsider. and just, bored and empty. i’ve had other therapists consider these all “bpd tendencies”. so why won’t anyone make it official? i know there’s a strong stigma you can’t do certain programs without it, like dbt…",1642261616,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-15 15:46:56,1,0,
26F Difficulty navigating new relationship,"this might be a little vent-y...but i really do genuinely want advice and input from others. 

i've been in recovery for nearly four years now, but i still find myself having a lot of difficulty navigating my romantic relationships. i don't know how to just be present and just *accept* people needing space from me for good reason.

my girlfriend (22f) and i have been dating for four months now. she has known about my bpd from the jump, has friends with borderline as well, and overall has been a very fair partner. we don't really fight or argue, we try to talk things out and for the most part it goes over okay. i can see at times that she minimizes her own concerns, but i call her out on it, just like she calls me out on my issues as well.

the context is, is that for the last week or so i've just been so incredibly emotional. in my mind i swing back and forth between feeling that she is disappointed in me and rethinking the relationship, and telling myself i am only thinking the worst because of how i feel in the moment.

last week she told me about how she feels when we talk, she feels i don't listen to her and am repeating rants and conversations to her, and that she feels i disregard what she tells me in those moments because of that. and she was absolutely right...when i get into my bpd rages, people could tell me the most profound advice and i would still most likely not recognize it because of how i feel in the moment. so we talked it out, and it was ok. i could recognize that it was awkward after that, and that we couldn't immediately return to how things were, so we sat in that feeling. at least i think it's healthy to have conflict that doesn't always end badly?

the next week we were on the phone, and the topic of her grad school came up. i knew somewhere in the back of my mind that she has been really stressed about it, and that she shuts down about it. but somehow in this phone call, i didn't connect the dots. we sometimes joke around with each other, hang up on each other when someone's thought process gets a little ridiculous. she seemed distracted and like a lot was going on so i hung up.

i was beginning to text her that i would call her back and text my advice, but she was really upset in a way i couldn't predict. she told me that her calling me was her way of reaching out to me for support and that when i hung up on her she didn't think i cared about her feelings at the time.

i wanted to grovel at her feet for ever making her feel that way because it wasn't ever my intention...but i knew she deserved her time and space to be upset. and that a genuine apology takes time to reflect and think on, so i did. and i sent it the next day. she accepted it and seemed like we were ok...but she refused to come visit me on my day off despite planning this for weeks.

and i didn't want to let it show...but that devastated me a lot. i knew we couldn't just pretend that i hadn't hurt her feelings...twice in one week so even more understandable-

but i thought we could at least talk it out in person, and i could actually be there for her, instead of just over the phone. 

i ended up crying about it the entire next day, and my thoughts were just a jumble. about how she didn't really love me, how i should never be in a relationship because i don't know how to accept that people want space from me, that she was more upset than she let on and that i was the reason why-

and it's to the point where emotionally i'm all over the place...i tried using radical acceptance and opposite action because those have helped me in the past. but i found when i was that emotional, nothing helped.

**the advice i want to ask for;** is how i can take my partner needing space from me less personally? what can i start to, to be more present and mindful in the relationship?

i feel like i've ruined things and i know everyone says that if a situation is awkward, it's because you're seeing it that way-but i genuinely am trying to just appear stable right now.

i don't want to be the partner always crying and demanding validation and support from them. i want to be strong, i want to be someone she can depend on, and i know as i am, i'm not that person. 

**what i also want to ask;** is how other people in long term relationships with someone who doesn't have bpd, have made their relationship work? 

i love my partner, and i want to make this work. if that will take some self improvement on my part, then i will gladly do it. i am humbly asking for advice and input in the thread. anything helps. thank you for listening to my longwinded rant &lt;3",1642260868,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-15 15:34:28,1,0,
Feeling so guilty and like I’m ruining my own life,"once again i’ve had a crazy episode and i was being rude to my boyfriend. telling him he doesn’t love me, doesn’t find me attractive calling him names etc. all i could think about was leaving him before he leaves me me and that i need to get out of that house asap. i couldn’t stop crying and blaming him for the way i feel even though deep down i know it’s not him. it’s like i’m arguing with myself in my head, one side of me knows it’s irrational and to calm down and the other half is just crazy and overpowers the other half. 

i’ve calmed down now and i just feel this awful feeling of guilt. i feel like an awful person who makes people feel bad. he is the most amazing person i have ever met and is so sweet and kind to me and the thought of me upsetting him makes me feel so guilty. it goes on for hours and hours i am screaming and crying at him for hours and he just tries to calm me down which i am so grateful for but i am so embarrassed and feel so guilty. he has reassures me every time that it’s okay, he understands and that he will never leave me but i feel so guilty and embarrassed every time. 

 please no one tell me he deserves better i already know he does. i love this man and want to be with him for the rest of my life. i just feel like i ruin things for myself and for others. if anyone has experienced this or has some advice please can you let me know. i partly feel like i just want to vent but also feel like i need some reassurance, i’m not sure why or what kind of reassurance but yeah? thanks guys",1642259451,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-15 15:10:51,1,0,
Im losing this battle,"i think ive entered the ""red zone""   ive lost the will to fight, i just dont care anymore. i started meds a few months ago and therapy starts this monday, things were looking up but i got into deep thought and decided i dont want to try anymore, its not worth it. there is absolutely nothing in this life that is going to make it worth living, not even a relationship as a matter of fact being in a relationship makes me downspiral and it doesnt end until the relationship does. i hate people and i hate what were capable of, i hate that a vast majority of us are so driven by sex and i hate even more how openly we talk about it. i hate that the need for it even exists, you all disgust me. i hate money and i hate greed and i hate that everyone is so thirsty to climb to the top just to ""have it all""  who cares!? frothing at the mouth over petty little material things and empty connections, i hate the human race and i cringe everyday waking up realizing im part of it. i hate that we have to eat, i hate that we have to use the bathroom, i. hate. being. alive.        if any of you have felt like this and made it through, how did you do it? cause for me personally i think this is it, ive thrown in the towel.",1642255799,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-15 14:09:59,1,0,
Had My First Successful Date In Years Last Night,"so i was diagnosed last summer, got started with dbt after a month or so of being in complete denial/believing i was faking it. it's been a tough road - i left my former career because i couldn't deal with the stress without dissociating the second i got home from work, and have made major lifestyle changes in terms of diet, exercise habits, not smoking a ridiculous amount of weed every day, etc. 

all that said, romantic relationships are by far my biggest trigger. i've never really been able to manage a relationship in the past - i fell into the pattern that i think many of us are familiar with where once i felt things getting serious, i would just blast the poor girl with the full fucking force of my trauma as a ""test"" to see if she could actually deal with the ""real"" me. i moved past this twice, once into an extremely dysfunctional relationship that i was able end (about a year after i realized i should, but still, proud of that in the moment and in hindsight) and once into a fairly fulfilling relationship that ended tragically (dumped with zero warning, she had some undiagnosed issues of her own neither of us were aware of at the time, but it was devastating to go through, legitimately took me six years to get over). 

i was not looking to actively date, but i did have a profile up on hinge and when i saw her match i couldn't help myself. we hit it off immediately, and i started to feel some of the irrational fp feelings i've dealt with in the past. i think one of the most important things that i've gotten out of dbt is realizing that my emotions are not all i am, that if i do not act on them then that's more important than trying to ""not feel"" them (fairly impossible, though i did spend years trying) or feeling shame for having them to begin with. i've been checking the facts and practicing opposite action like a motherfucker, really leaning on all the skills i've developed these past couple of months, and i'm a bit stunned that it seems to be working!

it has not been easy - we've been texting for about a week now and i constantly feel like i'm gripping onto the edge of my self-control with my fingertips. with texts i can at least wait to respond so i can modulate any extreme emotional response the message prompts, but in the past in-person has been where i lost it. i don't want to say last night was easy, but it was miles easier than i ever would have expected before dbt - i stayed in the moment, kept myself open without opening all the way, and while i had one slip-up where i snapped at her over a fairly innocuous comment that hit a trigger of mine (i caught this right after and apologized, didn't seem like a big deal though of course i've spent most of this morning replaying it in my head and fighting the shame thoughts), i was able to avoid acting on my worst instincts, like telling her i have bpd as soon as we started holding hands at the restaurant. 

i set boundaries and she's respected them. i've been honest about my tastes and preferences, even when i know they're in conflict with hers. those may sound small, but in the past i was desperate for a relationship that i would not do either of those things. she seems to genuinely like me, and not the facade i spent most of my life presenting to the world. it's still very early days, and we still have an awkward conversation ahead of us regarding my bpd (though i am trying to offer clues to some of the impacts - that i cry easily and frequently, that i'm very self-conscious, etc. kind of listing at least some of the symptoms/impacts without naming the source), but i can't help but be hopeful, if not for this particular relationship then at least for just how much progress i've made these last few months, and for the first time in years truly believing that i might be able to have a fulfilling and functional romantic relationship. 

it does feel like walking a tightrope, like i'm one false more from either losing control and discussing my entire history before it's appropriate, or splitting on her and running away. but, knowing i have a session with someone i trust later this week to help talk through it, knowing i'm resilient now in a way i wasn't before and that i can bounce back if things do go south, and knowing that someone saw me and accepted me...even if it feels like i'm going to fall, i haven't yet - one foot in front of the other, one step at time.",1642255735,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-15 14:08:55,1,0,
Short Job Rant because I am feeling a mix of anger and rejection and emptiness at 100 on my lunch break rn,"quiet bpd here who hates admitting they struggle; learning to set boundaries though. just got told i didn’t pass my new job probation although i have bent over backwards for it, surpassed targets and have put so much into the role. i know i do a good job - managers sing my praises but..

they said i didn’t pass due to three absences and if i’m honest two were from being absolutely having a terrible day, it’s hard working in retail and when mental health is still such a huge taboo. as a 21 year old with no family support (estranged parents) and a shit ton of trauma; it gets so lonely and overwhelming as it is. almost ended up homeless last year and so this job is necessary. i didn’t feel to report my diagnosis when starting as i know how judged and stigmatised having bpd is but now wishing i did because making up random ailments like “dizziness” when in reality i’ve woken up dissociated and empty at 100 has caused me to be scrutinised. holding down a job is hell when your identity shifts 24/7!!! i wish people would just understand?? not their fault i know deep down as i could have reported that i have no control over fluctuating emotions that i conceal really well but result in doing everything i can to not harm myself when i’m alone. now i’m sat on my lunch listening to angry music so close to just quitting but i know it’ll look a certain way.

BPD and Long Distance Relationships are hard,"hello, everyone. 

i (m20) have a girlfriend form turkey (f18). long distance relationships are a real thing, even as someone who said it would never work out, i was wrong. we have never met. i got really attached to her and the emotions i get from her influence my life a lot.

we have been in a relationship for quite a while now and i have told her once about bpd. she instantly said ""yeah! i think i have the same!"". well, great i thought. we could support each other. 

when we were fresh in our relationship, i didn't tell her about bpd. i did after a few months. nothing from bpd has bothered our relationship until a few months ago, i started to go insane. 

soooooo:

lately we have been going into a lot of fights, lots of bs fights. we had one big fight, which caused her to say ""i don't want to explain anything to you anymore, you never understand anything. i will not put effort into this relationship again."" this was +/- 2 months ago, since then i started to go insane. 

i feel like she does indeed, give barely any effort into maintaining our relationship. i have to tell her how i feel, so i did. i told her that i feel like she's getting away from me. she got really mad for me saying that. i let her calm down and told her my feelings again, later. again, she got really mad. 

when i feel bad, i want to talk about my feelings. as she is my girlfriend, i expect her to listen to me and comfort me. she did when we were fresh in our relationship, but now she only gets angry and starts yelling through the phone. i'm super scared to tell her my feelings again, because she will get mad again. she says she still loves me as much as before. i just can't believe it. 

when she tries to explain herself, i understand her. i can't seem to show that to her, she always says *""i'm tired of explaining, you never understand me. i will never tell you anything again, because you never understand me.""* i want to explain to her that i do understand her, i do understand her feelings, i do know what she's going through. i can't seem to make her realize. she gets so angry when she thinks like this.

last night, she went insane. she told me ""shut up now!!!!!"" multiple times. i can't shut up, because i can't live with the feeling of being scared, anxious or sad.

when we have a fight in the morning, night or afternoon, my life gets influenced a lot by it. i get extremely anxious and feel like she will leave me at any given moment. 

&amp;#x200b;

i am constantly thinking, anxious and trying so hard to make her feel happy. i tell her a lot of sweet stuff and actually care about her. i don't feel like she does the same in return, she's so sick and tired of everything and so am i. i'm always trying to talk about our problems and try to constantly fix everything. i've been extremely sad because of this relationship lately. i try to find happiness with something else. weed is legal here in the netherlands, it's easy to get and easy to do. i try to find my happiness with weed. i know it doesn't work, it only gets worse, but i can't stop it because it makes me feel happy and less caring for a few hours. 

&amp;#x200b;

i told her about bpd again this morning, she said ""oh my god! i remember, but i didn't forget!"" i don't think she knows what bpd is, i want to tell her, but where do i start? without her getting angry? how do i make myself and her more happy with each other. how do i make her realize that i understand everything she says. how do i make her listen to my feelings again..

Silently splitting on FP,"i’ve been splitting on my fp for the past 24 hours and it’s brutal. i’m doing it in silence this time instead of lashing out because it’s a secret relationship and i promised them on christmas i would try to do better and try not to continually split on them.

i’ve been having a sexually driven sexting relationship with a former flame for almost all of covid and we’ve consistently tried to groom each other to have the style of relationship the other one wants but we are both too stubborn to acquiesce.

i decided after my splitting episode pre-christmas that i would try it their way and let them take the lead but 2 days ago there were some astrological aspects which lead me to believe there was a window of opportunity to push my agenda emotionally and when i did, i didn’t hear back and it’s been over 24 hours.

now i’m splitting and keep having dark fantasies about how i will ghost them or how i will break it off if they do respond to me. i’ve felt like this relationship was over so many times. i’ve flat out broken it off with this person so many times but each time they let me back in.

right now i’m desperate to end it because i’m so tired of feeling this way and being in this cycle. i’m committed to taking this split in silence incase i change my mind and also i feel like ghosting will ultimately break them down and teach them lessons beyond what i’m capable of with my words. i fantasize about them contacting me and me giving them the option of hearing me out about why i’m ending it or just doing it silently.

"Loneliness, new city, and covid","hello everyone,
i moved abroad for work this fall, and i'm struggling with loneliness. i've lived and moved to many different places in my life (i'm in my early 30s now), but i was lucky that it was always somewhat linked to school/university, so i could meet people and make friends relatively easily. it's difficult for me to let go of all ""protections"" that i set up to protect myself, so getting really intimate with new people takes me a long time, but i can typically make friends easily. 

the job i have now doesn't make me in the situation that i have to deal with many people, and people around me are way older than me, have kids, don't live in the city, and have no interest making friends (they have their lives already ""set""). i wanted to start practicing sports because i miss it and need it, and because maybe i can meet people my age through it, but that has been postponed and will be postponed for at least another month due to health reasons (i hope i'll be receiving the medical ok to practice sports soon 🤞 during this upcoming month). 

covid doesn't make my situation easier because it's getting bad again, and i'm in a place now where we're obligated to wear masks at all times (which i'm okay with, i'm not discussing it in terms of agree/disagree with the rule), so even recognizing faces or making a connection by looking at somebody is basically impossible. 

i should also specify i have an autoimmune disease and i spent all 2020 segregated at home (luckily with my friend and roommate at the time!!!) until i got vaxxed in early 2021 and started having somewhat of a life again (at least friendship-wise and practicing sports again for a few months). then i moved abroad in the fall, took some time to adjust to the new city, adopted a cat and that made me really really happy and i'm so grateful every day i made this decision, but then i don't know or see anyone, i barely have coworkers and speak with humans very few times in the day. 

covid has gotten bad again and due to my health issues i don't feel exactly safe meeting random people (e.g. through apps — i was considering going on dates again, i haven't had any since the beginning of the pandemic). but i feel i can't continue as i am doing now. i'm starting to have sh thoughts again, after a long long time, and i feel i'm a bit depressed because i'm having more trouble than usual to get up in the morning (my autoimmune conditions gives me chronic fatigue, so that doesn't help, but it's worse than usual and it's slightly different, so i think it's some depression too). i'm also noticing that i'm having ed symptoms too and this happens whenever i'm doing bad with sh thoughts and can't ""satisfy"" them or get rid of them by trying to take my life back to where i feel i'm happy. 

i can't really afford therapy right now, i could at most go once a month or biweekly, which has proven in the past to be useless for me. i did best when i could afford to go multiple times a week (my insurance used to cover almost all of it), at least twice a week. 

so, uhm, thanks for reading till here, i'm looking for some advice on what to do. should i just use dating apps and forget about the fact there's rampant covid around? should i wait another month in solitude and see if i can get medical okay to practice sports again and then maybe meet people like that? should i do both? should i do none? 

i've been going to museums alone, i've been entertaining myself with bricolage in my apartment, but i'm getting sadder and sadder by the minute, as i feel i can't take this isolation any longer. what would you do in my place?

my therapist said she thinks i have bi polar but doesn’t know much about it, i feel like i more identify with bpd rather than bipolar tho. she suggested i see a psychiatrist so i made an appointment for in a few months. i’m nervous because the last psychiatrist i went to was very dismissive and didn’t even listen to the reasons i was there, just asked me questions and said i had aspergers then when i brought up the issues he said i’m just sensitive. so i’ve made an appointment with a new psychiatrist and i’m wondering how you guys prepared for these types of appointments, are they usually dismissive if you bring up bpd? cause i have many reasons to suspect i have bpd but internalized version of it and i’m nervous that when i bring it up he’ll just think i’m being dramatic? idk. 

any advice or experiences with the psychiatrist would help me understand better😂",1642221571,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-15 04:39:31,1,0,

Seeking advice from those with BPD who manage (relatively) stable relationships,"well i just tested one beehive and got a pretty unanimous decision, so i figured i'd test the other one just to garner more diverse opinions.

i (21m) do not have bpd, but my gf (21f) does. we've only dated a couple months, and she was fairly straight forward in revealing she had bpd. i didn't really know what it was, so i initially thought nothing of it. until monday, when she suddenly wanted to break it off because she quote 'didn't want to hurt me'. i'm paraphrasing quite a bit of course, she broke down crying talking about how she doesn't know who she is, she's afraid of me being around to see her hurt herself, and so she needs time alone. the following day she checked herself into a psych ward where she is currently. 

the day she broke up with me, i was kind of just in a daze as it came absolutely out of nowhere, we were perfectly fine sunday (or so it seemed). the day after she broke it off, while she prepared for the psych ward, we texted for hours; i needed answers. i basically vented a bunch to her about how i loved her and wanted to stick by her during whatever she was going through, etc. to summarize, after i got everything off my chest and she told me to stop trying to understand her because she doesn't even understand herself, the conversation got more normal while she was waiting to get checked in, and we talked a bit more about random stuff and how she was scared; she finally got checked in around midnight, and that was the last time i talked to her.

it wasn't until the day after that i did some research about bpd, and it all sank in. i didn't realize how much of her behavior was actually due to her bpd. her idealization of me, immediately latching onto me after her previous relationship, the times she's told me about how she gets angry easily/has abandonment issues, the whole lot. once i knew what bpd was it all made so much sense.

if you're wondering what my first sentence is referring to, i made a similar post to a similar subreddit that has lets just say a less-than-favorable view towards those with bpd, and they advised that i run as fast as i can.

but there are some reasons i think our relationship could work. she is very aware of her bpd and that she has problems, and she is now in the process of getting help, which i think are two big steps. as i've been learning about bpd i've been learning about how a non-bpd partner can help by laying boundaries and understanding the emotions of a bpd-partner. i guess what she did by wanting to be alone is considered 'splitting', and she might feel different the next time we talk. also, i admittedly feel a little selfish for wanting to be with her. i know for some with bpd that learning to be alone may be the best way to heal, but i am very willing to try working with her on this if at all possible.

so now i seek advice from those who actually have bpd, or who have been in a relationship with someone who has it. let me know your thoughts, and thank you.",1642219802,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-15 04:10:02,1,0,

Scared to go back to school,"this story itself isn’t directly related to bpd, but i definitely know my reaction is caused by it. i hope this is aloud. i would put it in the vent subreddit but i don’t think they will understand like others struggling with bpd do. i need some advice on my feelings, and i feel a lot safer talking about this here.

so (don’t judge me when u read this, i know it’s a stupid situation but please just hear me out ) today we had a sub in my marketing class. so one kid took it as an opportunity to completely cover the board in marker. at first i didn’t really care but at lunch my friend, we will call her anna, convinced me to help her erase it

while we were erasing it, one of the girls with a really good reputation and a lot of friends walked in and was like ‘why the f*** are you guys erasing it??!!’ like making a huge deal out of it

and i know i got a lot more upset about it than i shouldve but i really panicked and called my dad to come pick me up because i was really scared of the confrontation of when the kid who drew the stuff on the board came back , because of what if she told him

but the girl only knew anna, she didn’t even know my name.

it’s just anna is pretty widely disliked in ‘their crowd’ and at school in general. she doesn’t seem to mind it but they make fun of her and tease her allll the same and it’s started to get them to start doing it to me too just cause i’m friends with her. the reason anna is so widely disliked is because she’s very boisterous on her political opinions (such as racism, abortion , homophobia, etc). there’s definitely nothing wrong with that and it’s great she’s standing up for a good cause, but we go to school in the country part of indiana, and it’s hard to survive in this kind of school with that personality. she also unintentionally comes across as a bit of a smartass, and like she thinks she’s better and smarter than other people through her tone when i know she doesn’t.

it’s not really even a matter of i care super deeply about ‘popular kid approval’ approval (cuz i dont ik they’re a bunch of aholes who will have peaked in highschool) but i’m much more sensitive to the teasing than she seems to be and it’ll bother me a lot more. my reputation has been neutral for a long time but it’s going down because of her. 

after i got home i immediately begged my dad to take me to sally’s so i could get some hair dye. i dyed my hair back to brown and i’m gonna start dressing and putting makeup on again in hopes she doesn’t recognize me bc i wont fit her description anymore . i know how extreme that is but it made me panic so much that if my dad hadn’t been able to pick me up i probably would’ve hid in the bathroom for the remainder of the day

it’s just switching to this school last year was my fresh start but being friends with her is killing my reputation, it stands at a middle point right now and i have other friends so if i were to drop her i wouldn’t be totally alone.

i know it’s a super awful thing to do or even think about but i just don’t know what to do. i know it’s not her fault that they’re bad people and i shouldn’t throw away a perfectly good friendship to avoid problems with people who don’t give a damn about me either way. but it will only get worse from here, and since i react so heavily to small things i don’t know if it would be better for me to be selfish.

this is kind of all over the place, but i genuinely don’t know how to deal with this.  even the tiniest bit of teasing or a ‘joke’ i take the wrong way puts me in a really dark place.",1642218427,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-15 03:47:07,1,0,
My BPD induced habits are destroying my life and social life.,"to start this off i would like to say that i (22 f) was officially diagnosed with bpd and cptsd around may/april of 2021, and was very grateful to finally be making some sort of leap into the right direction in trying to fix my mental health. however, after finding this out and speaking with my therapist it is very clear that i have been suffering with these mental problems since my very young adolescent age and have fallen into the coping habits that i ruled were the best routes of handling my bpd symptoms, episodes, etc. self isolation and distancing myself from others and while this is sometimes very necessary in certain situations i have been doing it for so long it became a second way of life for me. i have a more quiet style of bpd so my first instinct is to close up , shut down, and remove myself from situations and people in fear of having an episode, emotional moment of weakness or anything that could end up with me being viewed negatively by anyone. 

  
it also didn't help that i was pretty much raised under the ideology of friend being a nonexistent and the only person i would ever have is myself and that i should more or less expect to be alone forever. thankfully, i have been able to remove myself for that situation and try to unlearn these things but it is hard and in this extreme moment i have realized that i don't really have anyone... i currently room with my bestfriend and for the past 6+ days has left me home alone while she has been staying with family and going on outings with her friends for multiple days and times and has barely spoken to me. i respect her need to have her own social life but one thing this has provided is the fact that i have no one. i barely have friends, much less anyone who can somewhat understand my state of mind, i find it ridiculously hard to socialize and make friends because of these habits. don't get me wrong i do enjoy my private time but i realized that it's not starting to seem like more of a self punishment in fear of something that may not even happen. so with this post i am asking for some sort of advice, help, maybe even new friends? 

living my life like this has done nothing but make me realize that i have never really lived or enjoyed much experiences with others even when i want too. i am not going to say i'm a huge  people person but i would liked to be able to make friends, have a relationship, form bonds, with others. lately i just feel as though i'm either held prisoner alone or that when i do socialize it's forced and painful because i have to be aware of everything. hopefully, someone can help. thank you for reading this.",1642218234,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-15 03:43:54,1,0,

the art of searching for answers,"hey y’all,
i found myself sitting alone with my thoughts and decided to try to mute them by going on reddit. i just stumbled across this forum. i’ve never been one to express how i am feeling on the inside because i figure once i do that, the whole dam will break. i guess this would be considered venting but i need to get my thoughts out 
i’ve spent the last 13 years of my life (25f) struggling with various mental health issues. i have many diagnoses but the one that sticks out the most, impacts my life in disastrous ways, is bpd. i have a tremendous fear of being abandoned by those i love, like the ones who have come before. i hide who i truly am because once the mask comes off, people always leave. i’m too much to handle, i’m too intense, i’m too moody. 
i’ve spent countless hours searching why those adjectives match up with my being. and then i began to see the patterns. it hurts my soul to even say this but i actively try to ruin positive, healthy, loving relationships because if i can get someone to leave by hurting them, then the pain of my perceived abandonment would hurt less. 
why?
why would one want to hurt those they love so deeply? 
why would i put myself through so much pain to try and save myself from being left behind, even if there is no reason i should feel this way?
i have so many questions. i have so much hurt in my heart. i feel my soul breaking.
i guess i’m just going to have to keep committing the act of searching for answers that may never come.

I don't know what to do.,"i am a long time lurker. i've made one post before. but i need help. i'm lost. i came home from work today to my wife being home early. as i walked in she immediately greeted me with ""i want a divorce""


she says she isn't happy anymore. she says she unhappy because she is tired of doing everything at the house. she has a very long commute for work and then she gets home and cooks and cleans.


and she's right. i'm lazy as fuck. i want to be productive, i tell myself everyday that ""today, i'm going to do x chores as soon as i get home"" and instead i get high, play games, watch tv, take my daughter outside, anything to avoid the work. all the while feeling like ""i'll do x in just a few minutes"" and i don't know how to stop it.


she also says that she thinks i'm unhappy because i'm angry so much. she's right about that too. i know i have anger issues and have been trying to get better. i thought i had been making some progress, but i guess not as much as i thought. i stopped therapy during the pandemic, i should have made more effort to keep going.


thats always my problem. i can't ever seem to make myself do what i really want to do. i self handicap by ""forgetting to try"" or whatever dumb excuse i make. it's everything in my life too, if it's not something i'm doing to prove someone else wrong then i just never seem to want to do the work when the time comes.


but where she is wrong is that my family is the only thing that does make me feel happy. we have worked hard together to build the life we currently have. we just bought a house, our only child is 4 years old and almost out of expensive ass daycare. 


she won't even talk to me right now, she went to her parents house for the weekend and said we'll talk on monday. i have already fucked up that part too. i've called 30 times, texted repeatedly. obviously i've made her mad about it.

i don't want to lose her from my life. i don't want to lose daily access to my daughter. i don't want to lose everything we've built. i want her to stay. but i don't want to manipulate her to do it.

Brother with BPD. What can I do?,"so, to start things of, me and my twin brother (19 yo) are living together in an apartment away from our family for the first time since we are both studying abroad in different unis.

the thing is i knew my brother had some issues but it wasn't until today that i saw him with cuts in his hand, smoking and drinking at 2 am when i woke up and went to the kitchen. honestly, i was clueless and i feel so stupid. 

so, he was a bit drunk and stuff and he told me the whole story about being diagnosed with bpd and that a friend of him passed away a while ago.

the thing is i have no clue how to manage it since i've never been to a situation like this before let alone that we live alone together so i got no one else to take care of him when i'm not home 

i've obviously informed my parents but i'm honestly terrified since they live 3h away and they have their jobs there so living with us ain't an option.

i don't really post on reddit but i'm seriously don't know what else to do.

I'm proud of myself and my relationship.,"my job closed for a week bc covid exposure and i didn't realize how hard i was working until today when i didn't have to go in. 

i got to stay home and my bf is being so kind(he's always kind he's an angel) and helped me make a schedule for today. when i told him i didn't want to do anything but have a nice breakfast, take a nap, and have some quality time together this evening. i expressed that i worried about feeling abandoned since i was gone for covid related reasons and was alone and a little anxious. he understood and said he would check in me while he was working. i feels secure, we said goodbye and i went about my day of rest. 


i'm exhausted from always making myself appear normal. and it was like i had my ball of zest in my pocket but i didn't need it for work so i panicked for a little bit. i found myself -for a moment- afraid that i was going to act out with my boyfriend. i have quiet bpd so i would have spent the day festering and hurting so badly that i have to take my anti nausea meds. but we've built our communication and i know myself so well now. instead of letting him go to work and then possibly spiraled in feelings of abandonment, i communicated and set an expectation for myself. an easy one(nap all day) but still!

"Newly diagnosed, perspective needed abt relationships/rant. Mention of sex (or lack of)","sooo i’ve been recently diagnosed (though i had suspected for years) and all the pieces are falling into place for me in terms of being able to understand myself and my symptoms. 

i’ve had many unstable relationships but my current partner and i are, as far as i can see, stable and have been together for 2 years. but i’ve been having a few months of insecurity about our connection. for some reason i’ve been worrying about him cheating. and i’m having a hard time figuring out weather it’s a overthinking thing or if it’s an actual real thing if that makes sense. 

for example when he’s texting on his phone i notice he tilts it away from me if i’m next to him, or he’ll lock his phone if i come near him. but my main reasoning is that we have little to no sex life, we have sex about once a month sometimes less. i’ll come on to him (go in for a kiss or something) and he’ll say he’s too tired or isn’t in the mood which is obviously okay and i will always respect that and never ever ever pressure him. 

but for me it feels like he doesn’t want me sexually. he never comes on to me and doesn’t really touch me other than pecks and hugs. i just don’t think he wants to have sex with me. for the first year of our relationship it was none stop and i know that happens in relationships but like it was pretty sudden and i don’t think he looks at me the same way anymore and it’s like we have all the relationship stuff without sex, so like a really close best friend. 
it hurts me a bit because i’ve convinced myself he isn’t attracted to me, isn’t really in love with me anymore and/or is cheating on me.

How to not be selfish in relationships,"i struggle to not be selfish in relationships. i grew up in a neglectful household. so now, when my boyfriend asks me to do simple things for him, like watch his tv shows he likes or to grab him something or just plain thinking “would he like this”, i struggle to make myself do it. he also is big on having his own space and personal time. i am fully aware of the fact that i’m not making him happy, i want to do these things, i know what the things are that makes him happy, i just struggle to *do* them. i don’t know if it is because the concept of praise almost makes me uncomfortable or that i’m so used to fighting for the other person in the relationship to show me love, or what.

Resources for partners of people suffering of BPD,"hello everyone. i hope all is well. i’m wondering if anyone has any good resources for people like me to learn and understand bpd. my girlfriend of 4yrs, who i love very much, suffers from bpd and though i do my best to help her and accommodate her. it really makes me mentally unwell. from the roller coaster of fighting, to cancelling plans, to making excuses why she isn’t with me when hanging out with my friends or family, and absolute dependence on me emotionally… it’s wearing me down. i understand, that she isn’t intentionally doing this but i can’t help but think i am somewhat emboldening these behaviors as well. i keep telling her with each episode that it will be okay but in all reality, it’s not, and i’m not okay either. i love her, i really do and i will do anything to help her get better but it’s beginning to cost my mental well-being.

Any advice please? Anxiety and splitting in relationships make me physically ill and I don’t know how to stop that.,"i wasn’t sure if i should put this under venting or relationships, but i suppose i kind of need advice so here we are. basically my boyfriend lives an hour away and yesterday he told me that he was going to meet his mentor today for a few hours to work on his truck. this is a man that he is very close to, and even though he has wanted me to meet every other person in his life(other than his mother who didn’t know i existed until almost 3 months of us dating), every time i asked to meet this older man he always seems hesitant or doesn’t make a point of getting us together at all.

so yesterday i asked him if i could come meet him today and his response was yes! so i got up and got ready to come to meet him, and even though i’m on very little sleep and i’m squeezing this in right before work, 
 is now saying thank you for getting up so early but that i should meet him on a different day. granted i did offer to meet him on a different day, however it was mostly just because it seems like he didn’t even want me there in the first place.

so now i’m fucking fuming because a. i don’t even think he bothered to tell his mentor that i was coming today, which could’ve saved this whole thing from happening. b. i live an hour away, you would think that he could’ve just voiced his fucking opinion yesterday before i got up early after not being able to sleep well, showered and got ready to go there. i am so livid i feel physically ill and every part of me is telling me to break up with him now, partially because of how irritated i am and partially because i feel bad for being this mad.

the problem is were both neuro divergent, he has adhd and so do i on top of my bpd, but because of my bpd i’ve become better at communicating? i am at least a lot more vocal about how i’m feeling and what’s going on, and i try to check in with other people when i get angry to make sure that it’s justified. so my problems today are that he didn’t bother telling me that he had left his house to go there in the first place, and on top of that i don’t think he even bothered to mention to his mentor that i was coming, which makes me feel really shitty because i shouldn’t have to work this hard to meet important people in my boyfriends life that he supposedly really wants me to meet.

i apologize for the anger,  i am sure i sound extremely selfish right now i am just in the middle of an episode and more than anything irritated because it’s not like we live down the street from each other it’s an hour drive for me. and we’ve also had the conversation that if he would like to do something with his friends by himself but he is more than welcome to do that and just needs to communicate that to me with no hard feelings on my end because i can’t always read social cues (neither can he).

How do (22F/bi) know if she (27F/bi) actually likes me?,"i'll try to provide as much context as i can. so i've been working in the deli for about 8 months and a bit ago a new bakery employee was transferred over to our store. we start at topping for a bit and eventually i asked her if she was by and she said yes but she didn't really date girls because the previous relationship she was in went south. i don't remember how but eventually we decided we wanted to hang out and she invited me over to her house to spend the night. we're doing that again tonight. she's been helping me through a lot of hard shit that i've been going through lately and i know she genuinely cares. like yesterday i broke down at my doctor's office and after that i came over to the store because i knew she was working and i came to talk to her person and she helped so so so much. she actually invited me to spend the week at her camper just to decompress and take my mind off of everything because we both need that at the moment. tonight we're going play pool and hang out with one of her friends and i think it's going to be fun. however, she has a thing for our store manager. he's engaged yet he's pursuing her. i try to tell her that this is going to get complicated and messy if they continue talking. but she is saying that she knows what she's doing and she can handle herself and if things get too messy she'll walk away. however he sent her let's say sexual text so i think about boundary was crossed there although i'm not sure if she reciprocated or not. so now i'm left wondering where we are in everything. we've known each other for like i'm not even sure at this point because time runs together for me but maybe like a month or two. i like her and i've never been so sure about something before and i hope i just give it time she'll be my girlfriend or at least i really hope so. any thoughts on this? there is more in my profile history as well and please feel free to ask any questions at all. i'm at work right now but i will reply to every single one when i can. sorry if they are any mistakes in the writing. i'm using voice to text.

she's let me into her world and i'm so glad to be there. i just want to make sure she's okay all the time. i've never been so truly comfortable with someone before. plus, our hugs are long, tight, and genuine.

oh yeah we hung out with her aunt shirley and then she mentioned she wanted to ease me in into meeting her family and i also met her mom and she's super nice and genuine which i love.

she's taken me on drug deals, snorted xanax. i know this may be whatever but i'm chill with it. that's what i mean by she's let me into her world i'm trying to be as chill as i can. and be myself",1642170640,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-14 14:30:40,1,0,
Meditation is hugely helpful,"i've suffered with bpd for so long its caused so much chaos and pain, losing someone important made me realise i need to help myself.

i've started meditation, for 4 mins twice a day, (slowly building the time up) and i've been doing it for a week and it's helped so much. my feelings really have calmed me down. it was only 2 weeks ago i gave up on everything but as soon as i got out hospital and realised i've once again survived i've been trying to change my thinking pattern.
 
spirituality tends to have so much self help and connection i'd highly recommend it. try and be open minded too don't close off to other views etc. at end day we are in world where we are still discovering so much and updating our self all the time. one day it will be a lot easier for us all to cope. in mean time meditation, open minded and self love is important. and helps with our emotions so much.

it will be hard at the start to not think of anything, but it will get easier and it because a good escape and you end up looking forward to that peaceful time.

i hope you are all ok and getting through your emotions

intense attachment so much you want to be them and they have so much control over you ??,"well when i moved into secondary school (i'm in year 11 now) i met this person and i think literally instantly they had such an impression on me?? i was completely in awe of them, i was so nervous around them and always felt the need to impress them and i copied them a lot, i thought they were so cool and amazing i copied the way they posted, did their social media (at the start) and then the next year in year 8 we started dating and it was very intense on both sides and i completely idolised them and constantly felt inadequate for them and always felt less than them and in the 11 months we were dating before they destroyed me i had completely taken on every trait i could, their laugh, humour, drawing style, the way they dressed, talked and whatever or whoever they didn't like i didn't like and same for like and i completely revolved around them and then they broke up with me and it made me spirallll and now i'm in year 11 i am still no where near over it and i'm still completely attached to them and dominated by them. i moved schools in year 10 so i haven't seen them for ages but they also kept playing with me and coming back and then leaving me again and it just fucked me up more and more and they're so scary i can't even message them without having an anxiety attack waiting for their reply and having to unsend it. i'm so attached to them i want to be them. i low-key want the disorders they have just to feel closer to them. i can't be free. i would attempt if they told me to probably. he has sm control over me.",1642168293,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-14 13:51:33,1,0,
Does BPD make it difficult to be around children?,"for context, i made a post in r/askparenting asking for tips on watching my cousins. what i left out of that post, though, was that a significant reason babysitting is a challenge for me is due to my bpd. i was recently diagnosed in the past year and was still jumping around for treatment. new insurance doesn’t kick in till next month so i’ve been trying my best to stay together until then. 

i don’t want to say i could never have the patience to be around children. i’m just worried that my disorder will make it an issue going forward. i understand parents and caregivers don’t need to have a diagnosis to be annoyed or upset with children. i noticed though that i just…have extremely little if no patience at all. and i’m fully aware children are children, they’re tiny people who are still growing and can’t really control their emotions. they’re products of their environments at this age, and i don’t want to taint that environment with my negativity. i’m always so worried that they’ll one day pick up on my annoyance, or they have before and i don’t know it. i don’t act out with them at all. the most i do is raise my voice before i realize i’m doing it. 

is this something that gets better as i go through recovery? everything feels so hard as it is from working to relationships, i don’t want it to make being with my family hard either. sometimes, i forget i’m 21 and it feels like i’m still a kid who just spawned into this world.

i had great relationship with my mom and dad until they got devorced when i was 6. i was moving back and forth every week. at my moms house we were completely allowed all feelings but at my dads we couldnt be anything but happy. he started to yell at me if he saw me crying, angry or annoyed. so i thought that these feelings are not valid and i started to supress them and ignore them. i would suffer by myself every day. i think that this actually could have been a huge part of my mental health and i feel like this is sort of a trauma for me. i still to this day dont share anything with anyone because i think they’ll hate me and get annoyed with me, so i keep everything inside of me. i feel like im on the edge all the time, even on my good days. one set back and i’m having a meltdown throwing things and hurting myself",1642157168,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-14 10:46:08,1,0,
I'm NOT trying to fix things out of my control,"the last few months have been a rollercoaster of emotions. i find myself swinging from feeling resentful and abandoned, feeling shame and regret, and feeling hopeful and empathetic. we all know these feelings, but this situation has been a real test. with this, there are a lot of reasons for someone ***without*** bpd to push for answers, try to find out if they did something wrong and/or force apologies on the other person, or think that the pain could go away for them and the other person if they just did \[something that may or may not be effective\]. but i'm not someone without bpd... and that's why i'm in this situation. 

i don't know if i'd be in this position if i didn't have a bpd diagnosis. maybe it would have been okay if i hadn't struggled so much to feel safe, if i hadn't leaned on my fp so much, and if i hadn't been exposed to trauma. or maybe, if i'd been diagnosed with adhd and c-ptsd instead, someone looking for support while loving me wouldn't be met with advice to run, detach, fear the future, or question how real our love even is. maybe that has nothing to do with what's happening.

i want answers so badly - to know if i could have prevented this or if it might get better. i want to know if i should feel ashamed because i deserved this, or angry because i didn't. i've been told i have to wait for these answers, and i don't know why. you know, it isn't easy to tolerate the stress of not knowing for months on end, wondering if they'll ever actually tell me, on top of having core abandonment wounds reopened. but i am, and without doing anything impulsive or self-destructive. i'm making it as productive as i can and working on getting better ***for myself.*** because i may not know if the person i love thinks i deserve better than this, but i know i deserve to feel better than this. i'm working to prove that to *myself*.

when i see signs that this person is hurting too, i want to fix it. i want to do all the things i know would help them feel better and show them i'm here if they want my support. i want to prove that i love them for who they are, that i could understand, that i can forgive. i want to show them that if this is hurting them, they can stop. that it isn't saving either of us from the future they feared because that's not where i'm headed. i want to show them that i wasn't starting from square one with this - i just needed help getting over a hump to keep progressing. that i've already faced things that i didn't think i could even just a few months ago. but i'm not doing anything to show them, because i can't force them to look if they aren't ready. i can't decide what they need to see. i'm just continuing to face my own challenges and trusting that if it would actually make a difference to them, they'd be hoping that's what i choose to do. 

if someone is hurting because they assumed that i would get worse, i'm not responsible for proving them wrong so they can feel better. i'm responsible for taking care of myself and being more stable. i'm responsible for not giving myself so little credit, too. they can choose to see the challenges i'm up against or the person who is overcoming them. if they hope i still love them after they ran away, it's on them to turn around. i'm determined to be standing in a better place whether or not they do.",1642155717,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-14 10:21:57,1,0,
Bpd but without the relationship issues?,"wanted to say this and see what other people have to say, i (17m) think i am borderline, and very specifically a quiet borderline, i’ve been seriously suspicious of been having one for about 2 years, and in a week, (the 20th) have an appt to discuss this topic about possible bpd

here’s the thing though, i’ve never been in a romantic relationship with someone, and therefore never had relationship problems with people, i’ve had some things that are criteria or symptoms, such as the fear of abandonment and efforts to avoid it, and the pattern of idolize and  devaluating, but it’s really been to some select individuals who i won’t name the relation to, but never to a partner, and these feelings are never obvious, i keep them inward and never let people know i feel these ways, i internalize the things i know are
“stupid shit” in my head and will not lash out to other people, i’m smart enough to do that, because i don’t want to change what others think about me to a negative since 

really i am just, very emotionally unstable, and i’ve had that, my emotions can be unstable and super intense, and other things too, such as the chronic feelings of emptiness, anger especially towards myself, paranoia or dissociating, identity disturbances, suicidal ideation or self harm, and impulse eating and spending (can’t drive and still a virgin, but i know i’d do those too if i could, just don’t mess with substances) i can fit all the criteria for bpd, and some towards some relationships, but i’ve never had rocky relationships from my mental health, and have never acting out or badly in a way that it would affect a relationship that i have  

and that’s what i’m curious about what others say about bpd without relationship issues, if that’s a thing or if that’s possible, i fit all the criteria, but i manifest and internalize it all inwards bcuz i don’t want to fuck things up, and my emotions are unstable especially when i’m alone, but the no relationship issues makes me think i really don’t have this pd even tho i fit so many other things about it

especially since recently, i met a girl who i caught feelings for, and have actually started to feel better now, changing myself because i want to better myself to get with this girl, since right person wrong time is a thing, trying to make it right person right time, but that too, makes me think that i don’t have bpd even tho once again, i literally got all the other criteria, except for one, struggles to keep stable relationships, (but i am concerned too that if i get with this girl, that she’ll be the first of my unstable relationships, and that scares the fuck i out of me)

i’ve felt confident that i have this disorder especially in the past 2 years, when i’ve really met the criteria for it really well, and i still do now, but i haven’t gotten a diagnosis yet, and the fact that i don’t struggle to keep stable relationships makes me think i’m worrying for fucking nothing and am wasting my fucking time with this stupid fucking shit, but i guess i just want a opinion or some stupid shit, idk what’s wrong with me",1642147157,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-14 07:59:17,1,0,

Fp not reciprocating and distancing herself from me,"for context me and her became friends over the summer and became close pretty quickly. we hung out often because of work and naturally gravitated towards each other. i ended up getting really comfortable and honest with her and opened up to her about certain things which i wont lie did start to verge on trauma dumping. she was always super supportive of me until recently when i’ve started to notice she will take days to respond or leave me on read completely. also she’s always been very sweet to me but didn’t reciprocate in the same way i did. an example of this was when i wrote her a message verging on essay length about how much she meant to me and how great she was and i expected the same for my birthday but got two sentences. i also see her show so much more love to some of her other friends and i think due to my lack of identity she’ll never feel as strongly for me. maybe it’s because i’m shy and introverted who knows. 

this is a vent but i don’t know where to go from here because it’s been a pain the past months feeling like i’m in the dark and like she wants nothing to do with me. i know that there’s a chance she might be busy and this is all unintentional but it sure does feel like shit. i cant imagine not having her in my life and after this brutal year she made me feel so much better about things. is there a way i can reverse the damage and make her care about me more? i really need input",1642144337,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-14 07:12:17,1,0,

Mourning what could have been.,"i think that the things i mourn the most are the past and the future.

i'm missing the childhood i never had. i'm getting older and farther away from it, and i realize i'll never get to experience a ""normal"" childhood. i'll never get to experience parents who were actively involved in my childhood. happy memories. childhood best friends. parents that loved me so much they did things with me. i've never had any of that, and i won't get the chance to ever again. 

it's much more frequent now, i find. i cry when i see those videos of moms making their toddler's lunches. i feel a bit more shattered every time i realize that the other adults in my life never saw the signs. every time i remember. every time i remember every fucking thing. every time someone says it wasn't my fault and i was too young. 

and it hurts. it hurts in a raw, throat swelling, chest burning way. the kind that makes you want to scream and cry and hit things until you're 4 years old again and this time your dad loves you and he holds you and everything's okay. 

and i mourn what this illness has taken from me. i was smart. i was focused. i could've been great. by now i could've been a better artist or done all kinds of things with my life.

now i can't do anything. i can't focus on anything except for him. my entire life is ruined and everyone thinks it's a conscious choice i make. i'll never go to college. i'll never have a career in anything. i can't function anymore. i just can't do anything anymore.",1642139231,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-14 05:47:11,1,0,
Ended a friendship without catastrophe,"big first time for me 

made friends with a woman that was temping at the office i work in. we hit it off working together and decided to hang out still after she stopped working there too. things changed, i was getting blown off casually. 

usually this would be upsetting and i would stifle it for fear of overreacting. well this time i still held off from the knee jerk emotional upset reaction. but after working through it in therapy a bit i tried to bring it up with her. the talk goes well and she totally gets where i'm coming from. or so she said, and then did the exact same thing next time we made plans. 

pretty upsetting but i still didn't blow up. i didn't know how to proceed because i felt like this person and i understood each other so well and letting the friendship end on account of a logistical issue might be an overreaction. a fair fear to have, i often overreact and have trouble discerning when my emotions match the situation. 

told friend i needed time. even followed up after 6ish days and said hey i have a lot going on, im gonna need to take space and follow up on this after. i was honest that i was feeling hurt and honest that i didn't want to over react or under react, and left it at that, they seemed to understand. 

after sorting out some personal unrelated life issues that were making it harder to think, i thought about things again in a clearer head space. it seemed like this person really enjoyed my company when they had it, but did not value me as a person. we really did have fun together but they wouldn't (or couldn't) do what was needed to treat me fairly. 

when i brought it up with them i did my best to focus on my part, use i statements, and not be accusatory. i said i didn't like the way things were going with us, i said i felt like my needs weren't met, and that i wanted to take a step back. if anything perhaps i wasn't honest enough in my effort to avoid conflict. but after i thought the convo had come to a healthy conclusion they added one last sort of.. personal jab. it stings but it also confirms my suspicion that the friendship was off to a bad start. this also left me content with the choice to stay as conflict aversive as possible while still approaching the conversation directly. 

i dont feel warm and fuzzy, this is difficult, but this feels right. this is thinking big picture and planning for relationship dynamics that support me and the other person in bringing out our best selves. this isn't hyperfixation and mania for 5 months after which everything its boring or shitty. 

its uncharted territory and still kinda scary. but i know even if i didn't make the exact right choice, im really trying to make choices with the best intentions in mind and thats all i can do. 

still good days and bad days but things are coming along. thanks to anyone who's read all that, we got this yall

well since a little while ago, i have been feeling more and more restless? the horrifying realization that this may be bordering on obsessive with how much i think about my friend and what she’s doing and wanting to be with her. also being kind of like calm down at myself when i feel hurt/upset/frustrated that she won’t like ask me to hang out when i express wanting to be with her/ around her. i also don’t feel the same kind of vibe from her and idk why? she seems fine but i don’t feel fine. i feel awful. and, i’m like screaming on the inside and irritable af (this one is about other things happening). if i lose any friends i either wouldn’t care or it would mildly suck but somehow just the thought that she thinks/feels less of me by 1% is making me feel desperate. i’m over here internally losing it over her not answering her text messages within the hour. what is happening to me?",1642135360,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-14 04:42:40,1,0,
"Boyfriend, Business Trips and BPD","hey guys!

wondering if i can get some support/validation/insight on this.
some background information: i was diagnosed in 2019 with bpd and i have been doing relatively well in terms of therapy and medication. my boyfriend and i got together in 2018. when me and him started dating he would always stay over. i have many intense crisis moments surrounding sleep and nighttime. from desperate loneliness to depression and separation anxiety from my boyfriend consume me when him and i are separated. don't get me wrong, i have had times where we didn't sleep together but those times were still hard. now that we live together, the separation anxiety is worse and is a constant thing i revisit in therapy. additionally, since early childhood, i've always had chronic sleeping issues where i've had sleepless nights and emotional breakdowns. i also occasionally hallucinate at night, which makes me scared. 
earlier in the month, my boyfriend got invited to tag along with his project manager and one of the corporate reps to go to california to visit some of their clients. he would be gone for 4 nights. when he told me this, i had a rough emotional breakdown, contemplating su***de. luckily, after calling a trusted friend, she was able to talk me down and offered suggestions. after exhausting staying with my parents (emotionally exhausting to be around) and staying with friends (mental breakdown over 1 night away), she proposed the idea of going with him. i was skeptical at first because i didn't think it was a thing but after asking around and researching it, i found out that it's borderline normal for partners to accompany their significant other on business trips. i proposed the idea to my boyfriend who was open to trying to make it work. 
i want him to go as i feel it's a great business opportunity but then again, part of me has to be a bit selfish as we haven't spent that long away from eachother and i feel like the timing was bad (having really bad emotional stuff going on. 
due to covid, the trip was cancelled. when it was, i was having a rough day at work (and the night before and i had called my boyfriend in absolute emotional agony being anxious for him going). when he told me it was cancelled i was relieved.  part of me was happy but the other part of me was disappointed because it was a great opportunity. 
last night, i brought it up. he kept telling me that it's cancelled so we don't have to worry. he also mentioned that i shouldn't have to have such a hard time sleeping or being alone at night. he said it's something i need to figure out and work on. i got a little sad that he didn't validate my feelings towards him going, all he really had to fall back on was the trip was cancelled. i asked him if he thought it was worth trying to see if i can tag along and he didn't reply. 
anyways, i just wanted to push this story out there into the bpd world.

summary: boyfriend going out of town for 4 nights with me having severe separation anxiety and really bad fears of sleeping alone. offered to come with to little validation. trip cancelled due to covid but still makes me sad and anxious.

Question regarding BPD,"hey all,

i have recently just started to learn about bpd and have a question that i would like answers to if possible. 

if someone with bpd ignores you and you haven't done anything wrong, but at the same time they are still active and talking to others, is there some kind of reason behind this?

i get that everyone is different, i just find it odd how you can just ignore someone who has been extreamly nice to them, buying them all sorts to make there life easier and then them act as if you don't even exist, only to come back in 2 days and act like nothing happened.

as you probably realised this is something that is happening to me right now.

i would like to know what the possible reasons could be behind this? what a pwbpd thinks/feels to do this, and also how to go about it.

i’m in therapy but i’m still finding life so hard. i can barely get out of bed, i can’t work, i don’t really have any friends, i can’t handle romantic relationships because that makes my bpd so much worse so i stay alone. it’s so lonely but i don’t want to hurt anybody.

two years later and i've been seeing someone for a few months. i've told him all about my bpd, about what triggers me, how i've changed meds, gone to therapy etc. but that i still struggle. 

he seemed so supportive. then as this time of year got closer i felt so stressed again. christmas and my kids birthdays got me stressed. looking for work got me stressed. i got a harassed by a guy that i sold something to on gumtree to the point where i had to report him to the police. a fake facebook account messaged me and said my bf was cheating on me (he absolutely wasn't, but it just added to the stress) and now the anniversary of being fully abandoned is coming up and i've been spiralling. 

i fucked up. i got so paranoid i wouldn't message my bf stupid shit that i didn't even mean. and i'd apologise and then feel guilty and would spiral all over again.

Urge surfing during moments of extreme distress,"hello,

does anyone have advice for what has worked for them? the last time i got distressed, i imagined the anger flowing through me into the ground and that allowed me to urge surf for a few seconds, which even just a few seconds is promising. i am hoping to find some sort of go-to thing that will help keep me from acting on urges.

i already couldn’t get this off my mind, and related to a lot of articles on gaslighting. then today, a coworker mentioned that lately when i ask her things i enter the conversation with “ am i crazy or-“ or “ am i an asshole for thinking-“  and it’s never anything actually bad. she was like you don’t have to introduce things like that! you’ve been doing it a lot lately. it made me realize that this behavior in my personal life is becoming noticeable even in my work life, and that something might be wrong. 

i avoid conversations about issues in the relationship now, because it always comes back around to being my bad mental health causing problems, or me being fragile, or me refusing to hear his side and gaslighting him, or sometimes he’ll start questioning me when i was bringing up something he did that bothers me. now he’s saying i run away from any conversation where he’s not telling me what i want to hear, thus invalidating his emotions, and that i never care how he feels. i’m actually running away from feelings gaslit, scared and invalidated by the end of the conversation. i don’t even raise my voice and he’ll get super aggressive. hell even tell me he doesn’t care how i feel because it’s always about me and it’s his turn now. lately the conversation goes nowhere constructive and goes from me voicing feeling disrespected or hurt- to a psychological breakdown about how i’m mentall ill and brought it on myself.

Unwanted feelings yet again,"hi, this is just a little vent that i need, even though some advice on how to handle the situation might be welcome.

after many failed relationships and a lot of suffering from many people, i thought i had finally found fulfillment and happiness in being alone, or rather, completely detached from anyone i met. 
not allowing anyone to be close to my soul allowed me to find my own place in the world, without needing a fp's approval, and it felt really good for a while. i was sending good vibes towards the world, and the world reciprocated. until it reciprocated too well.

i was meeting random new people as usual, and it led me to this one person, who i thought was unattainable at first, just like everyone i met. but they responded well every time i was fishing for affection, and as time passed, we developed a bit of a relationship (also they said they weren't the type to get emotionally attached, so i went in without fear or hurting anyone).

we're still not a couple, and using that word would probably send me back to the worst place mentally, but we have a similar dynamic. we see each other as often as possible, and they give me so much affection, i always almost end up crying from how weak and vulnerable i feel when we're together. 
it's just so hard to stay cool and detached. 

problem is, i'm really beginning to see them as a perfect being, and i can almost feel my old patterns starting all over again, it's infuriating. recently, they're spending time doing things i love with people other than me, and i'm cool with that, i really am. 
but that's not what the feeling tells me.

"Aww a new psychiatrist, was a good experience for once.","so after a couple of emergency department admissions, the mental health system here in melbourne, aus connected me with one of their crisis psychiatrists.
i've been unable to get a hold of one since september, covid has totally booked them out as so many people are struggling.
for the first time, a psychiatrist has told me that i don't need to be medicated.
here's what we figured out:
when i get in my thought loops, (bpd traits), i become anxious, i then panic about every upcoming moment which then leads to the feelings of emptiness, loneliness and i fall into depression where i lose my sense of worth and desire to live.
it was enlightening to see this and then immediately how i've done this my whole life - and how it has affected every romantic relationship and ended in their demise.
i like the idea of not needing to be medicated, but it also scares me as it means that i have a ton of work to do.
i accept that i will have down moments, but my goal is to lift myself out them faster and not fuse with them.
easier said than done, but in this moment i feel optimistic and grateful. my partner has been there every step to the way and gone through hell because of me which i am struggling to forgive myself for.
i don't have many people in my life, and she is the only one that has shown so much care, empathy, kindness, support and love.
i will be starting schema therapy next and am on a waitlist to be a part of a 6 month dbt outpatient program.
i want my life back, i want to find joy in moments, be present, be authentic and learn to place myself first.
there is hope. for all of us.
in those dark moments we lose that hope.
i place my hand on my heart in those moments and breathe into my heart and remind myself that is where i am. not my head, not my thoughts. my heart, my soul, my spirit. 
i hope that i can grow through this, be the person i want to be, attract amazing people and live a fulfilling life. 
this is my hope for me and for all of you.

Am I overreacting to something my partner said?,"so my partner and i were arguing a bit. she likes to pick fights and she’s been so cold the last couple days. an example being: says she likes me so much, i’m her person and the next it’s ‘i don’t want you in my life romantically but you’d make a good friend.’ which has me like 🚩immediately. 

last night, she said i was toxic (which i guess i might be but everyone is surely?) and i ask how i was toxic and i asked how someone can go from feeling something one day and switch up so quickly.

and she goes, ‘i probably have an undiagnosed mental illness. we can’t all have a diagnosis’ and this completely fucked me off. i have suffered with mental health since i was 12 and i wish i didn’t. 

if she wants my diagnosis, she can have it. i don’t fucking want it. 

i think i’m right to be angry. i think that was a low blow and i’m very upset and angry about it. 

we haven’t spoke since. i’m actually at the point of breaking up because i do not want that type of person in my life. 

however, i don’t trust myself and how i feel so i’m wondering if i’m overreacting. 

so, am i overreacting?",1643316807,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-27 20:53:27,1,0,

I hate that I can never feel sure about my emotional reactions,"when i’m having a rough day i am filled with scenarios where i wished i blew up on someone who talked down on me and scenarios where i wish i *didn’t* blow up on someone who talked down on me.

i am never ok with any emotional reaction i have. i try to choose silence, but i feel pathetic and still under attack. i try to “talk back,” but then i feel like a pathetic person trying too hard to be a big man.

the common denominator with these situations is the person instigated during times that i thought were ok and safe. times when their random mean spirited comments took me a back. i feel like i always have to be prepared for peoples rudeness, but i don’t like feeling like i’m always under threat, i want to just accept these situations. i want to truly internalize that how people behave reflects their internal worlds in the same way how i behave and feel reflects core experiences and emotions i have. 

there was nothing inherently “wrong” with me that “caused” these people to feel the need to put me down, and there is nothing inherently “wrong” with the people who i project my emotions onto. it’s all on them and their internal worlds. it’s all on me and my internal world. 

then i think about my own mean spiritedness and i turn the rage onto myself, how dare i ever feel bad about myself if i’ve judged others too. i want to believe i’ve never done it to the extent i’ve witnessed others but i doubt anyone remembers all their negative behavior either. 

i wish i could accept my humanness. when you grow up in a household that shames natural inclinations it’s so much more difficult to make peace with it. i just hope learning to judge these people who i felt “wronged” by less will influence me to be more at peace with myself and my behaviors and inclinations.

Dealing with BPD jealousy/insecurity and not knowing how to move further,"i'm making this post mostly because i want to hear different perspectives on this issue and how people deal with it and also kinda just to rant idk. so i (f20) have been with my boyfriend (m23) for over 2 years now and everything goes great until he mentions a female friend or acquaintance and i go into a full on spiral for multiple weeks. i know that my deep routed jealousy stems from insecurity and the fear of abandonment, and he has been very supportive and reassuring. he has also never done anything to make me feel insecure so i know my feelings aren't rational, but i still can't get over this feeling. i see every girl as a threat/competition especially if i feel like she is more attractive than me. 

this situation in particular makes me feel even more insecure because he and this friend have a lot in common, from interest in bikes/cars to music.  how they met was purely coincidental because she's the daughter of his moms friend, so they just came over and starting casually talking and don't even talk with each other outside of that. sadly i made the mistake of self sabotaging by looking her up and stalking every possible social media that she has to the point of throwing up, also knowing that she probably is his type makes it very difficult to get over this. at this point i see her as an ideal version of me purely based on her looks despite me not even knowing her.

he keeps reassuring me that i am his only type and that he just can't fathom being attracted to someone that he has no emotional connection with, and that their interactions are awkward at best. despite this my brain has the urge to fill in every ""gap"" of how i imagine their interactions, with the worst possible things and because of this i've been needing constant reassurance for the past 2 days. 

at this point i'm kinda sick of living like this because it's like my brain splits in 2, on one hand i fully realize that i can't forbid him from having women as friends and that trusting him is the only thing in my control. i also realize the root of my insecurity and that my brain just keeps projecting my past experiences of being cheated on and abandoned to this one, which is the healthiest relationship i've ever been in. at the same time i feel fucking sick whenever this happens and no matter how self aware i become i keep spiraling and i'm scared he will get tired of reassuring me one day 

i've also not been going to therapy for the past 2 months because i didn't get along with my previous therapist and have been too anxious to go look for a new one, which probably makes everything worse

Always feel misunderstood,"i know no one is really “normal” but there are people who clearly were able to develop in a safe environment which supported them and allowed them to explore themselves which then led them to  grow healthy habits and a sense of self and identity as they got older which gives them the privilege of leading fulfilling lives, hopefully.

and because of that i had to spend most of my teen years in treatment centers and hospitals, never allowing myself to develop in any manner really. i only started taking recovery serious in august of last year while at mclean(3east for life). and i really am so incredibly grateful for that opportunity, but the self awareness of this disorder is a real killer sometimes. i have no idea how to be a human still, i still don’t really know who or what i am, and i know exactly why too. the only concrete things i know about myself is that ,objectively, i am 19 and male; even though both those things still feel shaky subjectively. it feels like i’m walking a tight rope blindfolded over a dark abyss. it hard not to feel hopeless and terrified about the future.",1643254791,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-27 03:39:51,1,0,

Help to understand: being harassed by someone with BPD :-(,"hi, everyone.

i need some help to deal with someone with bpd who is harassing me. i want to clarify i don't know too much about this diagnose and my problem could be related to external problems he has.

my ex boyfriend is stalking me and trying to contact me at least once a week, the main problem is that it's making me feel like shit for days. 

our relationship was messy and really toxic. i will take my part on this. i am a very dependant person, let him use me for sex while he promised being together million times. can't say i didn't see he was lying last few times, but i wanted him so bad. everything ended when i found out he was dating a girl and cheating on her with me. my self esteem was destroyed and i have been working on feeling better the past year. i don't hate him or anything, just want to stay away since he made me feel worthless and suicidal at that time.

i have blocked him and made everything private on my social media, but he always finds the way to keep contacting me. he says things that are kind, like trying to catch my feeling again but he just makes me feel really bad and traumatized. he sends sexual messages (i think he still has my nudes) and tries to vent with me too. he admitted he stalked me in the past, possibly keep doing it.

i don't know what to do, no police is going to take this seriously because he isn't aggressive, don't know if ithey participation is needed either. i have been ignoring this and my therapist offers me help whenever i need it, but it's really traumatic to me and it's been hard for me to express this, i want to move on from this eternal breakup, i wanna stay in peace with my current life, but i keep caring and i keep suffering. i don't know if telling him how this is making me feel will make him stop because it didn't work in the past, and i don't want to destroy him either being aggressive myself, i don't really understand why he does this, i don't know how to deal with this.",1643246301,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-27 01:18:21,1,0,

move forward to today and i had an episode at lunch where i was just like nothing is real, i’m not real and it was getting to a dark place. this started a panic attack and my dad who is really good at helping me snap out of a panic attack we out at the time. luckily my parent’s dog maisie was there for me and her coming up to me and letting her stroke me slowly calmed me down. 

so, i was got myself into a calm date but then when i check my calendar i’ve missed 20 minute of a zoom meeting i organise. so, brain went back to the same extremes as the previous day from that i will be getting fire soon to i should quit. at least maisie was by my side again to calm me down. i was panicking because i didn’t what excuse to say- i’m so bad at lying but i don’t want to tell then everything.

i'm surrounded by people with bpd (2 flatmates and my best friend) and their detatchment/dissociative/psychotic symptoms seem to be a result of their unstable emotions/emotional state - ie theres a trigger (identifiable or not), they go into crisis and start experiencing those symptoms

for me it feels like the other way around. it feels like my detachment is permanent, but that it varies in intensity/severity. it feels like my emotions (despair, rage etc) come as a result of the severity of the detachment itself in that moment rather than external triggers/my emotional state

"After moving and slowly losing my friends, my FP decided she no longer wanted to be friends either, Please help me cope with this","i'm 17 turning 18 this year. i'm a junior in high school and while i havent been properly diagnosed, i believe i have depression and anxiety, with only learning that i might have bpd a few weeks ago. i met my fp at the beginning of high school and from their we became close friends. we would hang out after school and occasionally play video games. at some point i fell in love with her, and later aksed her out but she said that she used to have feelings too but later decided we were better off as friends and so she forced herself to lose them. i still havent been able to get over her. last year, i had moved, and throughout the moving process i vented to her and a few other close friends i made about my worries about them leaving me. they all told me they wouldnt and later i had moved to another city. as time went on i slowly lost each one of them, from either not keeping in touch, or just them being too frustrated with me thinking they no longer cared or that they were gonna leave. my fp stayed the whole time and tried to help me. after the move she had told me about how much i made her suffocate and the pressure she had to no longer hurt me. i decided that we should take a break from talking and she agreed. i told her to take as much time as she needed and a week or two later she texted me again. i thought things were gonna get better but a month ago she started being distant and it tormented me, to the point where i asked a mutual acquaintance to see if she was distant with them too,but he had told me that she wasnt and was acting normal. she found out about me asking and got understandably mad, with her telling me she was being that way to cope with her still feeling suffocating, pressured, and frustrated that i wasnt healing or changing after i had told her that i would. she then told me she didnt think we could continue being friends and so i asked to take a month of some can both try to heal. she agreed,but two weeks ago i just snapped and vented on social media on a private account only she had access too (she thought other people had access to it too however) about everyone leaving me, and how alone i was and those type of things. she took it as me not healing or changing and so yesterday she told me she no longer wanted this friendship. she apologized multiple times and just said she couldn't anymore. i begged her to stay but she didnt budge. she started explaining that i had made her depression worsen and that i had caused her emotions and mental state to become unstable. i respected her decision but i still tried hard to convince her to stay,but she said goodbye and later i sent her a message thanking her for everything, apologizing for whta i had done, and said my goodbye. she said thanks for understanding and i hope you have a good life. now i'm lost. i'm in so much pain and i havent been able to stop crying. everything feels so numb but im still in so much pain. this is so surreal and i dont know what to do. she promised she wouldnt leave and apologized for breaking that promise and i just feel so empty, i feel so guilty, i feel so frustrated, i need help. i had signed up for therapy and i showed her before this happened that i did, i had told her about the possibility of me having bpd but she coudlnt wait long enough for me to finally heal properly. please give me any advice or ways to cope. i dont know when the therapy would start. please help me.",1643232699,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-26 21:31:39,1,0,

"Hi everyone, what is a healthy relationship supposed to be and if I have no idea, why do I crave it so much?","(m21) first to preface, i have no real way of knowing what i would truly want from a relationship. my identity is pretty unstable outside of having ""drive"" and being ""likeable"" i can't pinpoint who i am at times and it seems my personality auto adjusts to circumstances. (if only my emotions did too, they are random unpredictable and mostly invisible to others thanks to masking) i have lived with this desire to be loved and to be in love with someone and have them around without fearing they'll leave. recently i have been putting ample thought into why i feel that way because of a hurtful breakup. so what exactly is it i'm looking for? is it nothing, if so then i'll have situational friends and keep all relations transactional or as surface level as possible to avoid the stupid cycle of: 

 {1st} compelled to comfort someone and meet all there emotional, sexual, and material needs by what ever means. literally being willing to hurt others to make them happy, responding to every negative thing they say or do with something positive and constructive. {2nd} thinking about them too much, feeling awful when they aren't available but keeping it to myself, hating not being able to benefit them and feeling like they are getting sick of me {3rd} either perceiving that they aren't putting the same effort because my exaggerated ""love"" for them is only from my point of view or making them feel overwhelmed, or them actually being somewhat manipulative, causing me to withdraw emotionally and see them in a negative light

if a healthy relationship for me would be having that first part, but with someone who relieves the 2nd and 3rd part by being overall an agreeable and somewhat ""soft"" person which naturally triggers an affectionate response in me this enabling me to continue trying to be ""perfect for her"". i know that's not a real thing to be perfect but the pursuit of that in terms of a relationship results in me behaving in a profoundly caring way as i've been told and i love to feel that.

if the above is unlikely, impossible, or hard to create in a deliberate way, then i'll just let myself become cold to ""romance"" and self regulate the uncomfortable feelings of wanting someone be staying busy in pursuit of simple pleasures, occasional drug and alcohol use, and being served by maids, cooks, and prostitutes to substitute what a relationship provides in a material sense. i'm honestly sure that'll be just as good as what i'm searching for but less stressful",1643229011,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-26 20:30:11,1,0,

ptsd + bpd in a relationship,"me and my partner both suffer from bpd. they also struggles with ptsd right now, so they is having some time for themself. last week i handled it nicely, didn't feel lonely nor sad. they needs time to recover often, when ptsd hits hard, and they always tries to reassure that that has nothing to do with me nor the relationship, and that's personal and still loves me (stuff we talked, in that talk we defined our boundaries and emotional needs). but this week has been harder. bpd symptoms were hella hard last night and started thinking a bunch of stuff i don't want to think (are they leaving me?) 

some context: when i was younger i was emotionally neglected by my family, and as i was growing up, i had some relationships with people who abandoned me in the worst way possible, so you can see i carry a lot of fears regarding relationships, my partner knows all of this and we have talked everything out, and i always get the reassurance i need with no problem! 

but????? i still feel so scared about this. it feels like the pattern is repeating once again. i know i must talk this with them (and i will later when my partner feels a bit better), but i also want to stop feeling like this,,, because when i feel like people are treating me differently (even when they explain why!!!!) i just tend to drift away ;;; i get furious and think about impulsive answers like hella short and dry ass passive agressive answers, so that's why i usually take my time and end up being nice after all. but i hate it. i even feel like ""if they doesn't love me enough i should break up with them, i am not loved, i am wasting their time"".

we have talked a loooot about our needs, we have put a lot of boundaries, but sometimes it gets so hard we can't even manage writing a message explaining how or why we are feeling the way we are.

how to work through our relationship when ptsd makes people emotionally distant while bpd requires a lot of emotional support and reassurance? really need some perspective over here

psychiatrist refused to diagnose me - is that normal?,"tw: mentioning symptoms of depression

i brought it up during an appointment with my psychiatrist, but she said she doesn’t want to diagnose me with anything new while my depression is so bad (i have constant breakdowns, can’t sleep properly, have lots of suicidal thoughts etc., it’s quite bad). 

now my question is - is that normal? to not want to diagnose someone because their depression is getting in the way? 
i don’t know anything about diagnosing, but one of my friends thought it’s weird and now i’m wondering if i should get a second opinion... of course i’d prefer to get a second opinion from another doctor right away, but it might take me months to get an appointment with another specialist, so firstly i just wanted to ask the people here if that kind of thing is considered normal / standard practice, or if it’s somehow wrong or uncommon.",1643219084,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-26 17:44:44,1,0,

yesterday it was one of those days where my therapist asked to do a family meeting, and i only went with my mother because my father couldn't. during the meeting my therapist explained what were the behaviors that my parents have that make me have self-destructive behaviors. fast forward to dinner, we were talking about it with my dad, since he wasn't there. while explaineing things my mother had the brilliant idea to do exactly what my therapist told her not to. it's been 5 months now that we keep talking about the same issues, but she keeps doing this shit over and over again, and she doesn't want to understand how it affects me. after what she told me i was really having a panic attack, and while i was there she kept shouting at me about how that was all my fault. and even when i tried to take the medicine that my psychiatrist prescribed me she tried to stop me, because to her i cannot ""drug"" myself with those pills. all this made me relapse pretty bad, obviously. the problem is that she is still expecting me  to stay productive and all, which i obviously just can't. 
the problem is that i don't know what to do. i just want to run away or at least do something that would make me feel better (even if for the others is self-destructive) but i can't do it at home, because there is my little brother in the house, which is really small, and i cannot even take the train somewhere else, because it would take me 30 min by car and i don't have a car (tuscany problems, it sucks, i know). in addition, i cannot go some place else on my own, i cannot afford it (italy is quite poor, especially for young people). i really don't know what to do. is there anybody that maybe experienced something like this and maybe has some advice?

well ""later tonight"" rolls around and i'm keeping calm, mind you this is night 3 of them being gone and they were only replying with dry texts all day so i was scared they were upset. i sent a normal text about work that they didn't respond to and a few minutes later asked if they were coming back. no answer. i went into ""holy shit they're mad they're not coming back"" mode of course and texted ""i'm sorry please talk to me"" and i tried to call before i really panicked but it goes straight to voicemail. so i really panicked. couldn't get ahold of them so i texted two of their friends while crying and hyperventilating. found out their phone was dead, thanked the friends, i get a text later from my partner saying everything was okay and i had nothing to be sorry for. but when i called them and asked them to come home they hung up so i asked them to call me back and they blew up on me after i said i thought they blocked me, all they said was ""i wouldn't leave without my cat."" i was speechless and they said ""if this is how you're gonna act every time i'm with my friends just say that, this is the same shit my ex wife did and that's why i ended it."" said they were with their friends for days because they were having a meltdown and didn't want me to see it. i was fucking bawling saying i can't know that unless you tell me, sorry for texting your friends but i had a huge fucking panic attack and needed to know you were ok, i can't help always assuming you're gonna leave me if you don't communicate like i ask and they were still mad saying stop assuming shit. once they got home they saw me fully break down and let me cry on them but wouldn't go back on what they said no matter how much i tried to explain why i did what i did. just annoyedly kept saying it's ok. and now days later they keep asking if i'm okay but i don't know if i'm wrong for being so hurt by being compared to an ex for having a mental breakdown so i'm so scared of saying anything else. i didn't tell them i relapsed during the panic attack or that i don't know what i would've done if i hadn't gotten ahold of them. i've been crying so much since and i'm terrified to bring it back up. they said if they were gonna break up with me they wouldn't do petty shit they would just do it. but even still knowing i upset them i can't stop stressing.",1643187997,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-26 09:06:37,1,0,

My parents and upbringing are reason for my BPD,"i feel the way i have been brought up is a lot responsible for me being vulnerable, instable and having hyperness and anger range. 
i belong to an indian family surrounded by people having excessive anger issues (and they were somewhere proud of it) 
seeing neglect later in my life (being the middle child and seeing abandonment with the late arrival of my younger sibling ) i felt neglect, abandonment, division of love from my parents. 
multiple abandonment issues by friends, being victimised and slowly being sensitve towards made me thick from outside but a cocoan. all of this expedited and smoothened emotionally by my anger vents, taking out anger on petty things etc. 
i could not handle all of this. 
now at the age of 30, i am the worst partner to be with. i keep on taking out unnecessarily flaws of my partner, expect him to be perfect in every way possible, having emotional instability, keep on venting anger and be 'a typical bpd girlfriend'
it is literally tough space to survive. 
when my ex broke up with me, i had sucidal thoughts all the way, felt abandoned by the whole world, did not have a sense of myself. i just didn't know what was right.
i feel that vibe and energy again and again even now. 
i just want to escape from myself sometimes. it gets bit overwhelming. 
i feel there is no escape. i feel trapped.
i am the epitome and master in ruining relations - i feel nothing but helpless

whenever i have sucidal or instable thoughts, i listen calm music to relax my nerves and living in a conservative house and society it gets tougher. 
people in india are not educated , acknowledging or sympathetic about it. infact my own parents are not.

Is there hope for splitting to end with someone?,"for background i am 29f and my fps are typically female best friends. 

there have been multiple fps in my past that once i split hard on them, that’s it, no more communication, i’m totally done. i guess trying again isn’t worth the risk of perceived abandonment again so i just never talk to them again. in more recent years i’ve had one that i split on but before that switch was flipped it was a very messy “breakup” i was very hurt for months before my brain finally “saved me” and decided she wasn’t worth it. but i only went no contact with her for a few months. we did end up talking again and hanging out but it is very much on an entry level friend status, nowhere close to fp status. 

i’ve recently come to the conclusion that i think i have split on my mom. this happened somewhere in my teen years. sometimes she’s tolerable but other times it infuriates me to see a text from her, especially if it’s meant to be loving. this is horrible i know. but it’s such a knee jerk reaction to hate it and ben when i do give some kind of loving response back it’s mostly bc i feel terrible that i’m terrible. i do love her, shes my mother, but it’s incredibly hard for me to actually feel into it from the giving and receiving end.

Diagnosis / Treatment experience in the UK?,"hey guys - i hope everyone is keeping well. i guess i’m looking to see if anyone has had a similar experience to me.

i’ve been back &amp; forth to my gp for almost a year now with reference to my mental health. i thought i’d finally had a breakthrough when a lady from iapt suggested she felt it was “down the personality disorder route”. my counsellor at the time also advised she felt the same that that i would benefit from a diagnosis / treatment pathway.

from there, i was referred to the personality disorder clinic and have been on a waiting list for group therapy. in the mean time, the clinic prescribed me promethazine to help with my episodes. i’ve been waiting since last september and appreciate that it’s a long wait. i’ve suffered in the mean time, and been back to the docs to see if i can be referred to a psychiatrist / therapist for a proper assessment and diagnosis. 

i don’t mean to seem desperate for diagnosis - trust me, i don’t want to have bpd. i just want to know that i’m going down the right treatment pathway. after all, both people who told me that it *might* be down this route closely followed up with “but i’m not qualified so take it with a pinch of salt” or so to speak. for all i know, i could be going down completely the wrong route. in addition to this, i want to tell my family what is going on with me but without something concrete to tell them - i barely know where to start. my employer has been breathing down my neck too because i keep having to adjust my hours for appointments / counselling etc but have no official diagnosis to give them. i’ve been keeping them at bay by saying it is a “complex mental health issue” but they’re starting to wear thin.

"""It's not my job.."" Partner doesn't this think he should have to act any differently towards me ever in regards to my BPD, even though it would probably help.","my fiance (34m) that i've been with nearly 4 years has said the entire time since i was diagnosed 2 years ago that it's not his job to change or alter how he reacts to me. any article i send him, he so lovingly (sarcasm) calls it ""homework"" and proceeds to always see the fact the part of those articles core talk about him making any kind of change in how he talks to me, and since i am the one with the mental illness, feels that's ""unfair"" for him to have to do.

he has many times during or after arguments told me how hard it is to be with me. after enough times of hearing that, i have of course asked the question ""why are you still with me then""? and the best answer i get the vague ""because i love you"". my wording of that sentiment has also at times been more ""why are we even together"" etc. not a healthy question to ask, but i don't think telling your partner repeatedly how hard to deal with they are is either and he disagrees.. defends it by saying he is basically venting. it hurts me all the same, just like it hurts him when i ask why are we still together.

we are so polar opposite on an emotional level. while i have logical moments / aspects to me, he is basically all logic and i am mostly emotion. i have been in therapy for over a year and am now waiting on dbt to start this week so i feel like i have been trying to improve but i have a mountain of stuff to change and these things take time.

i am currently at a loss for what to do and desperately wish i could i make him understand that how he reacts plays majorly into my emotions that i so desperately fight to control (sometimes winning, sometimes losing).

is there any advice or resources you guys have for me on this? i want this relationship to work, but i currently feel like we go in circles of making each other miserable and he doesn't want to do any work listed in the numerous articles i have sent.",1642496573,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-18 09:02:53,1,0,

they have years long friendships and see their friends all the time. meanwhile, i feel like they've been slow fading me. i'm very ill and limited, lonely, depressed. i have been censoring my feelings, the fact i'm suicidal and feel alone in this relationship. lately the messages haven't been coming, i have been left on read. i deleted their number yesterday. i'm pretty sure i won't hear from them. 

i know you must fake it in some relationships. especially if you're low in the ladder. but i'm so done. i'm traumatized by people, i've had lost my mind through covid, my illnesses prevent me from going outside most days, i am in bed a lot. 

i can't fake it. i feel alone, i feel like a husk compared to their friends. it hurts to hear about all the nice things they're doing while i am stuck in bed.

i see all these trendy instagram posts like “how to deal with depressed people” and “how to deal with anxiety” and it makes me unbelievably mad. when i was depressed 7 years ago, all my friends thought i was weird and left me. now, being depressed is like trendy or something i don’t even get it. but bpd isn’t accepted. whenever someone tells me they’re depressed and i see everyone running by their side, i just want to scream in their face and tell them their problems aren’t as big as mine. there’s stigma around bpd but not as much around depression and anxiety and i’d rather there just be stigma around both tbh. 

everyone just throws around the words “depressed”, “anxious”, and “triggered” it’s fucking annoying. you are sad, not depressed. you are nervous, not anxious. my triggers are actual triggers. those types of people are so embarrassing. i understand a movement has to start somewhere i’m just saying all my wealthy white friends complaining and feeling “depressed” about getting in a fight with their friend at the nail salon or some shit like they can’t even comprehend how lucky they are to have a friend to get in a fight with in the first place. you don’t need a “mental health day” you are fine, stop being dramatic.

i would often come back because i valued and missed her. then she said how much she loved and missed me, and was happy to have me. she was often depressed, devalued herself, and worried about being alone. i was there for so many desperate moments, panic attacks, emotional phone calls, love life issues, etc. it made me want to come back and try again, try to be better, understand what i did wrong and work on myself to be better. 

it hurt more because she would have others in her life that she would fight for and be downright intense over. if she was afraid of losing them she would show up to their house, call from anonymous numbers if blocked, make scenes and arguments and get them back, so many things. as unhealthy as it sounds, i feel hurt she never did that with me. i was always the one to mildly come back and work things out.

her diagnosis never changed how i saw her, i just tried to adapt and be understanding. i know i need to let go because our relationship isn’t healthy but it’s really difficult. she told me she cares for me and wants the friendship but changes her mind all the time and idk what to do anymore. i just want to move on and heal but i feel guilty and also sad.

Ex FP has a new girlfriend,"i am having a bit of a hard time at the moment. i dated my last fp on and off for two years. i was 15 and he was 18 at the time we started dating, and he was my first love. everything between us was intense. we had broken up twice during my sophomore year of high school, but got back together at the beginning of the pandemic. things were really good for a while. he loved me deeply and was a very compassionate person. however, during that time my bpd symptoms started to get worse than they ever have been. our relationship slowly became tumultuous. in part because of the pandemic and also because i was constantly set of by everything. things took a turn during this last summer and i convinced myself that i needed to break up with him to have some space. i’m not sure if that was the right decision, and i don’t know if i’ll ever really know, but the breakup was one of the most painful things i’ve ever experienced. it’s been about 7 months since then and my life has been on a complete downward spiral. in terms of how i’ve coped with the relationship ending over time, i would say i shift constantly between the thought style of “i hate him and he was bad to me” and “i love him and i ruined the best thing that will ever happen to me”. i’ve had multiple short lived romantic partners since then, but i constantly try and go back to my ex because i crave the intensity we had and am afraid i will never experience that again. i’ve always been able to reach out to him when i had this feelings, but now he is dating someone new and it is terrifying for me. it doesn’t help at all the she is a mutual friends and someone who i have compared myself to since the second i met her, in addition to the fact that me and her look incredibly alike. now i feel the desperate urge to reach out and tell him i still love him. i know that a part of me does, but rationally i also know that trying to get back into a relationship with him would be incredibly difficult. i suppose i’m just looking for anyone out there who may have experienced something similar with a past fp and how you felt about it? i’m feel pretty isolated in my emotions right now and nobody else can truly understand it except those with bpd.",1642469803,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-18 01:36:43,1,0,

Surprised by intensity of new connection,"i'm 33m and have adhd, c-ptsd, and bpd or at least strong borderline traits. i've known about the first two forever but bpd is a new diagnosis after years of assuming bipolar. reading this sub has been helpful (if intense)!

i ended a 12-year-long relationship at the end of 2020 and have only recently been back ""on the market"".  i really hit it off with a woman i met in an online hobby group and we have had a couple of very successful long-distance dates over the last couple weeks with more planned.

i anticipated some anxiety/excitement/etc., depending, but was totally unprepared for the degree of insecurity and fixation i've felt and the speed that it's come on. this seems like a common hazard with bpd and i may have a double dose with the adhd.

the issue is not that these are bad feelings, obviously i like the person, rather that they are unpleasantly and inappropriately intense, very out of sync with the reality on the ground.

i know to some extent this is normal and not necessarily a bad thing as it relates to excitement or deeper connection, which are good things and too rare in life. the issue is the intensity is ramping up my anxiety and distraction to the extent that i've made recourse to some less than ideal coping strategies to manage (nothing dangerous, being vague to avoid triggers).

there's plenty here that could stress me out but i wonder if the distance is a factor. i've been in thousands of zoom meetings, since 2020 and have come to despise it probably like the rest of us. i tend to do badly with separation and separation is built in to distance connections.

anyway. is there a question in here? i'm so new to bpd that i'd value any reading or experiences whatsoever. thanks!",1642467863,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-18 01:04:23,1,0,

How do people with BPD react to being called out on their behavior?,"long story short, i was someone's favorite person and best friend. due to me having a history of depression, trauma, etc. my friend's behaviors hurt me a lot (she started ignoring me out of nowhere, days after she told me she was thankful for me.) we've talked whenever i got hurt, and she was always reassuring, telling me that i'm the only one she wants to talk to when she wants to shut the world out, that she's sorry, etc. she's gotten close with other people, her behaviors have hurt me more, it felt like she was splitting more often, and i've told her recently that i'm still hurting a lot. i have reassured her by saying things like, ""i know you didn't mean to hurt me, i'm just expressing how i felt. i know you're not that kind of person.""

i don't know if she's just giving me space because of how/how often i've been expressing my feelings and she's afraid she'll lose me or whatever else, or if she's gotten attached to these new people who have come into her life and no longer wants to be close with me. she does have a history of getting close with people before just fizzling out, and i don't know if that's happening with me or if she's just being careful with me. 

new friendships/potential friendships are exciting to her. she gives a lot of time and a lot of herself to those. i was exciting and we had the best conversations, growing super close and talking everyday. i was there for her when she needed me. but when i was at my own low point, she was too focused on her new, exciting friendships that she almost ditched me in the middle of our conversation. she had little time to spend with me, but spent hours talking to someone and telling them, ""these conversations remind me of the ones i used to have with diligentpond18"" and that hurt. like, am i not fun to talk to or hang out with anymore? what could be going through her mind?",1642461149,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-17 23:12:29,1,0,

Am I valid for wanting to leave my relationship?,"i’ve been unhappy in my relationship for a long time. i want to know if i’m valid for this, or if i’m just an awful person for wanting to leave. i’ve been with my boyfriend for around 2 years now. we’ve been best friends for a long time, and i’ve known from when we first met that he struggled mentally. 3 years ago he was officially diagnosed with cptsd, and 1 year ago he was diagnosed with bpd. 

i love him very deeply. we have extremely good chemistry, and on good days we will bounce off each other in the best way possible. he helped me get clean, and supports me in being the best version of myself i can be. i love him, and that’s why i’ve been hesitant to post this. it feels like a betrayal, but i want the advice of people who struggle in a similar way that he does. 

i am exhausted. ever since he was diagnosed with bpd, he has completely changed. it’s almost as if the act of being diagnosed set him off in a way. he struggled with codependency before, but now it’s much worse. every day he calls me right when he gets up (which is much later than me, so i’m always awake at this point). if i do not answer right away he will treat it as a rejection. once we are on the phone if i ever want to leave i need to make an excuse. if i simply say ‘oh i gotta go now’ he will literally go into a state and act as if i’ve broken up with him. i have a list of excuses i need to use if i ever need a break. on average we interact for around 7-8 hours a day, which is way too much for me. every conversation i am walking on eggshells, and one wrong word can turn the next couple hours into a mini-crisis. 

he says he is committed to his therapy, and i partially believe him. he’s gone half a year without self harming, and he rarely misses sessions. but he has been through 4 therapists in the past 3 years, and he’s admitted that while they try to engage with him, most of the time he shuts down. he adamantly refuses to accept he has trauma, he is still in contact with his childhood abusers and without going into details what happened to him is disturbing on many levels. he cannot accept this, and finds every possible excuse to avoid it. 

at the beginning of our relationship we had open communication, but that is no longer possible. one time i was incredibly exhausted after being on the phone for so long, and i decided to just be honest about that instead of using an excuse to leave. he went off on himself in a manipulative way. he started yelling about how he is an awful person and how we talk too much and i need to leave so i can have a break from him. i know his patterns and i know if if i actually hung up he would have either self harmed or done something impulsive. i hate that i have the responsibility of preventing that, and that the only way to prevent it is to sacrifice my own mental health. 

if it was just that i could live with it. but his codependency goes further than just calls. on random days he will decide to not eat because ‘he’s not struggling if he eats’ and he will not tell me. i know him well enough to know when he does this, and the next two hours are always me trying to beg him to eat while he makes excuses as to why he can’t. if i don’t keep pushing him he just won’t eat for days. recently he’s gotten better with this, but it still happens often. 

it always feels like we are taking one step forward and one step back. one thing will improve, and another will get worse. there are many other things i have not listed, and as he improves with one another will get worse. every month there is a new crisis. i am so emotionally exhausted with this relationship, it feels like it is draining my soul. 

i posted this here because i know the rest of the internet is very biased against people with bpd. i wanted to get the opinions of people who are free from that bias, and understand his struggles. i’m afraid to leave because i know exactly how bad his fears of rejection and abandonment are. i’m afraid to cause the person i still love very deeply to spiral, but i’m just so tired and so unhappy on a daily basis. i feel like my happiness isn’t as valuable as his physical and mental well-being, since if i leave i know he won’t recover from it for a long, long time.",1642457549,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-17 22:12:29,1,0,

to jump right into things the main issue that devastated our relationship, was my lack of emotional awareness. i suspect i'm experiencing alexithymia due to how bad i am at identifying what i'm feeling, emotionally and in my body. it seems like in the absence of knowing what i feel, i tend to just attach a narrative to whatever emotions i'm feeling that seem to fit the situation/environment around me. these narratives tend to have to do with my relationships and whether i was fully convinced of them or not, i would always communicate them to my girlfriend/ previous partners. 

i read something yesterday about communicating your emotions, and not the narratives attached to your emotions, and it just broke me because if i had realized that earlier maybe i would still be with her now. i'm not going to go into the details of our relationship because i am a bit raw at the moment and can't handle rehashing things, but my emotional regulation, self-understanding, and consideration for her during my moments of stress was less than desired in our relationship.

if i felt off and started shutting down, i would think and later communicate, ""i am feeling this way because i'm uncomfortable/ upset with you doing this""- but i was usually way off and would later on realize something like, ""i was feeling that way because i was anxious about this/ generally exhausted"". you can see how this could devastate a relationship. the core issue was just, ""i'm uncomfortable/anxious and i'm shutting down"" and that's all that really needed to be communicated. 

i also didn't mean to ever point blame but i think i would often end up pointing blame to her a lot, for the things i was feeling. it started off very self contained, like i'm upset but that's not your fault, i just want you to know that i am for clarity. towards the end that blame started becoming more direct to her and i started losing self-accountability. i'm not sure why, i just can see the trend of that happening now. it felt right in the moment but maybe that's just because it was taking pressure off of myself.

as a kid my mom would often ask me what's wrong, and my answer was typically ""i don't know"". sometimes this was a lie i'd say because i was embarrassed of the real reason, and other times i genuinely didn't know. a lot of times i didn't know, i recognize now as i was physically overstimulated. the other portion of those times... i still don't know.

when i reflect on my childhood, i can vaguely remember the time period when i started to prepare excuses to give when my mom would ask me what was wrong.

i need to not do that. i end up focusing on the reason/excuse/narrative so much and the solutions in that narrative, that i ignore solutions that are more simple and accessible to me. i have a lot less narratives when i'm alone and it's easier for me to detach from them, but i still have them. for example, i woke up feeling anxious, my first thought was, ""i feel anxious because i miss physical touch because i'm waking up alone and to solve this i'll need physical touch""- when really at the core of it, the issue is just, ""i'm anxious"". and i have much simpler coping mechanisms i can use for that.

it feels like a compulsion, and when i'm in a relationship, it feels like you have to have a narrative and a reason. like you need to be able to understand your emotional patterns and stuff that bothers you and what's wrong, so your partner can understand you. but i was often just taking wild stabs in the dark, i was just hurting her so much. i thought i was helping us but i was hurting us so much. i wish i could take it all back. 

i've noticed i'm a lot better with regulating and identifying my emotions while medicated (generic adderall). but i suspect that's because i just have a lot less emotions while medicated in general. i have no idea though. when i take breaks between meds, i have the same issues. 

i want to be a more emotionally healthy person, medicated or not. for myself and for potential future partners. i've been in back-to-back long term relationships since i was 18, so i don't plan on jumping into anything else any time soon. i just know i'd like to be in a relationship eventually, again. 

i know this just needs to be talked over with a therapist, but i guess i wanted to know if anyone in the community had any insight or advice they might like to offer. sorry if this is long and confusing. i'm struggling to even know what to ask help with and i'm not sure if this post makes any sense. i just need to be better.",1641427912,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-06 00:11:52,1,0,

how to have a healthy relationship with a FP?,"so my favourite person is my best friend/kinda gf. i say kinda because we’re taking a break right now. it was the hardest decision i’ve ever had to make, but i made it, and decided to take a break from our relationship. for multiple reasons. one, because of our distance. we live over 1k miles from each other and we have no way to consistently see each other, especially since i’m living in a halfway house right now. two, i’m in recovery and i want to take the na advice to not have any serious relationships early in recovery, for the first year of sobriety. i’m 78 days clean today. and my bpd for another. it got to the point where i couldn’t do the things i enjoyed without having those moments with her, or at least thinking about her the entire time. i was constantly worried about her leaving me in one way or another. i was going to move to her state when i hadn’t even considered that state before meeting her. i was completely and utterly obsessed with her and i couldn’t stop myself until i decided to take this break from her and our relationship. it got to the point where i was starting to think that maybe i wasn’t in love with her, maybe she was just my fp, but after careful consideration and through taking this break i’ve realised that my feelings for her go beyond a fp. and honestly? i feel so much better now. although it’s still there, i’m not always worried. i’ve started to be able to sleep without her, etc. 
we still talk almost every day, but we don’t call each other constantly and we don’t sleep on call anymore. it was so bad that i couldn’t sleep without her on the line. through taking this break and taking some time apart, things have changed and improved significantly in terms of my obsession. it’s still there, but not nearly as bad as it was. i’m worried that it will get bad again when we get back together. i’ve only been diagnosed for about 3 months, before then i was diagnosed with bipolar for 2 years and i’m still unsure if i have both or just bpd. how do i stop having a fp? is that even possible? if not, how do i make sure the relationship stays healthy and not get to that point again?",1641425286,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-05 23:28:06,1,0,

I’m tired of splitting,"i’ve tried to be different with my girlfriend this past month and stop splitting, but i only lasted a few weeks. last night i split on her out of no where because we usually send hearts and gifs when saying goodnight but this time all she said was  “i’m so tired goodnight baby” and in that moment i started thinking she found somebody else, or she’s getting bored of me when in reality she was just really tired and we had a whole argument after that where i blew up on her pretty bad. 

this morning she sent me an old screenshot of a friend saying something funny to her and she wanted to laugh with me about it but that picture reminded me of some bad stuff that she did during that time in our relationship (it’s been a year since it happened and ever since she changed and she treats me better now) but i immediately blew up on her again and brought up the old stuff that happened and we had a pretty bad argument.

she understands i have bpd and she’s been extremely patient with me but i feel like with what happened last night and this morning she’s fed up because it keeps happening. 

it sucks because even though i’m self aware it’s hard to control myself and now i feel like i’m going to lose her and it’s all my fault. i just want to be normal, i don’t want to feel emotions as strong as i do because nobody understands or takes it serious.",1641413097,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-05 20:04:57,1,0,

I (f28) feel like I want to break up with my partner (m25) of 3 years even though they haven't done anything 'wrong',"i posted this on a relationship advice subreddit as well, but someone suggested i post it here due to my bpd. 

""my boyfriend and i have been together for almost 3 years. i care about him deeply, but i don't feel the same anymore. my libido is completely gone and we haven't slept together in a few months. 

the reason i'm doubting myself is because i was recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and one thing about bpd is that, even though your feelings are valid, you can't always trust them.
since adulthood, i haven't been single for more than a few months, and my previous relationships were all serious long term relationships. so basically i've never been alone and i don't know who i am outside of a relationship. 

the problem is that every time i think i might work up the nerve to do it, i start doubting myself and remembering how good he is to me and how sweet and kind he is. i think i'm just terrified of being alone, but i also don't want to make a mistake and hurt someone that i still care about. 

i am planning on speaking to a therapist about this, but getting advice from people who might be/have been in the same situation would be very helpful, i think.""


i have a few points that i would like to add.
i feel as though we are no longer compatible. 
we started dating very soon after meeting each other, and he moved in with me almost immediately as well.
there is a very large financial gap between us, where i earn way more than him this doesn't bother me that much, except i pay for everything in our home as he can only afford his direct expenses. this has put a lot of financial stress in me and it doesn't seem like it will improve very soon.

i was diagnosed about a month ago, but have been feeling this empty unhappy feeling for months.
i don't know all the terms but i've noticed that when i'm thinking about being unhappy, i can recognise all of the parts of our relationship that make me unhappy. but then when i decide i might want to end things i start to doubt everything and see the good. (as mentioned above) i think this is part of having a fear of abandonment, but it's making me feel stuck.

Everything is too hard,"my partner hasn’t been talking to me the last couple of days. they respond in text sometimes, but mostly they’ve been shut up in their room. they have their own mental health shit (ptsd, autism, adhd). and they’ve been really stressed out and overwhelmed looking for a job. they’ve had multiple interviews and they might have two sure prospects but they’ve gotten no response in the last week and a half and the anticipation has been killer.

it’s been really hard not having them talk to me. it’s triggering. less triggering, now that i’m used to it, but still. this morning i had therapy and decided to take our dogs to the park after therapy vs. before since i woke up late. the dogs started whining. i was done with therapy and going pee before heading out. then i hear my partner come out. basically we got into a relatively small tiff about them not knowing i had therapy and how i should have taken them earlier. i guess in retrospect, it wasn’t a huge deal.

but to me, it is.i went grocery shopping on my own yesterday. i made dinner. i’ve been making dinner for multiple nights the past two weeks (that’s usually their job, they’re a great cook). i’ve been taking care of the dogs, the house, myself, the cooking, all while trying to work through abandonment/bpd shit because my partner wasn’t talking to me. and the first time they decide to speak more than a sentence to me is to scold me? what the actual fuck??

i was so mad at first. and now i’m just distraught. silent treatment is hurtful to people, even without bpd. and we’ve barely touched or hugged in days. we haven’t had sex in months, which is a whole other thing. and i’m just here, wondering, why can’t someone just love me? why does it have to be hard? what about me is so wrong that people are just repulsed? don’t i deserve to be cared for and appreciated and touched, without it being some form of manipulation? because that was my ex-wife’s shit. very affectionate, lots of sweet words, but ultimately she was holding a lot of resentment towards me because of my behavior and didn’t tell me anything was wrong until too late. and now i have a partner with a lot more substance, but the above shit happens. can’t i have both? can’t i have some softness and gentleness?

i’m so tired. i wished they’d appreciate me more. i wish they would say “hey thank you for managing while i’ve been mia. i see you and i appreciate your effort.” they say “ty for cooking” so it’s better than nothing. but i’m tired of better than nothing. i want to be seen. i don’t require a lot, just some sincere acknowledgment. but i feel like that’s just… they don’t see it. they only see what i could have done better. they only see how they would have handled it if the roles were reversed. but the roles are never reversed. because that’s not my mo. my mo is overly available. and i have kids. i can’t afford to go catatonic. i feel like they’re testing me. they had an ex who kicked them out in the middle of a mental health crisis and they were actually on the verge of feeling better and getting a new job when it happened. i know this because they’ve been bringing it up a lot lately because they feel it might happen again. either they’ll leave or i’ll kick them out. and i refuse to let that happen. we’ve put too much work into this. we’ve made huge strides in our personal development. and i refuse to let that all be squandered by some bullshit.

in a weird place,"hi guys. quick rant because i feel lost. i was diagnosed with bpd at the ripe young age of 15 after a years worth of observation. initially i was like okay well atleast i know what’s wrong, now i just need to obtain the necessary tools to not only live with it but control it. i’m 17 now. it feels like forever has passed. i’ve been through atleast 6 mental health professionals, therapists, physiatrist, psychologists. i’ve been looking for the right fit. the last psychologist i talked to did not come off to be progressional. i let myself be vulnerable, tried to explain my goals and things from the last that i need to heal from &amp; it felt as though i was being judged, she was cold &amp; made so many assumptions abt who i was n what i wanted, which were false. explaining that 30 minute call is difficult, she blamed my issues on weed (i only started smoking heavily when i was trying to survive living with my mother) 
the majority of the conversation was about pharmaceuticals. i let her know multiple times after she kept trying to push me to take medicine i did not want to, it’s a personal choice. i believe i can get better without pharmaceuticals, slow down on my smoking. first i just need to overcome the shit in the back of my brain.oh my fucking god did we get into it about bpd. being i was young when diagnosed i don’t know if the diagnosis is valid, hence another reason why i was there, it turned into what felt like mind games instead of straight shot question

then the pregnancy test was positive. he changed immediately. i really needed him during this time (i ended up misscarrying early but it was all just so much of an overwhelming experience) and he told me he felt “hopeless” with his mental health and just couldnt be there for me.

a week went by - and he apologized about how he reacted and how he should of been there since this was his problem too. we talked - and i admitted i needed to learn to not be so codependent on one person and he said he would learn to communicate more.

now ever since then, i have been desperately going out of my way to remind him why he liked me so much in the first place. we are long distance and we use to ft hours every single day and we havent since christmas (when i got the test). he promised last night he’d ft me so i spent hours putting my make up on, watched his favourite game show so i could have something to talk to him about. i really wanted to remind him of us.

well you guessed it. the time he was suppose to call came and went with no call or text. i cried for hours because i really felt like it was my last chance. 

i broke things off because i couldn’t stomach the pain and i knew it would likely get worst like every other relationship i have been in.

he said he wanted to be with me but was “incapable of giving me what i needed” and then told me that i project onto him.

i’m so tired of being devastated when someone leaves - because im always too much and they always leave. i’m sad because i desperately want things to be back to before and to not end things. i’m so sad and i just don’t know how to cope. i just wanna delete social media, never replying to anyone again, binge and be destructive. but i have to take care of myself first and not let my mental health convince me im coping when im actually just hurting myself to forget him.

any advice? and thanks for reading. no one in my life understand what its like to have bpd and i feel so alone somedays.",1641392740,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-05 14:25:40,1,0,
My fp is hiding things from me,"to start this off, my fp is a person i got very close with right from the beginning. we live on different continents so we’ve never met, but we are still each other’s closest people in a way, or at least he’s mine.. the point is, he’s not that talkative doesn’t like being asked questions but he’d usually answer mine. i always felt like i knew what was going on with him and his life until recently…

he started texting way less, refusing to answer questions and i don’t mean invasive ones, i mean questions any random person who knows him in real life would know the answer to. i understand his mental health has gotten worse and he probably needs space which i’m really really trying to give him, but he’s torturing me so badly. i confronted him asking whether everything was okay between us and he said everything was fine, but it really doesn’t feel that way. he changed his texting habits immediately as he had stopped texting me regularly which was one of the reasons i stated as to why i felt like something was wrong, he began to start conversations rather than waiting for me to text first. i appreciate his reaction, i know it’s because he’s cautious of the fact that these small things torture me like crazy, the amount of breakdowns i’ve had are uncountable.. yet he still hides things.

it genuinely makes me feel so bad i keep splitting on him, i get the urge to tell him i can’t talk to him anymore then i just remember that i’d miss him like crazy afterwards and i think of asking for a break instead… i don’t want no break from him. i feel so pushed aside, as if i’m not even a part of his life. i’m just so tired of crying. i don’t know what else to say and how else to approach him. i walk on eggshells not because of him, but because of myself. i overthink my texts so much playing all the possible scenarios and choosing a text, the answer to which i assume would hurt me the least. i try so hard to sound stable and as if i have my shit together, but i’m falling apart on the inside. 

i just feel very unwanted and unimportant to him, undeserving of knowing even just what’s going on in his life. unable to have a regular conversation with him unless i force myself rapidly not to ask because otherwise i’m met with “i don’t know” or he just ignores the question in itself and it breaks me every single time.

I pulled an Evan Hansen and finally confessed to my soulmate's mom about what I did...wish I could say I was proud of myself but I'm not,"11 years ago, i lost the man i consider my soulmate in a car crash. we only met a few times but he treated me like i was worth something, like i was worth something so it was no wonder i fell for him. shortly afterwards, i got in contact with his family, i guess so i could stay close to him in some way. like evan hansen in the musical ""dear evan hansen"", i lied about how close we were because i didn't want his family to think i was weird.

11 years have passed and i've successfully kept up the charade. i'm an honorary aunt to his two nephews and i'm close to the family but i made myself sick with all the lies. i knew chris (my soulmate) would hate me if he could see me but i didn't want to be abandoned again. see, my family isn't really healthy but his is and it was a relief to be part of a group where i don't feel the need to walk on eggshells.

yesterday, i posted something about chris on my fb wall. his mother responded with ""he knew you were his friend. thank you for that."" i realized then and there that what i was tired of living a lie and that it wasn't fair to them.

so i confessed to his mom on messenger. i told her everything. she hasn't responded yet.

it's said that once you tell the truth, you feel like a great weight has been lifted from your shoulders. well i sure as hell don't feel free right now. i'm still disgusted with myself for doing what i did, making up stories about all the things chris and i supposedly did together.

How to separate romantic love from an unhealthy obsession?,"hope everyone is doing well!

i've struggled a long time with loving someone and being obsessed with them at the same time. every serious romantic partner i've had longer than a few months has become a favorite person. 

their mood becomes my mood. criticism and compliments from them are amplified 1000x. all my hobbies are theirs. my free time is spent talking to them. i lose my own identity. 

and it gets worse and worse over time until there's fights, conflict, crying, and eventually, one of us gets blocked, usually from me splitting on the person, abruptly hating everything about them and wanting nothing to do with them anymore.

i really don't want this to happen ever again. i want to keep my own identity while enjoying the presence of others.

i do have a therapist and medication and they have helped a lot.

i feel an FP forming… help!!,"hello! i hope everyone is having a good day!

just a bit of background, i’m not formally diagnosed with bpd but i have many of its symptoms - one of which is hyper fixation on one person for validation and mood regulation and all that jazz. i’ve noticed that my fp’s are generally romantic partners, with my current one being a romantic-partner-turned-friend. in addition, i’ve also been questioning my s3xuality and feel like compulsive heteros3xuality (comphet) makes me mistake anxiety and discomfort around the opposite gender for “butterflies” in my stomach. it also goes hand in hand as a woman in being conditioned to crave for validation/attention from the opposite s3x.

that being said, i was swiping on a dating app the other day and matched with someone. we talked for a bit, exchanged socials, and talked some more. he asked me what i was looking for on dating apps and i told him “new friends or a relationship” bc i didn’t want to just h0okup with no feelings involved. we seem to have clicked really well and texted each other all night the other day but eventually we both had to go to sleep bc he had work and i had school the next day. since then, i’ve been repeatedly checking my notifications to see if he’s messaged me to the point where my mind is so alert that i couldn’t sleep. i msged him a few times since then (just casual msgs here and there so that he doesn’t see me for the insane person that i am in regards to this entire post) but instead responding with a wall of texts (like how he was a few nights ago), he only responds with like 1-2 msgs. maybe it was bc he was h0rny and wanted a girl’s attention late at night?? idkkk

i defaulted to one of my solutions, which is muting notifications just so that i wouldn’t be checking my lock screen all the time. i barely know this guy yet i can already feel an unhealthy fp relationship/friendship forming if i become close with him.

My marriage falling apart around me,"i through a venting flair on there because i didn’t know what else would fit. 

throw away because honestly i’m scared they’ll see this and i wanna refuse i’m even venting about this because it makes it hurt more.

i (28m) was diagnosed with bpd about two years ago and am just now getting my skills book so hopefully this changes my thoughts up but i know this is more of a venting post then a bpd specific post but i can’t help acknowledge that maybe if i didn’t have this dumb disease i wouldn’t be so stuck on this or paranoid and constantly panicked. 

so awhile back my wife (29f) asked me for a divorce. totally caught me off guard but all the reasons she gave me were totally valid and we ended up working things out! hooray. but the downside was i instantly became hyper paranoid that it was going to happen again. constantly worried i wasn’t doing this or that right etc and awhile back we had a convo about things just like this. reddit throwaways. she said “i’ve got one or two accounts that i ask stuff on just to get it off my chest” this sent me into a panic and i did something entirely out of character and snooped on her phone. (i’ve accept it was shitty and ultimately hurt my relationship so i understand any hate and downvotes) unfortuantly i found a post talking about  “i want my husband and his best friend”
she goes on to say in the post about how he’s always been attractive, physically and emotionally and how they click so well on different levels then me and her but she still loves be dearly etc. and goes on to mention how she’d be really happy if it started as a casual fwb thruple and that the idea of being intimate with both of us has been stuck in my head non-stop. well. now that post is forever engraved into my brain. i brought it up a long awhile ago to her and she reassured me it was an intrusive thought that was during a time when we were in a really bad stop for our marriage and she was severely depressed along side not knowing she was pregnant, so crazy hormone brain also. the entire thing has caused me a massive amount of stress and i know it’s self caused but man. my confidence has taken a major hit that i’m just not good enough. especially because she believes poly is a good thing and sex doesn’t mean anything intimate where as i disagree with both of this things. so makes me wonder why she’s even still with me after having the perfect time to walk out.

does the lack of public affection from your s/o or fp ever make other borderlines feel ashamed/embarrassed of? but to a weird extent. like your s/o or fp refusing to hold your hand in public or post about for example. not even the upright refusal, but them just not doing it in general. as if they forgot, or never had the idea to begin with. personally, asking my girlfriend to post about me doesn't even make it better because i had to ask her. it wasn't her idea, it was mine. sometimes i express how the lack of that type of affection makes me feel, and when she then offers to post about me i freak out because i think i'm being selfish or egotistical. and it really isn't the same feeling. when it's random and unexpected it feels so good, but when i have to ask it's no longer a surprise. it was no longer her original idea. i could go on about this forever but right now i just need to know i am not alone.",1641364816,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-05 06:40:16,1,0,

more recently i accidentally triggered them while talking. they got really upset and said some nasty stuff back to me. we didn't talk for a bit, and then we did talk. it was very emotional. we both wanted to work things out but they did that thing again, projecting these strange negative characteristics and intentions onto my triggering them. i heard them out and thought about it a lot, but i don't really see it. i am a pretty introspective and self critical person but i can't imagine why i would want to trigger someone consciously or unconsciously. 

we both wanted to patch things up but they said they needed time. but they also said they have the instinct to just abandon me also. they said they need time.

Just diagnosed...what the heck do I do now?,"woah. okay. so, i had my very first meeting with a psychologist today. after a few hours of discussion, tests, and just general provision of information, i was told that i was assigned a preliminary diagnosis of bpd. okay, what the heck is that? my psychologist proceeded to provide me with information about symptoms, treatments, medication, support groups, this, that, and the other thing. okay, cool. even before that i felt ridiculously overwhelmed, and **then** the information avalanche happened. now, i feel like i'm floundering. 

i'd sought out therapy as i'm currently going through a pretty rough break-up. i pushed away my partner of 3 years, went through a 6-hour period where i burned just about every bridge i had with them, and then promptly started trying to get them back and regretting every single thing i did. i've been told that i do this a lot, if not on that grand a scale. it was my discussion of this event that led my psychologist to begin preliminary testing for bpd, and, well, i guess those tests revealed a lot more. 

i'm not sure what i'm looking for here. quite frankly, i'm scared, confused, frustrated, overwhelmed...so many emotions going on right now. the only thing i've got set in stone  is that i'm meeting with a group coordinator somewhat soon-ish to see if i qualify for a support group in our area, but asides from that, i've got nothing. my psychologist wants to see me again one more time to run more tests, but she outright stated that she doesn't really do therapy for ""this kind of thing"". the list of resources that i was provided with for support in my area is depressingly slim, as are my insurance options for treatment.

Any BPD relationship success stories out there?,"i’ve (41m) been dating my gf (f35) for 6 months and it’s been a whirlwind. after posting on several relationship threads and speaking to 3 different counselors (2 individual ones for me and 1 coupes counselor for both of us) i stumbled across a bpd thread, it was a relief and heartbreak all once. it’s given me perspective and fear.  it’s given me plenty of anxiety about all the red flags i was noticing but was getting to deep into the relationship to stop. 

so here we are, back together after i showed her some youtube videos. she feels enlightened and optimistic to look into treatment. 

are there any success stories out there? i’ve seen all the “run while you can” threads but would love to hear some success stories of couples with a spouse dealing with bpd traits.

I just blew up at my mom for a situation that she's already very upset over.,"my stepfather is home on his deathbed. he's been there for weeks. i know it is selfish of me but i have not felt welcome. christmas was a disaster.  then i take it out on my mom. she called because she needed support from me. i'm tired of giving her support. i'm angry about a lot of things. i'm never good enough for anyone. they think i don't care. the man was in my life since age five. why would i care?  yea his ""real"" daughters are there with him. i'm just his stepdaughter. i'm angry about a lot of things that i've had to endure. i cannot be a support system. of course i'm self centered, they did a good job of making me that way. 

i just hurt my mother when i should have been a comfort. i hate being paranoid. thinking they are purposely not asking me to visit. thinking they are secretly plotting to hurt me. i know this isn't the right behavior but i can't help feeling this way. i've been trying soooo hard and it feels like it's all for naught.

I ruined the lives of the people I loved with my lies.,"let me start out by saying i feel terrible about what i’ve done. i’ve done so much to improve myself and my personality so i can just try to live a normal life, but alas, i’ve managed to be a displeasure of existence to my best friends.

one of my best friends (allie for a fake name) for 3 years allowed me into their friend group over the summer over a tragic incident, and i got close with another one of their friends (samantha for a fake name). i knew allie wasn’t ok with me being close to them and i knew allie had some sort of feelings for me even though i was in a relationship at the time but i decided i could just hide my friendship with samantha from allie.

fast forward a few months when i inevitably lost interest in my most recent ex, samantha and i started cuddling together and spending a lot of time together. samantha knew allie didn’t like her anymore because she was friends with me but she liked me being there for her a lot. i tried to remain close to my best friend allie too while hiding my situation with samantha and vice-versa. 

at one point allie confessed her feelings for me and i told her i didn’t know how i felt towards her instead of telling her that i probably wasn’t interested in dating her. i thought this would save how good of friends we were without complicating things but in reality i was probably just leading her on by giving her hope. 

long story short the truth about samantha and i finally came out after a drunken new years party and the fallout was nuclear from allie. allie and all of allie’s friends corrallated a night to all call me at once telling me how much of a pos i am and how they don’t want me in their lives anymore. 

the worst part is samantha lost a lot of her close friends too over the fallout and for some reason they’re blaming her instead of me for the things i did. they’ve been bullying and harassing her all over social media and she’s absolutely devastated and also hurt by how much i lied to everyone just because i was selfish. 

i just want to help both of them right now, they’re both in so much pain, i can’t believe my lies have caused so much devastation to everyone. i just wish they’d be bullying me instead of samantha she deserved none of this. 

i just want to stop hurting people i still love them all so much this is all just so wrong. i just wish i was never in their lives at all at this point. i hate myself for what i’ve done and i wish i could take it all back. i still have all their christmas presents and i don’t know what to do with them. this all hurts so much, so much hurting just because of me and me being not brave enough to be honest with people out of fear of what they’ll think of me.

i (f23) have had a rough time the last couple years. two failed relationships and fallouts with friends. a lot of them were just cases where we were growing apart; others were extremely toxic. i have always been meek and quiet and handled the nastiness as ""politely"" as i could i suppose.
the consequence of that is ... i tend to just bottle everything up. holding in my anger and sadness is the worst.

recently, i've gotten into a new relationship. we have been official since march 2021. it has not been great. he (m26) has an ex partner (mtf21) who has caused so many problems between us. he emotionally cheated with her, while she was cheating on her new boyfriend with many people, which is what he told me. it took a long time to work through this but i still lash out on him for holding an ex partner above me and not letting me move on/manipulating me into thinking we have a monogamous relationship. 
i gave him an ultimatum, either it was her or me. he said he will always choose me.

i recently went through a miscarriage and it was not pleasant. i noticed he wasn't too sad about it. and then one day he just was. a while later, he told me his ex was trying to get into contact with him. let me tell you, i lost it.

my gf and i have been living together 6 years, and there have been many times she has had to pay for the bills, i have paid her back the money i didn't pay, but the memory still sticks with her. so everytime i tell her i'm struggling, she becomes the opposite of what i hope she would be. she because more harsh, more worried, more argumentative, more judgemental... and it's because she's worried i won't work and she has to take over the finances...

my work pattern has been extremely erratic, walked on so many jobs. now i work self employed which works well because my mood changes so much.
the only problem maybe is *i am now the boss* and decide my working hours. and that maybe makes it easier to not work when having a tough time.

Self care in relationship with someone with BPD,"just looking for some general advice!

my girlfriend was diagnosed with bpd about 3 months ago, we’ve been together about 2.5 years. previously we thought it was solely depression and anxiety. this on the whole has been a good thing, being about to learn about the specific condition and work with it. 

the main thing i struggle with is taking care of myself and her. i have never been diagnosed with any mental health problems, but have my struggles and fair share of bad days. 

when i prioritise myself and my mental health, she struggles to deal with this and she needs my care and support a lot. alongside full time work, exercise etc this can be very exhausting and hard. 

how do i lead her to be more independent and get this time? whenever we have these discussions she takes it the wrong way, typically gets angry and tells me to never bother with her as she is left feeling like a burden on my life (which she isn’t!) 

i do struggle to detach myself, as all my instincts are to help her, but it is often at the expense of my own mental health and i will end up having many bad days/weeks.",1641321260,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-04 18:34:20,1,0,

A sad story,"my wife got diagnosed with bpd some years ago. last year we married and thanks to covid had to postpone our honeymoon. finally in march this year we could take our trip to southafrica and i was a dream come true for both of us! a week after this trip she went into stationary therapy for 8 weeks and after this another 8 weeks on a daily basis from monday to friday.
two weeks into the therapy she totally shut everybody out and said she needs this time for herself. even though this hurt me badly, i respected her wish and kept my messages to a minimum.
she totally changed and as an outsider (which hurts to admit that i am one) its not for the better. she started smoking, has new friends (all of them were patients in the clinic) and doesnt care anymore about her older friendships.
couple months ago, she mentioned, that she doesnt know if her feelings for me were enough for a married life/romantic relationship together. some weeks later she mentioned, that she has developed feelings for someone else. and another couple weeks later, she told me (only after i asked her) that she is having an affair. this fucked me up pretty badly. her affair ended it (which hurt me even more, that it was not my wife who ended it).
we went to couples therapy once, but the therapist said told us, its for no good if we dont both want to try to save our relationship. she still doesnt know, what she wants, while i am hanging in this void, searching for answers and trying to linder my pain. i dont know how much longer i can give her time, before i make the decision for her :( i dont know, if i can ever forgive her for what she did and how she treated me, but i want to at least try it. we have been together for more than a decade and i know the potentiol we have. but still, this is cruel. i did not deserve that. i feel like a total fool and i fail to understand how it has come to this point. we always said, we would fight for us if it came to a point like this. how could she do this to me...
these past few days we spent much time together and had a really nice time all in all. but i fear for her it was ""only"" like spending time with a good friend, not more.
i have so many questions, but i fear her answers.
should i try to last a little longer or is it to late? i dont really know what i want to hear from you guys, but i certainly feels good to express my feelings.

ps: if you (my wife) read this:
i still love you and i dont want to give up on you. i would love to carry my wedding ring once again, but it has to be you who puts it there. it wont be easy for me to face all my pain and try to forgive you, but for the sake of what we had, for what we might become, for you i would take this pain on me and fight.

i’ll admit, it was not easy. especially on my part, where i was still creating a bit of tension and not even the beginning of my healing journey. 

well — last month, after i kind of emotionally expelled out that i needed a few weeks away because i want to be able to romantically move on from them (as they have done so from me) and that the friendship makes me unstable, they unfriended me on everything and then a week after that, they sent me a very harsh email and a song with ugly and cruel lyrics. 

i showed it to my therapist and she said i did not deserve that email. because i take responsibility for the stress and the affect i had on their mental health, but i do not believe that i deserve for them to throw all the last two years of their life on me. 

in the end, i did cry. for a couple days. but my heart did not shatter. i did not beat myself up nor did i entirely blame myself as i can see we both did wrong by each other in some way.

i don't understand this because i told her that it would make me feel a lot better if i had at least a diagnosis because its making me feel so crazy and i feel like i'm stuck in a loop of self-gaslighting. it feels very weird internally because i have symptoms and should be treated for it but at the same time idk if i actually have bpd for sure, and most of the time when i'm having an episode  i try to rationalize like ok this is a symptom but is it really?? i feel like a fraud and just pretending when i try to explain what i have/am feeling.  

i also asked why she doesn't just diagnose me due to these reasons and she said if she diagnosed me it would be harder for me to get help in the future because there is a lot of stigma around the diagnosis + it would close a lot of job opportunities for me. 

she basically said in a round-about way that i have bpd with out actually saying that i have bpd??

How to manage it unmedicated,"cw: eating disorder (bulimia), drugs, emotional instability, mood swings, unstable relationships

so i have got temporary a job in another city for a month. the plan is to stay with a friend.
this friend does not know about my bpd or eating disorder but she has been around over the years calling me up and talking casually now and then.
i used to be good at bottling up my emotions, did it all my life with my parents, and dated someone without empathy for 4 years.

then i met my ex.
he opened up a lot of doors into my emotional life and i started feeling things. for real. not just cover them up.

but we has things that we were not compatible with and those difficulties led to communication difficulties and finally in a rise of bpd symptoms which in the end was why he ended the relationship.
got diagnosed with bpd in september. 

i have been very destructive after...
had friends leave me because i was so self destructive to handle
and i have developed a severe binge eating habit which has gotten better the last months because i was homeless for a while and didnt have access to a kitchrn.

but yesterday i got triggered by a mutial friend of his and dissociated and was with a friend and it was horribel for both him and me to deal with
and i often feel like i ca not control these mood swings unless binge/purge it away

am considering contacting a guy i met when i was homeless who sell drugs and see if he has adhd pills   cuz that is something that has helped with mood swings in the past when i my friend used to give me, but im scared cuz i have never bought drugs illegal.

im on a wait list with psych here but it can take months.

not sure what else to do, i dont want to fuck up this friendship with my bpd instability. so if i cant get hold of pills i have to be more bulimic. that sort of stabilise me a little.

that dont require payment

it’s almost 3 months later and i’m still having meltdowns. i’m still shaking and having nightmares reliving it. i’m crying to two of my mutual friends with him consistently. i feel like a monster for how i would get and i didn’t have answers for 4/5 years of our relationship on what was wrong with me to even fully understand what was wrong with me. i tried doing just talk therapy and it didn’t help.

the mutual friends we have together keep saying while both of us we’re wrong in how we handled the situation i shouldn’t fully give up hope on him coming back and my therapist says given our history he probably will but just… i have a gut feeling he isn’t coming back this time. they keep telling me i wasn’t a monster, that i’m just struggling with my mental health… but i kept screaming and i couldn’t stay calm for more than maybe 2 months max…

i don’t blame him for being done with me cause i’m pretty done with me but i just… i’m living my biggest fear by losing him, i’m fighting every minute of the day with myself to not message him, i blocked him on almost everything cause my friends said it would help but i just feel like i’m being torn apart again and again by my own mind.

Runaway by Beach House,"(hope i flaired this correctly!)

i’m claiming this as a bpd anthem. i know the song probably isn’t about bpd but some of the lyrics are so relatable to me.

“can you cover what you’re hiding from?”

“may you never go too far”

my relationship is about to exit the honeymoon phase and i’m terrified; need advice.,"i (17f) am diagnosed with bpd. my boyfriend (19m) is extremely uneducated on mental health; he knows next to nothing about it. before we started our relationship i expressed to him that i have bpd and that it affects my life a lot, and that it would not be easy to be with me and we were both going to have to work hard if we wanted this relationship. “i can handle you baby” is what he told me. 

when we started dating, i had left a very lengthy toxic relationship not very long beforehand. after getting away from my ex, i felt so much better and i was doing great. that’s when my boyfriend and i started dating. 

now, as things are catching up to me, and my mental health is starting to decline again, i’m experiencing more frequent/prominent symptoms and having more frequent episodes as well. during these episodes he asks me “what’s wrong baby” and i usually don’t tell him. i do this because i know he knows nothing about mental health or bpd, as well as i’m extremely embarrassed about experiencing symptoms and having bpd in general after my ex labeled me a “crazy manipulative bitch”. 

when i do tell him what’s bothering me, he doesn’t usually say anything; probably because he doesn’t know how to reassure people, and immediately tries to solve the problem instead, but he can’t do that with me very often because the problem isn’t something i should realistically be crying over in his mind, so he just holds me while i cry. which i appreciate very much, because the physical contact is calming to some degree and i know that he cares. 

we have been dating for almost four months now, and i feel our relationship is about to exit the honeymoon phase where everything is all fun and happy and loving, and because he is so uneducated on mental health, especially my bpd, i’m terrified. i understand that this relationship won’t be sustainable if he continues to choose not to learn about it. 

we are currently living together at a homeless shelter. we have talked about and made plans with moving in together after this place. we share expenses and most things, including smoking pieces and our room. if we broke up, it would be very messy because of this i believe. 

i do not want to break up with him; i love him very much and i know he cares about me too, but we grew up very differently; his family was full of addicts as well as generally not the best people, so his main goal in life is to have fun. doing research on bpd doesn’t consist with his idea of “fun” so he hasn’t made time to do it, though i have expressed that it will most likely need to be something he does if he also wants this relationship to be healthy and sustainable. 

i have been starting to compile together some information that i plan to present to him on the topic of borderline personality disorder, but i’m not sure of what else i can do to help the situation. 

advice / personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. much love xx

Splitting catastrophically in a relationship,"i [21f] have a seemingly really happy relationship with my boyfriend [21m] that has lasted for 8 months. 

recently i have been struggling severely with terrible splitting where i will be in deep states whereas i am convinced i need to break up with him in order to be independent. 

i have extreme self-esteem issues and am triggered by things he says unintentionally in our conversations. it will be things like his past experiences, or a scenario he alludes to in the future where we might not be together. 

these things trigger me beyond belief and send me through a downward spiral questioning everything about the relationship and my position within it. we are also looking for housing next year, this causing my tribulations in this state to multiply by thresholds. 

in the times where i *actually* open up to him, he is the most endearing and understanding individual i could ever ask for. which almost makes me feel worse in a horrible, twisted way. 

i come here with a few needy points of guidance:

(1) i come out of these states completely unattached to the negative emotions harbored and manifested within them. this makes me doubt a lot of the emotions or thoughts i experience, especially the negative ones. how do i cope and recognize my true feelings and thoughts?

(2) 99% of times in the past i have not told him of the times i split because i always considered the act of telling him completely counteractive to the welfare of our relationship. lately i have been communicating more about them due to their severity. i omit the detail of how convinced i am about breaking up with him, but i communicate the feelings i experience instead. i do not want to share with him every time i split, because it does not affect him. i am alone in my bedroom at night every time it happens, and i wake up unaffected. i also do not want to form codependency or drain him emotionally. should i limit the times i tell him if it heeds no benefit to him?

(3) i feel absolutely terrible about experiencing these cycles of behavioral thinking at any given negative experience of emotion. i would feel so horrible if the situation were the other way around. i truly feel that it is unfair to him to have a partner who is frequently questioning the state of their relationship. would it be unreasonable to break up with him for these reasons?  should their be open discussion between us in this scenario or should i be straightforward?

"Numb, afraid and full of rage.","for the past three months i tried to get over a difficult time in my life.

i don't know what happened but it earsed every good moments and events from 2021. for example my graduation and my birthday. these events were the best of my life and now i can't remember those days.

i know that bpd have a part it in this.

bad things happened in the last 3 months. my new year eve was the most hurtfully moment because i lost so many people and destroyed so many friendships and relationships.

edit: right now i'm in a new relationship but because of the state of my mind i can't feel anything. i feel like i'm not in a one. i feel like i'm alone. i don't know how to say her this without hurting her because she loves me even she didn't say it and care about me but i can't feel it like is real. 

sometime last year i told my ex in a serious discussion, without wanting to make her feel stressed or manipulated, that if we will break up, i will can't fall in love again and i will not be the same.

after the break up in september everything i said turned out to be true. i become numb and some sympthoms from bpd that i never had before, appeared like mushrooms after rain. i started to lose myself often and lose my conscience, i'm full of rage and i can't feel anything else.

the episode when i lost my conscience was after a huge fight with my ex and my mind was blurry and i hurt myself without knowing. i realised after everything happened and i had a huge two degree burn on my back hand.

after that episode, i became numb. i didn't care anymore about studying, getting my life back together, who i will hurt or what good or bad things i say. i hurt a lot of people with my behavior. 

i was and i'm feeling like i'm the bad and worst person i never wanted to be.

on the new year eve i realised all of this after two huge breakdowns.

i tried to talk with my therapist but every time i tried i felt like i was hitting a huge reinforced wall inside my mind and my soul. 

i want to start to get over everything and be myself again or just a part of what i was last year in my good times. i know i can't be fully better again because of my experiences.

"Finally acting normal, but feel like it's causing me to be inauthentic and bottle things up","long explanation.

i've put a lot of effort into improving my interpersonal communication skills and strongly reigning in my reactions to bring triggered, invalidated, or treated poorly and dismissively. i would say i've even gone so far as to feel that i'm managing conflict in the moment, even in group situations with some aplomb, and i can see why ""normal"" people struggle. when conflict arises it's almost as if you're supposed to not be upset if someone does something hurtful and you're just supposed to let it go and move on like nothing happened. 

i have been doing this with my friends, so when they say or do something hurtful sometimes i try to brush it off, or sometimes i try to communicate about it in a way that makes a solid ask for boundaries to be respected, etc. and because i'm trying to keep an even tone and be kind, sometimes when i'm telling someone i am hurt by something they have drive, they don't take me seriously, and if i increase the intensity just a little to stand my ground, they call it snappy or aggressive, when i know and have therapist approval that i am being reasonable. so basically it feels like people are trampling over me and i can't say or do anything about it. i also feel like i'm hiding how i actually feel and am never being authentic or vulnerable, because if i am people just want to stop talking to me.

i've also started to avoid telling my friends when i'm not doing well, so i can preserve the relationship and just ""be more positive."" this has helped my relationships get more stable, but at the end of the day i'm going home and isolating and crushing in on myself. 

i feel lonely, and like no one actually hears what i say or cares how i feel or when they do something hurtful, because my bringing it up is the problem, not that it happened.

i guess it's also worth noting that most of my friends are somewhat avoidant or are people pleasers who cannot handle conflict very well at all. even the most miniscule things that are just basic asks. i never feel like i get to talk to anyone as a real person, i'm just becoming a facade.

My 2022 three phase plan to address my BPD,"emotional disregulation causes  intense psychological distress, and even in some cases  physical/ psychosomatic pain. it's  something we live with and can learn to accept. once there is acceptance, we can begin to think about how to practically improve our quality of life. this doesn't mean we can be cured, but it means we can find  alleviation through treatment and practice. this may be an ambitious plan, but i needed to note it all to see the bigger picture and visualize my eventual goal.

phase 1: for this new year, i will be making note of how many times i lash out or act in reckless manner due to my pain. i will note when i delay my impulses and avoid lashing out. these are my reactions and i have a better chance of controlling those, than the feelings which arise. by ""scoring"" myself i will hopefully see my progress, which can boost my self-esteem and encourage me to keep going. if i record 10 episodes a week, my goal will be to get to 9 by next month and then 8 and eventually, it decreases significantly and the duration of these episodes lessen. this will be physical evidence of my improvement. i will sanitize my environment as much as i can. avoid the obvious triggers like my life depends on it - because it does. for me that means no dating. that's hard for me so i'm going to create a temporary environment that's inhospitable to romantic partners. this won't last forever i hope. but it's what i need right now. 

phase 2 - i will be using alternative therapies like philosophy to change how i think about the world and my place in it. il expand my knowledge about others living with life-impacting challenges, much of which isn't their fault. i will learn from them, those born with health challenges and how they manage to find small pleasures and cope. step outside myself and my internal struggle even for a short while. this offers perspective through a larger more forgiving lense. i've started learning about stoic philosophy which has helped change my frame of mind. with bpd i often feel like a waste of space, like i bother and upset everyone i know. i feel empty. to try to address it, i will volunteer with those less privileged than myself. perhaps i can redeem myself by doing some good in the world for someone else, seeing as my reactions and behavior have hurt others in the past. i don't have a time machine but hopefully it balances out one day: what i've taken and consumed and what i've expended and given. 

plus this leaves less time for me to obsess about romantic partners or engage in potentially triggering behavior. 



i will manage my expectations. therapy, medication, learning is all in aid of diminishing my pain. alleviating my suffering. i don't expect it (by itself) to make me happy. that can only occur at phase 3, once i am stable. only in this managed/stable state can i begin to recognize happiness when it overcomes me. living in a fog of my own suffering means i'd not even know true joy if it slapped me in the face. intense emotional fog where i can't even see beyond my suffering, let alone feel joy. i want to find or travel from the fog to the mist. mist (while still challenging to navigate) is not as dense and we can see more of our environment than if we just sat in heavy fog. in my mist,  i'd be able to see a few meters ahead, chart a course to avoid some of the potholes in the road, connect to others along the road, envision my destination as i travel the road, appreciate some of the scenery on the road and start to make  progress on my journey. it's never going to be complete sunshine and pleasant weather. this is impossible where i live, the climate or my climate  is different. i don't control the climate, i just learn to accept the weather and then embrace it. just as someone in a tropical region doesn't control theirs. they make the best of it by finding shade in overwhelming sunshine. 

this is my 2022 plan and even if i do only manage to improve 20% in step 1, i welcome it. it's far better than i've ever done before. i'm wishing everyone the best for the new year.",1641102608,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-02 05:50:08,1,0,

Pls i want to stop splitting with my gf,"ok.


my gf told me that the other day she told a girl i know (lets call her mary) that she used to like her. mary said that she liked my gf too and they started to joke about how it was a missed opportunity bc a third party ruined that connection and caused a failed chance to dedicate a stupid one direction song abt summer love.



she told me that mary felt worried since she knows that we r both together and bla bla bla, but gf told her she wasn't hitting on her, it was just silly gossiping. mary does skateboarding, and gf started to post on her insta stories about how hot are skaters and that they can with her.


i'm not jealous, idgaf if they talk or not. what angered me is that i felt it as manipulative. as if ""i have chance with someone who is sp hot, so get jealous abt it"". it bothered me a fuck ton and caused me to split on her 


the other day she also joked about being mad at me. i got sad and went to cry to the bathroom. it was a party and her friends (they love me, and felt bad abt me crying) told her the situation. she went on and comforted me, apologizing for her behavior and telling me it wont happen again. the same day she told me about the mary thing, she told me that it was vv manipulative of me to cry. 


i took all of that with confidence, laughing it off and telling her that i have the emotional capacity to not bottle up my emotions (something false but whtvs). 


i'm splitting hard. i'm so fucking angry and now i'm being sp needy with her bc i want to prove myself that she wants to hurt me. but it isn't the case, she is giving me a lot of attention and it i want to jave a reason to be mad at her.",1641097288,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-02 04:21:28,1,0,

i felt so good i wanted to take a shower (for the record i usually shower once a week or once every two weeks), when i was waiting for the water to get warm i received a message from facebook, was she with the same exact message and i wanted to send it to the archive without answering but, me being stupid, decided to answer her... perhaps it was a good beginning...

fml... the same words that feel empty: i love you, i'm sorry i haven't been in touch, some bullshit about a lot of work, but she loves talking to me and all that bullshit that just unbalanced my great day, so i confronted her: i told her that i cannot be waiting to hear from her just once a year and i that it really hurt my heart that she writes me to ignore me so i asked her to decide if she was going with the same i would rather her to stop and forget about each other, i already have, or that she would be teasing me that way.

she replied in such a formal way saying she never meant to and she won't text and disappear as usual...

Just needing input.,"i do not have bpd. but, my ex does. 
she had mentioned that she was diagnosed a long time ago, but due to a lot of… things, i guess, she had been misdiagnosed before. to the point where she was put on meds that damaged her already fragile mental health. 

she didn’t seem concerned about it, so i didn’t. 
here’s some context. 

she had been with a partner for about 8 years. he was emotionally neglectful at times and ignored her alcoholism. (he is also an alcoholic.) these things are true, and i witnessed things. 
we were friends for years. always a support system for one another. 
fast forward to 2018. i basically became her mistress. her emotional mistress. she had been feeling alone in the relationship and had actually cheated multiple times. 
went through the ringer… i dealt with so much from their really unhealthy relationship. but i loved her and cherished her. i was happy to be her support. she said that i was the first person to try to understand her. like, truly understand.
fast forward again. 2021. 
she leaves him. and immediately is with me. 
she never broke off contact with him, they remained somewhat casual friends because they had pets together. we talked a lot about how the way he treated her wasn’t ok. lots of processing. 

welp. about 6 months in, the cycle started with us. she definitely began to devalue me. it was so much. it all led to her leaving me right after thanksgiving after a week of binge drinking. 
she “needed space” but kept talking to me. then, after a week of keeping me in limbo, i myself got really upset and (probably for the first time) put my foot down and told her the pain i was feeling and that she needed to gather the rest of her things. 
to my surprise she was extremely upset and refused to talk to me. she got her things and kinda made a scene.

fast forward to about 2 weeks. during the two weeks, she ignored my calls and texts. she finally answered, aaaand bam. back with the ex. turns out “he’s the one she loves”. she said she wanted to be friends.
then changed her mind again. she told me she’s angry because i told her i felt like she didn’t try. (i wasn’t being mean when i told her this, just stating facts.) and that needs space if we are to talk again.

is this.. is this a final discard? i read everywhere i need to drop her and go nc. but this is not something i truly want. i understand i can’t be with her, but i really care about her. 

is that what she wants? do i eventually remind her i’m still here? i probably won’t receive answers… i guess i just want all of this to make sense to me.",1641079073,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-01 23:17:53,1,0,

I have never let go of any feelings or emotions which has led me to have a very wide range of thoughts,"i just realized this. i'm not a contradictory person, but the range in which i can have opinions on things is so large that to a lot of people it probably doesn't even make sense. except it does. i acknowledge everything, a ""conflicting"" feeling or emotion doesn't just overwrite the last one. they all coexist. sure, my opinions on things can change, but that specific opinion would have to change.

for sake of example, i could feel six different ways about an apple. i could talk about apple stems like they're the worst thing ever, apple skin just the same, yet talk about apple skin color like it's a blessing, the taste of an apple as perfect, but the average juiciness of one to be lackluster, and the size of an apple to be just right. 

when i say it like that i simply just sound opinionated. but imagine you heard each opinion from a friend in a random order at random times throughout your life. last time you heard them rant about an apple, apparently they're shitty, *even though they were only talking about the stem &amp; skin*. now this time they're raving about how great the taste is. none of those statements contradict each other, but it would feel that way. because the energy this time contradicts the energy from last time.

especially a scenario like the apple skin. they were complaining about how terrible the skin itself is, but now they're talking about how beautiful it is in color. as contradictory as it sounds, it's not like last time they said the color was gross and now it's beautiful. they're simply referencing a different aspect of the same subject. 

i realized this whole thing because a while ago i also realized that i could **naturally** treat 8 different women completely different and each one would be surprised at how i treated the other. which i don't think is normal. and i stress naturally because this isn't a bpd morphing moment either, or a situation where you treat them differently to accommodate for differences in their personality. or maybe, it indirectly goes a lot deeper than that and doesn't really have anything to do with women specifically but rather that they just happen to be vessels for something else entirely. but that's off topic.

either way, i'm seeing this be true for a lot of things in my life. all these coexisting thoughts that many would perceive to be contradictory but truly aren't. it's just that one thing doesn't have the ability to completely invalidate the other.",1641071673,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-01 21:14:33,1,0,

"Self-sabotage, clinginess and heartbreak.","honestly, i didn’t even like this guy that much and yet i’ve made a huge mess in just 8 dates.

so, i moved to a new city for grad school and within the first week met a cute guy at a club. 

he stayed the night at my place the very first night, nothing sexual but he stayed with me all day- i was too awkward to ask him to leave and i guess he probably felt awkward leaving as well.

we went out a few more times after that but i had unleashed full insanity on him.
i complained to him about being homesick and not making friends and even called him crying once when i was having an anxiety attack, just 8 dates by the way.

i could feel him pulling away, like any well adjusted person would after enduring my neediness, so naturally i pushed harder and started to try and make plans with him even harder- keep in mind that i didn’t like him too much.

he pulled away harder. then on new year’s eve, he asks me if he can come with me to my friends house party and i said yes. 

he came, i was wasted so i couldn’t spend too much time with him but whatever. anyway, he took me to mcdonald’s and over there i asked him if this wasn’t a good time for him, considering he’s always busy when i asked him to hang- he comes over after and tells me its over.

and now i feel like i’m in love with him.

Afraid to start therapy,"i finally made an appointment to see a therapist starting next week. that's a good thing, right? except now i'm having second thoughts.

i'm afraid that while getting help and guidance for navigating my disorder may make me a happier person, it won't make me a better one. i pretty much fall into the quiet type of bpd, i turn everything inward and devalue myself. i know my maladaptive strategies have negative effects on my family (i'm a married woman with two kids, and i'm not always successful in hiding how miserable i am from them). but i'm afraid that if i start to think of myself as a more ""worthy"" person, i will become selfish and won't give as much to others as i do now. i don't want to become even more of a burden on the people that i love than i already am.

i'm also afraid that by going to see a therapist, i'm taking a space from someone else who needs help more than i do (reading this sub has both been validating to me as it shows that i'm not alone in many of my experiences, but i also see so many people who are suffering more than i am, so what right do i have to complain?)

i feel like if i could just be stronger, i could keep holding it all in, i could just squish my wants and needs down to nothing and be only what others need me to be. i know that's unhealthy and maladaptive--and a crummy example to set for my kids, too--but my self-worth is so low it feels ""right."" that i should be able to present a perfect and contented exterior while feeling as miserable on the inside as i know i deserve to feel. i don't want to harm myself, but i don't think i deserve to get better.",1641063489,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-01 18:58:09,1,0,

Reflecting on the past year and my progress in living with BPD,"hello r/bpd, i wanted to share a little recap regarding my progress in living with borderline personality disorder over the last year :) i thought maybe some people might find it motivating and whatnot and wanted to share some positivity ❤️. just for the record, i am 28f from czechia.

my year ended on a really good note, and i know that is not the case for everyone and not something to take for granted. my life has improved greatly over the last year. it took a lot of determination, dedication and hard work, but i have achieved many great things and finally feel like i made it out of a very dark place. i completed my dbt program after 8 months, i completed my bachelor's degree, i had my medication changed and finally found a combination that works for me, i have reconnected with some of my great friends, my relationship is stronger than ever and i got a job. while there are still ups and downs, i'm generally feeling genuinely happy and grateful for what i have. i just wish the same for everyone else who might be struggling.
if you are struggling, please know that things can improve! it might take time and it might not be easy at all, in fact it'll probably be really fucking hard, but it's important to remember that it is possible.

Is it possible to have a healthy friendship with your FP?,"our fp is our best friend. she doesn't know that we have bpd, but she's definitely seen the clinginess and dependency we can have toward her and she's cool with it. our previous fp abandoned us last summer and because of this we have become a lot more anxious.

Ex-partner contacted me during the holidays; I am distressed,"my ex-partner/ex-fp called on christmas day and i didn't pick up. this has been really hard for me because i feel like i still miss them. i have done really well to try to move on and i have been very good at not contacting them or looking at anything related to them. 

i am not sure why they called. i contacted them in august about reconciling and they refused. i planned on making this my last attempt after good deal of recovery. when they refused i did good by not contacting them. they contacted a week later to ask if i had free time. i didn't and we hung up.

fast forward to late november and they contacted one of my siblings to get them to ""secretly"" ask me about a product i purchase that they were interested in. i found that odd at the time because they clearly had no trouble contacting me before. i held up pretty good, didn't try to contact and asked my sibling to not tell me about any of their messages in the future. 

the reason i gave all this context is to show you why i am so confused by this call. it seemed like a month ago i wasn't even worthy of a direct contact attempt. i didn't grow up with christmas so it's not a big deal for me and they know that. why did they contact me directly? what changed? what do they want?

a part of me knows it doesn't matter. i have already committed myself to moving on from them and i never want to date them or interact with them again.

a part of me wants to get in contact. to be totally honest, this part of me has hope that maybe something might happen and could reconcile or casually date. but i don't want to get back to that person, yet i feel a part of me is holding on and that call gave me more reason to feel that way. i haven't contacted them yet and i honestly don't even feel comfortable doing so. my ex-partner has a history of lying or twisting the truth. i feel like if i call or text in response, they would tell people that i tried to contact them and neglect to mention that they initiated the contact.

the part of me that wants to get in contact needs validation to go on and do it. i haven't been giving it that validation and i am trying to use opposite action and reminding myself of my goals, values and convictions. i am not sure how this will end up working out but i am going to keep trying.

Anyone with BPD or BPD+ADHD experience PPD?,"i recently got diagnosed with bpd comorbid adhd and i’m due with my first anytime soon.

Relationship tendencies: common for BPD?,"the longer we are together, the harder time i'm having feeling connected to my husband (married 7 years). i feel like i can't trust his word or rely on him (whether or not it's based in reality). i find myself feeling suspicious and less able to feel the ""good things"". i feel very ""flighty"" and desperate almost. 

in previous relationships, i was always the one to end them because i no longer felt i could keep up the charade of whatever personality i was putting on, yet i was too uncomfortable with being myself enough to show vulnerability. i commit quickly, we get very serious, then i break their heart. but with marriage, i'm stuck (more or less) being who i truly am, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. i've slowly shared more and more of my inner thoughts and he hasn't run away yet. 

i am not officially diagnosed, though my psychiatrist and previous therapist believe i do have bpd traits. current therapist doesn't want to label me, but i feel very much in limbo without understanding what's going on. i have a very hard time communicating these more complex/abstract thoughts and feelings, especially when they aren't ""active"" - if i felt a certain way, even strongly, the previous day, i am not likely to remember well enough to articulate them the next.

"bpd ruining things, again","long vent sorry. i’ve been crying for hours, i have work in a couple hours and i just can’t stop crying, all night. this is my second new years with my boyfriend but the first we spent together. it was going so good, i was with his family all day and things were literally going so good all fucking day until twenty minutes before the clock turned we got into an argument, because of course things can’t ever go smooth especially not on what was supposed to be a special night… so i spent the next fifteen minutes so upset and hurt that when we were downstairs with everybody he wouldn’t even stand close to me and that we had to just pretend to be happy, and it wasn’t a genuine moment anymore. i was supposed to be in his arms watching the ball drop with him and his family and it was supposed to be excited and happy. instead all i could think about and focus on was my feelings and how hurt i was and how i was already mourning a moment that hadn’t happened yet.

How to deal with abandonment from favorite person?,"i know that i have to go to therapy, but i don't have the money for that, not now. so i'm asking from advice here.

my fp abandoned me two years ago without saying anything, i got so unstable and had a lot of ""favorite persons"" to replace him, but they didn't last, it didn't work, then one day he came back, i felt complete again, i felt like me again, happiness, bus still i was so insecure that i couldn't stop telling him that i was scared and hurt. he left again, didn't even say goodbye, again. it's been a year now and still hurts like hell, i've been crying every night hoping the pain will stop soon, but it never happens.

i sent him a letter a month ago, i told him everything, that he is my favorite person and what it means, what i wanted and **how much it hurts**. but i also told him about this friend, who recently was friends with him too, i got jealous about their relationship and kicked him out of my life, i wasn't rude, i didn't told him how i felt when i saw them together, i hid everything and said it was my fault, i *really* tried not to hurt him, despite i was the one hurt. so when i wrote that letter to my fp, i told him why i stopped talking with this friend. i was trying to make him understand, that's why i said all the truth, no filters.he wrote back, he said a lot of hurtful things to me and he was so mad for what i did to his friend, that he hates that i hurt people he cares for and that i probably made his friend carry my emotions just like i did with him. he said a lot stuff about me too, he made me feel like i was the only problem, that i am the bad guy! i could feel so much hate on his words, he never talked to me like that, he never got mad at me... reading that letter i started crying and yelling, i wanted to throw and break everything. he hates me, he doesn't want me back, he cares more about his new friend than me, he didn't understand *anything* i tried to explain, and he doesn't validate what i've been through. i can't stop thinking *what about me?* i want to tell him ***what. about. me.***

it's not fair. i started crying in pain every night since he left. and since that letter everything's worse, i cry more, scream on my pillow 'cause i can't tolerate the pain, it hurts so much, i can't stop asking myself *why would he said that stuff? why did he hurt me again?* i feel like i lost my last sparkle, i don't feel happy ever, i'm always crying inside, i don't feel joy doing stuff that i like, i can't distract myself, those words are on my mind all day all night. i tried venting to friends, but they don't understand, and i don't feel comfortable venting anymore anyways, because of that part on his letter about me putting my emotions on their shoulders.

i don't know what to do. i'm seeking for advice, but just feeling like someone *finally* understands me it would be nice.

**!!!!!** and i'm sorry if this is bad redacted, english is not my first language and i don't even think clear at this moment.

Did I do the right thing by blocking my EX FP?,"did i do the right thing by blocking my ex fp?

i recently got in touch with my ex from 22 years ago. i only been in 1 other relationship in my life which lasted the whole 22 years we were apart. now that my 22 year relationship is ending, i started thinking about my ex who i really loved and because i have bpd will always love. 

when i got back in touch with him he was so happy to hear from me. he explained to me that he had a baby on the way. he said that him and the bm had broken up. apparently, she had said some really disturbing things about his mom (who passed a way) and his oldest daughter. these things that was said was in a sexual context which included him. even though she said these things she still was the one who dumped him. i encouraged him to work it out with her (for his daughter sake) but he insisted that it was over. 

we started texting and talking everyday. it was just like old times. he asked can we meet but i always told him to have his baby first. my reasoning for this is: maybe when the baby is born his bm will change her mind. the baby can open doors that he thought was closed. he kept saying that it’s over. 

eventually, we started talking about love. i let him know that i still loved him and he told me the same thing. however, i still had anger towards him because things that he said before. i got mad at him because i felt like he had all these other relationships since me and he took a lot of crap from these woman that he didn’t take from me. in fact he was very harsh to me. i blocked him because he started playing jealously games. but i missed him so i unblocked him and messaged him. i apologized and i told him that i hope we can still be friends. he sent me a picture of him and his new born daughter and i freaked out. i was so happy and i kept messaging him but he didn’t respond and i started to think that he wasn’t messaging me because he had got back with the baby mother. i got scared that he will be leaving me. i didn’t want to start texting and calling him like crazy so i blocked him again. 

this is driving me crazy. i feel like if he really cared he will find away to contact me. should i unblock him and message him or should i stay away and give him, bm, and baby time to be a family?",1643419124,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-29 01:18:44,1,0,

call the dealership the following monday and they bascially got upset becuase i didn’t have it towed there. i explained why, and they’re all, okay it makes perfect sense and no worries. 

i also cannot drive my car past 70km/hour without having trouble accelerating.

january 19: dropped my car off at the mechanic to have them scan my car and see what code comes up for my engine. comes us as a cylinder mis-fire and there’s lots of blow by. and they said to not drive my car as the engine will fail.

went to go pay, can’t find my wallet.

january 20: call my bank and visa to declare my wallet as lost/stolen. no longer have any payment methods. it’s around somewhere close as there was zero activity on both my debit and visa since i used it last.

january 21: started the process of replacing all my ids, other cards that were in my wallet such as my health insurance card. also the same day i realize i’ve been driving without my driver license card

CODEPENDENCY vs AUTHENTIC INTIMACY,"codependency: i need you to feel ok or else i'm not ok. 

authentic intimacy: i allow you to experience whatever you are experiencing, without needing to change or fix it. you are your own person.


codependency: i need you to support me and i will guilt you in subtle and not so subtle ways if you don't.

authentic intimacy: i ask for support when i need it from others, not just my partner, and i don't lash out if it's not available in the way i need it.


codependency: i will blame and shame you for not doing what i want you to do.

authentic intimacy: i accept you as you are while having clear standards around how i will be treated and spoken to.


codependency: you should know what i need. it's not the same if i have to explain it to you.

authentic intimacy: i communicate openly, and i will never blame you for my lack of courage to share what i want and need.


codependency: true love is about being loyal no matter what.

authentic intimacy: i have standards and boundaries about how i will be spoken to and treated, and i will clearly express those to you with love.


codependency: you have a lot of issues, and i'm going to help you. that's where i get my value and worth and sense of being needed. 

authentic intimacy: i'm already valuable and worthy. i'm not here to be my partner's therapist, fixer or caretaker.


codependency: i need you, and you need me.

authentic intimacy: i choose to be with you every day, and you choose to be with me.


codependency: i can't be without you.

i've started spiraling and minimally splitting, which i recognize and i've been good about ignoring the intrusive thoughts and anger, but i've been feeling nothing but immense heartbreak and pain at just the mere thought of him leaving. i love him so much and i want to make this work for him and me.

Even when you do everything right people still get mad at you,"argh! sorry this will be a ramble

i was supposed to be seeing one of my best friends today, however she messaged this morning saying she was unwell and wouldn’t be able to make it.

i took my time dealing with what felt like rejection / abandonment (i know it isn’t). i said that i was sorry they were sick and i hoped they’d feel better, gave them a bit of space, and then said “it’s fine that you need to cancel plans, esp since your sick, but also it makes me feel disappointed because i love spending time with you. and i hope that doesn’t make you feel guilt or whatever bc like not your fault?? it is what it is?

but i’m wondering if when you have to change plans, you could also offer up an alternate time or date to do those plans, or at least reaffirm that we will sort something else out soon? i think that would really help with all my abandonment issues” (which they’re aware of).

they teased me and said “nah i’m never hanging out with you again”, and i explained that i was already feeling a bit vulnerable about abandonment feelings for unrelated reasons, and they kept antagonising and teasing me, but i just laughed it off.

i later checked in with them to see how they were feeling, we had a brief convo (which they further antagonised and teased me about unrelated things) and asked if they were up for rescheduling because i have a busy week next week and wanted to lock things in. they proposed a time and i said “no i’m busy then but this slightly earlier time would work”, which they couldn’t do. i said “looks whatevs, unless you want to hang out on a weeknight then forget about it, i’ll see you when i see you”. they didn’t respond for several hours and then said “yeah that’s rational, be mad at me for being busy. i’ll message you when i want to speak to you again.” (knowing them, this probably won’t be until late next week if not more, when we usually speak daily).

and just. i get it, their sick and want space, fine, but i’ve spent all day brushing aside them winding me up and continuously stirring my abandonment issues, for them to then get upset for reading my message as snarky (which i can see it could be) is beyond frustrating. and now i actually feel abandoned. i swear you can try your best to not blow up at people or be upset at people, and yet things still end up a mess. i’m just over this damn disorder and everything being so hard.",1643343890,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-28 04:24:50,1,0,
Someone is trying to pursue me,"as the title states, someone is trying to pursue me. i (28f) gave up on relationships long ago. my last relationship was with my child's father. our relationship ended approx 6 years ago. i ended it because of the constant battle of ""i love you, you're the greatest. what we have is perfect"" to then being ""i resent you. get away from me. our relationship is a fucking shambles"". i knew this wasn't fair on him and on top of that, there was no intimacy anymore. we went 2 or 3 years without a cuddle, a kiss or anything because i felt repulsed (i go through stages of feeling repulsed by intimacy but this was the first time those feelings lasted for so long). so i broke things off for the other person.

anyway, fast forward to now and i'm still very much not wanting to let myself get close to anyone because i know it will end up the same way. i'll get attached, feel like i'm in love and then switch to the complete opposite. it's all very confusing. it feels like i don't know what's real anymore and what isn't in terms of feelings for people. so i play it safe and keep telling myself ""no. you don't like this person. this is just a hoax"".

there's a guy that is adamant he likes me and wants me to give him a chance. i've told him no and i've explained why by telling him in detail about all my mental health issues and the issues around myself and relationships. despite everything, he still keeps on insisting i give him a chance. every conversation we have he will pester me about this and each time i repeat myself as to why i can't give him a chance but it feels like he isn't taking on board what i'm saying because he's so caught up in trying to talk me round to giving him a chance.

i'm at the point of losing my shit and i don't know what more i can say for him to respect my reasons for not giving him a chance. i consider him a friend and he's awesome but him pursuing me is starting to infuriate me. i wish he could see me the way i see myself instead of him constantly putting me on a pedestal! this has been happening for a few years now and he still won't give up. he says he doesn't know why but he just feels drawn to me. i feel bad that he likes me because i know what it's like to like someone that isn't showing signs of liking you back. however, it's not that i don't like him, i'm simply rejecting him because of my mental health and wanting to protect him from the shit show that is my life.

Feeling exasperated by friend with BPD,"my childhood friend suffers from bpd, despite not having the condition myself, i have bdd, so i can understand some aspects of her condition. about a year ago, she moved away and we sort of lost contact, but recently we’ve began to communicate again. i really enjoy my time with her, and as i’m moving out of my parents house this year, i wanna savor my time with her. 

recently she was dumped by her boyfriend, who she described as her favorite person, and understanding now how attached she is to other people, i want to be there for her. today is thursday, on monday when they broke up, i asked if i could come over on friday, she said yes. i continuously checked throughout the week on whether if it was ok, and asking her if she was ok. 

today, i asked again and she said that she was actually going to another friends house, and i couldn’t go because another girl that i had a falling out with would be there. she’s never been the most scheduled person, but i’m really really really hurt by this.

i bend over backwards for her, when she got covid, i sent her sweets and snacks because i knew how devastated she was. i spend time and money drawing her without pay because she wants me to. i make sure to never mention the word “vomit” because she doesn’t like it. i don’t want to lose her, but i just can’t rationalize this, why would she- do this? i’m frankly devastated. i asked her early if she was upset with me, but despite being online has ignored my texts. i don’t understand.",1643336274,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-28 02:17:54,1,0,
Is this a normal or even a symptom ?,"hi. i have struggled with ocd (especially hocd or sexual orientation ocd) and depression and anxiety for a long time. i’ve also been semi diagnosed with bpd (psychologist suspects and believes i have it but never officially diagnosed me)  

past few days i’ve been obsessively thinking about me and my relationship due to ocd cycle. i have been struggling with hocd for so long and i always used my missing sexual attraction to people as evidence that i’m lesbian but recently i kept re-searching about being asexual and aromantic and now i’m doubting my sexuality in a different way again because i’m 19 and i still never had a proper relationship, the two relationships i had in the past for from middle school to high school and it was when i liked them and when they liked me back i felt so anxious and repulsed. i notice a pattern that when i like someone and they like me back i get so scared and anxious to the point of throwing up. 

rthrough stories of aromantic and lithromantic people and they said they experienced the same response and now i can’t get it out of my head. however someone said that this could happen in bpd too and i was like wait a minute. i have bpd. so i guess i’m asking if this could be a symptom or bpd? i’m not sure but i can’t imagine what i would do if i’m really lithromantic because i crave love and i want to be happy so much in a marriage bht why do i feel so strongly when they reciprocate?",1643334558,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-28 01:49:18,1,0,
"I can feel the emotion, but it doesn’t have to be the most intense","as i learn and grow on my bpd journey, i have found that meditation and reflection and openness to communication and calm confrontation is the key to me being more in control of my emotions (basically, if i can allow myself to be open to these things, then they cannot hurt me because i can accept them). 

and then tonight, as i was reflecting on my emotions throughout the day and my emotions that im having about tomorrow, i realized that i can feel these super difficult emotions (like the worst anxiety or feeling disappointed in myself) or situations (such as a friend cancelling a hang out) and they do not have to overwhelm me. i can feel them, and that’s acceptable to have these emotions, but i do not need to dial it at 100% and start lashing out because of this. 

i know this is taught throughout a million therapies and i logically understand it, but right now, i feel it emotionally and i can honestly say, that allowing myself to feel it to understand it makes me finally feel okay.

I'm a teenager with borderline traits and I feel so lost and unprepared for the future,"hi! i am new to reddit and only use it to read other peoples posts but i really need to vent rn.

background: i got a new therapist last year who really opened my eyes about the fact that i'm traumatized and i got a c-ptsd diagnosis which explained a lot. around october i had a break up from a 9 month relationship and i had a nervous breakdown from the ups and downs i was feeling from being in the relationship which lead me to being hospitalized (plus si + sib stuff). in the hospital they said i was showing borderline traits which is when i started doing research, watching youtube vids  and just reading people's stories on reddit.

at first i was feeling empowered and like i was making progress because of how self aware i am but now i realized what exactly having fixed thinking/thought processes means and that my awareness doesn't mean shit because the pain just never stops and when it does the happiness is so overwhelming i get into dangerous situations. i have complete burnout from trying to understand myself and i just hate being stuck and i don't want to get better but i am just so exhausted. i've been almost bedridden for the last three months, i have no friends besides my older sibling (and that relationship is pretty one sided because i split all the time and take up a lot of space :/) and my parents have to cook and bring every meal to me. my dad isn't from the us so once i'm 18 my parents are going to move overseas to retire. i'm the youngest which means my independence has a deadline and my parents are just waiting for me to grow up so they can finally leave. my older sibling(s) got to mess up and come back home and then get back into the adult world but my parents are just... gonna be gone :(

i've been through (and kicked out of lol) group therapy, partial hospitalization programs, iop, hospitalizations, constant er visits and i'm now back at the dbt group i've been kicked out of twice because of safety and some erratic behavior. i'm just about ready to quit again though since dbt feels like a personal attack on my whole existence and when i do the skills it's just a checklist before i do the maladaptive thing i was planning to do in the first place. not to mention that every time i enter a new treatment place i have to fight and advocate for trauma informed discussions of mental health and not treating me like depression and anxiety are the problem when they're just a symptom of the other stuff going on with my mental health.

the more i learn about myself the worse everything gets, i don't even know what i want out of this post i just have no one in my life who would understand or who i would be able to articulate this to without the protection of being behind a screen. plus how i feel and how i view myself changes myself that i start to lose motivation to even go to therapy or communicate how i feel if i'm just gonna disassociate from what i felt 3 seconds ago and change my mind.

is there no buzzfeed quiz to just tell me what i should feel in my life, and how i should act, and how i should be?

Excuse vs. Reason,"i am not excusing my actions by saying i have bpd, i am simply giving a reason. an excuse is not taking accountability at all for your actions. i take full responsibility for the mistakes i have made always, i feel the hellish guilt from my actions and i am actively seeking therapy to make myself a better person, that is not an excuse. if you are actively trying to get better because you feel guilty for what you did that does not make your mental illness an excuse. it is sometimes hard to see what you did wrong when your whole worldview has gone to shit and you think everyone is out to get you, it's fucking complicated. people who do not have the illness or who are not educated professionals will not see this and i have come to be okay with this, but it's always us that have to do better, the people who are already living in hell just because people do not understand us. i am okay with that, but sometimes it gets hard to deal with because it makes you feel like you are destined to be evil which is something i already subconsciously believe. it's so hard to navigate because you understand that they have a reason to be mad but you also understand that they do not understand at all what goes through your head. 

so now i simply live my life like this: to the people i have harmed, you are absolutely allowed to be mad, hate me if you want although that won't get you anywhere but hurt, but to the people who i have not hurt whatsoever, and know nothing about me, kindly back the fuck off. hopefully one day the world will become more understanding and compassionate even to the people who are painted as villains.",1642741932,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-21 05:12:12,1,0,

I really like when something good happens and I feel like shit about it.,"i'm pretty sure i have a date this weekend. i don't know if it's a date, and that makes me so anxious that i want to throw up.

i don't ever expect sex from people; but i'm hoping that if it is a date it doesn't go that well because if she sees my thighs, i'm going to have to explain a lot of wounds, and i'd like her to be a bit more familiar with me before we have that kind of conversation.

my interest in her is absurdly high seeing as i know fuck all about her at this point in time. sure, i knew her in highschool which was half of my life ago, but that still means i haven't seen her in 16 years. but i love to delude myself into thinking that that makes it a love story 18 years in the making, and that just makes it so special, and i put all sorts of expectations on her like it will get rid of the hangups i have from my last girlfriend who i also put too much expectations on.

again, the real anxiety comes from that i don't know if it's a date or just hanging out, and she'll do things like heart react to things like me saying what restaurant we should go to in text (which took me two days to decide on because i'd work up my anxiety so much that i'd start to space out), so i just get more confused because i don't understand heart reacts in general, and i sound like a fucking teenager when i say shit like this.

and at some point in time, i have to just accept that i am going to fuck this up, she just moved back and is probably just trying to meetup with friends, and my frothing-at-the-mouth, lovesick, idiot bubbly heart eyes are going to scare her off. she's smart enough to have talked about recognizing when people are love bombing her and since i ooze affection at first, this is going to be rough.

then at some point in time if by miracle it is a date and i don't fuck it up, i'm going to have to give her the heads-up that i sometimes just stop caring about people for a while and go through the motions because i know i'll come back; but that i can be a real dick because it's easy to irritate me when i'm feeling distant.

y'know, at least when i dick everything up it'll be over with. i say now; but when that happens i'm going to think about how stupid i am because i don't have any friends at this point in time because every time someone gets a little bit busy i stop feeling to try to beat them to the punch on abandonment until i've ghosted them so long that there's just no way we can be friends again, so i can't really afford to lose another one, and i do want her as a friend even if this isn't a date anyway.

Fox, PHD",so helpful for anyone interested in learning more about themselves and different skills to combat symptoms. i got mine on amazon and i highly recommend. i posted a more in detail review of it on my tiktok about the first part as that is how far i’ve gotten but there are also ton of more in depth reviews on it online from people who have completed the workbook as well as professionals who recommend it for patients with bpd or people who aren’t diagnosed and feel as though they identify with the disorder. my favorite part thus far is that it really makes you feel like you’re not alone nor crazy. it has statistics about how many people deal with bpd and for me  personally that helped because whenever i’m highly emotional i convince myself that i’m the only person who has felt this way. if you or someone you know has bpd and is willing to use a workbook this is a great option :),1642732517,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-21 02:35:17,1,0,

"Just having a ""burnt out on life"" type of vent - Also, maybe content warning?","i find myself genuinely not knowing how or even why i would even say this to any of my friends.  so reddit, you're it.

i think about talking to these people who i claim to be close to, who claim to be close to me.  i think about needing a hug, or even needing (and i can't believe i am saying this) to be held.  just for a little bit of help to stand, to function, something...

here's the thing...i don't feel comfort from any of them.  the hug i want is not comforting, the words are just things that are said.  and, what can be said, really?  what words are sufficient for me to feel better?  no one can teach me how to feel.  i stopped talking to them about the crap in my head for these reasons, and kept it all in - just casual interaction - but...it isolates me more.  

but my friends...i remember copping criticism from a friend for not checking in on her partner on one day, and at the same i get nothing.  that same friend was supposed to give me equal catch up time but took it all and forgot about me in the end (this has bugged me in the last week).  the other few...it's mainly just silence and help like telling me to go back to sleep when i am experiencing my insomnia.  go seek therapy, don't do the bad thing.  or just skirting around it all.  i feel as if i get criticized for not checking in with them, but get told that i should have reached out if i was in such trouble.  i mean...at some point you get fed up of reaching out, even for casual chat.  

so in a world where i don't feel comforted, why should i be upset that my friends don't really speak to me until i speak out?  that i don't get checked in on?  i think no matter what i think or say or feel in this life, i am expected to live anyway.  so, i may as well be silent.  i may as well keep it to myself.  happy life or not, pain or not, suffering or not, disconnection or not, as long as i live that long life, whatever.  fuck it.  

i'm just tired of doing the life thing.  good or bad experiences, neither have made me think it's been worth it.    nothing i have now makes me think it will be if i stick around.  nothing in me can even imagine a better world for me.  to be honest, i don't even care about having one anymore.

A weird hunger,"so i’m 41, just started a good job, still live with my mom so i can pay off student loan debt and save and i’m quite lonely.

yesterday i was driving and just felt like something was “missing.” i still haven’t gotten rid of the feeling and i wonder how long i’ve felt like this:maybe for years… maybe my whole life.

the worst part of this is that being around others doesn’t get rid of the feeling. i wonder if i want a boyfriend. i’m gay and i’ve never had a serious romantic relationship and don’t really have any realistic prospects for probably one major reason: nobody is good enough for me. i want my boyfriend to be perfect-which is ridiculous, because i’m far from it and am not perfect myself. i want him to be this strong example of a strong confident man that always knows just what to say or do to quell my emotional insecurities. 

the main reason for this post is i just long for someone special and don’t know what to do about it. i have a specific craving to be held-maybe even cradled and that’s not going to work because i’m 6’4”. why do i want this and am i the only one here and is this a specific trait that is common among those with bpd. i have some friends, but i don’t think they can meet this “need” of mine. it’s like… i don’t know… it’s like i missed out on something as a child and now i want it.

i realized this a while back, but lately, the feeling has become more pronounced and it’s like the longer i go without it, the intense the craving for it gets. think of it like loneliness but magnified. it’s like a loneliness that can only be quenched by being held and hugged very tightly and told specific things like “you’re deeply loved. you are very important to me. you’re wanted and liked and make a unique and important contribution. all of your efforts are noticed and appreciated. etc etc.” i can’t give this to myself and not just anyone could say this to me: it would have to be someone i respected a great deal and i would have to believe them and that is a very tall order: so tall that i don’t think anyone i know could fulfill this need.

"Attachment, Enmeshment, Control","i have bpd

i've never had much interest in anything other than receiving love. no real hobbies or interests or passions in life. i drank for 25 years(sober one year now)and pretended my way through life using alcohol as a means to cope with the external world and allow myself to socialize in order to find love. the only thing i really care about. i'm just realizing this about myself after reading a similar post here.

during the past year i've formed what is now officially a relationship with a long time friend of mine. she's very understanding and compassionate about my condition and we communicate very well. we always have. everything is healthy on the surface and staying in a healthy dynamic is our number one priority. i couldn't ask for a better more understanding partner.

i've been running into problems though. i'm too attached. i'm insecure in the fact that she's very successful and excels in everything she does, yet i struggle. i feel like if i can't keep up both financial and physically i'll lose her. she assures me that i don't need to feel that way, yet of course i do anyways. there will come a point where i'll have missed too many trips that i couldn't afford, or be unable physically keep up with climbing a mountain on a trip that we have planned. i'm a decade older and my years are showing with some injuries that would make something like that much more challenging dirt me. how many times can those things happen before she gets tired of it and drifts away? before she finds someone else that can do all those things with her?

i've become enmeshed and many things she does effects me in ways they shouldn't. lately when she excitedly tells me about some success at work or cool new thing she bought i get anxiety.  she did something great, and i didn't, and i feel inferior because of it. i compare myself to her constantly and it's not good. she has goals and wants to have money and nice things, and i've spent my entire life finding a way to survive as cheaply as possible. i hardly work at all. i gave up on having a normal job or a career a long time ago as a result of my illness. we've talked about this and she assures me that it doesn't matter and she loves me and accepts me for who i am. i just can't shake the feeling that it's naive of her to think that, and for me to believe it. 

we have a lot of future things planned. i can't really say that i'm passionate about many of them, but i do want to do them in order to enjoy the time together. it takes me right back to receiving love as my number one motivator. i don't care about the activities i just want the love, so i'll do anything in order to get it. it makes me happy to see her happy and that's my number one priority. always putting myself second. 

this is all coming to the surface now because she's moving into my house in a few weeks. i'm so very excited, and yet terrified at the same time. 

after a lifetime of failed toxic relationships i finally find myself in one i've always dreamed of. i never would have thought that i'd want to leave it so i can be alone again and go back to that safe, yet cripplingly lonely space, where i can't effect anyone other than myself. to use the only real control i have to end this relationship in order to avoid the abandonment that i feel will certainly come someday.",1642715036,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-20 21:43:56,1,0,
LDR partner [M36] decided to no longer talk after he couldn't visit me. Any insights?,"tl;dr: guy i'm talking to/casually dating was upset i am bummed he couldn't visit and doesn't want to talk about it/suddenly decided he doesn't want to be involved anymore?

long story:

i travel a lot for a living (roughly 200+ days a year worldwide) and met a wonderful guy during the summer. we live 9 hours apart which for me is no issue as i can easily hop on a plane or drive. he's been struggling a lot since we first met (official borderline diagnosis, not making the same amount of money he used to, sober for a year, moved from norcal to the midwest for a job) and we stopped talking after a month. a few months later i came to his city for work, hit him up and have been close ever since.

i am in therapy for bad anxiety (him for bpd) and work hard to always remain calm and objective when dealing with the emotions of others. most of the time it works, but sometimes it doesn't, and i have a bad anxiety episode - lately it's been very rough following the end of my work contract. i've been doing my best to try and deal with it on my own but i had a really triggering therapy session last wednesday that spiked my abandonment issues.

this guy and i text and call each other constantly - i'd say it's about 50/50 on the attention and effort and i haven't felt unsupported by him: he's always been great at being open with what he's going through. i recently spent 5 days with him at his place and despite the fact he was dealing with a stalker i didn't regret any of my time with him and made sure he knew that and supported him through it. 

it had been a month since we had seen each other (i was on a tour) and the plans to meet up had to be postponed twice. last week i was missing him and he offered to come visit - i was hesitant as i was on my period and didn't want him to feel as though he'd take a trip for nothing (i explained this). eventually i realized i was being silly and told him how much i want him to come because i am happy to simply spend time with him. he waivered on it and ultimately didn't come. last friday he called me extremely stressed out about work and money and said he didn't visit because of money. i've been feeling very anxious and told him i was sad he didn't come but understood and i can always come to him. he made an excuse to get off the phone very quickly which made my anxiety spike through the roof. i texted him to say i was sorry i made him feel uncomfortable, but my anxiety is acting up and i am scared i am going to be foolish for getting my hopes up in seeing him again - especially since we have plans to meet up when i am near his city in a few weeks. i am often the 'backburner' option in relationships, and i am scared to be in that situation again. i explained i am confused because he says he misses me and even was going to visit, but i can't come to him?

this morning i texted again to tell him i'm not upset with him and wanted to talk this out because it's normal for people to have disagreements, but if we want things to be good we need to talk. he texts me back to say we've never discussed being in a relationship (i know this, and i haven't brought it up) but i acted like a spiteful girlfriend not getting her way. he goes on to say that he feels i am setting us up for failure by expecting more from him than he can provide, even though i've been open that i don't want to force anything, and i am even open to relocation if things are good because i don't need to be in my city for my job. he says he knows i'm attached and wants us to be together (yet he's casually mentioned things like 'if we lived together' or 'i want to wake up with you' when i have been more conservative about these statements). he was also mad i suggested he had someone else on the backburner when 'i can't even take care of myself right now'. it's upsetting he thinks i insinuated he's cheating when that thought never crossed my mind.

i've been wanting to talk to him because the things he says makes it sounds like he wants to be together, and i want that too! more than once he's said ""whatever this is we're doing"" when describing us and makes me think we need to talk about what we want from this. does he want me to be the girl that hops on a plane every other weekend to see him because i'll happily do it. or does he want me to be the girl that we hook up when i'm nearby and we send funny memes to each other on occasion? because i can do that too, but i just need to know where i stand on things.

obviously, i'm going to respect his wish to not talk right now (he said this whole thing has been 'very unsettling') because i'm not the type to beg, but man the waiting sucks...i'd rather know if we're ripping this band-aid off and giving it a shot, or if its time to go our separate ways. i know he struggles a lot with disappointing people, and i don't know if this is his way of self-sabotaging because he can't physically be there for me or if this is a bpd episode... i just don't know.

Is lashing out to people and saying things you don’t mean a common trait of BPD?,"tl;dr i (f,26) broke up with my bpd girlfriend (f,26). she said some nasty things to me then begged to take her back. i’m trying to figure out if she lashed out at me because of her bpd?

she has done this to me before a few times in the relationship, said things she hasn’t meant and then took it back.

soon i will be too old for my parents to want to take care of me, they are already growing tired of me and want me gone. i can’t hold a job down and i’m not sure how that will pan out in the future. i’m stuck in my 17 year old mind and when i imagine the next few decades… well, i don’t. i don’t see myself living that long and i’ve somehow not taken my own life yet. that’s because i’ve stayed in codependent relationships, used substances to cope, people have tolerated me for now.

"While we can't overly depend on factors such as people, how can we evaluate the realistic amount of dependence we should have on other life factors?

i feel i've developed a sort of notion that once i start seeing anything— inanimate or animate.. basically any noun, as a potential resource to depend on for any factor (in this case it's depending on my workplace as a place to study effectively), i must evaluate my intent for depending on it and etc.

i perceive my workplace to be a very comforting environment and a sort of aspect of my routine through shifts and my weekly dose of necessary social interaction (customer interaction, workplace small-talk).

2. j has said the r word and used autism as an insult and k is against these terms
3. we went into a smaller groupchat with 6 people in it and i asked k to remove him from the server. k wanted to hear his side of the story and believes it could be a language barrier

5. i left all the groupchats and blocked the entire small groupchat
6. i later heard k had a panic attack from the situation
7. i reached out through one of the small groupchat friends, and apologized to k. i found out that a (who was not in the call during the fight but in the small gc) made a groupchat excluding me
8. the first message in the groupchat, sent by a was ""s is sensitive"", i am s
9. there were messages sent such as ""s holds grudges"", ""s makes everything about herself"", ""s never apologizes"" and ""we can't baby s forever"" 
10. a gave me a present for my birthday and i sent her a thank you message. a sent a screenshot to the chat and said ""she has to say this""
11. i don't the group i don't want to be friends with them anymore because they betrayed my trust and i don't feel comfortable around them
12. a sent me a message to me saying ""i just want to clarify with you that i did not make a groupchat without you to talk shit about you. instead it was to comfort k because she was having a panic attack. none of us talked any shit about you and i understand it probably felt that way, but it was so k would be able to feel better."" and ""please stop making other people feel bad by saying that ur a ""shitty friend"", it's not cool but i understand that u might be insecure about that""

Why do I feel deep incredible Sadness in my chest for no reason.,"i go through phases where i'm so disinterested in my life, partner and the people around me. bored. i feel empty. or just an incredible deep sadness that i can't find the root of. everything feels so forced. it can also feel overwhelming.. the lack of nothing. if that makes sense. i feel so tired all the time when i feel like i get enough sleep. i can recall when it gets really bad my thoughts go to the extreme real quick of hurting myself and just calling it day. 

of course there is the other extreme of feeling like on top of the world or just being more optimistic with the future. although it feels like lately that phase fizzles out more quickly. although therapy has helped a lot. this is still an on going issue i've experienced since high school as far as i can remember. my hair is thinning out, i don't put that much effort in my appearance and when i do i still feel unstatisfied with how i look or feel about myself. i'm just 23 but i feel so old. 

i've always wanted to be like one of those girls with a pretty smile and that was effortlessly pretty. with a pretty face. with a good face structure. an interesting individual. i understand that a lot of the self hate i have for myself is up to myself to work on, but damn it is just hard to get up and make a change. lately i feel like i can't enjoy sex because i think i'm gross to look at, like in my head i  think of how disgusted  i feel with myself then how can my partner possibly enjoy looking at me. i'm too in my head i can't enjoy things. there is never peace and quiet. i'm sorry this is all over the place. i didn't feel like talking to anyone personally about it. i just want an embrace that makes me feel something. cause lately i feel nothing with everything.",1642665531,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-20 07:58:51,1,0,
Are you able to notice when your having a “symptom” of bpd?,"i apologize if my question was weird. let me explain it in kinda a longer ish form. 
so i’m 16. i am not diagnosed with bpd and i would never want to self diagnose. however- my therapist has brought it up before and so has my other therapist i had a while ago lol. my friend has also mentioned that they thought i had bpd. now while doing my research i found that most people with bpd dont know they have it. so i’m curious if this is actually true. let me explain. 
so i myself can tell when my emotions are  going from happy to sad. i know that when i hate my friend i will most likely go back to loving them. i know when i get angry outbursts. and i also know when i get super attached to someone and can’t leave there side. i’m very self aware. 

so to kinda short that, can people with bpd be self aware? are you able to notice when you have a drastic  emotion change, even if you can’t stop it, or notice when you become super attached to someone? 

i really hope my question wasn’t offensive, and if it was i will gladly take this down. i’m trying to do more research for myself and i would never want to offend anyone 🤍",1642663899,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-20 07:31:39,1,0,
i got drunk again smh. not a terrible outcome though.,"i went to work, left my keys in my mail slot like a dummy. i texted my neighbor, who ignored me for hours. meh. i pick up my weed and go to work. 

work was okay. this coworker i’ve had a slight crush on that i’ve been trying to ignore (trying to ignore the crush not her) really likes learning about me. i love our conversations. 

we sit at the bar and have two drinks, and i’m telling her a bit of my story and opening up about having bpd and cptsd, and struggling as an addict smh. it’s nice. i really like talking to her. she told me her boyfriend was struggling with alcoholism. she mentions him on and off, normally positive. because of my bpd tendencies, i try not to talk about my ex because i know where that always leads with crushes, and above all else i feel weird dating anyone rn (i’m in recovery and struggling with my own issues) so i keep my distance with all of that. i pay for her drink then we. go our separate ways 

it’s close to 10 degrees f where i’m at (midwest). thinking i can use the lockbox to get a key to get into the building (my unit has a keypad), it seems it’s not working. so i gotta figure out how to get inside. well if i wasn’t drunk i wouldn’t have been able to do this, but i had to go in the alley, climb the gate onto the first floor back porch so i can get into my apartment. my neighbors never responded. when i went to the lobby and saw my keys, i saw red. i was on a loud tirade playing music saying loudly fuck  them (like as soon as you walk into the unit lobby you saw my keys in the mailbox. i was so mad that my neighbors couldnt even respond pretending they didn’t see it), then blocked their numbers. people always wanna seem nice to me and introduce and seem helpful with the “if you need anything i’m here” but i could’ve been sleeping on the street in near single digit weather because they couldn’t even text me back! ugh. 

i been trying to work on not getting drunk and just moderating. i felt i moderated well in this scenario but if it wasn’t for me being locked out i wouldn’t have split and been all angry smh. i put a lot of blame on myself  but my neighbors are assholes. i could’ve at least gotten a courtesy text. fuckers",1642662832,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-20 07:13:52,1,0,

How to overcome a complete detachment from life?,"i've had mbt, finished a few years ago. i've had every kind of therapy i'm allowed on the nhs, they won't fund anymore for me for a few years now. tried all the meds offered, i do take an antidepressant and meds for my adhd and they help somewhat. my psych is content to keep me on the current doses as they're pretty much the highest you can go.  so i've been discharged, i can only go back for help with meds and i actually don't think i want them changed, because they do help. 

but i feel so detached from life. the pandemic has exacerbated this, i'm forced to study from home this year and it's like i don't exist. i've tried for years to build strong relationships with my few family members, it hasn't worked and only causes me mental pain so i've given up. i have one close friend i see regularly but she's too busy to meet up more, and i see a mentor through my uni because of my disabilities. aside from those 2 people i don't interact with anyone. i go to a sports class that's mostly much older women and no one sticks around to socialise as they're rushing off to deal with their kids. 

it's odd because i wouldn't say i'm depressed or numb in the way i was before. i'm definitely not happy but i don't have s*icidal/sh thoughts, which is great. i never get too emotional one way or the other - never ecstatic and never depressed. i just feel like a ghost, an empty shell. my only goals are things that i need to have - i.e. goal is to get a job, because need money. goal is to have a relationship, because loneliness is dangerous for me. but i have no passion for anything. i've even stopped freaking out about doing badly in exams because i don't care about my degree grade anymore, i just want to pass and leave the uni.",1642662693,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-20 07:11:33,1,0,

about the show on Netflix 'spinning out',"although it's about bipolar, not bpd, it reminded me of some shadows that i needed to look

even though the show was pretty wacky in writing and the characters were really poorly developed it was very engaging and the actors were really good

but besides the flaws, it had important messages and brought me a lot of insights

i'm pretty proud of the fact that i can sense these things and make sense of things now, not cluelessly soaking in everything as is, but to be able to see what's really making sense. i did not had this ability before and that was definitely a big reason why i felt the way i did and suffered

How to talk/calm yourself down?,"hi everyone. looking for some advice on mechanisms you personally found help you talk yourself down. 

for context, i've been dating a guy for just about 6 months. he's the best person that i've ever met...loyal, thoughtful. he understands that i'm a little bit clingy and doesn't make me feel bad at it and attends to my needs. i think we're very suited for eachother, he needs reassurance too, and if there's one thing i'm good at it, it's showing and telling someone i love them 😂

well, we had our first earthquake yesterday (that's what i call it when i freak out.) typing this out makes me feel silly, and i can realize how minor it is now.

we were laying in bed and i tried ...(you know). i had just gotten over covid and it has been awhile lol. he turned over and grabbed his phone and said oh my gosh there are a couple tik tok videos i meant to show you yesterday but i forgot (ps, watching tik tok videos together is not our thing, i don't like the platform and i don't even have an account.)

things i felt in that moment: embarrassed, rejected, stupid, unattractive, and unappealing. 

needless to say...i shut down. and i mean down. i couldn't even speak, i started tearing up. he noticed i was upset, but he claims he thought i was kidding. i rolled over and after about 10 minutes he asked if ""i was done yet"". which hurt even more. 

he got up to shower after he said this ""is exactly how he wanted to start the day"" (sarcastically, ofcourse), and i got up to make his bed. when he came in the room, i said i was going to go home. 

he started to panic, told me no. said all of these sweet things to try to convince me to stay.

to summarize, when i cooled down a little bit from the fight, which was bad, i told him i have a lot of issues and i don't want to put him through that anymore (not great).

he started to cry, he was so upset. 

anyways, i guess my question is ...what could i have done, said, thought in that first moment of feeling rejected to prevent all of the above from escalating? any tips? i'm afraid this fight is going to cause him to leave me. this is a pattern of behaviour for me and it ends the same every time.",1641830147,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-10 15:55:47,1,0,

"Is there anyone with this disorder that eventually just stopped feeling things and now all the time(or most of it) feels empty, detached, numb, dead inside and bored, is that something that can happen to people with bpd? Also if you can share what has helped you with feelings of emptiness","like all of you i used to be extremely sensitive and feel everything deeply, i myself perfectly fit into quiet type of bpd where i would never show my emotions to the outside world, but on the inside i was always suffering a lot and especially in the months leading up to beggining of emptiness i felt that i was falling apart inside and i was feeling so much pain and loneliness all the time that i felt that i couldn't take it anymore and although i would never kill myself because of my familly i used to just pray for death for days on end, i just couldn't live with what i was feeling anymore. 

then after a couple of months like that everything sort of turned off, i didn't feel that all consuming pain anymore and although that might sound like a good thing it's not, it's actually somehow even worse and i would now gladly go back to those times when i was extremly suicidal and crying and having mental breakdowns all the time. now instead of that i'm just bored all the time and it's like there is nothing that can get me out of that boredom, sometimes i just feel numb and other times i can physically feel that gaping void inside of me where my emotions used to be and i find living like that really unbearable, i don't even feel alive, i don't feel like i'm a person. i also feel very detached from other people. and because i'm bored and empty all the time i impulsively try to fill that emptiness with binge eating and/or restricting food, sometimes alcohol and cutting just to try to feel something, just to feel alive. i even started thinking about trying some hard drugs just to get out of my emptiness. 

i know that chronic feelings of emptiness and dissociation are symptoms of bpd, but i don't know how long does this last for you guys, because i read that dissociation happens in times of stress in bpd but it's been like this for me for over three years already. also i find that sometimes i can still get triggered by something that someone says or does to me and then i can feel pain and it can be quite intense, but when that episode ends i just go back to feeling empty. but emotion that i find is the easiest to surface for me now is actually anger (i don't know why is that, as myself as quiet borderline never used to feel anger towards other people even when i should have), so now when it happens that something makes me angry i latch onto it like it's the only thing that exists and in those moments it's like i even want and in some really fucked up way ""enjoy"" having arguments and fights with people because it makes me feel alive for a little while.

so my question is, can and does it happen for some people with bpd that used to have extreme emotions and reactions to actually become someone who mostly feels empty and detached and doesn't enjoy and want to do anything and if you found anything that helps with that, since all of my coping mechanisms for it are not healthy and only help in short term.",1641829545,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-10 15:45:45,1,0,

Talking about BPD with your teenage kids?,"hi bpd community, 

tl;dr - any resources to help out a ma with bpd have a frank conversation with her teenage kiddo?

as the title may imply, but, to stick with my genuine spirit, i'll just jump right in.  i'm seeking some advice from you all as you all are either currently teenagers, have been teenagers, are actively parenting teenagers, or have parented a teenager before.  

i have a great squad of kiddos, i really, really do.   on saturday night, we were driving home from dinner when my youngest (11 year old son) interrupted my 14 year old daughter, who was telling a story to our 15 year old son.  our daughter became upset with our son and curtly requested that he shut up.  i immediately and swiftly came to his defense and called our daughter a bully.  i'm very ashamed of my behavior.  

my daughter has been very upset with me and also last night after dinner, i heard her ask my husband if i was okay.  this is all cuing me into it's time to really start having more intentional conversations around my bpd symptoms with my daughter, so that, for example, if i need to dismiss myself, out of the blue, to get myself together, it's not because of her/personal, it's because i'm having a really shitting fucking abnormal response to something in my environment?  

do you guys have any articles or advice or books or anything specific to speaking about your bpd to your teenager?  i want to have open, honest conversation with my daughter.  all of my kids.  i believe in appropriately-aged content, of course, but i do not believe in burying heads in the sand.  i think that might be how i developed some of my bpd traits to begin with - thanks, mom and dad!! fuck you!!!!  (attachment theory is really interesting - you should check it out!!)

anyways, tia!!

The harsh recoil of excitement... yay :/,"i already have a hard time making and keeping friends for various reasons, but it's even harder to think you're a friend to then be in the discard pile. i'd been wondering for a while about getting a pc, and a friend offered to get me a really really nice one. i got hella excited, as i'd be able to play more games with some nice friends i felt i had at the time. long story short, my friend had to back out of buying me a pc, but i still wanted one largely in part to play with those friends. having already gotten some of the equipment, i decided already in the back of my mind that i'd just get my own pc if my one friend backed out. which of course he did, i just reeeaaallly was hoping he wouldn't.  thus, i have a still really nice pc a little over $2k instead of a $4k one (which i honestly didn't even need). 

but anyway... shortly after getting the pc both friends i wanted to play with essentially stopped talking to me. when i say my excitement was killed... man... i already overthink as is. i know people come and go, i shouldn't have gotten excited, and blah blah freaking blah. 

still, it hurts. it makes me cry and feel sick all the time. another silly delusion and exciting thought shattered. from super excited to play together all the time back to dry dms and long boring sad days alone. i don't even feel like using the damn pc a sizable chunk of the time. i'm really glad i have it but looking at it or using it can feel hollow or saddening. it's an excellent holiday present to myself. it runs super well all around. fps is divine. graphics are insane. but i bought it largely in part for an emotional reason that fell apart. as an overly emotional person, it hurts a ton.

even as a child my ""love language"" if you can call it that, was just playing video games with people i like. my overthinking brings me back to questioning what a friend even is, if i was ever one to them, if i'll ever really be one to someone, and the list goes on. i feel obnoxious, disliked, hated, and worthless. i still want to play with someone, but part of me is forever hesitant because it's beyond tiring to cycle through these emotions, always obsessing about the people that leave as my brain severely struggles to both comprehend and accept a sudden loss of connection. even for legitimate reasons, it's always painful when someone goes from a close friend to just someone you see online, then seeing them online is a sad avalanche of emotion in itself. from nearly every day to nothing. from laughs and comfort back to the deafening silence. i miss every close friend i felt i had. every person i woke up and felt excited to talk to or play with. but logically i know they most likely rarely even think of me and it's difficult to try making new friends.",1641814761,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-10 11:39:21,1,0,
Blowing money after quitting Zoloft…and blowing up,"i have had a chaotic last few months. the person i was with for 10 years lied to my face for months and gaslit me. i spiraled and was suicidal to the point of making the plan, but he called around to my family to shame me so he could try to shove me off on someone else so he could go out and party. i ended up quitting my dream job and moving back to the south with toxic family. before i found out he had been lying and probably cheating, i was stable enough for so long to no longer be considered diagnosable. my doctor put me on zoloft, which helped soooooo much, but i can’t take nsaids for my inflammation on it and the pain got to be too much, so i weaned off of it when i felt stable. since doing so, i’ve spent probably over $1000 (that i don’t have and put me over my credit cards limit) on random projects i dreamt up and have been exploding at my irritating family versus just brushing it off. i feel so out of control, and i know a lot of the emotions are still coming from the broken relationship with my ex. he still texts me how much he misses me even though i told him not to and he has no intention of being with me. it just hurts over and over, but i can’t block him because he kept my cat and used the remaking lease as a weapon so i couldn’t take her,and i hate myself for not going further in debt to bring her with me.

Quick Vent/rant,"i'm hanging out at a ski resort with some friends rn. i was hoping for some really fun times and happy memories! one of my friends here i have a big crush on, and i was also stoked to spend time with her!

here i am now, lying awake on the first night, because another one of my friends is in the same bed as her, and he's been very into her too. 

my brain hasn't stopped with all the intrusive thoughts... it's keeping me awake. things like this trigger my bpd badly, and i'm worried that this will affect my experience here.

a lot of things i do actually want to think about are racing through my head. the most important one being talking to one of them. sounds weird, but i just want to ask them to keep it chill until i'm gone. not too much of an ask. better than bottling it up. i also understand that it's their business and i will keep things as brief as possible in this conversation with one of them. i feel more closer to my crush, and feel more comfortable talking to her, but the guy might be better because it would be way less awkward. i'll figure that out in the morning.

another thought is potentially leaving early because this affects my emotional health very adversely. i'm very close to this friend group. they're well aware of my bpd and as well how emotionally volatile i can be. they would understand.

some other ones of note include reinventing myself. i've been a little too vocal about my bpd, basically i've become my disorder. people associate bpd with me. it doesn't come off very attractive at all. perhaps rework how i view relationships, i feel like my self esteem is low enough, not to the point where i don't feel worthy or ready for a relationship,  but where i come off as needy and clingy to my partner.

Hate him.,"my fp is my ex. (love it when that happens)

we broke up multiple times because of my fluctuating moods until he finally had it and we broke up for good.

two months later, we're at a party. still friends, because we agreed on staying friends. he gets drunk and proceeds to tell me he how much he still loves me and how he hated that he couldn't be mature enough to understand and take care of me etcetera etcetera. i leave the room at the indication of a friend, get into the bathroom, grab the nearest unused razor and proceed to s/h. i knew that those drunk words meant nothing because he would never take me back anyway. 

anyway,  2 months pass (again). we fight multiple times, he sometimes tells me that he doesn't want to be friends with me anymore and sometimes tells me to talk to him more and that he still cares about me a lot (wondering who the bpd is here lmao) and my entire mood is based on that.

now into the equation comes this girl. i don't know if y'all saw encanto, but she's basically isabela madrigal. the perfect golden child: she's beautiful, smart, international dance champion,  fit and kind - everything. every guy who sees her has a crush on her. my ex had a crush on her before we got together as well. she sits in front of him in most classes and they flirt constantly. 
she's in our friend group too and has been for a while. his former (?) crush on her has always been an insecurity of mine (her entire existence actually lmao) because she's so much better than me in every way possible. i ended up being mad at him very often because i was convinced he still liked her even when we were together 

back to our story,  my fp told me he still cares about me a lot and he's not over me, but that he doesn't want a relationship.  i respect his choice, obviously,  but that's not why i'm mad. he tells me he loves me when he clearly has a crush on that bitch. the audacity of this man to keep me hanging when he knows what i'm like even though he clearly likes her. he probably liked her when we were together too.

i don't know what to do. i hate him so much right now i could burn his house down. last time i printed our pics just to set them on fire in the bathtub but i feel like i need to do more this time. i'm just so frustrated. i know that a different fp will probably come with time and i won't care as much but right now it's all i can think about.

Splitting,"oh man, i just want to start off saying that this doesn’t apply to everyone with bpd, but to anyone that hasn’t developed “whole object relations”, which is a precursor to many personality disorders, such as bpd, npd, schizoid, and avoidant to name a few.

now from being more self aware as a psych student, i know that i failed to reach a developmental milestone when i was six months old, so i can’t perceive the good and bad parts of a person i hold dear together. so that not only impacts how i perceive them, but how think of them and how i behave towards them as well if i’m not really watching it.

No idea what to do anymore,"i can't tell anymore if my reaction to finding out people are expecting is a side effect of my bpd anymore or what it is. 

i'm sitting her in my lounge room basically bawling my eyes out because another person i know is expecting. i can't be happy for her as she is a lacklustre person, and i don't see her care about her current child. she's also not a very nice person. i know i should be happy for her as she is my partners best friends partner but i honestly dislike her as does my partner. 

i have wanted children since i was little. my partner and i have been together 8 years and have been trying to have kids. i suffer from endometosis and the doctors at the hospital have stated that it's probably due to this i can't fall pregnant. they refused a second operation on me when i was hospitalised for 3 months due to it, claiming it can't make you that sick, yet it was the only thing showing up on all my tests. i can barely walk anymore due to oa in my right hip from an accident when i was 12 and need hip replacement which i have been holding off on until i can have kids. 

my only option is ivf and i don't have have 10k + just sitting around to be able to go through with it as my partner currently foesnt have a job and i'm already struggling financially. 

the only person who i've been legitimately excited and happy to hear was expecting was my best friend. when she miscarried the first time in time i knew her, i cried with her and for her and when i found out she was expecting again i was overjoyed for her. i think it's because she's best friend and has supported me with my struggles. but when it comes to everyone else i just curl up and crying. 

i just want to be normal in that regard. i just want to have my own family and the older i get the more i realise it just won't happen and i'm not sure how long i can take it anymore. my partner is doing everything he can to help me and overcome it but i can't help but feel i've let him down so badly.

I Made a Decision Almost a Year Ago... Not Sure How I Feel About It Anymore,"i have both quiet bpd and asd. both of those things interfere with my ability to socialize by a lot. that tied with just bad luck.

a few years ago, i realized that i have bad luck with people. most of the people i've been with used me, ghosted me or abandoned me in some shape or form, or just flat out treated me like shit. only a few of those people have been gems, but even those have hardly lasted. if its not either of us, its a third party circumstance.

i've had a handful of fps over the course of my life, and that has fucked me over in various ways. i have many stories related to that.

when i transferred to my university in january 2020, it seemed like i was making progress socially except when just when things were going well, covid hit and i had to say goodbye to my friends who decided to go home to their families. 

the pandemic made my already awkward enough social skills regress. its harder to socialize even if i try. the only person i can truly socialize with is my girlfriend who is also my fp and also borderline (we actually have a healthy relationship since we both have strong boundaries and communicate well). i have a fwb that i hang out with once in a while (we are open/poly) and my friend from class that i study with sometimes.

i made an attempt to get myself out there and meet people last year using tinder and facebook. but that repeatedly resulted in either getting stood up, terrible hookup, or getting used for something like my money. i always ended up feeling like shit afterwards. i feel alienated enough with my mental illnesses and each time i try to fix that by socializing only to feel alienated once more. 

i got tired of repeatedly having shit experiences. so i made a decision to permanently stop meeting new people and making friends. i don't go on dates anymore other than my partner and i only talk to those few that i know once in a while. 

the downside as of 2022 is that i feel more isolated which doesn't help my mental health. i turn 24 this year so i feel like my window in socializing as passed anyway. my social skills have regressed further more to where i can barely look at a cashier. i freeze up in all social situations now. i made a post talking about my experience being with my girlfriend and her friends where i shut down basically. i feel paranoid all the time and can't trust anyone other than my girlfriend. i assume people just want me for my body or money.

it may become more problematic now. my girlfriend has been inviting me to hangout with her and her couple of friends who i have actually hung out with before i met her. but i had arrangements to hang out with them a year ago where they canceled on me at the very last second at the time of all my social fallouts leading up to my ""decision"" so i just split on them since. my girlfriend happened to be friends with them later and told them that i was hurt and they both sent me a message apologizing and wanting to make it up to me and inviting me to hang out. and while i appreciate it, i can't get out of my ""split"" head space. 

essentially, one part of my brain is like ""hang out with them. you need it after being isolated for so long"" but the other part of my brain says ""don't do it! you will get hurt again. you always do. don't trust anyone!"" so on one hand i feel like i'm missing out but on the other, my social phobia has gotten so bad and the whole point of overcoming it is to see that it won't hurt you but i get hurt when i try. thats why i gave up on everyone. since i am so indecisive, i've left those friends hanging.

i just don't know what to do anymore. i made my decision so that i wouldn't be hurt again and having my time wasted, but i hate feeling like some feral animal who can't socialize for shit. i'm tired of having such shit luck too and i don't know how to change that.

"You are not overreacting, you are not too sensitive, you are not crazy. You are emotionally reacting appropriately to an extreme belief you have.","one of the things that helped me to not see yourself as a overly sensitive person or emotionally explosive, your brain jumps to an extreme conclusion which your emotions are appropriately reacting to. 

sure someone not replying to you doesn't warrant an extreme reaction, but is your emotions reacting to that directly or to something else you believe?

even for a neurotypical person, believing someone will abandon them and that person now hates them will justify a very upsetting emotion. their brain just doesn't jump to that conclusion a lot. 

instead of going, ""oh im just a borderline, i have no skin or shield for anything like they told me""

say to yourself
""my emotions are rational and true, what beliefs am i telling them that they are reacting to extremely?""

""they didn't reply to me, why am i so upset??? i'm so mentally damaged and toxic""
vs.

""they didn't reply to me, now i believe they hate me, so my emotions are reacting to that belief, so of course its why i feel extremely panicky right now""

think about it, if you truly believe your friend hates you, then of course your emotions are upset and they are reacting rationally to that thought. they're not being sensitive, your emotions are in the right because they believe that your friend hates you is true. 

most of the time i would go ""god i cant believe im reacting this way! it was a tiny thing! stop feeling so upset! nothing happened!!"" which never helped i felt more anger and broken inside 

but now i would go "" oh dear for some reason i got really upset over that, but i know i wouldn't get upset over just that, let me see, when that certain thing happened, i started to believe that they would hate me if i did something i wanted to do and that they would leave, oh course i am upset, its because i think that's true, i'm not over reacting, i am reacting rationally to this belief""

i come to realize that bpd is not having extreme emotions but more accurately, we are having extreme beliefs that lead to extreme emotions. it's easier to control our beliefs than fight with our emotions. learn to love and embrace what the world seems to call your weakness because turns out -- it might not even be your weakness but something that wants to help you all along.

tldr:
let your emotions exist freely and try to manage your beliefs instead of trying to directly control or battle your emotions

How to distinguish?,"in my last post i talked bout my relationship and how we had several stupid but bad fights a few weeks ago. we talked them through and my spouse has been really nice to me since them. not counting some minor reactions that made me sigh and just ignore him for a few minutes, anyway.

for the last maybe fiveish days i've bee struggling inside. so i still love him? or more like, yes, i still love him, but i don't like him. his smile has always been my sun even in the darkest hours, and now i don't feel it. i'm in my ovulation period, when i'm usually all head over heels for him (even when depressed, it's always my one week of feeling like a human), and now there's nothing, not even the cozy, safe and warm feeling that comes after making love. i smile at him, when he tells me he loves me and tell it back, but it feels empty. i don't engage in conversations nor want to tell him things. i've tried to cuddle, but they lack the closeness, too.

so, is this the beginning of an end (which i don't want it to be) or just my bpd making me numb as a defence mechanism after a way too hard of a week?",1641763681,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-09 21:28:01,1,0,

Happy stories or advice for partners with BPD,"hey guys,

i've recently entered a relationship with a girl who has been diagnosed with bpd. she received this diagnosis about, 3 or 4 years ago, and has had quite a lot of therapy and medication (although now ended) for it. i'm a very touchy and needy person (with my own issues i've had/having therapy for) and although she was at first it had lessend a bit. she is however aware this is because of her bpd and her previous trauma, and that sometimes she just doesn't have the energy. we've been dating around 3 months long distance, but that first month, i was at her place literally constantly, so again i don't blame her at all for backing off and needing space.

aaanyway, since i've known about her diagnosis i have done a lot of research as i wish to help support her in whatever way i can. there are an awful lot of seemingly anecdotal bad experiences people have had thru bpd relationships, and even soke articles with the language used is almost derogatory when trying to offer advice. i'm very interested to hear the good experiences people have had, as i don't think enough exists, or perhaps some advice.

Tensions with condescending housemate making me feel more unstable,"i live in a house with 4 other people, one of which is a very christian guy. i've had a few tensions with him, mostly due to being cooped up over lock downs. there was some things he said and did that just really got to me, so i talked to him about it and it hasn't been an issue since.
now... i'm starting to have issues with him. i thought it was just in my head, and that i was probably just being a bit unstable and too sensitive, but one of our other housemates pointed out that the way he talked to me was just not okay.
generally he seems very judgy of me. i've slept around a lot (mostly as a coping mechanism and selfharm, but it's good stories. i refuse to feel guilty and bad about it, because that would just make me spiral) and i do tend to go out and drink quite a bit. he on the other hand, is no sex before marriage and no alcohol, which i respect.
i'm generally trying my best to be respectful of him and how he has decided to live his life. but he looks at me annoyed if i'm about to go out or if i talk about someone i hooked up with.
he just got a girlfriend and were all so happy and excited for him. i've been trying to have conversations with her too and make friends with her, so she feels more welcome in the house, and he just looks a bit annoyed whenever i do.
i started seeing someone as well, and it's going really good. i've made so much progress with myself over the past few months, and this feels like one of the easiest and healthiest things i've ever done. but if i talk about the guy, my housemate just looks annoyed. when i told my housemate about the guy, he didn't even say anything. just looked at me like he couldn't care less. i'm fairly sure that he thinks i'm incapable of anything other than hook ups.

the other day we were talking about something, and the word glacier came up. he pronounced it in british, and i said that sounded wrong to me, because i've never heard it pronounced like the before (i'm not british). that's not an unusual conversation in our house, and it's usually not an issue. but he went off at me, and incredibly condesendingly said ""that's not how we say it in this country. i study it, so i actually know what i'm talking about"".
i felt so bad. i've never felt so alienated. it's not my fault that they pronounced glacier different in the first english speaking country i lived in, or that that pronunciation is closer to how we say it in my native language.

he quite often acts like a know it all, and will just jump into conversations to give his opinion. usually just to point out that someone else (usually me) is wrong. even with his girlfriend (she's also not from the uk), he always seems to be teaching her stuff. not in a bad way, but his tone is just always kind of talking down to her. 

even tonight i was making some traditional food from my country. it doesn't have a name in english, so i translate it to a rice pudding or porridge but also not quite that. he corrected me and said it was more like a porridge. i asked the difference, he explained it and i told him it doesn't fit the description of a porridge because that's not what it is. and he still corrected me. he doesn't even know what it is??

i'm so mad and frustrated. i know i should just be an adult and be the bigger person and talk to him about it and say its bugging me. but i also know hell just say ""yeah that fine"" and then it'll just create more tension. i would much rather just be the perfect housemate and be nice and polite to a point where he looks like an asshole to everyone else. i'm so pretty and i would probably even try to get him to be more of an asshole, just because.
i'm genuinely struggling to not try and downplay it and say its just in my head or because i'm being sensitive, or because my emotions are a bit extreme. he's always just really subtly condescending and he acts like he's better than everyone else. he acts like he has some moral high ground over me and it upsets me. ive had to deal with a lot of shit and sleeping around and drinking is probably one of the few things that got me through it. i'm not proud of it, but he's making me feel so bad about a already dark part of my life. he's been making me so upset recently, that i've just been crying in my room trying not to selfharm. and he has also seemed quite judging in the past when i have selfharm, and he's acted like i just did it to get attention, which isn't the case. i'm so proud of myself for not giving in, but it's taking so much of my energy to constantly try and not selfharm. 
but i just don't know what to do about it, so i think i might just try to avoid him for a few days",1641758137,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-09 19:55:37,1,0,
Anxiety About Spring Semester,"anxiety about spring semester

tldr: i’m having panic attacks about taking classes in person. 

i’ve had severe anxiety my whole life and have also struggled with depression and borderline personality disorder which makes my anxiety and my emotions even more overwhelming. it got so bad that throughout all of highschool i switched to an online school because i would have panic attacks and stomach aches every school morning that would prevent me from attending. 

it took me a few years after graduating to realize i wanted to go to college and by then i had worked with my anxiety a little more and was able to accomplish things i never saw myself doing. i started my education at a community college and took my first semester of classes in person and rarely had anxiety going to class.

my second semester of classes i took on campus as well and rarely struggled with anxiety either. halfway through the semester is when covid started to hit and everything was shutting down so all of my classes switched to lectures through zoom.

after that i finished the rest of my associate’s degree by taking classes online.

i just started at a university last fall semester to work on getting my bachelor’s degree. my first semester of classes i was able to take online as well.

my spring semester starts tomorrow and all of my classes are in person. i’ve been having panic attacks about it and feeling overwhelmed for a couple weeks now but it’s caused me to fall into a bad depressive episode this week where i’ve barely wanted to or have had the energy to get out of bed. 

what has made it worse is all of my classes are 4-5 credit classes and there is a lot of work involved and i’ve already freaked myself out reading the syllabus for each course. i also work part time every day i have class and i am stressing about finding time to do my assignments. 

i’m also not much of a morning person and will have to wake up early for class which is impacting my anxiety as well.

does anyone have any words of comfort or advice that could help me get through my spring semester?",1641757045,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-09 19:37:25,1,0,

Anger outburst after months without one,"using some new skills and a lot of hard work i have been keeping my anger to a very quiet rumble until today and i am feeling ashamed of myself. i am also feeling grateful that i was able to eventually remember the tools i have and reel myself back in. i am also very grateful to have someone on my side, even though he is still learning much about me and how my brain works. story time because i need to vent.

i had to work and since it is a sunday i decided to drive my truck. i rarely drive it because the gas mileage isn't great and i work further away than my husband. it is a nicer vehicle than the one i drive so it is kind of a 'treat' for me to drive it. one bit of contention between my husband and i is how he keeps the truck: very very messy. it drives me crazy, but i have let that go and decided it is a battle i will no longer pick. well i am on my way home and notice a tarp fly halfway out of the bed of my truck!! i pulled over immediately to secure it (i thought the bed was empty, i certainly couldn't see anything in it when i left) well there is a ton of garbage and other stuff up against the back window of the bed. i am sure some other things have flown out that i didn't notice. i am horrified, i start to imagine what could have happened. my mind starts racing and anger takes over. i am no longer in control of the ship. i sent him a few angry foul texts and continued home. luckily for me and everyone involved he isn't home. this gives me a chance to check myself (after screaming out loud to my empty house how i almost killed someone and why is my husband so careless!- only much more r rated of course) 

i first had to remember to breathe. then to assess. what happened? who was hurt? is this anger justified? is this anger reasonable? is the level of anger appropriate? and then i started some mindfulness exercises. it was not easy. my mind kept looping. so i start over again. and again. and again. and then i get through it. and i am breathing. and i can't believe it, but i think i am me again. i am thinking clearly. i am present. i am back at the helm.

then comes the shame. the embarrassment. how did i let myself do that again? i lost it again. why am i still so messed up? that i have to swallow. that i have yet to be given tools for. so i am here on reddit admitting to it all. my shame and embarrassment from this ridiculous outburst. it is a part of who i am and a part of my learning process. i really hope one day these will be only distant memories but for now they are part of this work in progress that is me. my emotions may try to hijack me; and sometimes they win, but i am so over being afraid and ashamed of them.",1641755919,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-09 19:18:39,1,0,

Do these sound like bpd symptoms?,"my first post here. 

to give you the rundown i have been feeling empty and depressed since i was around 11 years old. going through some phases of being completely manic and out of my mind followed by months of procrastination, suicidal ideation and self harm. i sought help for this from camhs during lockdown as my episodes seem to just prolong and am now awaiting a diagnosis for ocd and bipolar 2.

the younger one, was a lovely person. bpd definitely showed up in her behaviour sometimes (e.g. intense emotional reactions), self-harm, and she did technically cheat (although, our relationship was in an unstable place at the time as she would have to leave the country). but, overall, we had a decent, respectful dynamic and remain on good terms. she didn’t demean or gaslight me, didn’t lash out at me, was in therapy and very open about her diagnosis and treated me well overall. 

my current gf is a lovely person too but the way her bpd shows up is was harder to deal with. she lashes out at me for innocuous reasons (e.g. trying to console her when she’s down), she projects a shitload on me (e.g. telling me i’m trying to control her while literally telling me to not to feel certain emotions), demeans me (called me childish and irrational for wanting to see her), is super-paranoid (doesn’t want  me to hang out with friends), and in between all of it (when she’s calm) tells me i’m the most amazing person she’s ever met and losing me would be the worst thing that could happen to her. 

yesterday, she totally lost it. on thursday, i asked if she could meet up on friday and she said she couldn’t but could do saturday, so i said it’s ok, saturday is only one day away anyway. she took it as a sign i didn’t care (because i shouldn’t have been so chill about having to wait longer to meet her) and got upset. when i insisted that i couldn’t understand what i’d done wrong (you’ll have to take my word on this, i didn’t raise my voice or become agitated), she went into a rage. shaking, crying, screaming. then she threatened to self-harm and blamed it on me. she completely dominated my feelings out of the situation. when she calmed down, she started telling me how amazing i was and asking whether i would leave her. i said i’m too emotionally overwhelmed to have that discussion and i need to process my feelings. she became fiery again. apparently i was about to abandon her. she wants to date only someone who won’t abandon her. i took my leave (from her flat) at that point. 

truth is, i am feeling 90% like leaving her. the first 3 months of our relationship were amazing—intense, super-rare connection. then, as soon as i asked her to officially be my girlfriend, the extreme behaviour started. i believe she’s trying hard. she’s starting therapy (and was doing it for like a year in 2020 but stopped because she thought she was cured). now she wants to do emdr. yesterday, she actually uttered the words, “why am i like this?” while sobbing into my chest. it broke my heart. but i was also angry because of the way she was treating me. 

i care about her a lot and i think she is trying to battle her illness. but i feel like i can’t trust her. when she switches, it’s scary. it truly is like two different people. i feel like she could attack me without regard, emotionally (which she has done) and physically. she’s worried about being cheated on but, at this point, i’m worried she is cheating on me or could in the future (when i inevitably displease her). she once lied to me about going to a gig with her friend, then slipped up later and accidentally mentioned that she actually went with 5 guys. i didn’t draw attention to it but logged it in my mind. she constantly distorts past conversations and events, and just moves on when evidence to the contrary is presented. she’s obsessed with asserting that she’s “not a bad person” after her episodes, and uses that as a way to dismiss my hurt and concerns (e.g. “you keep holding me to these impossible standards and judging me, but i know i’m not a bad person”). i told her the only standard i’ve asked of her is to not demean or lash out at me. 

yesterday, she sent me a text to try and get me to stay. i truly care for her. but i’ve read other stories and i’m scared shitless—because the timelines for 90% of the horror stories match mine to a t so far. i have a strong emotional urge to give her a chance but my logical brain is telling me to run for my life. why put myself through this? on her word, when she’s calm, that she thinks i’m the best thing since sliced bread—even though she treats me like trash when she’s angry?

so i have two questions, if anyone can help:

1. what does it take to make a relationship with a pwbpd work (aside from the foundational things any relationship needs)? i need to honestly assess whether i can provide these. 
2. what are the signs that a pwbpd is absolutely not ready to be in a relationship?

i’d, in particular, appreciate views from people with bpd who have been able to reduce their symptoms to a sub-clinical level and maintain a healthy relationship (whatever that means). 

i’m not faultless. i tend to shutdown when i’m emotionally overwhelmed and that drives her crazy. i’m working on it but i feel like what she throws my way is a whole other kettle of fish. i look forward to the responses. thank you.",1641742146,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-09 15:29:06,1,0,

He threatens to breakup because i want to have alone time,"my partner and i hang out  24/7, we rarely have any time apart. usually i get really lonely and stuff when im alone, and he is very dependant on me so he hates it aswell. 

this weekend we were apart, i got some alone time to get back to gaming and he went out partying with his buds. usually i freak out and start a fight, but this weekend i was very content and kept myself busy. ive had a nice time being alone so it feels like im getting better. 

today he spams be about missing me and such, i tell him i miss him too and that i love him. i also say that ive had a pretty nice weekend and that ive been enjoying my alone time. somehow he takes this as a sign that i dont love him and that i dont miss him. 

he starts freaking out on me for wanting another day by myself. and says that we are done multiple times. its not the first time he lashes out and says we are done. i try to explain everything but he is still freaking out and calling me names. 

he then proceeds to blame it on my bpd. he says that im having an episode and that he knows me so he knows what will happen. he says that if i dont hang out with him soon i will have a mental breakdown and lash out on him. like im the problem here?

i feel just fine. ive just been having a nice time this weekend and i wanted another day for myself. and he reacts this way? this cant be good. 

i know it sounds so dumb, but when he tells me that stuff it makes me question myself. what if he is right? what if i will have a mental breakdown soon because of this? he makes me question my own judgement and yeah. now im here. trying to explain, i need some second opinion.

After DBT,"18f with 18m

after dbt, i trust my partner a whole lot more and feel a lot less bothered about them leaving me and finding someone else. it is long distance/online so i really struggle to feel any emotion/attraction while we are just texting/calling and i get tired of it sometimes. but when we are in person and there is a lot of physical affection/just being around that person, i feel a lot better and the worry goes away. i'm struggling to feel as ""in love"" as i used to feel but they still feel that way for me and i feel so guilty.

could this be because of the dbt helping me or is it my bpd making me feel empty? i've also realised that most of my crushes on guys have been due to comphet, but this one felt real and genuine, even while online. but recently i've noticed that i cant feel anything while online and i feel everything when were in person.

"I’m feeling at my lowest again, possible TW.","i suspected i had bpd for a while (23, f), i suspect my mum also has it because she is exactly like me and struggles really badly with her mental health but is in denial about it. it’s taken me over 6 years to be diagnosed, finally got diagnosed in september of last year.

i really hate this illness, i really do hate it. i don’t know how to cope with it. my life is a total sh!t show and has been for years. i’ve had years and years of trauma from different people, i got abandoned and treated like dirt by my own mother (she has always been interested in herself and herself only), friends and other family members. i really feel like i have nobody, absolutely nobody because nobody understands. they claim they know what bpd is but whenever i show symptoms everyone just responds with the same old thing “don’t let that upset you” or “you’re being over dramatic, it’s not hard to calm down.” i’ve even had family members tell me that all i do is cause chaos and that i’m attention seeking. 

i’m at my lowest right now and i’m seriously struggling. i barely have any friends who i can talk to when i’m at my lowest. my partner of two years (23, m)  is great but he just doesn’t understand how much of a struggle daily life has become for me, he’s lucky because he doesn’t struggle with any mental health issues. i try and talk to him but i shut down or get so annoyed because he doesn’t get it. 

i cannot work because of my mental illnesses, i’ve tried to work in the past and it didn’t work out for me, i was having panic attacks constantly, trauma flashbacks and a lot of stress - so i’m on disability benefits right now, due to this i live with his family, who i love and adore, because i can’t afford my own place at this moment in time but i feel like i’m in a prison living here. they don’t understand bpd either. if i try and talk to them they just tell me to cheer up or make it all about them. some members of his family talk down on me and are so horrible towards me, it’s made my anxiety so bad, i will refuse to leave our bedroom when they come over. i can’t stand up for myself and i would truly love to be able to do that but i just can’t. i go into emotional shut down. 

when i’m in a bad episode i can’t even talk to my parents, my mum tells me constantly to get back into work because it will make me feel better but i’ve told her countless of times, right now isn’t the best time to be working but she’ll make me feel worthless for being ill. if i get upset to her over the phone, she would just tell me to grow up and tell me she’s not interested and put the phone down. my dad is the same, he doesn’t understand bpd. he thinks i’m out causing drama and he has told me, my bpd is stressful to deal with.

You don’t have to be a star baby…To be in my show!,"i’m really feeling contemplative about the issue of identity. someone with bpd i’m coming admire kind of seems to support the corroborated idea about bpd’ers leeching their personality and identity from others (paraphrasing). 

anyhow, now i find myself challenging myself in regards to identity. i have a few ideas: i think the idea that we don’t have authentic-identity is extreme navel-gazing. typical people don’t much consider this topic, and maybe we shouldn’t either? every time you meet someone you like and admire it’s natural to fall in-like with their preferences. sometimes it’s just a matter of exposure no? you meet someone let’s say who likes country music and line dancing 😬 you might be a hip hop enthusiast; however, they take you to a country bar. maybe you meet some nice folks, you have fun learning the dance moves, and now maybe you like country music. this doesn’t mean you’re absorbing their likes in deferment of your own does it? doesn’t getting to know new people automatically expose you to a new array of ideas that tickle our fancy? i think this is completely normal typical behaviour that we seem to think is somehow negative.

identity and personality often get confused. and even in my own rant here, i realize i have used them interchangeably. but there is an overlap often. but i’m curious about the fact that identity is so changeable. sometimes our values move around as we learn, and this isn’t bad. i’m wondering if we have shifts on/in our continuum of life, as one does, and our continued over analysis of self is just too painfully self-important.

i have been diagnosed with bpd and bipolar for 3 years. as of which 3/4 of that was me being depressed and the rest basically just me manic. i’m not new to this lol i’ve tried unaliving myself like 12 times and have been inpatient 11 times, 1 of which was a few month stay in a residential. i’ve had like 30 different therapists. i’ve done dbt. i’ve tried all different types of meds. i’ve had friends at one point. i was active and keeping myself busy. i’ve tried probablt every coping skill. i’ve worked on my relationships with people and i’ve worked on how i view the world. i have experienced practically a lot….

but i’ve never felt like this. never before have i been completely alone. never before have i experienced nobody caring. recently i took 50 benadryl in a very upset state of mind, not thinking, and that was scary as fuck. like i already have psychosis but this shit sent me into a whole different state. i kept getting heat flashes, as of which i would start seeing white and everything would go blurry and when i look around everything moves really fast and blurs together. i was talking to people not even knowing what was being said or what the fuck was happening, yet i had whole ass conversations in detail and idek what it’s about. i started seeing shadow people all around me and seeing shit everywhere and hearing shit. i got scared so i tried to throw up and i did a little but then my mom heard and yelled at me for puking. she then came in my room and saw the bottle of pills and this made her even more mad. now she’s telling me about how stupid and selfish i am and how i ruin everything and i’m dramatic and nobody cares about me. lol this isn’t anything new tho, this is how she talks to me whenever she gets angry, she takes everything out on me and lately i have been way too depressed to even care. i just sit there and either say nothing or ok. but what sucks is that i for some reason have attachment issues with my mom and i just really love her and want to spend time with her always and have a good relationship with her so it’s really upsetting that she doesn’t feel the same way. and what’s even more upsetting is that it’s not just her. for some reason everyone walks all over me. my dad takes his anger out on me.  he has never bought me my basic needs and has kicked me out sooo many times ages 12-15. he treats my step siblings and siblings good. he buys them shit and spends time with them  so when i say something about how much he sucks to my mom my brother always says something about how he doesn’t treat him like that and i’m just lying. um i literally have no friends and i feel like my boyfriend doesn’t like me but i don’t wanna say anything cuz i don’t wanna ruin anything. but literally all u have is my boyfriend and he has no phone and lives an hour away. so i can only talk to him thru his moms phone like once a week for like 30 minutes and i can only see him once a month lol. 

anyways i still feel wack from the benadryl and i really don’t know what’s real or fake anymore and i question everything every second of every day and i really have lost all hope and reason to continue living.

also i overdosed 2 nights ago and rlly didn’t wanna tell my bf cuz i didn’t wanna seem like an attention seeker but i did today and he didn’t say anything. he said he didn’t know what to say lol and that’s it. 

nobody every reaches out.  nobody would notice if i died. all my friends left me. 

lol whatever imma just decompose in my bed who gives a fuck

also i was around like 30 people today and i kept saying stuff and nobody even looked at me. i really feel like a ghost and this isn’t the first time. last time i overdosed i thought i was dead for a month. that’s how i feel rn but 100x worse.

I was never the problem,"i’ve really been struggling with my break-up. it’s been 6 months. almost 7. we were together 4.5 years. we lived together. joined our families and kids together. 

he left me in july. at first i thought we would get back together…honestly i still hope to. but i keep rerunning everything through my head.

why?
why would i want to get back with a man who:

1. cheated on me. he vehemently denies anything physical ever happened, but i saw the texts. even if it wasn’t physical, it was emotions.

2. went back with his ex-wife and broke up with me on and off again for a month.

3. once we got back together, he was still living with her to “make the divorce amicable” (they had been separated almost 2 years before i ever came into the picture).   he swears nothing happened between them yet she thought they might be getting back together.  we were together the entire time but on the down low as not to upset her.

4. continually “chose” her over me. which he never saw.  example, we’d have to change our plans because he didn’t want to fight her…so instead he and i would argue.  he always defended himself saying “i didn’t choose either of you, i chose what was best for me”

5. didn’t see an issue with him spending time with her and the kids as a family and exclude me and my kids. including overnight stays. (maybe without the above history i’d been a little more understanding in that) plus, 2 of his kids were older. one out of the house and married and the other in high school. the youngest was the same age as my youngest. currently in 6th grade.

6. when the “indiscretion” happened he originally allowed full access to his phone so i could be at ease, but over time he started getting pissed if i asked to see it and eventually stopped letting me.  (i asked to see it maybe once a month)

7. continually told me my parenting was creating drains on society. 

yet his teen had to be spoon fed his schoolwork to pass. he barely graduated. he is now 20, works part-time and refuses to get his permit and license because he’s “too tired after working at the grocery store to study for the test” and instead plays video games every waking moment.

my oldest is 15 and has been hustling side work for 2 years and just got his first real job making more than the 20 yo working as a part-time janitor for his school.

his youngest would refuse to eat anything except 4 or 5 things. and she would lie about taking bites and covertly throw things away with no repercussions. she also had to be forced to do any school work to pass.

all three of my kids are straight a students. i care less about their grades and more about the fact they are diligent and conscientious students.  

he used his son’s adhd as an excuse for his laziness, yet two of mine have it, i have it, and my other son is autistic.

he continually berated me for letting them have their electronics, but all of them participate in extracurricular activities and my oldest and youngest are super active in sports.

8. he would gaslight me all the time and tell me that he never said things, or that’s not how he meant them. 

i am forgetful and ditzy but it just got to the point that i literally was questioning every memory of every conversation.

9. he told me when he left “i hate who i am when i’m with you”

10. he made some really stupid financial purchases that still have me annoyed. like 10 garden statues that cost $600 but we couldn’t afford to pay rent. or his handgun for $800 he “needed” for defense even though we had a shotgun.

i type these out. i think about it over and over again.  why would i want to be with a man who doesn’t like me?  i cry. i lose sleep. i have si and sh urges over it. why!? why doesn’t he want to be with me!? what’s wrong with me!?

and sitting in bed just now i said to myself mid-cry, “i was never the problem”.

and the thing is, he says to me, “i told you it was a me problem!” when i get upset…yet for 4.5 years, his words said different.

i just need to keep reminding myself “i was never the problem!!!!!”

i may forget those words often, but someday i will believe them for good!",1643172763,TRUE,BPD,2022-01-26 04:52:43,1,0,
struggling with the constant battle of “is this paranoia” and “is this intuition” is so frustrating.,"it’s trickled it’s way into anything. i’ll read up on “signs that ____ is happening” bc i fear it. and then i can’t ever tell whether it’s happening or if it’s just my anxiety speaking. i can’t tell if i’ve thought of them doing that before or if it’s always been the case. 

its hard ever talking abt it too bc it’s not like you can tell someone you think they might not be interested in you, or you think they’re going to leave you.

it’s hard just trusting that it’s going to be okay because it hasn’t been in the past. i don’t want to beat myself up later bc i didn’t see this warning sign. i would be so disappointed in myself if i got hurt bc it was paranoia all along.

it’s extremely frustrating and it’s hard to live with this.

Post Relationship Paranoia,"hello everyone,

recently (about a month ago) i got out of a relationship, that ended fairly ugly too. and my ex said things to me i have a hard time dealing with. for instance that everything i talked to people about regarding our relationship, that they all carried it on over to her. that she just is that kind of person who gets told stuff. so when i talked about her and our relationship, they all told her immediately.

i talked to other people about our relationship mostly because i wanted to know if i am irrational in what i dislike, or if what i feel is missing is just delusional or me misunderstanding things, or if i am just paranoid. 

and while that already ignited my paranoia manyfold, as it turns out it wasn't completely wrong either. because she was cheating on me. she had an affair more or less the moment we started dating. so all my fears, all my feelings of her distancing herself from me, which caused me to become more clingy and whiny, all of these feelings were correct.

during the breakup i talked to someone only tertiarily knowing my ex about what happened. but the following days it felt like that person was avoiding me. so my paranoia hit overload. and then it turns out i was right again, they were avoiding me because apparently they talked to my ex and felt like i was lying about everything i said about them, and that now they never want to see me again.

it's now a month past all that, and despite trying to reinvent myself, go to new places, meet new people, i cannot get rid of this paranoia. this self hatred. every time someone i like looks too much at someone else, or invites them over more than me, i feel like they prefer them to me, that i am alienating them. that soon i will find out that my paranoid fears were correct.

but. i kinda fucked up at practice and my overthinking has been pushing me back into old habits since. i’ve been working really hard at not doing the same thing as always, but today i opened my mouth in the chat too much about my issues (my common trend). it wasn’t as bad as it usually was in the past, but this week could defiantly have given me some bad luck. 

i’ve been hyping this band up to everyone, a bunch of people know about it, if i fuck this up i’m probably going to delete my facebook again or something drastic to hide from embarrassment. 
i hate this. i hate that i’m like this. i never asked for this, i never wanted to be this way. i’m working on getting out of my comfort zone, doing things i’ve avoided for so long, but if i fuck this up idk what i’m going to do. 

i really just want to be understood, my first band really did my dirty and i haven’t been able to move on and be the same since. i self sabotage every good opportunity i get and i just want to stop and be understood. i understand it’s a lot for people to take, and it’s overwhelming but i don’t like this either. i don’t like having the need for constant reassurance, i don’t like that every other day i overthink if i’m a good fit or if i should run. i’ve run away from so much and this is something i feel is really meant to be. but god damn. 
i hate that i’m like this. i came off strong to start, got their respect, and i feel it fading from how i’ve been. i don’t get social cues either so that makes this even better. 

i really hope this works out and i don’t fuck up this good thing again. any advice is more than welcomed. 

tldr:
falling into old habits and really hoping i didn’t ruin another really good thing.",1643149232,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-25 22:20:32,1,0,
Did I finally stop repeating patterns or is my downfall inevitable? Hoping my bpd doesn't ruin everything again.,"as most of you know, keeping a job is hard as fck. my pattern goes like this:

1. gets anxious about new job
2. tries extremely hard to be perfect
3. does surprisingly well
4. moves up the totem pole quickly
5. gains responsibility
6. gets overwhelmed
7. gets depressed bc i can't ever be as good as people think i am
8. gets angry and irritable bc why is this shitty job my life
9. doesn't show up for work and doesn't leave bed for weeks
10. repeat once homeless (or nearly homeless)

so, i got this job at a diner the day i moved to town. my neighbor was wearing a uniform shirt and i said, ""hey, are you hiring?"" and i was hired. she told me i was the easiest person she'd ever trained. i felt like i still wasn't good enough. except i quickly realized my worst is still very good in comparison to others.

anyway, i have lost this job a couple of times. i'd stop showing up. i'd piss my boss off, but she'd end up needing help and since we're neighbors she could just say, ""hey, coming back to work?"" and i could. i've been on meds and i've been dependable. it's like i'm finally where i want to be. things are starting to change and i know it's small and probably seems stupid to some people, but i might end up being the assistant manager. the money would be incredible. i already get paid well for what i do. i just finally feel like i'm going to be a normal, functioning adult! i have to stay on my meds and stay honest with everyone. hopefully i don't fck it up.",1643147742,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-25 21:55:42,1,0,
Why can't I remember much of my childhood?,"i can only remember tiny little pieces. 
i don't even know if these things i remember are really that bad. i don't know what to compare them to. i'm not sure what other 'normal' people grew up with.

- i remember very minimal things about neglect 
-i remember smacking 
- i remember not being treated for health conditions
-i remember feeling like i was not the favourite child 
-i remember making my own food 

there's other things of course but i can't list them all.  remembering and recognising these things as not normal has been super difficult for me. i never even knew they weren't normal. i say normal but i can't think of another word to use.

is it a good thing i cant remember much or should i try to dig up my past for better understanding of what i'm feeling today? what should i be remembering from my past? are snippets a normal thing? i'm just worried there might be something more terrible that happened that i'm not remembering. i can only remember select few and i feel like they might balance out with the good things that happened. but do they or am i fooling myself. i just don't have anything good to compare it to. also some horrible things happened to me with one particular ex bf. i'm not sure if that comes into play with my diagnosis or if i'm just attracted to people like that because of my diagnosis.",1643144558,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-25 21:02:38,1,0,

Am I wrong in this situation or is my mother?,"i’m confused because i’m not sure if i’m being an asshole or if my frustration is justified. i live at home with my parents and i am on disability allowance as i am unfit to work and have been unfit to work for the past few years due to my mental health. i get 208 euro a week and i give 50 euro of that to my mother as “rent”. 

okay so this is a bit embarrassing but i don’t own my own bank account and it’s very difficult for me to get one because i don’t own any documents with my proof of address and the banks are very particular about which documents you can use and not use..etc so all my money goes into my mothers bank account each week and every time i have to buy something online i have to come to her and tell her. 

anyways i found out about “revolut” today and it seems like i can start transferring my money to that. i confronted my mum about this and asked her how much money i had i saved up. i expected to have atleast 4-5k saved up as i don’t really spend that much and i have been getting the allowance for a long time. 

she said i had 2k and that’s it. i was shocked and confused and we argued about it for a while and she was saying “well you spend 20 euro a week on fizzy drinks” etc.. so i decided to add all the things i spend each week and each month and subtract it and in the last two years i should of had saved up 12k yet somehow i only have 2k saved up according to her. also this was only calculated from the last two years but now that i think of it i’m pretty sure i’ve been getting the allowance a lot longer than two years. anyways she got angry and threatened not to collect my money anymore (i can’t collect it because of severe social anxiety). she said there’s no way she’s giving me 12k and i was fine with that i just said that i would like some of it paid back to me over time and she refused again. 

i feel like i’m being an asshole though for confronting her about this since she does a lot for me in terms of stuff around the house  and making dinner etc but also something feels wrong about the whole situation and it’s not the first time she’s spent my money. she spent all my confirmation money when i was a child too.",1643142632,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-25 20:30:32,1,0,

Personal attack/ jealousy,"i was wondering if anyone could help me identify this feeling i have. it has to do with my boyfriend, the only person im very close with. it has to do with the fact that when something changes with him (new job, new schoolthing) i get very upset. i thinks it’s a mixture between me not liking change, and me taking when something goods happens to someone very personally. i think things like ‘he now has that and i don’t which makes me worthless/a faillure. its like when he got this new job and gets more money per hour than me, i feel like im so stupid and worthless, even when its not even possible for me to obtain that same job due to skills that he learns at his study, and i don’t do that study. its like i can’t be happy for him ever, because of how bad it makes me feel. usually im pretty good at identifying feelings and where they came from (childhood situations that made me like that), but with this one i dont really know what this feeling has to do with. like the jealousy and feeling personally attacked thing came from somewhere in my childhood, and i dont know what kind of situations could have made me like this. long story haha im not native in english sorry, but maybe somebody can help me with something? im starting treatment for bpd this week btw, very excited i love uncovering things that made me like this and fixing them haha.",1643136624,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-25 18:50:24,1,0,
"Start of relationship: Majorly stressed, questioning. Looking for input.","i'm questioning everything. i recently ended a co-dependent relationship because i thought i'd fallen out of love, and because i wanted to be more independent. i've questioned this choice 1000x since and originally planned to be single for a while. well, then i met a guy a mere month after the end of my relationship. he's amazing, he really is. i definitely see his negative personality traits as well, but i think i'm lucky to have him. he ofc is head-over-heels in love, as it often happens because bpd people seem amazing, compelling, and intense in the beginning before we get difficult. 

i just recently got diagnosed with bpd (in combination with histrionic personality disorder) and it explains soooo much. i finally understand my moods, what happened with my ex.. it's such an eye-opening discovery. but it also makes me over-reflect on and question everything. especially relationship-wise. 

in my research i often read we tend to fall head-over-heels, not able to think of anything else. i don't have that with my new guy (let's call him d) and that scares me. does that mean it's not real love? i question and probe every single feeling to look if it feels like love, constantly compare to how i felt with my ex, anxious to determine if i am in love. i'm so scared i'm only grasping for him to not be lonely.. 

about how i am feeling: well. when i'm with him i feel safe, calm. he makes me laugh, i'm completely open with my symptoms and the stress that i added to my last relationship and he makes an effort to understand. but as soon as i'm alone i'm so tense and stressed. i'm determined to limit our contact as i rushed into my last relationship way too quickly, so that stress is present a lot. 
we took a break a few weeks ago because i wasn't sure about my feelings, and the constant tension stopped. but i missed him. i'm so scared that this tension is a bad sign. 

my last relationship lasted four years and the guy acted as my home, my therapist, my everything. so that's unhealthy. i have no healthy relationship to compare this to. i don't know how healthy love is supposed to feel like. if it can be slow. or if that means i'm just not into him and only want to be. 

i'd love your input, your experience. i've googled lots and never found anything about borderliners being crazy in love at the beginning of a relationship, but never questioning. 

this post is a mess. feel free to probe, question and ask away. thanks so much for reading. so, so much.",1643136401,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-25 18:46:41,1,0,
Guilt after splitting,"last night i found out that my boyfriend had been doing weird stuff behind my back (like adding random girls/ spam porn accounts on snapchat? and using their photos to get off). we have been together for almost 3 years and a very common trigger for me is being rejected sexually, so naturally i split on him. i had just spent the last 2 hours crying and venting about life in general, i was very much having an existential crisis. he’s so sweet, he sat there and listened the whole time, he always does. afterwards he took me to get ice cream, brought me home, got a bubble bath ready for me with netflix set up and my favourite tea, as well as tidied up the entire apartment and set up our room to watch a movie for when i got out. but i found out this information while i was in the bath, we started fighting through the bathroom door because i wouldn’t let him in. i kept yelling at him telling him to leave our apartment, that we’re done, that he hates me, you know, every thing. in those moments he wasn’t a good guy who was just doing some odd shit to me, he was an evil genius who concocted elaborate plans to hurt me. no seriously, often when i split i feel like no one in my life has my best interests at heart and that i’m not safe from anyone. i ended up breaking his phone and saying horrible things, threw my controller at a wall, and dumped a few of his sweaters off the balcony. he kept apologizing and saying all he wants is me, that he loves me so much etc but how could any of that be true when he feels the need to do that stuff with other girls? he was crying and throwing up and i just sat there, i didn’t care. i just stared at him and was wondering why he was the one on the ground crying, i felt absolutely nothing. i left the apartment to talk things through with a friend, i calmed down and was ready to have an actual conversation with him. right when i walked in, that’s the first time i noticed he had cleaned the whole place up, and looked at my spot on the bed he made up for me. i didn’t notice any of this during the split, and i just feel so bad that he was doing absolutely everything he could to comfort me and just take care of me when i felt like the whole world was out to get me, while i split on him. i made him one of my enemies when he’s the one who’s always in my corner… when i got back we both just melted into each other’s arms and sobbed. we talked more in depth about those accounts he was engaging with, talked about ways to move forward, and both apologized for our actions. he says it’s okay, but i don’t believe that. how can anyone deal with that part of me and still accept me so easily? sometimes it makes me think that he’s just too scared to leave, that i’m so bad for him and i just think he deserves to be treated absolutely amazing, so when i act in ways that don’t reflect that towards him, i just can’t imagine the amount of resentment i must be creating in the relationship. i woke up this morning with so much guilt, uncontrollable crying and finding myself trying to think of ways to make it up to him, basically want to go on a love bombing rage to try and make this guilt go away, but i know none of that will work. i keep having flashbacks of things i said and did and see myself as this hurtful monster. i never want to hurt him, when i’m angry and telling him to leave my whole body is angry at me, telling me not to , i don’t want to say that stuff i genuinely don’t want him to leave but i sound so convincing when i say it, it’s scary. how do i deal with the guilt of hurting the person i care the most about on this earth?",1643136234,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-25 18:43:54,1,0,
Am I a lost cause?,"this is a repost of my first post which seems to have gotten stuck in moderator limbo. it's venting but any suggestions are appreciated.

it must be hell to be married to me. i fear both abandonment and getting ""too close"".  i love her but i am so mean and i hate myself for it. i am a liar and a manipulator, and one of the frustrating parts is that it looks deliberate, like i have some kind of diabolical scheme like in gaslight. i don't though, the truth is i fail to show empathy or have any insight into how others feel. when i try to consider these things i tend to go over the edge into obsession about how to make her happy and this leads to further self loathing because i know (maybe irrationally) that i will never be enough for that. so i try to correct over caring but i switch over to indifferent detachment and completely skip the middle ground. i feel like a binary bit trying to navigate an analog world. of course i should be able to exist somewhere in between, but the middle is so alien and confusing. how do people manage to be partway ""on""?
some part of me must want to remain this way and refuse change, it's a small part but very persistent. how can i silence that part of me without slipping into emotional numbness? meds and counseling have helped some, but i'm too damn stubborn to let myself be fixed. if i could permanently turn off all my emotions and only respond to the request of others it would be better than being this",1643133505,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-25 17:58:25,1,0,
"Tips for when being in a relationship with someone who has BPD and ""shuts off""?","i(m21) have been with my gf(f19) for over 10 months now, and its been ups and downs like any other relationtship but overall it's been very good and we love eachother.

however, lately i have been concerned with something she tends to do when she finds a conversation too overwhelming(?) as in if we have a small disagreement or argument she might just ""shut off"" after a while. i could probably count on just one hand how many times it has happend so i have not seen it as a big issue. she says it's a coping mechanism, but i have noticed that i never really feel like we get to properly talk about stuff that we might not agree on, or make up when we have an argument. usually we just stop talking about it, things are awkward for hours/days and then i apologise and we move on. atleast try to.

so the thing is that i wonder if theres something i can do to sort of make it easier for her, i try to be as accomodating and comforting as i can, and try to see things from her side, but it's not easy. i have asked her what i should do when she shuts down but she just said it's complicated and that i should google it because it's not her responsability.

i really just want to be able to talk to her about anything(not litterally) without feeling like im walking on eggshells around her. 

should i give her space? stop trying to continue the topic if i feel like shes getting overwhelmed? i appreciate any tips/help i can get.

Not everyone with bpd splits,"talked about this with my therapist today and just needed to scream this into the void.

extreme idealizing and devaluing in relationships is one of 9 diagnostoc criteria and you only need 5, yet almost everything about bpd centers around splitting to the point it's hard to find anything discussing bpd without it.

not all of us have every single trait of bpd, and just because *you* experience something doesnt mean it's a bpd symptom. i've seen redicouls claims from other pwbpd, like

""pwbpd never forgive and will get revenge on you""

""if you have bpd and say you're not manipulative you just aren't as self aware as me and are worse""

or on the flip side

""i can't help that i'm manipulative, i have bpd that's the way we are""
""i stalked and harrassed him cause i have bpd i can't help it""

no. these are not bpd traits and it is very wrong to characterize a whole ass mental illness based on your experience. bpd is *not* an excuse for all of your bad behavior. stop spreading misinformation.

not everyone with bpd splits.
not everyone with bpd is imulsive.
not everyone with bpd has fp's.

moving on from an ex FP&lt;3,"so as the title says, i will be sharing my advice on how i personally have slowly started to move on from my ex fp. 


now this may not work for everyone and i hope nobody takes this the wrong way as i know having an fp and losing one is extremely difficult and traumatizing, but i want y’all to know that it isn’t impossible. i have been struggling for months myself trying to get over my fp as they broke up with me, but every time i get in a mood where i feel like i need them back, need to text, call them, start to spiral over them, etc. i always tell myself that there was a time when i lived without them, and i can live without them again. 


i know this is easier said than done, but i assure it helps train your brain to remember that people come and go and we are capable of living without the people we never thought we could. 


one thing to remember though, is you are worthy of genuine love, care, and support, and if your fp wasn’t giving any of that to you, then they weren’t the right person and would not have done you any good going further.

Self-harm of pwbpd,"i've been with my partner with bpd for a couple of years now and we've been living together for 1,5 years - we've both grown and changed for the better. he's been in therapy, i've been in therapy, we've both managed to get away from some unhealthy behavior patterns and some of the codependancy. however, things can still get very toxic from time to time and it's so hard to cope when they do. 

he still practices self-harm by hitting himself in the head (even though he's out of therapy; the dbt-therapist said this might never go away, he's done it since he was very little). and i feel like i can't handle it anymore. i sometimes feel like i'm in a war zone in my own home, although this is where i should feel safe and loved. he screams, hits himself, rolls on the floor. and there is nothing i can do to stop it, i'm not allowed to hold him, console him - no matter what the reason for the emotional distress is. it hurts to see the person you love hurt himself. and it hurts that you can't do anything about it. and i can't help but think about our future and whether it will ever go away. or whether he might get a concussion or has gotten one or will one day have chronic traumatic encephalopathy. or whether i could ever have children with him, because i would never want a child to see their father this way. it even triggers me now and i get very anxious before it happens or when i anticipate it might happen and angry when it happens.

anxiety around talking to mental health professionals,"** sorry for how long this is in advance ** 

i was referred to a psychiatrist in june of 2021 due to my worries about my mental health. i was sure i had bpd because i have all the 9 symptoms and they all affect me in extreme ways (some less than others). when speaking to the psychiatrist i listed all the symptoms and how they affect and i also told her that i am almost positive i have bpd. towards the end of the session she confirms that i have all 9 symptoms but that she doesn’t want to diagnose me because there is a possibility that i might grow out of it in the future. she said other things but i honestly don’t remember much cause it was a while ago and i also don’t want to repeat anything i’m not positive she said. what threw me off though was how quickly she was willing to put me on medication despite not requesting to see me again to see what was actually going on with me (the symptoms of bpd overlap with a lot of other diagnoses and i personally think it’s irresponsible to refuse to diagnose me but put me on medication that might not even work for me). 

i ended up going back to my family doctor and expressing my frustration to her. to my surprise the psychiatrist had already contacted her and told her about her concern for my “need for a diagnoses”. so i spent that meeting trying hard to fight for myself but i just felt like i was being shut down. its been months since these meetings and i am still struggling horribly, i deal with bpd symptoms almost everyday and i am still positive that i have it but theres a voice in my head that tells me that i am attention seeking , and faking all of this. 

i start school in september and due to my mental health issues i believe having diagnosis will help me get the support i need when i am not feeling the best (disability support). so i’m planning on talking to my family doctor tomorrow about wanting to be speak to another psychiatrist but i am terrified. i’m so scared my words are going to be taken the wrong way and that i’m going to be seen as a bad person.

when i was 8 my parents separated (they were never married) because my dad cheated and i heard every argument they had and used to walk in and cry and tell them to stop arguing. neither of them comforted me about it afterwards or even acknowledged that i witnessed everything. after my parents split i was really depressed but my mum was too sad about the breakup to notice (i don’t really blame her for that i just wish she had at least talked to me about it or asked me how i was feeling). in the years after that i really struggled to deal with my emotions and started self harming as a coping mechanism. my mum walked in once and i hid my arm but there was blood on my sheets and the tool i used was laying in my bed. she looked at it and then looked at me and said “haha your not self harming are you?” laughed and left as if the thought of that was so absurd to her and she never asked me or spoke about it again.
in the following years my younger brother (2 years younger than me) developed sever anxiety and anger issues. his anxiety got so bad that he was too scared to go to school and didn’t go for almost a year. during that time he would fight with us every day when it would have been time to go to school. he was extremely aggressive and sometimes hit me when he got really angry, to the point where i had bruises. my mum always said it’s not his fault because he was having mental problems and never acknowledged that what he did was wrong and never asked me how i was feeling. so i tried everything to make her notice how i was doing. i often provocted my brother so he would hit me to the point where i had swollen bruises but my mum always just got mad at me for provoking him so i ended up thinking that i deserved it and provoked him even more often to get hit by him. 
at some point my mum got him committed to a mental hospital and after that he was doing well and we get along great now. 
but at this point my bpd had gotten worse and i felt like i couldn’t talk about it with mz mum because she never wanted to hear it.
i couldn’t hide my emotional outbursts from my friends but whenever i got really emotional at home i just hid in my room and dealt with my emotions with sh.
my mum never knew about any of this or how i felt during those times but last christmas my brother my mum and i had a deep talk and i told her all of it. 
it was so hard for me to share everything but i hoped it would make our relationship better and help me move past this. but after i told her everything she basically just told me to not be dramatic, i had an easy life compared to her.
the next day i asked her if she would pay for me going to therapy and she said “no. now that you moved out i finally want to live my life “. she makes a lot of money and we always go on nice vacations so i don’t get why me going to therapy is something she doesn’t want to pay for. 
i’m just so sad and frustrated that she helps everyone around her but even when i share everything, which is something that was so hard for me to do because i’m a secretive person she reacts like that.",1643074232,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-25 01:30:32,1,0,
is it possible to move on from an fp,i know that theoretically it’s possible but i don’t understand how to do it. how can i possibly let go of someone i love so much. how can i move on when man i wanna do is drown in the memories of us and wish that one day we can go back. i don’t want this to become depressing and i really hope that this is not triggering to anyone but i just have to know if it’s actually possible or not,1643074141,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-25 01:29:01,1,0,
uhhh idk what to do,my partner is always depressed (their words not mine) and at low points. they don’t really have any friends and the friends that they do have live all the way across the country. they told me they had bpd and ptsd in the beginning of our relationship. and at the time they lived with their parent and were in therapy. we have lived together for abt 2 years now and they haven’t kept a consistent job since we’ve been together or prior. the jobs they’ve had they quit bc it was too much for them because they want accommodations the jobs haven’t give ( ability to call out whenever and work 2 days a week of their choice that week and able to sit down and wear whatever). they also don’t do any chores or cook and also don’t want to eat any home cooked meals because of many reasons ( their food restrictions and dislikes). it has really been hard on me bc it’s hard to support both of us we live in a major city and im a server and bartender. they did have a major loss their mom in the early parts of the pandemic and i’ve done and continued to research about their illnesses but it’s really hard to go to work come home and then have to play support caretaker and more it feels almost maternal sometimes. yet i never do enough ? any advice?,1643071557,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-25 00:45:57,1,0,

moments of lacking empathy?,"(sorry i wasn’t sure what to tag this as, im new to the subreddit)

hi, so i have bpd and i am still on a process of understanding how my mind works and everything of that nature. i am really struggling to find help or resources on certain things that i experience, so i thought i would come here to post something. so basically, let’s say someone is vulnerable to me, telling me their problems and being upset and wanting comfort. for some reason something switches in me and i cannot care or comfort them at all? im not sure if that is understandable or not. it’s not something recent, i’ve had it just as long as the other symptoms. it has started to bother me though as more people come to me looking for support and i can’t give it to them. eventually, after the problem is over, i do start to feel bad and i wish i could’ve helped but in the moment i couldn’t. is this something else anyone experiences? and is there a name for this? ):

recently, i’ve become repulsed by my him. i’ve been incredibly irritable. i want to go back on dating apps and match with people. i’m afraid i’m not attracted enough or i’m not ready for a serious relationship yet. i talked to my mom about this, and she’s so worried about my mental health. she doesn’t want me to go on dating apps right away if i were to break up, because she says i wouldn’t be processing the grief of a breakup. but i feel like i’m going insane. i’m looking for jobs right now for when i graduate and there’s obviously other stress triggers in my life. but i feel like if we broke up now i would feel sad for hurting him and maybe remorse, but that i’d get on dating apps immediately and get the dopamine rush from matches. i haven’t told my boyfriend these things- i don’t want to hurt him. i feel like i’ve screwed up and become so committed and we’ve talked about marriage, and i am so scared of disappointing him, his family, and my family. i don’t feel mentally stable. my chest is constantly tight with a racing heart and i just want to cry. i know he doesn’t deserve someone that is repulsed by him at times and isn’t sure about what she wants, but i don’t want to hurt him and we legitimately thought our relationship was from god.",1642106342,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-13 20:39:02,1,0,
help please,"my(15m) girlfriend(14f) has bpd and i need advice from others who live with it.

(online relationship we've known each other for 5-6 years)

today we were having a good day (i thought) we were laughing, smiling, joking and just having a good time. then she went on tiktok to ruin her mood and look at pretty girl. i kept telling her to not go on tiktok, and to not ruin her mood. she told me she can't control it, i don't really understand so please help me with that. this is something that affects our relationship (9months) and i've been trying to fix for about maybe half of the relationship or more. how do i help her believe the truth and help herself? why is she doing this to herself, she says she cant control it and i want to understand, listen and be considerate. i love her with all my heart and i want her to know it. our relationship is very complicated. we can't communicate that well because i cry because i feel guilty and that makes her feel guilty for making me cry, she blames herself for everything and i just want to make her happy.

Our complicated story/Does anybody else find it hard to be monogamous sometimes?,"our story for context:

we texted very much but i could stop to switch from ""i like you too"" to ""i'm not sure about all of this"" (i consider that one of my bpd symptoms) which must have been pretty hard for him. then i told him that we should stay just friends, thinking that i wasn't ready for this and that we would get together when we're older.
after that he found an other girl (also in germany while he still was in argentina). that was the point i realised that waiting for each other was the most stupid and also most painful idea i've ever had^^""
i told him how i felt but he wasn't sure about the whole situation and it took two months till he broke up with her and told me that he still loved me.
since then we are happily together but his time with her left some kind of ""trauma"" and also after 1,5 years think of this still triggers me and hurts so much sometimes...

we talked about a non-monogamous relationship at some points but he says that he couldn't do that because of his jealousy. for me it also became more difficult, at the one hand i think i could seperate loving him and getting to know other ppl quite good and as i already mentioned would like to make more experiences and have more of the ""adventure"" which comes from new people but on the other hand since this traumatic two to three months i got jealous and more insecure on my own so even if he would agree in an more open relationship it could be very hard to me as well till i've finally processed all of this pain him being with this girl gave me.

what's a good way of not taking it to heart? bpd fucks my head up so much. makes you read into stuff to heavily. what's some coping skills that work for you? cause i feel shit and i shouldn't. thanks.",1642097394,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-13 18:09:54,1,0,
"for those of you who, like myself, have both BPD &amp; ADHD, please read. i need to know i’m not alone.","i don’t ever feel like i belong. i never want to go inside my apartment because even though it’s mine, it feels like it isn’t. i think it’s because i’m homesick for a place that doesn’t exist. 

when i’m surrounded by my friends, or my family, sometimes i’ll end up zoning out completely. in my therapy sessions, i’ll do the same. over the years, i’ve gotten better at pretending i’m an active member when i’m around others. but that’s the thing—i’m pretending. obviously i’m not alone because i have people in my life, but i’m lonely. 

i get so bored with life. i need *constant* stimulation, or i get depressed, anxious, and irritated. i have to go, go, go. i’ll do anything to feel a rush, even if it means blowing all my money when i shop, or driving recklessly, or getting blackout drunk almost every other weekend. i just don’t have any interest in the hobbies i used to love, and every time i think about trying a new hobby—or *do* try a new hobby—it feels dull almost instantly. i used to love to read, write, and draw. no whenever i pick up a pen or a book, i just put it right back down. 

what i hate about most adhd medications (i take the max dosage of vyvanse, and have taken others) is that i’ll feel like i’m on a cloud and i’m finally happy. then an hour later, when it wears off, i become miserable, exhausted, sometimes even angry for seemingly no reason. 

each day is the same. at work, at home, when i’m out and about, i just watch the clock and wait for the day to end. but i hate when the day ends because i know i have to go home at some point. i hate being in my apartment. i want to go home. i don’t know where to go, though.",1642097203,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-13 18:06:43,1,0,
Am I splitting or is my annoyance justified?,"recently a coworker exposed me to covid. she was sick in the office and i begged her over the course of days to go home. (for additional context, she lives with her parents and doesn't rely on her income to pay bills) we had a fairly good relationship for the past two months, despite some minor annoyances about her work ethic and maturity. for the sake of keeping it short, here is a compressed summary of events:

wednesday - she is full blown sick and coughing and sneezing. gets covid tested in the evening.
thursday - she comes in and says she hasn't gotten her results yet but she still feels very sick. doesn't wear a mask all day bc she is so congested she can't breathe.
friday - she is out and i am told she tested positive and was encouraged to get tested after work ""because if [i] leave there will be no one in [my] department.""

i proceed to become the sickest i've ever been for nearly 2 weeks. i am still testing positive, one person i live with has also tested positive, another is sick and another is unvaccinated but fortunately fine. my job will only pay me to be off for 5 days, so i begrudgingly come in despite doctor's notes telling me to quarantine.

i come in and there are emails to be answered as far back as 10 days ago. there is work we could have both done that is not only undone, but people are sending reminders. my coworker comes in 20 minutes late, takes off her mask immediately and without asking how i'm feeling or anything, proceeds to give me paperwork that is work for me to do.

i have more responsibilities than her even though she has been working her 4 mos longer than me and we get paid the same rate. i am livid and ignoring her because i can't trust myself to not say something passive aggressive...she is currently maskless and on the phone with a friend, while opening up the mail, one job i don't feel comfortable doing considering i was told two days ago that i am still covid positive and transmissible.

am i over-reacting? this whole thing makes no sense to me...",1642094588,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-13 17:23:08,1,0,
I hate the lack of sensitivity and humanity everyone has. Not once have we who suffer from BPD received an apology.,"i utmost certainly believe no one understands us, especially the people whom we care for. this could just be my case but i’m positive that the people i’m close to do not wish to understand me nor help. 

we are treated so poorly by everyone we love, not once have i had someone apologize for treating me badly, insulting me, lashing out on me verbally…etc. i would just simply receive an explanation for their emotions once everything calms down and that’s that. me though? who gives a fuck about me, who cares that i absolutely spiraled out of control and cried myself to sleep. 

of course, no one should walk on egg shells around us, but you shouldn’t be an asshole either! things like that hurt us on a much deeper level than the average person. 

a person with bpd will rarely receive a sincere apology, it’s always us who have to beg for someone’s forgiveness. even when we make a minor mistake, we’re harsh on ourselves enough… no need for someone else to destroy us mentally.",1642093123,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-13 16:58:43,1,0,
Is this the start of an episode?,"last night i woke up very anxious in the middle of the night. my spouse stays up very late on the computer every night for a break from reality. he enjoys playing games mostly but does some internet stuff too (bills, research, porn).

i use to be very insecure about this two years ago but i’ve mellowed out now. he wasn’t in bed til late.

so last night i woke up alone with a series of racing thoughts like: 
“what if he’s talking to other women? what if he’s only nice to me because he needs to make it easy on us when he leaves me? what if he’s being nice to me now so i don’t suspect he’s talking to other women? what if he doesn’t find me attractive anymore and they make fun of me while she charms him? what if he’s looking at homes with her?”

leading into: “i should snoop into his stuff.”

i’ve been off previously now and again as i suffer from frequent uti’s and migraines (from jaw clenching).

Unpopular opinion: I did not like Encanto,"okay, so hear me out, i really did not enjoy certain aspects of encanto, and i’m suspecting that it had to do with my bpd. i did not understand how mirabel could just forgive her family so easily, let alone her own mother. her parents didn’t even notice when she was left out of the family picture, and when mirabel was at her absolute lowest after the house collapsed, her mom was just “hang on i gotta go take care of my over-dramatic sister”. 

personally, i wouldn’t be able to forgive my own mother also for never standing up for mirabel as abuela just tore her down to shreds at every turn. abuela accused her of being under the influence of alcohol in front of the whole town, and not a peep from her parents! and at no point at all does the rest of mirabel’s family check in on her despite the fact that she’s constantly having to deal with being the black sheep of the family (besides bruno that is). 

idk it was hard for me to get through all that and everywhere i turn people cannot gush enough about this movie, whereas i feel so differently. i would love to hear from other people with bpd because personally it triggered some of my symptoms, as in refusing to let go of the smallest transgressions and then distancing myself completely. or just let me know if i’m the only one feeling this way. that’s okay too!",1642088119,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-13 15:35:19,1,0,

Could we have some other content in here instead of ”fp”?,"imo we should just have one weekly post where all the ”classic” fp content should be posted. ”vent here about your fp” or something. 

every day there are so many similar posts and people dont often even answer to any of them. it’s boring and not helpful, and personally i believe there is more to our personality disorder than ”fp”. so why is it almost only topic in here?

the word here is romanticized and misunderstood anyway. ”favorite person” makes it sound like ”best friend forever &lt;3” kind of thing when in reality it’s just obsession, boundary issues, etc. misinformation isnt allowed in here, and i think this term has become misinformation when you look at how some people use it.

what does an r/o diagnosis mean/advice,"aight so a year ago i was hospitalized for bipolar disorder a bunch and each time i was inpatient the psychiatrists at the hospital(s) tried to diagnose me with bpd but i 'fought it off' by lying and putting up a fit over it.. or so i thought. i was convinced they were trying to diagnose me with bpd to call me manipulative and invalidate me because at the time i only really knew of bpd's stigma.

i'm more level on meds now but am still a mess outside of being bipolar and when i went through my old records i found out they never dropped bpd. they tried diagnosing me every time i was hospitalized and it's even listed with my other official diagnoses as ""r/o bpd"" or as a provisional diagnosis. 

before i started fighting the bpd dx i did talk it over with a psych there and i have all but one symptom, and have for most of my life. it was after she said i fulfill the bpd criteria i started trying to lie my way out of it :/

anyway.. does anyone know what that means? i wanna understand it. 

also is it a good idea to try to 'diy' dbt? i really am trying to make a change but i'm worried it will back fire.

Feeling like shit for lashing out.,"hello, it’s been three weeks since i stopped talking to my ex. but i said some mean things i regret. i’ve been beating myself up about it but i feel he was a douchebag too. 

i broke up with him in the summer. i wasn’t happy, and i was about to move out of state for a job. we ended on good terms and went no contact. he subtly told me i was a rebound and that i was bad in bed…which was a shocker to me because we were together for three years. 


anyways i move and leave. he contacts me a month in. and i stupidly answer. we talk and when i visit he asks to be fwb. and i say no. i could tell he suspected of me hooking up with someone and told me if he found out he’s stop talking to me. 


later one he keeps calling me and i stupidly answer. he keeps asking for fwb and i finally give in agreeing. we have a lot of phone sex. but i tell him i don’t think it’s a good idea to get back together. 


he starts seeing a person a fwb and i kind of flip. but decide to maintain low contact, still he calls me. and i mad that he’s hooking up with someone (immature of me ik) tell him i hooked up with a friend a month after our breakup. 

he seemed upset but started treating me as a friend which fine. he told me a month  into his rebound things were getting serious. and i’m like fine but it means when i visit there will be no hook ups and no more phone sex.

he seemed annoyed but agreed. 
i shit you not when i visit i made it clear there were no hook ups happening between us.
dude made a move on me and we ended up making out. 

i put a stop to it and went home. 

but my dumbass called him the next day to hook up in an hotel room. 

idk whyi did that. after the hook up i realized i was in denial about my feelings and called him. 

he said he felt nothing towards me which devasted me (but i deserved it). i blocked him everywhere.

i made it clear i wasn’t mad at him for not liking me but was mad at him for not respecting my boundaries from the start.

why the hell would he still want to keep me in his life and be intimate if things are getting serious with his fwb??

i told him, “i don’t want you as a friend, i don’t want you in my life, please leave me alone!”

he was driving and something outside the car was the stressor. when i began to panic, he knew it was happening and did not move the car or roll up my window. he left me stuck in this panic and he feels no remorse whatsoever. 


anyway, i’m doing some dbt analyzing this panic attack and how i could have prevented the 3 hour argument that followed. 

i feel like all i’m doing is writing “relax and control my emotions” as the solutions or “ dont say anything” and things like that. i feel put down by this. my emotions are part of who i am. they make up a lot of who i am. i feel like these sheets are just making me compliant. 

any advice for dbt solutions or perspective on this feeling?",1642056815,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-13 06:53:35,1,0,

Struggling after breakup with FP,"i realized recently that i pushed away my fp/bf/best friend into breaking up with me because i feel like i don’t deserve his love or affection. over the last few days i’ve been spiraling and regretting the decision. i wish i could go back in time and not breakup with him. i still love him so deeply and i want him back, but both of us have decided to work on ourselves. he says he doesn’t know what the future holds and we could have a future again but i fear he’s going to move on and i’ll be even more crushed. we want to stay friends and he wants to support me while i’m struggling but he wants to distance himself so i don’t become too dependent on him. i just want him in my life and i want to be with him romantically because i love him but i’m terrified that he’s gone forever and that i’ve scared him and pushed him too far away. i just want to be in his arms and feel like everything is okay again. i wish i could go back and be with him but i can’t. i just don’t even know how to cope right now.",1642052935,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-13 05:48:55,1,0,
My identity is so broken,"i feel completely different from moment to moment. if i'm not currently feeling a certain emotion, i can hardly talk about it because i have no connection to it and i only know i even felt that way because of my journal entries.

i constantly contradict myself; i'll say one thing one moment, and the complete opposite the next. it makes me sound so fucking stupid and i hate it. it doesn't feel like it was me saying the thing, but in the moment it does, but there never really feels like a true ""me.""

i can hardly talk about my symptoms and experiences because i'll say something with 100% certainty and explain how it affects me, but later i'll have absolutely no clue what i was talking about. i'm so scared people will think i'm lying because it is confusing when someone tells you they experience something one day, then it seems like it was never even an issue, but then they start talking about it again as if it was the main issue in their life.

my therapist is always confused as to how i can be so determined to do something, but the next time i talk to her it's like i never felt that way in the first place despite nothing changing.

i can never describe myself. i mean sometimes i can say what i think about myself in the moment, but it never stays the same and nothing ever feels right. it's not just trying to ""discover"" myself, there will literally never be a consistent answer because of how broken i am.

it's so obvious to everyone around me; my friends, my family, my therapist and every single other mental health professional i've talked to. i hate it. i don't know how i'm even supposed to fix it when i can't connect to certain parts of me no matter how hard i try because it literally does not feel like me if i'm not currently feeling/thinking it.",1642052752,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-13 05:45:52,1,0,

How to best support/handle someone close to me who is splitting?,"my partner is struggling with is what suspected to be bpd, or at least bpd tendencies. (actively in treatment). 

disclaimer: i am not at all a mental health professional. this is based off of my experiences with this person, their family history, what *my* therapist suspects based off of my experiences/their behavior and my own research. i am not assuming a diagnosis, and i’m aware that i’m incapable of coming to any for sure conclusion - i’m simply here in hopes of gaining more education &amp; tools to support my partner. they meet the dsm-5 criteria for bpd. 

ultimately, they shuffle between demonizing me (and everyone else in their life) and treating me like i’m the best person they’ve ever met. within days, they switch between “i’ve never felt so loved by someone as i do by you”, to “all you do is hurt me” with no apparent reason 

we’ve split up in the past, and i’ve only ever offered to work on our issues however we can. they’ve switched between, “i don’t want to be with you”, to calling me their partner within days with no explanation/communication. i asked them where we stood, and they flipped on me again in less than 24hrs. that night, we had plans with a friend the next morning and within a day, they blocked said friend and told me we aren’t together because i asked if we were together. 

i’m just confused, i love them more than anything and just want what’s best for them. if they’re not willing/ready to work on our relationship, that’s fine. if they want to, i’m here for it. i understand this is all related to their history of mental illness, so ultimately i just want to know how best i can support them during these times. i’ve been giving them space to process their emotions.

i just want to feel better. i want to know how to cope with the symptoms i have been experiencing all of these years off and on. i have done the risky behaviors like sex, drugs, alcohol, etc. i cling to certain people and lose it over the slightest things, thinking they are leaving me, hate me, keep me around for sympathy, etc. i push people away before they can hurt me. i self harmed for many years, only now am i struggling with it again. intrusive thoughts are creeping in more and more. my mood is up and down. i lose my cool, falling into rage or hysterical crying, and shut it off most of the time.

next week i am meeting with my doctor again. if this is truly what has been my biggest hurtle yet, i know i can tackle it. as long as i know the platform that i could be standing on, i will be able to recognize the direction i need to go and how to live a much better and happier life. i know it won't fix me, i know that i won't be better. but i can work towards getting better. and i can help those closest to me understand what is going on inside of my head. i can even understand what is going on within myself better. i just want to understand why i am the way i am and try to make myself a better person.",1642024929,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-12 22:02:09,1,0,

Doppelganger,"i guess i'm just here to share my story in a way i never have before, hoping it will help.  i didn't even know i had bpd until like a year ago.  i knew i had something for a long time.  just didn't know what.  my therapy sessions were unfortunately interrupted before they could continue in a more eye opening direction.  my therapist knew i had bpd, but i eventually learned from her notes  unbeknownst to her that there is possibly more to discover.  i'm 30 now, but i've been afflicted with bpd and whatever else since i was about 15.  so for half of my life.  i have been told my story is irregular, but i wish i understood it better.  

the first half of my life was extraordinarily normal.  wonderful, happy, and naive.  childhood.  when i was 15 i learned more deeply of many things.  brotherhood.  love.  betrayal.  confusion.  so many swirling things that may be pieces of my innermost puzzle, but are simply the boarder in my eyes.  easy to assemble compared to the rest.  it's where you begin.  after attempting to cope with betrayal on multiple accounts i, discarded someone i truly loved.  the first person i ever loved completely.  i did that for lust with another.  for sex.  for passion.  i learned a great deal about these things over a couple years and then the passion died.  i then discarded that second much more physical love, for another.  one more beautiful.  more captivating.  more elevated.  more calm and innocent.  these things attracted me.  it was my life, but in her eyes i believe i saw something new.  this love was truer and different than all others before it.  it was brighter and warmer and something hardly describable.  it was the difference between love, loving, and being in love.  it was the wind in my fist.  

a turning point that was meant to be.  that love left me and i was the on the short end of the stick for once.  i was left.  i was a shell of the young man i was before that moment.  i was 18 at thar point and pain was my new ally.  my traveling companion.  onward and forward i had to go, onto a new form of love with another.  like that's all i knew.  a love of infatuation and distraction, and yet a love of true friendship and sexual magnetism.  it was fleeting and intoxicating.  it was my destiny.  left again i was a curious being.  i grew eyes that looked for emotions others could not see.  i made a new friend and i tortured her for a thousand years with what was to come.  i bonded souls.  i turned a living beautiful being into a catalyst for my rage and insanity.  i found true love.  this woman was kindness itself.  her tears would carve you into something stronger, if only to keep her from crying again.  her smile was a dream you would see for a decade.  i was respected with her love.  unconditionally made real with her undeniable favor.  

this gemstone of a human being took from me my heart.  i was not aware of this at the time.  when life swept her away from me to another location, as years passing often do take from us what we love and what loves us, my soul was torn in two.  at least in two.  my face was ripped in two different directions and when you found a smile on one you would find a frown on the other.  a doppelganger lived in the mirror.  a partner to switch between.  the light and shadow, but without balance.  i survived for years because of these two parts of me, keeping light trapped within.  i traveled.  i got her back.  i made real what was dreamed of.  i lost her again.  i traveled.  years pass.  she found me or fate found us.  the stars aligned briefly.  i experienced true happiness after years of mostly pain, addiction, and loneliness.  i left her.  lost her.  time passes again.  reconnected one day after everything had changed.  one last night together.  no sex for once.  just being together.  side by side.  best friends for one last day.  i never saw her again.  i don't know if i'll ever get a chance to.  

i chose to move forward with someone else every time i had convinced myself there was no point in waiting for her, and she did the same.  eventually i found a new kind of happiness.  one that lasts.  a love that has substance.  a love that is my current life.  it is the current adventure.  what i am figuring out now.  

my dreams though were tethered to my past.  i gain no serenity.  i'm allowed no peace of mind.  i am rage incarnate, as i became throughout my journey.  i am a whirlwind of fears and heartache and disposition.  i am always alone and yet always in the company of another version of myself.  always a shifting presence away from unwavering selfish indulgence.  i have lost some of my closest friends to the songs my heart sings.  for those i've allowed to hear it have betrayed me and turned me into that same boy fifteen years ago.  i miss them, those friends.  my only spiritual healers both left me.  i cast my new life into distance.  a hermit feels less for those he does not see.  i do not dream anymore, for my prayers to the old gods keep my dreams at bay, and insomnia has been my price these fifteen years.  it has been a blessing in disguise.  in those waking hours i wrote many fairy tales and adventures.  poetry and art.  

i scrape by now.  in so many ways.  the hysterical laughter of the man i keep caged inside me makes it's way through my lips more and more every year.  for if shadow loves that woman, or perpetually some archetype of her rather, the light is my diligence to cage it now.  it is my chosen being, so that i may have the slightest control over when i am the other.  when i'm alone i am shadow.  i remember, i laugh, and i cry, and i love who i love, and i lust, and i use, and i destroy, and i create.  i'm both a king and a servant.  both the hero and the villain.  the knight and the dragon.  i am the person you despise, and a man you love.  i am greatly misunderstood.  i'm on the borderlines of personality disorder and a gift.  i would not be different if i could.  i would change the world to understand.  that's what i will do with my writing.  i believe there's magic in storytelling.  i believe i sacrificed enough to make it all worth it.  i believe.  

i would give anything to have my cake and eat it too.  to make love to who i wish without breaking hearts.  to allow myself to be myself without holding back, but this world is not full of the understanding.  it is full of fragility and readiness to blame those with more destructive natures.  every day i fear i will allow myself to relax, and the cage will open, and i will be seen as the monster rather than the man.  the secret is that it was the monster who created my proud art, who persevered, who was tenacious, who attained what was lost, continuously, even if temporarily each time.  how i miss the full moon of these words.  how i miss letting go and devouring this world.  how long will it be before i'm free again?  these words ring in my mind.",1642009367,TRUE,BPD,2022-01-12 17:42:47,1,0,

we have been together for a few years and also have a child together, but i’ve always felt a stronger and closer connection to my bestfriend. and i won’t lie, i used to think i had feelings for her in the beginnings of our friendship even though we always had significant others, then that feeling went away, then it would come back, go away again for a bit, then come back again. i obviously have bpd which is why i’m posting in this sub lol so i would always blame it on that, maybe my mind is getting confused, maybe i just love her so much as a friend and my bpd brain is telling me otherwise? 

anytime i dream of her and we end up kissing or doing anything sexual it feels so real and natural in the moment, and then i wake up and feel so confused, angry, jealous? that it wasn’t real? i don’t know what to think anymore, there was a point before she kind of seemed interested and so many instances where i could feel the tension between us but i feel like we both ignored it. we always called each sisters and said we couldn’t ever date cause of how weird it would be… but anytime we get drunk we end up making out for “fun” (when we were single ofcourse) &amp; i always avoid holding her hand, or cuddling with her of any sort cause i just feel like it would be too much for me idk?

The hours/morning after a bad episode is always the most sobering and disgusting thing,"last night i split really really bad on my roommate. i was super stressed out because my car decided to overheat constantly, due to two large holes we found in the coolant hose last night. we tried to patch it up with duct tape but it didn’t work. we added coolant and it didn’t work. i drove 10 miles under the speed limit and it didn’t work. i had to pull over every 3-5 minutes, which is stressful enough given i usually have to drive at least 40 minutes every night to pick my roommate up from work and drive home to our isolated apartment. he kept telling me about “you should’ve done what i said and now we’re screwed” which he wasn’t wrong about, but it’s not what i needed to hear when i could see thick smoke coming out of my hood and couldn’t stop thinking about the financial cost of getting a new car as the lone driver. 

i snapped. there’s no excuse for it and i’m so embarrassed. i screamed and swore and sobbed and said some gross and manipulative things i shouldn’t have. i meant it at the time, but i shouldn’t have said it. last time i reacted so poorly to some major stressor was way before i graduated dbt in october.

"FP is doing a tech purge, afraid he won’t be in contact with me as much anymore","my fp had been talking about ditching his smartphone and replacing it with a nokia or something similar, with the hopes of becoming “less contactable”. 
we do not live together, but we do see each other once or twice a week. we’ve been dating for a year and a half now and (in my experience) texting and calling each other in the days we spend apart has been quite a big part of our relationship. in fact we even met on the internet. 
in the past year or so, there’s been a few instances where he hasn’t responded to my calls or messages for 24-48 hours at a time. each time i told him this really upsets me. when he’s not responsive it triggers me emotionally, and makes me feel like he’s going to abandon me. i’ve addressed the issue with him on a few occasions and each time he makes me feel like he’s going to do better, only for him to do the same thing a few days or weeks later. now that he’s bought a block phone with the hopes of being less contactable, that makes me feel like he doesn’t care about our contact at all, and the issue’s only going to get worse for me. 
he’s only had it two days now and his contact with me has already been very little. i’m not even paranoid about him being with other people or anything like that, i just get so anxious when we’re apart and i need to check in every few hours. 
when he initially bought the phone i tried to ask him if he would text me as much but he laughed at my concern and blew it off.

she says i need to love myself more so she can love me but she doesn't understand thst my self love comes from her love and support, whenever she is happy with me and we've had a great day out or just a great night, i feel much more confident within myself and in those moments i have a sense of self and purpose and feel like i can achieve my ambitions. likewise when she is sad or having negative thoughts, especially about me and bdp it's the opposite and i feel like she's going to abandon me even if i've made it up entirely in my own head.

"I think we finally had ""the talk""","see my post history for context. the short version is i hated a girl with qbpd years ago, we broke up, now we're talking again. she's dating somebody else but we've both admitted we're still very much in love with each other still. and how she feels about her boyfriend is... not quite as strong as her feelings about me.



anyways.



this conversation has been a long time coming, i think. tonight i asked her about our relationship, her and i. and she told me she's focused on working on her relationship with her current boyfriend. the controlling, abusive guy. the guy that's given her bruises, insults her, and has threatened to put her in a homeless shelter. and i pretty much lost it, as much as that's a thing for me. i told her that i can't be her backup plan for when the thing she actually wants doesn't pan out.



he's the one that manipulated her into a relationship and then dropped the mask after that first year like a lot of guys do when they think they've ""won"" the relationship like it's some kind of game. and she admits that. she recognizes the abuse. but apparently she's also afraid of getting hurt again by me. when we were together, she put a *lot* of reliance on me. it was a pretty healthy relationship as far as somebody with bpd goes, but i gave out from under her and i think the thought of that absolutely terrifies her. 


in the meantime, it turns out that she's been getting worse with sh and having episodes over... well, me, whenever i have one of my low days where i miss her too much. i don't know what she's thinking when that happens, if she's wanting to be with me but feeling obligated to stay with him, or wanting to be with me but being afraid... i don't know. but i don't like the idea of her hurting herself like that over me.



i don't know what to do. from what she's said i'm the only person that makes her feel like somebody genuinely cares about her. but i also don't understand why she can face all this with her current partner and not just fucking *leave*, because somebody who does all that and says those things to somebody who's already been through so much abuse and trauma is a fucking monster.",1641960003,TRUE,BPD,2022-01-12 04:00:03,1,0,

"(UK) newly diagnosed, feel hopeless after been told I have to wait almost 2 years for treatment","hi, new here, 21f from the uk. 

i’m feeling pretty hopeless because i’ve just been diagnosed, and told that there is an almost 2 year long waiting list for me to get treatment. 

i have a history of mental health problems (anxiety &amp; depression dx @ age 13) and have been on a variety of antidepressants, none of which have helped. they’ve all had side effects that ultimately made me feel worse (feeling numb, like i’m not real, can’t cry, excessive sleepiness that severely impacted my life, lack of emotion &amp; more. didn’t realise this until i stopped them). i was never less suicidal or depressed on these meds, they just alleviated anxiety. 

 i stopped taking the most recent one (setraline) last march and it was like i felt human again. i could feel all my emotions again but this has obviously made me more tearful in the low moments. i can also feel anger again. my mood swings became more severe. i also had these intense mood swings from the age of about 9-13 years old, so initially i thought i was hormonal and stopped my birth control as well as the antidepressant. this made no difference and these mood swings continued until my mother forced me to see a doctor as she believed i had bipolar disorder and she felt i needed a mood stabiliser. 

i’ve just now been diagnosed with mild-moderate depression (which feels ridiculous considering how severely debilitating it is when i’m in a depressive period) and bpd/eupd due to trauma from my childhood. the psychiatrist i saw advised that i try another antidepressant (venlafaxine) and then has put me on the 20 month waiting list for treatment. 

i feel so hopeless because i have no faith in this new antidepressant and it feels like an insult to have to wait this long for treatment when i cannot live my life normally (they did not specify what treatment it would be). just needed somewhere to vent this as i feel like i’ve lost all my friends recently, and of course if anyone has advice it would be appreciated :’)",1641956684,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-12 03:04:44,1,0,

Dealing with NOT being someone’s FP anymore/breakup/guilt,"hey, so in summary i (22f) was in a relationship for a year with someone (23m) who has bpd. 

i’ve never been so happy with anyone before as i was in this relationship and he vocalised a lot how he felt the same. in typical style, we were pretty obsessed with each other throughout the relationship, but it didn’t feel unhealthy at the time. i didn’t realise he had bpd when we were together so i didn’t see any triggers that i can now looking back. it’s also worth mentioning that i have quite an anxious attachment style myself, so the ‘love bombing’ i received from him when i was his fp and he was in the obsession stage made me feel really secure and trusted in him 100%, something i normally struggle with.

fast forward, the last 2 months of the relationship took a very rapid downward turn leaving me feeling so confused and hurt. he received some bad personal news which i think accelerated this. he completely went cold and distant from me, very different to his normal affectionate self and when i confronted him about the change in his behaviour he said he felt empty and we decided to go on a couple weeks break so he could figure himself out. during this break, he was behaving pretty impulsively and i found solid evidence to believe he had been cheating on me for the last month, so i ended the relationship.

this was just over 6 months ago now, after the breakup he quickly got into a relationship with the girl i suspected him of cheating with. i feel like the whole time i was delusional and it wasn’t as real for him as it was for me even though my heart feels that’s not true and want to believe it was genuine. he had confessed a lot of his emotional struggles to me and i find it so hard to believe that his new relationship isn’t just a distraction from ending ours when things started to take a negative turn so he could emotionally leave me before i left him. but at the same time i feel so much guilt for ending it and keep on looking back overanalysing things i did or said to make him start ‘splitting’. i miss him, blame myself, and keep trying to rationalise his behaviour by justifying it through his mental illness.

i guess i just needed to vent to people who may understand his behaviour more than i do or have any insight into how to cope with the aftermath of it all. i’ve never experienced someone suddenly shut down like that before. i feel so angry, hurt, and confused, but i’m still mourning the person i thought he was and the relationship we had. i’ve thought about re-visiting therapy because of the impact this has had on my trust and self-esteem. any advice or words of encouragement?",1641223787,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-03 15:29:47,1,0,

"If you tend to get low / depressed around your period, have you found that psych mediation has helped?","hi guys 

i’ve been considering going back on medication for a while because i’m currently in recovery and have been in dbt for a couple of months. it has helped a lot and i’ve been making progress which i’m really excited about!

ever since i was a teen (i’m 24 now) either before, after, or during (usually before) my period i’d get severely depressed and su*cidal. it feels like bpd but faster but bpd is already fast enough so i feel like i’m stuck on a rollercoaster ride until my hormones chill 😭

i take birth control and it’s helped with acne, preventing pregnancy (lol), and i don’t get cramps anymore. but my moodswings are horrible. and i’m very irritable and snap more. i find it so much harder to control myself and my emotions during my period and it makes me feel like i’m regressing and i hate it :( my emotions are extremely volatile during my period and i literally feel like i’m on a rollercoaster ride and i cry so much and i feel hopeless and depressed. i hate it. 

i’ve suspected i may have pmdd for years and spoke to my doctor and they suggested i may have it too but i never looked into it further. so i guess what i’m asking is does psychotropic medication also help with moodswings during periods for any of you?  

either way i am going to get back on medication as my therapist suggested but i really dread the low lows, ideation,, irritable ness, moodiness, crying and depression

so just looking for some advice please :)

i am 27 and recently got diagnosed with bpd and my diagnosis has really helped me move on and enjoy life more because i now know the correct coping mechanisms and i feel more validated etc etc but i can't stop thinking about all the time i have 'wasted' not caring, ruining relationships, opportunities and jobs. i am ready to move on and start fresh and started actually acting on the hobbies that i want to do.

for example one of my best friends lives in australia and i'm applying for a working holiday visa but it's only for below 30 year olds. i'm not quite there yet but i'm thinking what if there's other things i haven't done yet because i need to cram it into the last few years of my 20s? also, my boyfriend has done, seen and travelled to a lot more places than me which i love about him bit i always get a ping of jealousy because these are the things i've wanted to be doing but i've been too busy overspending and engaging in reckless behaviour to actually get myself motivated to do these things. 

i know this is irrational and i can't change the past but i can't stop it from making me feel down and i just want to press on and do what i want with my life.

in my efforts i often just end up making other people worried and upset, because it's so hard to regulate my emotions and impulses. i often push those who get close enough away as much as i can so they'd never come back because i feel like i become a hinderance. my friendships hardly ever last longer than a few months and then i'm back to being by myself and my favorite person who i'm way too dependant on. 

i don't feel like any community would accept me, so i end up isolating myself in my little safety bubble where i cannot do or say anything wrong. it makes me feel so lost in what kind of person i am becasuse i constantly switch sides trying to appeal everyone, but it never works out. nothing ever fits neatly in the good and bad category and i feel so lost in what i should do. 

another year passed by and i'm here yet again with no contacts remaining that i've worked towards building up over the previous year. yet i keep trying because i feel like i must, that maybe one day i will have a healthy net of friends or acquaintances that i won't feel like i am a burden to and i won't let them control my life either.",1641176343,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-03 02:19:03,1,0,
Am I ok to feel annoyed?,"my partner was feeling unwell on nye and we have no rapid covid tests available near us as they are all sold out. i've kept one in my cupboard incase i need it.
as my partner was unwell i offered it to him to make sure he wasn't suffering from covid. the test was negative.
the next day he was still feeling terrible. i reminded him he had planned for one of his friends to visit him today to which he sighed and said he would cancel those plans as he feels too sick and needs rest. i said that was  a good idea and told him to let me know if he'd like me to come over tonight and cook him dinner and help out. he then left my place at around 10am.

i messaged him at 3pm to ask if he wanted me to come over that night and he  replied saying ""if you want to come over a bit later then yeh i’d like you to be here :) friend 1 is here, friend 2 and 3 are coming a bit later. brothers there too. i’ve had a couple drinks now and feeling okay haha. if you come over i’ll just buy us dinner? you’ve paid for enough by now, i’m happy to buy dinner. if you’ve got something you can do tonight instead though then i won’t be upset haha""

to this i said dw ill just stay home today because it made me annoyed he was too sick to function in the morning enough to want to use me only antigen test, but not too sick to invite the boys over and drink.

"Comparing BPD and autistic communication - looking for resources, stories, support","heya! hope it's ok to post here. 

i'm autistic and don't have bpd, but i'm in a polycule of 5 with 2 people who experience bpd, and 1 person who experiences very much my type of autism. one person describes their bpd as petulant and the other says they experience it in more of an internal fashion (withdrawing in, trying to mediate, over-explain etc).

i love my polycule so so much and we had a huge discussion last night about communication and realised just how different autistic and bpd communication is. 

for myself and my other autistic partner, emotion isn't really a ""thing"". the world works in systems, numbers and processes and when something doesn't have a solution or can fit into a process, we're so lost. autistic communication, even about emotional problems, works like scientific debate which from the outside can look like ideas are being shut down and a person is being rejected. when really what we're doing is breaking down the components of an idea, analysing what will/won't work, reframing, fitting it into a flowchart and waiting for someone to vet our logic to potentially disprove it or present new logic. we often don't feel validation is needed because we work in such a ""yes/no"" way even with complex issues.

example of a thing that happened:
autistic partner - uses statement ""people like you""
me - knows this means ""people categorically who experience bpd in a similar fashion"" and no emotions are attached, it's just a statement. in the same way you would describe something as red, tall, light, cold etc.
bpd partner 1 - raises tone and is upset because this appears to have negative connotations
bpd partner 2 - agrees that this wasn't ideal to say, withdraws
me/autistic partner - *buffering noises*



we realise how how starkly different bpd communication is, we all had a laugh over it together, all apologised and we understand each other so much better now. it honestly feels like there's more to love having had this revelation and knowing so much more about each other. in terms of the above, i learned ""people like you"" was a categorical descriptor in the context of autism but a judgment of personal worth and validity in the context of bpd.

i'm really invested in learning more about bpd, particularly in the context of autistic/bpd communication. i'm hoping to find resources, stories, support etc so i can mentally catalogue and apply new processes/ways of communicating and rewording my thoughts in a way that is outwardly easily readable.",1641173536,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-03 01:32:16,1,0,

i am a 27/m diagnosed bpd that displays more quiet bpd symptoms on average. 

this time of year is about the worst possible time for me. we have christmas which i loved as a child but absolutely despise now, then new years which is a time where i look around at other people and really just see the differences between me and them and feel incredibly alienated from the rest of humanity (more than usual that is). finally to cap it off we have my birthday in the next few days and that's a very high point of sadness and despair typically for me.

Why does my BPD cause me to be unhealthily obsessed with romantic interest I barely know?,"bpd is hell in itself to deal with, but the biggest issue i have is how obsessed i become with certain people. it’s usually romantic interest that i haven’t known for long, and despite not knowing them, i make what i do know my world. i’ll think and talk about them non stop, and that’s even with little to know contact. most of the time they’re just leading me on, but the people who do want to be with me i don’t want them, i want one specific person (which changes every few years) who doesn’t want me. often times i will s*lf h*rn or try to end my life when things go wrong with them. it’s actually very scary and concerning to me, because one day i’m scared one little thing will happen to tip me off and i’ll go to far. i’ll never be able to have or keep meaningful relationships if i keep on like this, because my friends know my issues but of course they get tired of my obsessive behavior rightfully so. also i’ll never be able to have a real meaningful relationship because i only fall hard for people who won’t reciprocate. i’m wondering how i can stop these obsessive behaviors, and thoughts. i’m so tired of thinking of someone who doesn’t even think of me or know me well, but i can’t stop it’s like my brain is on auto pilot.",1641025803,TRUE,BPD,2022-01-01 08:30:03,1,0,

im now starting to realize how much i hate the holidays + bonus (person w/o bpd who suspects). can someone actually answer pls and tell me if whatever im planning is actually the right way to go about this?,"every single holiday there is always turns into a fight. thanksgiving 2021 was the worst of them all, but somehow my family always finds a way to piss me off and its really annoying. christmas sucked this year because we all came down with covid so we couldnt even go anywhere. honestly it was horrible. today was bad too just because my family pissed me off again. i honestly cannot stand them sometimes its insane

now heres where the bonus comes in. i was on a group phone call with my friends earlier around 10:30 and my one friend, ""porshia"", who i happen to be the closest to, put her hometown friend on the call. her hometown friend, ""connor"" is someone i happen to be into as well. as soon as he gets in, 5 minutes later he says he has to go ""because... yeah"". i immediately told myself he felt awkward because im in there. granted realistically he most likely was awkward bc none of his own friends were in there (which makes no sense because hes met all of us before) so now im just concluding he was awkward because i was in it. 

i bet poshia, whos also his best friend, definitely told connor i was into him because why else would he be awkward if it wasnt because of me, especially considering he wasnt too awkward when we first met, and i even went to grab coffee with him by myself. and she definitely knows im into him because i fucking accidentally hinted it to her like a dumbass.

another thing, ive been trying to plan a hangout with her, another friend from school named ""alex"", connor and another one of porshias hometown friends. ive been asking porshia about it alot because im just here in quarantine and cant wait to get out of here (i have 2 more days left). there hasnt been a solid date yet for us to hang out because theres been no solid date set yet, but she has time to hang out with her other friends from home just spontaneously out of the blue. of course she has a right to do so but it pisses me off because why hasnt there been a solid date set for me to come down and hang out with you guys but you can spontaneously hang out with other people? i have no clue how any of it makes sense

as opposed to thinking about it too much im honestly just gonna vibe out here and wait for shit to hit the fan. i know i have no one else no matter what anyway so i might as well just wait for the day we stop being friends. its made worse by the fact that my dad and his family are leaving the country in a couple weeks, with my (dads) dog, who i believe is the only one truly there for me because people fucking suck ass

Hollow,"i’ve always felt insanely empty. my front being filled with externals such as hobbies, who i surround myself with, what i do, careers, school, etc. it’s so easily shaken since what even made me build this front was the feeling of being so hollow.

this hollow body carved with feelings of doubt, fear, anger due to feeling so out of place. nothing serves purpose anymore. i could do something to fill my time but in the end it’s so temporary and won’t fill me up. i’m just wandering around attributes of myself until i use them all up and have to face an empty, cold room again. i’m so exhausted. i don’t know what to do anymore.

everyone naturally has the anatomy— the structure even— laid out for them. they understand what makes them a person and still have a tangible understanding of individuality. i understand i’m an individual but why. how does this feeling of being an individual even make any sense i just know my externals but it all comes in and goes out just as fast. it’s so overused but it’s really “feeling like an alien” but it goes so much further than that. anger easily takes over this emptiness because i can finally latch onto something. it burns the inner carvings of myself up, burns others hell even scares others. i really just don’t know what to do to fight this emptiness. i love to write but it’s temporary.

Feeling like I’m losing it today.,"(tldr separated on vacation from my ex fp, began to spiral and called him, nervous about going back bc my psychiatric appointment is later in the month after i get back) 
my (19f) ex partner (20m) and i live together currently. i’m visiting home for the holidays, and have been struggling particularly with being away from him in addition to the solidification of our separation. last night it really hit me while writing a song that he doesn’t want one with anyone like me. the song was so depressing, revolving around themes of loneliness and emptiness. 
this morning i woke up with that heavy feeling in my chest. i had barely any motivation to get out of bed. i managed to shower, brush my teeth, and eat a little food, i even got outside and did some emotional release yoga in the sun (my fam lives in florida) but as i was lying down the overwhelming feeling took over. i began to spiral and cry. i was thinking about the fact that he will inevitably find someone else that he deems better than me. that he will give the new partner the quality of love that i didn’t deserve. that they will treat him far better than i did and he will wonder why he ever stayed with me. 
i went on a walk and called him. 
i tried my very hardest to prevent the call from becoming convoluted. i let him know that i was in a bad place and really just wanted to hear that he still liked me as a human, that he still cares about my existence. i asked him to apologize again for hurting me and he said no. that’s where i really lost it. 
i began to say manipulative things and he pointed it out. logically, i knew i was being manipulative, but my feeling told me otherwise. i told him this, but obviously that didn’t help. 
we ended up finding common ground and we both apologized for the ridiculousness that ensued. 
i’m really posting this because i have a psychiatric appointment very late in january, and i drive back up to our house tomorrow. i can’t bare to exist in his presence any longer.

I’m tired of being a loner but I can’t ever manage to keep friendships because of my splitting.,"i have one real friend and he is my ex boyfriend lol. 
it’s embarrassing but my only “friends”are all online. i say “friends” because it feels weird to describe people as my friends as i don’t trust anyone or feel like they like me. we talk about stuff. it’s not like we go out and do all sort of fun things real friends do. 
i talk to people at university but that’s to do with work, we don’t do anything outside university. it’s so boring. 

things like being left on seen or certain messages that seem like nothing but for me (a lot of us) is hell. 
i think to myself “oh, fuck you then. i don’t need you.” 
but i don’t say anything, i stop myself even though i want to be so rude to them (i am in my head)
and then they reply/send a message i like and i’m all happy again. 
..if they don’t i get soooo angry and think the worse of them and of course i think the worse myself. why would anyone want to be friends with me anyway. guys talk to me online because i’m “good looking”. frankly i’ve stopped entertaining them and pretending to think they genuinely want to get to know me for fun. 

i hate living this way but that’s how my brain works and always have. 

i find it incredible that some people’s friendship groups lasts a life time, could never happen to me because no matter how close we get it falls apart. it’s tiring. 
also takes long for me to get to be myself with someone because i don’t know who i am. frankly i think most people are boring and i rarely connect with people.

Jealously of my own creation,"seeking advice. i (27f) have been in a relationship with my so (30m) for about 3 years. it’s been rocky and we’ve broken up a few times in the past. but have always found our way back to eachother. 

this past year i fell into a deep split. i was depressed for months, was uninterested in anything, convinced i didn’t deserve anything i had and sought emotional validation elsewear (another male) out of fear (i know now) and of rejection so i left.. we were separated for 2 or so months. we both saw other people, but i can’t stop thinking about who he saw. someone he took on trip out of state.. after only going out “7 times” which was our thing. we always traveled everywhere together me it was something we loved to do with eachother. amongst other things. i know i am the one that left but in the truth i didn’t want too and it was the hardest decision i could’ve ever made but i didn’t want to hurt anyone anymore. i figured just being alone and single and not having ties to anyone was the right thing to do, it felt like the only thing to do.

these thoughts have been consuming me, i can’t stop thinking about everything to do with them together and it’s driving me crazy. it’s been 6 months since this all happened but i am still so hurt and it seems the farther away i get from that time we weren’t together the more and more it hurts.

but we couldn't go back to that dream days again you know. after the break ups and traumas (had to live without him for 2 months, all the terrible things i did, all the fights we had, all the shame, guilt and self hate) i couldn't be normal again. bpd came back (even stonger than before) with the first break up and never has gone again. i've started to being afraid of get abandoned so bad. i've became so jealous of everyone. i've started to want him next to me 7/24 and started to fight when he leaves home to see a friend. i've became so clingy and started to feel unloved or uncared whenever he does anything else includes me. i started to be so agressive and have destructive episodes whenever i feel like that.
everything has happened also fucked him up. probably worse than me. it triggered his trust and anger issues which are already a problem for him. he has started to gets angry much easier and gets calm harder. his situation and anger also started to trigger my bpd and it becomes a vicious circle. 
now both of us are exhausted and mentally fucked up. is there anyone who can suggest sth that can help me with this situation i've created with my own hands?",1641677207,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-08 21:26:47,1,0,
Hate this illness with a passion,"i suspected i had bpd for a while (23, f), it took me 6 years to get diagnosed, which finally happened in september of last year. i have nobody in my life who understands my illness. whenever i go into an episode people blame me and tell me it’s not hard to control, that all i do is cause chaos or drama. when it is so hard to control my episodes. i just wish i had someone who understands how hard it is for someone with bpd. i’ve lost friends because of my bpd and them blaming me for everything when they did some horrible stuff towards me to cause me to have a bpd episode, even my family are so hurtful sometimes. i feel so lonely and lost. i feel like i have nobody and i’m sick of people saying they know i have bpd but still blame and treat me like i’m some sort of monster when i show bpd symptoms.",1641673589,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-08 20:26:29,1,0,
Does sharing MBTI help keep the peace at work or add trouble when working closely with a person who I suspect has BPD? Other ways?,"there have definitely been communication issues on both parts.  he/she displayed a pattern of behavior consistent with what i've been reading about bpd, splitting episodes(pretty darn sure) and many other signs, but no confirmed diagnosis that i'm aware of. 

i'm a work mentor.it has been very rocky and intense, but i'm still trying to help. he/she suggested we exchange mbtis to help with the communication issues.

would this help somehow? or would this somehow be used against me? i'm a bit skeptical giving a person with a pattern of these behaviors the guide to how i operate. my mbti seems very accurate. though maybe it can help..

the goal is to create an environment i can help while making it a bit more comfortable for the both of us... and there can be no open conversation about the illness at this point. help is appreciated. thanks!

rapid mood swings are making me exhausted no matter how much sleep i get.,"i’d first like to say yes, i am medicated. i went on lamictal two years ago and have seen a drastic difference. i’m at the max dosage. lately though my mood swings have been so extreme. 

one moment i’m chipper and in a great mood, then ten minutes later i’m miserable. sometimes i even get very irritated and want to scream or hit
myself for no reason. it’s on and off all day. the nights are the worst, though, because that’s when i start to feel extremely depressed. 

the rapid mood swings are making me tired no matter how sleep i get. it doesn’t matter if i sleep for five hours or 8. when i say tired, i mean so tired that i can feel my eyes start to shut and i feel like i’m about to just drop to the floor. i’m very worried for myself. 

i reached out to my psychiatrist, but i don’t know what he can do. i don’t want to get off the lamictal. he pushes therapy, too, but i’ve seen therapists for years and it doesn’t do anything for me. i’m at a loss. i want to close

I thought I was better,"i'm sorry in advanced this is really confusing to read because i am confused.

after i got rejected 2 weeks ago, i completely cracked and did all sorts of unhealthy stuff. and good stuff like running and art. but in the end i got better. so i thought. is this some sort of depression after rejection, before that i was fine. everything was working sort of. but this one shitty person needed to ignore me and make me crack. i have 3 exams next week i couldn't study for because of my state of being. i feel like a worthless little whore who doesn't deserve this life. but i know if i give up now, all the suffering before was pointless. why can't i feel like i am something again? everything was great. i also can't fail ending it, if i do, i will be put into mental hospital again. and the one surrounding me is a  sinkhole full of idiots. there is no treatment no therapy, no therapist that talks to you. everyone sits on their asses and chills and smokes. nice hospital lol. why can't i be loved, literally everyone hates me. why can't i find love, only because i screw up every time. don't text them back or tell myself that love dos not make sense. and the people i want to be in relationship with never want to be with me. people that i want nothing from love me. god, why? why would anyone want to be in a relationship with me, i am crazy. my personality changes based on the clothes i am wearing. yesterday i was fine i felt good and motivated, thought finally it's over. finally, you survived it. but today these stress dos not leave. it's not even an emotion, i don't even know which one it is, it's stress or something like that. why can't i have intimacy? why can't i have a relationship that doesn't fall apart before it ever really existed? why did i tell myself it's fine to open up my emotions to that person for once? just once and let my feelings guide me like a psychiatrist advised me back when i was 17 and had love struggles. i did it and nothing worked out. i just sit her cry and break down. i want love, i want happiness. not only that, but i don't want to be alone. someone has to like me. why dos everyone finds a loving partner except me? the dumbest dickhead can find love, but me, a smart guy can't? why do i chase something that doesn't make sense? love is like live worthless but still worth the experience.  i have dyslexia, and therefor dating apps suck. but i want someone so bad. someone who can make me whole. make me feel and taste love, real love! but every time i try, i get destroyed. i should just give up, but i can't. i lose my life to corona. i'm 19 i should be happy. i should be partying. i love parties, for a split second you so round yourself with all of these happy people. for a split second, you're not alone. and full of feelings and positivity. i met a girl there, she was sweet, but i went silent, and we never spoke again. why is my life a photo album full of misery. no, that's wrong, there are always these moments where i feel like i am on top of the world. where i am a hero! where everyone loves me and adores me. but it all comes crashing down quickly when i realize everyone secretly hates me. when i stop covering the real me, who ever that is and tell people who i am, they all hate me. i'm a worthless piece of shit my mom was right all the time. i am an asshole since i was little. why can't these tension go away. will it go away? maybe after i wrote the exams and completely failed all of them. one is with the teacher who thinks i am a lacy bastard. wooh cool! i'm hyped for school going to be great. physics, math and politics exams. and i suck in physics and math! but i need to graduate, so i can escape this shit household staring my narcissistic mother. who knocks on my door just to tell me she's worried and the insults me. nice life man. all my childhood was  a lie. a lie full of insults, punishment and strange affection sometimes. why do i keep pushing? i shouldn't, but i do. because i am stronger than she is. i hate myself! please save me. if you made it through this till the end, thank you!",1641669578,TRUE,BPD,2022-01-08 19:19:38,1,0,

I wish mental health treatment was encouraged in society.,"seriously, if i got treatment for my mental health when i first started showing symptoms a couple years ago, i think i would be in a completely different place in life now. i'm 22 (and thats still young i know) but i have wasted a lot of my life , so much that i still feel like a kid and i'm stuck at the age of 13. i don't feel like i have changed or grown since then because my mental health has just been like this since that age and i have seen no real changes , so its like i'm mentally stunted. it sucks when other people are moving on and growing up and you are like stuck and not changing even when you desperately want to. i live in a family that just suffers in silence and thinks mental illness is not real. i remember when i was really depressed i was told i have a demon in me and i needed to pray everyday...like??? why isn't mental illness taken seriously? why is it so stigmatized ? why is it so expensive? i know for a fact if i got the treatment i need i would be way more functional and i would have an overall better quality of life...i'm tired of living this way. i've been like this for years , i'm so over it. wish i wasn't born this way and given mental disorders i didn't even ask for. why was i chosen to have this harder life ? and i don't think its any special reason either life is just unfair.",1641665138,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-08 18:05:38,1,0,
Should I tell my sister I hold grudges towards her?,"i am deeply, deeply mad, and hurt by my (more than a decade older) sister because of several harsh emotional invalidation moments.

my sister in general is a person who i think lacks emotional intelligence - an acknowledgment of others and her own emotions, empathy, compassion etc. or maybe she just lacks those with me. and i can't blame her for how she is but oh man, i do. that also makes me feel guilty because i love her and we also have good times (at least used to) although lately i've just been reminded of my pain whenever i'm around her. i'll try my best to not make this too long and wrap up the main situations that are haunting me. 

when i was in my late teens and finally could understand my emotions at least a little bit rather than just hide my discomfort in alcohol and drugs, i started to display symptoms of depression. i was very much hurt because of a triggering event that opened up all that pain i've been cultivating since i was little. i remember i came up to my mom and told her that my therapist told me that i have depression and i could really use some medication. my mom subtly brushed it off (although she was quite supportive before), i started to panick, my sister overheard our conversation because she was in the same room and classically told me i am not depressed, i am just lazy and people like me only need a kick in the ass. i was crying like a newborn baby and all i could hear was lectures on how i just need to suck it up and basically become a better person then my so-called fake depression would fade away. a few days later i was at my school prom and of course, i felt like not being there, i went and hid in the toilet. texted my sister that i feel bad and want to go home, i got an answer - 'what is wrong with you? learn to manage your emotions'. there've been several times during those depressed years where i was judged because of my state and was given feedback of how i am just very down and this is inadequate and unacceptable. then i fully learned that my emotions can't be shared with this person nor with anyone in my family and i started to wear a mask of a 'happy, normal person' otherwise i am called ungrateful and spoiled.

the next time, which really hurt me, was after several years when i texted her that my therapist diagnosed me with bpd (i have no idea why i felt like sharing, maybe i thought this would get me some empathy or compassion). the answer i've got was - 'i don't believe it, you definitely don't have it'. and she just told me how people just victimize themselves with these diagnoses and basically how the modern science of psychology and it's application is shit. that's all i've got. i've never ever told her anything about my feelings or bpd again, nor ever was i asked a question about it, it's been 2 years. 

the last event that really made me fire up was when she annoyed me and i asked her to stop, and criticized me and i was telling her so many times to stop commenting me and other family members, she blew up and said how crazy and too sensitive i am, i also started to yell and said that she doesn't understand how she impacts me and doesn't stop what i asked to be stopped. we got into a crazy fight, she hit me a bit, i hit her back. then i went to talk (because i can't handle conflict and always go and try to make peace at least on paper because otherwise i feel extremely anxious but i also feel very bad because others use me as a doormat because of this) but she didn't talk with me and only later said how i think that i am extremely traumatized and i am victimizing myself all over and all this bullshit and none acknowledgment of how i actually feel. 

sorry, this is extremely long... but i really just needed to vent and also ask you guys, should i tell her all these things? because now the last time i saw her she was nice but i believe nothing changed and this could easily happen again. but i also don't think she would understand and maybe again tell me that i am too sensitive and am victimizing myself and all that bullshit... maybe it is better to heal on my own and put this energy into learning how to establish boundaries and stand up for myself so that this doesnt happen again? rather than waiting for her to change...

I'm lost and confused,"hi all! 

not sure what i would tag this, but i have this weird situation where i just dont know how to maintain one single personality or set of emotions and logic? dunno how to explain it.

basically i was talking with a friend, everything is chill. suddenly, another friend pops up. with this friend i have already gone the cycle of (meet -&gt; click -&gt; over attach -&gt; burn out -&gt; them distancing themselves), however, when she appeared i immediately starting talking, acting and thinking as a few months before when i initially met. which is bad, because a few month before me was completely different as in i would objectify people among other things.

i don't know if i'm making sense, i'm currently in another episode hah but anyways.


my question is what kind of activities can i do so that whenever new people pass around i don't automatically switch completely and have composure of everything about me and basically continue functioning smoothly.

idk if this because of bpd or the bipolar side or dpdr but since its a personality thing ig i'm in the right place?

"Anyone feel like instead of healing after a breakup in a good way, you've maladapted and cemented yourself off from love? What can I do about it?","its been over 5 years since a 5 year relationship i had ended. since then, i feel like i've actually gotten worse and worse at being open to love again. at first i was a wreck in all the usual ways that a breakup hits you, and those aspects have gotten better (i no longer think of getting back with her or become a wreck when i think about her). in the traditional ways of ""getting over"" an ex, i've done it, and the pain of it all mostly feels behind me. except that, i've ended up becoming super closed off to new girls -- i very much compare them to my ex, and what really, really sucks, is that my ex had so many good qualities that are extremely rare each, and seemingly impossible to find a combo of. i feel like i'm looking for someone who more or less is a copy of my ex. and because i can't find that, i've just become more and more closed off. 

i used to date, and since covid started i really haven't. if i were to chart out on a graph how much i've actively tried dating since, it peaked a few months after breaking up with that ex, and has been on a steady downhill until flatlining when covid started. 

in short, i feel like instead of healing, i grew an emotional scar tissue so thick over my eyes that it's blinding me. and i don't know how to undo it -- because the cynicism i feel towards dating feels almost like it's...wisdom? except it's so damn cynical that i know it's crippling me emotionally and preventing me from finding somebody new. 

what the hell can i do about this? regular cbt therapy didn't help. dbt seems to have worn off (i don't really do the skills on my own now that i'm no longer in dbt therapy). is this some sort of soft-version of a trauma response that i should see a trauma therapist about? relationship therapist? like, it actively feels like it's getting worse and worse as time goes on, not better.

Can people with BPD have stable relationships?,"i'm going to start off with saying i am not diagnosed with bpd, but it is something i am considering.

a key feature i read about in bpd is unstable relationships. the few people i know with bpd have only been in long term relationships for a max of a few years, but they are on and off. 

i have been with my fiancé for 8+ years and love him faithfully. 

i have a handful of childhood friends that i keep in contact with, but few close friends as an adult. i find making friends very difficult and i prefer to keep to myself. 

i have made friends over the years but eventually i stop talking to them because they are too much to handle (i tend to attract people who are mentally unwell).

Coming clean about my mental health...,"(scroll to the bottom for tl;dr)

about a year ago i discussed the possibility of it with my therapist, who said i fit all the criteria (self-sabotaging, impulsivity, fear of abandonment, black and white thinking). however, i was also a minor at that point and i wasn't legally able to get diagnosed. my therapist said that borderline traits can be reversed in young people, but they become more permanent in untreated adults. she also suggested that my symptoms could be from my autism and adhd, which i was already diagnosed with.

nonetheless, i was desperate for validation of what i was going through. i felt like a monster for the thoughts and feelings i was having. i felt like everyone was leaving me, but i was so scared to talk about it because i felt that voicing my worries would only push people further away. and i had this underlying fear of being a ""crazy ex girlfriend"" type of person, which made me dysphoric. i felt like my clinginess and emotional sensitivity were too feminine, and that they somehow invalidated my trans identity. i was also scared of being a ""creepy stalker,"" which was a nickname my middle school classmates used to bully me. i felt like my emotional needs at that time were overstepping others boundaries, and i felt like a burden for not being more emotionally independent. i knew i couldn't make my ""problematic"" feelings disappear, and that made me feel like i was worthless. which only furthered the cycle of suicidal ideation.

i would repress all feelings of hurt, sadness, and anxiety, and i spent most of my time walking around like a robot. i did so for the fear of appearing ""crazy"" or being a burden. i would keep a straight face through any kind of distress i experienced, only to cry and scream into my pillow for hours when i got home.

all of this completely impeded my ability to understand lessons or complete assignments in school. and this lead to my teachers and parents getting frustrated with me, and i even got dropped from my pre-calc class for ""not making any progress."" which of course did no good for my already depleted mental health, and shortly after that i attempted suicide.

the treatment facilities i went to taught me valuable lessons in dbt, but caused me even more emotional distress than i had been experiencing before. my trauma was invalidated, i was referred to aba, and none of the staff knew anything about neurodivergence. at one point i was literally told to mask because it would ""make it easier for the majority of the world to not have to accommodate you.""

which in retrospect showed me how much of my problems did indeed stem from neurodivergence. rejection-sensitive dysphoria from adhd. black and white thinking from autism. trauma symptoms from years of feeling unheard. and i think me slapping the label ""bpd"" on it was my way of masking and avoiding the pain. as was hiding my emotions constantly. my suicide attempt was an autistic burnout from masking, not a borderline episode. 

i have been diagnosed with autism since i was 3 and adhd since i was 7, but i didn't get the help i needed. i didn't get on adhd meds until 2021, i was silenced for speaking up about my needs, and my parents had the assumption that i wasn't capable of making my own decisions and used my diagnoses as an excuse to completely dictate my life without my imput. of course i developed depression and anxiety at such a young age, i was going through hell and nobody could see because i didn't have the words to describe it! and of course i felt shitty all throughout middle and high school. i was given relatively large doses of psychiatric medications meant for adults, without recieving proper therapy. my therapist was ""focused on autism,"" but she supported autism speaks and thought i needed to be ""cured,"" and she didn't understand my mental health struggles or my gender and sexuality. i wish there was more discussion about the overlap of neurodivergence and mental illness. that would save so many people from going through what i went through.

tl;dr: i no longer think i have bpd, and instead believe i have been experiencing distress from lack of support and understanding for my neurodivergence. and i believe that rejection sensitive dysphoria and black and white thinking are just part of my neurotype, but have become unhealthy in my current circumstances. the ""fake it till you make it"" attitude i had was a form of masking, which inevitably lead to burnout. and that is why regular depression treatment doesn't work for neurodivergent folks!",1641613518,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-08 03:45:18,1,0,

what is getting a proper diagnoses like?,"i was recently in a mental hospital, and i asked one of the psychologists i was seeing there if i could get tested for bpd. i had taken dozens of online tests prior and researched a lot into the disorder, and a lot of it added up to me possibly being borderline. it would explain so much of my life, so i thought it was worth getting a proper diagnoses. in the hospital, the doctor pulled out their phone and listed about 10 criteria for bpd, and i said yes or no if they applied to me. i said yes to about 8 of them. the doctor said, “yep sounds like it,” and never brought it up again. it could be because i was seeing a few different psychologists there, and maybe they miscommunicated between each other, but i would’ve thought a diagnosis would’ve been more complicated than that. when i got tested for anxiety and depression, all a diagnosis took was checking out a few boxes on a paper. is getting a bpd diagnosis really that easy? i don’t want to self diagnose or anything and claim to be something i might not be. what is y’all’s personal experience with getting a diagnosis?",1641591037,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-07 21:30:37,1,0,

How can I stop being mad at him?,"my bf and i both have bpd. we’re doing really, really well and have learned how to handle each other for the most part. however, we both have above average expectations of each other in terms of communication. we both keep each other super up to date on the what/where/who’s, since being out of the know is pretty much both of our trigger. but naturally, we’re both human and sometimes one of us will forget to mention a person, or go somewhere without mentioning it, or have a change of schedule that isn’t mentioned, etc. when i do it, he gets mad, and i tell him i’m sorry, that i forgot, then give him as much detail as possible and propose some kind of solution that’ll make him feel better. he, on the other hand, is a non-apologizer. if he does the same thing, he doubles down. i find it unfair and we get into an argument until i inevitably say ‘but what if i did the same?’ and the argument ends. i stay mad, he doesn’t apologize, i get over it once i’m not having a moment anymore, and we’re fine again. 

it’s happening again, he didn’t talk to me all morning and didn’t go to work. we had a brief argument, i said ‘bye, i love you’ and hung up. he went to work, but didn’t apologize. he’s acknowledged in that past that he is incapable of apologizing, even if he feels like he should, and might never be able to. i understand that his psyche might just not be able to handle the shame associated with it but it’s upsetting to not have closure until i cool down myself. does anyone have advice on this?",1641590295,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-07 21:18:15,1,0,

we got back together this past sunday and it’s been great, but we went out to dinner last night and i don’t know, it just felt different.

Is it the BPD or is it a problem?,"ahhhh need some advice because i can’t tell whether what is happening is an issue or whether my bpd brain is making it one 😩😩

basically my boyfriend wanted to make a promise to eachother near the start of our relationship that if he quit smoking, i stop making myself in to a barcode if you get me? i was fully down for this. anyway less than 2 days after he broke this promise but denied it even though i smelt cigarettes on him. he eventually admitted it, i was a little pissed but forgave him. 
it’s been around 3 months now since this and various times throughout the 3 months he’s done the same thing and every time he lies about it. i’ve spoke to him and explained how every time it hurts me because i feel like he just doesn’t care about his end of the deal at all. 
he’s bought a vape and uses that when he’s with me but literally it seems as soon as he’s away from me (at work, at home, even going to the shops over the road) he has a cigarette. 
last week he told me he threw all his papers etc away so has no other means to be able to smoke but yet he did and when i asked how he said he ended up going to the shop to buy some more but he said that was the last of his tobacco. but then this morning he was leaving for work and i heard him rustling around with something in the drawer. he thought i was asleep but when he left i checked the drawer and it smelt like tobacco and had residue of tobacco in there. 
at this point my mind is spiralling because im fed up of having the same conversation with him over and over again with me confronting him and him lying for ages to eventually tell me the truth.

How do I deal with a bpd mother?,"honestly, don’t know where to post this. my parents got in an argument yesterday and my dad revealed my mom had bpd to me. i was always told by my grandma that my mum was a bit different.

Biggest attention seeker for my whole entire life,"i’m so mad at myself i have always been such an attention seeker. is this even normal like maybe this is normal person stuff but everyone’s too ashamed to say it aloud except me because i’m desperate for an answer at this point

in grade school i wanted to break my arm so i could wear a cast and get attention. yeah, i know that’s a common normal thing for young children so that’s fine.

but in high school i had this weird fixation on having appendicitis for months. it was half health anxiety but also half just like ??, attention seeking ??? like ?? literally went to the hospital over it once cuz i convinced myself of it. wtf. i never had appendicitis. i also got these bad anxiety stomach aches, which of course i blew out of proportion and saw so many doctors from childhood to like junior year of college. even had proceduresfor it. but i knew it was just anxiety. 

also in high school, i started sh. this was half genuine “coping mechanism” and made me feel relief. i was genuinely struggling, i won’t deny that. but i also can’t deny it was also for attention. i get that that is valid as for some people it’s a cry for help. but then when i got attention for that i hated it so much. i still do it to this day at times.

now, i’m afraid that all of my mental illness is attention based. the thought of being undiagnosed makes me feel awful about myself. i need people to know i’m suffering all the time. sometimes i worry that i tricked my therapist into diagnosing me with this. or that maybe she’s just humoring me. i’m constantly holding onto any diagnosis, validation, anything i can get. is this normal?? this is the first time i’ve been genuinely honest with myself about this stuff, i’m afraid to tell my therapist, i’m afraid i’m grasping at straws. i know i’m suffering on a severe level, but have i slowly done it to myself?",1641282016,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-04 07:40:16,1,0,

i don’t know if he’s still interested as much as i am anymore, but if so, how do i calm these thoughts. a huge part of me wants to run away and block him and never look back. that’s the impulse. but apart of me really wants to grow and communicate as best i can. i just can’t help feeling like a constant fuck up.",1641279194,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-04 06:53:14,1,0,

Realization and acceptance are hard,"i’m rambling a little, and i’m sorry, i just wanted to vent and be proud and sad…and i figured if anyone is going understand the rollercoaster of emotions i can go through within hours…it’s you guys.


my fp and bf of 4.5 years broke up with me in july and moved out.  this week, january 9th to be exact, would have been our 5 year anniversary. at first i was convinced we would get back together.  we love and care for each other…how could we not!?

i’ve posted before about how it has become obvious he is moving on starting in early november.

the last straw was within 24 hours 3 weeks ago he went from wanting to talk about their possibly being something between us again, to telling me he decided to move forward with someone else.

i’ve been “dating” since i first found out he was dating. i’ve been on 3 first dates.  one guy i really hit it off with pretty well. we actually went on several dates. but it was pretty obvious we had a lot of differences that would be difficult to overcome long-term.

i was sooo proud when i asked him if he felt the same way i did…that i liked him, but wasn’t sure we were compatible. he agreed and we decided not to see each other anymore. 

in the past, i would have kept quiet and “molded” to his values.  or, continued on a physical relationship even knowing a serious long-term relationship would likely never happen.

so proud.  but. that’s not the end. because it bolstered me to be more bold and forward in my online dating profile and messages to guys. (i want to try to find something real, i don’t want hook-ups, and i do not want to be in a ethically non-monogamous relationship (no hate, i have a lot of friend who are, and i’ve tried, it’s not right for me).

but setting my boundaries and stating them so clearly made me realize how much my ex and i are different.  and i’m not saying he didn’t try to compromise for me, but he wouldn’t bend his values, and i did. all. the. time.   because i loved him and i wanted him to love me and stay with me

and i was proud of this realization too…but so sad. it just hit me like a ton of bricks.  i never will be with him again.  it’s really not going to happen. even now, i want to backtrack and tell him i’ll change.  i’ll do whatever he wants. i’ll be whoever he needs (hint: been there, tried that, do not recommend)

i’ve been talking to a guy for just a few days. he seems really amazing and we do have a date set up.  but he also works different shift than i do, so now the weekend is over, and i don’t have the communication from him i did, i just started dwelling on my ex again.  

so. i’m excited and nervous about this new guy, proud for setting boundaries and communicating needs with the “dating” guy, proud for being able to take that idea of non-compatibility and apply it to my ex…..which then made me so sad and full of grief again of losing him.

i’m sick of telling my tale of woe to my therapist (appt on wednesday), i’m worried my bff is getting sick of my grief as well(but saying she does not like my ex is an understatement so i know she’s glad we’re not together).

sigh. and 99% of all my other friends are mutual friends with my ex and i refuse to talk about him with them.

i just want to feel…..stable.  for one week…could i just have a nice baseline of contentment and no intense up and down emotions!?

i want to be able to think of my ex and feel the same way about him i do my ex-husband. nothing emotional.

BPD is so frustrating because it’s your responsibility to fix something caused by other people,"i didn’t wake up with this, i wasn’t born with this, i wasn’t genetically bound to have it. it was something that developed as a direct result of being treated horribly by people that were supposed to protect me. it was a result of being taken advantage of, abused, and neglected. i didn’t wake up on morning and decided at 9 year olds i was going to try to kill myself. i didn’t want to or choose to sleep with 30 year old men at 13. i didn’t choose to eat myself into a coma because of the awful mood swings, to compulsively lie, to disassociate to the point i didn’t know who my own mom was, to self harm so i had one thing in my life where i decided what i felt and how i was harmed. i didn’t want to try to commit suicide 5 times by the time i was 15. i didn’t want to be on prescription meds and in therapy since i was 9. i didn’t want to hurt others and lose control of my anger. i didn’t want to be a problem child. i didn’t want to go to residential when i was 12 or constantly be hospitalized or forced to be on home bound because i was a “high risk student”. i didn’t ask for any awful thing that has happened to me. i didn’t want to be another statistic. people view us as monsters and narcissists because of our disorder, but the reason we have it is because of actual monsters who ruined children. and now we are stuck with the after math. we’re stuck with the hard work and all the awful things that come with bpd. and its stupid and it fucking sucks. that’s all just wanted to get that off of my chest.",1641264390,TRUE,BPD,2022-01-04 02:46:30,1,0,

The jealousy and selfishness eats me alive,"i really hate it. i hate the person this disorder can make me be. i can be so god damn selfish, and it's embarrassing. i live with my fiance and his brother, and said brother just broke his ankle, and while i feel super, genuinely awful about it happening, and i really feel for him (i broke my leg 2 years ago so i get it), i can't stop thinking about how this means i'll be getting less attention from my fiance. i also feel like a part of my identity is being usurped?? my broken leg was 2 years ago, but it's still one of the biggest things people ask me about.

so i guess i'm jealous about my soon to be brother-in-law's broken ankle, and it's absolutely pathetic. how selfish am i?? i still feel really bad for him, and i plan to help as much as possible, but i already get stupidly upset whenever my fiance spends time in his brother's room away from me, and i dread this jealousy is only going to get worse now and possibly end up costing me my relationship.

i plan to work as hard with my therapist as possible to mitigate and try to find tools to cope. my fiance notices the shift in my mood and keeps asking me what's wrong, but how the hell am i supposed to tell him that while i feel really bad for his brother, i'm worried about less attention? he might understand, but also he might see it as really selfish and be disappointed/disgusted in me. rightfully so. i'm not proud of how i feel, and i reeeaally wish i wasn't like this. it's going to be a rough few months.",1641263287,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-04 02:28:07,1,0,
Things were going well but now so much has gone wrong,"sorry in advance, this is coming from a really disorganized and panic filled spot in my life.

in october i (19f) broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years. prior to then i'd never suspected i had bpd, though i was officially diagnosed with asd and ocd in august, and upon diagnosis i realized a lot of the overlap between bpd and asd applied to me and i started to suspect things. 

after a lot of self-destructive behaviors/hypomania/mood swings, i felt like things were kind of evening out. i'd met a new guy (20m), we established a ""casual"" relationship but he did say he had feelings for me. i had mentioned before i just got out of a relationship and needed to take things slow, and he said the same had happened for him basically and that his prev. relationship wasn't good for him bc ""his problems became hers and her problems became his"". still i could feel myself getting attached really quick and i could feel myself wanting to act out but i wanted so bad for things to work. i know people always say that romantic feelings with fwbs and stuff never work out but i just wasn't clear on if we were fwbs?? i still kind of don't know.

on the 31st i found out i was positive with covid and immediately i told everyone i'd been in close contact with. of course that included this guy, even though it had been well over a week since i'd seen him and it's really likely i got this after i had seen him. still i was super worried for everyone and i felt so guilty at possibly infecting them. my sister has been reassuring me it's not my fault and with omicron being so infectious that it could've been anyone but it was just me but i still feel so! bad!

anyways, he was reasonably upset, especially because he lives with his grandpa but he also kept saying it was okay and shit happens. but he then told me that he didn't know if he could trust hanging out with me with this covid stuff happening, and that this has all been stressful and not ""casual, like he wanted"" (and also some time ago, he thought i gave him lice. this is a whole other thing but i have good reason to think it wasn't me) and i said i understood and would leave him alone for awhile. we have since not talked (this happened the 31st so it's been like 3 or 4 days). on the first day i figured things would be fine but starting the second day i've just been getting hit with waves of guilt and extreme panic that he's going to leave. 

i really wanted to reach out, to rationalize to him that i really didn't know what happened, that i care about him and i don't wanna ruin what we had but i know that it's coming from a place of trying desperately not to let him leave. i have not said anything and i'm trying *really* hard not to because he asked for space and he deserves to have it. but i also worry that when it *is* time to talk to him again he won't want to/i will say those things and he won't want to continue talking to me b/c it's not ""casual"". i recognize that my feelings definitely mean i *want* something more and it's not healthy to keep going if that's what i want and he doesn't but i'm just so confused and lost and hurt. there's a lot more context i've left out probably but i'm just venting. i just kind of want to tell him all of this but i don't want to be too much, too difficult or whatever. it doesn't help that all my friendships right now don't feel stable either (whether or not that's actually just in my head is up for debate).",1641256547,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-04 00:35:47,1,0,
How can I love someone who has BPD?,"hi everyone. i do not personally have bpd but i am close to two people that do.

i have depression, anxiety, and ptsd, and i know that i certainly have to be loved in certain ways (being constantly reassured, for example).

what are some things that you wish others would understand about you, in terms of bpd? is there anything you need (like being constantly reassured) that will help? how can i love you in a way that is comforting?

i’m not sure if this makes much sense, but i hope someone out there will know what i mean.

Being married to a compulsive liar when you have BPD,"my husband (24m) and i (23f) have been together since highschool and have been married for a little bit over a year. my husband has always had a terrible habit of lying; not only to me but to family, friends, classmates, co-workers etc.. he has always been this way and most of the time his lies are harmless and he does it to make himself look better or to avoid conflict. since we've gotten married i have noticed it more often and it's starting to get to me. i am diagnosed with bpd and anxiety so ""trusting my gut"" isnt enough sometimes.i dont know what to believe because i know he there are times i have a strong feeling he isnt honest but he insist that he is. there are times that i am wrong about when he's lying but there are times where i am also right.

this is starting to really hurt our relationship. we're both trying to be better and over the last month there hasn't been anything for me to be suspicious about. but i cant help the intrusive thoughts and i am unsure how to move forward. i guess what i am wondering if anyone has just accepted this behavior in hopes that it'll get better on its own? im just so sick of overthinking and trying to put together details everytime i feel like hes being dishonest. neither of us want a divorce so what i am looking for is just advice on how to cope so i can be more secure in my relationships. other than this issue we get along perfectly; we have similar interests and goals and enjoy eachother most of the time. i just cant help but sometimes feel like he is living a double life.

Hit rockbottom,"i do not know if this is bpd causing this but i am going crazy because i am so scared that i might be a narcissist (i apologize to anyone who has npd, i am just trying to understand myself). my last relationship lasted about 2 years. the first year i was completely in love with him, wanted to marry him, believed he was my soulmate, and the next year i could not stand him, i treated him like shit and he took it. i love-bombed him so much in the beginning because of how blinded i was for his love. then later, i gave him nothing and i do not know if i expected anything from him or for him to continue doing things. 

he took all the yelling, controlling, mean things i said. i feel like i used him. towards the end i felt so disgusted by him and felt absolutely nothing towards him that i would not let him touch me. i could not bring myself to kiss him. i ended things because i could not handle how i felt,  i honestly think i ended him because i had reached permanent devaluation, idk if this is correct or i am perceiving correctly. sometimes i look back and i just could not stand him towards the end of the relationship. i wanted nothing to do with him. i discarded him like he was nothing. 

i am crying writing this because i am currently in a relationship with someone that i truly believe i will marry one day, but i keep being scared that i am going to devalue him and discard him like my previous bf. i am scared that i am a narcissist. i always get jealous when i assume he is checking out other girls or talking to other girls because a part of me wants him to only love me, to only look at me, i want to be the center of his world. fyi i do not want this from my friends (which i have very few of, partly because i am okay with being alone and i always think that i do not need anyone (which ik is irrational) . i know this is wrong. i know what i want from my current bf is completely irrational and unfair, i do not know what to do. i am also always doubting whether i really do love him or if i just want to be loved. i told my current bf to not take shit from me. i want him to set up boundaries. i am so scared of hurting him. i really want to end up with him. 

these thoughts are also coming up because he has been showing me engagement rings and he wants to propose in the next year. 

* context: i also think i am a narcissist because i treat my mom like shit. i cannot stand her. i know i really love her and i would be destroyed if i lost her but i cannot bring myself to treat her right. i always want things. idk if its because she played a huge role in causing my mental illness. idk if i am delusional and she was always nice and i am just a horrible person. whenever i brought up things that i could remember from my childhood that she did and how they affect me, she would cry and say "" you always think of your mom as bad, you do not think about all the positive things i have done for you""

"Spouse being toxic, what to do?","me f37 (i'm bpd), spouse m38. together for almost 3,5 years. he has 4 kids (16yo, 2x14yo and 12yo), i have one (9yo), kids are with us every other week. we've been living together for 2 years, and we're going to get married in june and buy a house around the same time (we've been waiting one, as it needs to be renovated first). we've had our ups and downs, but so far managed decently. sometimes we fight really bad, but we make out and apologize and try to be better.

i had a high stress job for two years that ended two weeks ago. i worked from home due to covid and was severely burdened by loneliness and the kids when they were here (misophony and my station was in the kitchen where i heard every little noise in the house, and teenagers are not quiet). he just got a high paying new job, has never worked from home during this time. he also has never properly understood how horrible this two years has been for me. 

we had two weeks of holiday time during this christmas. that should've been a very happy time, right? wrong. after the kids left, we had a week of horrible fights. or to be more accurate, we fought on monday, he was mean to me (the worst part was saying i'm apparently so juvenile that he has to explain every little thing to me like to a 5yo. he was drunk and said later he deeply regretted saying that and that he doesn't really think i'm that dumb, but the damage was done), i spent day or two in a deep depression, got out after talking and rinse and repeat three times. 

i'm badly depressed due to unemployment (fifth year in a row in this situation, this time no hope of getting something soon like last year) and i've been badly burned out for months. and now he gets angry at me for every little mistake i make. this morning i wanted to drive him to his new job (he said he could take the bus, but i wanted to support him and do something nice). i asked where i should drop him off to and also suggested another spot maybe 300m from his suggestion. on the way i asked very nicely which spot i'd drive to as i was not sure. he replied with an angry tone and when i got hurt and wanted to discuss it later today, he told me he had gotten upset that i hadn't understood i was supposed to just go to where he asked me to. to me it wasn't clear as he hadn't told me to go there anyway, after i suggested the other spot. 

him getting angry at me for such little things seems to be constant now. he hasn't noticed he's gotten hostile like that. to me my question was not a thing to get upset/angry at all. i don't understand it. it hurt me a lot. it feels that he doesn't accept me as i am, and i'm not allowed to make even tiny mistakes or be confused or ask if i need reassurance. my self-esteem is already at the bottom and he hurts it even more.

i’ve seen a lot of people with bpd lately saying “stop thinking you have bpd!! it’s not cool or trendy!! stop self diagnosing!!”

and i’m not self diagnosing but because i hear all this i think to myself wow. i don’t even want to bring it up to a therapist now. because apparently even if i feel like all the dsm criteria applies to me there’s no way i have it because all these bpd people are saying otherwise.

Is this a me thing?,"i get into these states where i know my partner loves me, and his love for me is clear and everything is fine and wholesome. to completely forgetting how his love made me feel and there’s nothing he can do or say that will make me believe that his love is true because everything is tainted by this perception of him. i think it might be a mood change maybe but it can change within seconds and most of the time i feel that bad way of thinking. the reason i think it’s a mood change is because when i’m in the good mood i can think of the bad perception of him and not be bothered, i can think of the times where i’ve felt hurt by some thing he says and be fine because i can logically see through them. when i’m in the negative mood i use all our past memories and conflicts to paint him as a bad guy. there’s always this deep sadness and panic too. my brain is pretty analytical and logical so when i get into these moods it is fairly easy for me to pack evidence and logic to paint him this way. however, my brain has to go through some pretty paranoid thinking and a very negative view on people to obtain this perception that i makes more logical sense for him to be genuinely in love with me. 
another thing i should add, which is partially why i think this is only a me thing, is because there are multiple perceptions in between that, it’s not only black and white. maybe his feelings are this , maybe his feelings are that, maybe he’s this maybe he’s that. it’s very exhausting for me not to have a clear image or any image at all of what he is.",1641950594,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-12 01:23:14,1,0,

Letting a mistake sour an overall good experience,"last year in october i got to spend a week abroad at my online friend's place. we'd never met before and were both very excited to see each other. throughout the week i often went quiet, didn't know how to function normally and overall i think i made us miss out on a lot of fun as my behavior was draining my friend and i was aware of it but couldn't do anything about it. by the end of the week we had a lot of communication issues and misunderstandings. 

since then we've talked about it and came out on good terms, we're now back to what our friendship was like before, but i still feel so heavy whenever i think back to october, even though overall it was fine and they've reassured me multiple times they did enjoy spending time with me. it hasn't stopped affecting my own perception of our friendship which is so scary, they mean a lot to me. 

how do i cope with this? we are genuinely on great terms and there aren't any concerns but it is constantly circling my head and i'm scared it's making me withdraw from them or making us grow apart. it was supposed to be such a good time for us both and i don't know how to forgive myself for ruining it.",1641944059,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-11 23:34:19,1,0,

i'm also a jealous person, and more jealous than i'd like to me. i don't really like the thought of someone else being his favorite person. but i know that's unfair.

also i have been living with my boyfriend and we've been together for 1 year, through out the relationship i have managed to cope with my bpd and express myself and feel pretty normal for the past 8 months, however as time has gone on i've noticed myself stop talking to my boyfriend and family about my emotions and feelings and i tend to close off my bpd part of me due to feeling ashamed and embarrassed/being scared that it'll be viewed in a negative light and will upset him and my loved ones, obviously with bpd this is self sabotage and is the completely wrong way to go about it but as time has gone on i've been trying to act like i'm fine when in reality i'm going through some stuff and that creates a drift and makes it hard for me to fully open up and to trust etc, and then that makes me want to run away so they dont see me like it and my boyfriends opinion on me doesn't change, i know it's toxic not communicating and thats why i want to fix it and be able to, they have also gave me no reason to feel like i cant talk to them it's just the way i feel

i just find it extremely hard but i know it could ruin everything if i don't open up and learn that it's okay to talk to people, and i know it's all related to the feeling of being embarrassed and ashamed but when im going through an episode like this i cant rationalise my feelings or thoughts and not feeling like i can talk about it to anyone makes it so so much worse as i start to believe my irrational thoughts and feelings and i feel extremely alone and guilty and like i should just cut everyone off so they won't have the stress of me going through stuff like this, i know that i need to learn to communicate better but i'm unsure on how and what to say, i feel really guilty as well as i feel like i should be able to control myself and i hate that something like this can change the way i would usually communicate and open up, once the medication kicks in i know i'll be better and i'll just want to pretend that nothing has happened but i also know that's the wrong thing to do as it must be really confusing for everyone when i suddenly act distant and hide myself away and i know it might put a strain on my boyfriends emotions/our relationship in general, when i'm on medication i know things will be way easier and that hopefully this won't ever happen again but after this episode i need to make people aware of it and learn to talk about my emotions and feelings in general as i'm seriously worried that one day it will become too much for me or it will ruin everything

i know it’s from extra stress at my workplace since i recently got promotion and i’m working much more so we don’t see each other as much. we just bought a house and a lot of things have changed in the past year for both of us. but i’m always splitting on him and i don’t know what to do about it. i’m starting fighting, i’m accusing him of hating me, cheating on me, etc. when he’s never done anything of the sort.

it’s always me,"hello everyone i am sorry to vent i just want to write this somewhere so here i am. 
i feel like it’s always me. something bad happens? that’s on me. someone upset? it must be my fault. a message with a different tone? i must have done something. a literal cat could do a pee on a random person’s doorstep and somehow id feel like it was my doing. 
it’s tiring taking everything as an attack and sometimes i think im doing well but really it’s because ive isolated myself to bare minimum contact so i can’t get hurt haha. 
i’m not sure what to do anymore. my partner makes me feel like i don’t do enough but i can’t help but be on self preservation mode because if something bad happens it’ll always be my fault anyways. that with the hot mix of black and white thinking on my part pretty much ensures im alert.  i feel like im hyper aware of everything anyways. i have explained it more times than i can count but the messages i get about ‘you don’t change’ make me feel like i must be communicating through a language only i know or something. 
i just want to love in a balanced way literally why can’t bpd stand for ‘balanced person daaaamn’ haha :( i really do have lots of love to give but my way of doing so has been blueprinted to outward care and self care, too. i feel like my fear of being to blame ultimately leads me to being blamed time and time again.

(23 f) knowing that i will have to live with this for the rest of my life makes me not want to have a future.,"i think i could count on both hands how many medications i’ve been on. i’ve seen multiple therapists since i was 12 years old, but it doesn’t help. i hate that no matter what i do, this illness will never go away because even though there is treatment, there is no cure.

every day is the same and i’m on autopilot. no one truly knows me because i shape myself depending on who i’m around and i feel like a liar because of it. i’m tired of the mood swings. even when i’m happy, i’m not. this isn’t to say i don’t have moments in my life when i don’t feel so bad. but deep down, i’m still depressed. i’m not alone, but i’m lonely. and this loneliness runs so deep. 

i watch everyone live their lives while mine is passing me by. there have been times i sat in my car crying, wishing i wasn’t here. and wishing that someone, anyone, would just come be with me. they wouldn’t even have to speak. i just want someone who really cares. i’m loved, but i don’t feel loved.

My FP has NPD.,"0/10 do not recommend.  

i have been lovebombed for 2 months, and i can feel the devalue phase coming on. he would text me all throughout the day every day, those texts are less and less. sex was happening almost daily, now     a couple times a week and he suddenly has trouble finishing. 

a bit of a backstory. we were together for a year, broke up for a month, got back together, broke up for 6 months, and are now together again. during that 6 month break up he slept with two women- one being his neighbor, which he claimed only happened a couple of times and he wasn’t even able to finish with her. initially i was fine with this- we were apart and things happen. i started to have a gut feeling so i recently read their texts while he was asleep. he completely downplayed whatever relationship they had- sex happened often and with him finishing. 

so of course i have some resentment that i can’t talk about with him because i went through his phone. 

back to my current problem. my sex drive is through the roof. now that i can feel him pulling away i’m freaking out. yesterday our texts were back to the horny level that i’m used to. lots of photos and sexting and detailing what he was gonna do to me later. so in getting ready to go to his place after work i get really dressed up in a skimpy outfit. when i arrived he didn’t say one word about it. i felt so humiliated. i shared this with him and his defense is “you can’t just expect me to know what you want all the time, you need to communicate.” considering we were sexting basically all day i thought it was pretty clear what both of us wanted, but for whatever reason when i got to his place his switch flipped. you all know as well as i do it’s impossible to reason with narcs so i ended up apologizing and he said he needed to be alone tonight to “play video games and zone out” (he’s 38 years old by the way) so i went home. 

my bpd symptoms are flaring up. i have these intrusive thoughts of him just going downstairs and banging his neighbor pretty much daily. i have pretty bad body dysmorphia and have been feeling pretty good about myself lately but now my self esteem is in the trash. i can’t just “run” or get away from this person right now because he’s my fp. i feel so stupid and worthless.",1641913940,TRUE,BPD,2022-01-11 15:12:20,1,0,

I need serious advice please. Urgent in nature and NSFW (Trigger warning but I'll try not to be as graphic as the situation is),"so i have bpd, ptsd and adhd. being in a relationship with my girlfriend who has bipolar 2, ocd, ptsd and most likely bpd has been challenging to try to avoid us affecting each other.

i have things pretty well in check considering my girlfriend says how different i am from when we started dating over a year and a half ago. unfortunately i can't say the same about her.

she's opposed to therapy and desperately needs it to deal with past trauma. she's been through more than anyone should ever had to deal with. she stopped taking meds because of insurance issues and so stopped seeing her psychiatrist. of whom she only saw a handful of times anyway

now, everything is hitting. her depression, her trauma, her ocd traits, her unhealthy coping skills which are self harming and hurtful to both her and me, and mostly her suicidal ideations. 

i am the only person she confides in. and i'll do anything to keep her talking so i know what's going on in her head. she's open with me about things related to that, that i won't post here. and i'm scared to push her to get help too much more. she gets defensive. and i know if i keep pushing, she will shut me out. i also know if i contact her family, she would know it's me. i don't want her to lose the only outlet she has. but i don't want to lose her either.

i don't even know if what i'm telling her helps in the long run, but it gets her to the next day. it's the only thing i can do.

she has shut me out a little already. she will only text me. she won't see me or call me. but she will text with me for hours every night, so i'll take it

she still lives with family, so i know she's as ""safe"" as she can be. and she's extremely private about her family. i have no real way to contact them aside from her mentioning where her mom works.

i'm getting to the point where she's worrying me so much, i'm thinking about showing up at her mom's job and asking her to talk when she gets out. it scares me because if her mom even gives a hint i talked to her about this, she will never, ever talk to me again. that would probably tip her over the edge she's tetering on. 

so i'm looking for advice. how do i get someone help that says it won't help her because she's too far gone and messed up? if i think at any point she will carry out her ideations, i will call a wellness check for her. but what can i do so it doesn't get that bad? just being supportive is not helping.",1641910877,TRUE,BPD,2022-01-11 14:21:17,1,0,

the thing is, i got a friend, a really good friend, that i had a crush on but has since told me he doesn’t have romantic feelings for me, but being so alone, so deprived of any contact with another person is what forces me to go and put myself out there to find potential romantic partners, which is something that terrifies me, but now that i have him, i feel so lonely, lonelier than ever before, and yet, i don’t feel desperate enough to force me to do something about it, and it’s killing me.

Why is it so hard for me to maintain friendships?,"i (20f) have struggled with keeping friends ever since high school and it's caused me to feel so worthless and mean, even though i'm actually a really empathetic person who has a pretty easy time making new friends. most of the friends i've made i now don't talk to anymore because i've ruined things one way or another, and it's an ongoing cycle that's occurred with at least 6 of the close friends i've made in the past 6ish years. 

my bpd, anxiety, adhd, and depression combined make me a huge overthinker and i am constantly reading way too much into things. for example: when a friend can't hang out because they have plans with another friend, i feel replaced, jealous, guilty, and then tend to start asking for reassurance from the friend that they don't hate me, and then this leads to more anxious behavior, me sending long guilty ""i'm sorry"" texts, and eventually driving a friend away because i'm insecure and anxious. it's so hard for me to tell myself that other people can have other friends and do other things without me, because in my head if i'm not their ""best friend"" or whatever then i equate that to them hating me or thinking i'm not good enough. i don't talk to my best friends from high school anymore because i've gotten jealous and anxious about them joining new friend groups, getting into colleges that i didn't get into, being better at school and sports than i am, etc. it's more of an internal jealousy/anxiety that manifests into asking for lots of reassurance, reading into things too much, and just not being able to have a good time because i'm so preoccupied in my thinking that ""they don't like me"" or whatever. 

i'm in college now and am struggling with an awful depression episode that caused me to withdraw from classes last term. i was in bed for weeks and didn't really talk to anyone. i'm at risk of losing 5 of my extremely close friends and roommates, and i sent a text today that i feel extremely guilty about. i'm at home now, crying and feeling absolutely worthless because i can't keep stable friendships, and friend breakups hurt me so much, i don't know if i can handle 5 more. i don't know what to do.",1641879307,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-11 05:35:07,1,0,

my fp is my (sort of, kind of, not really) partner and has been my best friend for almost 10 years. we have a history of toxicity, both of us. but i'm trying my best to communicate with him when i come off as an asshole or when i'm in bad moods, so he knows it's not him. 

he doesn't do that. he refuses to do that. he snaps at me, talks down to me, takes harsh tones, etc., especially when i need help with something. when i mention that he's doing it, he tells me he hasn't done anything to me. that i'm making everything about me. that i'm gaslighting him. he never apologizes for how he treats me and refuses to take accountability.

tonight was one of those nights and it went really bad. he's ignoring me now. i don't mean like he's avoiding me, i mean he's actively ignoring me. and i can't do anything about it. i can't live without him. i love him so much it hurts. 

and just like always, he's going to get away with this behavior. he gets to sleep in my room while i'm on the couch, drink as much alcohol as he wants, ignore me, and in a few days (or maybe even tomorrow) it will all be fine again. because i'm dumb and can't break the cycle.

No idea what’s symptoms and what’s life,"sorry if this is vague or scattered, i’m just at a loss right now. i’m female, 23, and i’ve been diagnosed with bpd by two psychologists in the past year so i’m not looking for opinions on whether i have it or not—i just struggle to objectively see it playing out in my life. i’d like to know whether other people in the community experience symptoms in these ways or if they could be caused by something else. relevant comorbidities are avpd, severe depression, and inattentive type adhd.

1. i loved all my friends at one point. but i moved frequently, and i went through periods of idealizing them almost immediately after. i often fantasized about situations where we were much closer than in reality (they chose to hang out with me over other friends, they invited me to parties, they wondered what i was doing during summer breaks). usually i stopped liking them when i made new friends at school, though i didn’t really dislike them. i was too busy trying to get my new friend group to like me. today, five-ish years out of high school and about a year out of college, i never want to see any of them again. i don’t remember being treated poorly by them, but i feel so intentionally ignored and looked down on. i missed a college friend’s wedding by mistake. i probably had a place at a table since i rsvp’d. my core college squad was all going to be there, and… no one called or texted to find out why i was gone. they knew my mental health state. i think i fucking hate them and i can’t remember them ever treating me as anything more than an npc but i’m not sure if this is a valid expression of splitting or just my avpd putting up a bigger wall. i have no friends, even though it’s a nice idea, but i have zero trust in anyone. 

2. until i was 21 i had this idea that i was immune to silly emotions and that i never let anything get to me. however i had angry or sad episodes starting at about 10, usually every 2-3 months, where i locked myself in my room for several hours and cried myself to sleep. i “allowed” this behavior because i knew i’d cry it out and stop feeling whatever was causing the pain by the next morning. as a teen i was reassured when i cried because i thought i would cry all the stress out and then i’d be okay for the next couple of months. these days it looks a lot like i had/have an extremely volatile emotional state and now i wonder when my next breakdown will be instead of pretending i can schedule a time to feel bad and be okay the rest of the time. i don’t know if this counts as explosive episodes because it never shows itself to others, i just bottle it all up until i’m alone and can safely express it.

3. i don’t like anything. i have adhd, and others with it typically bounce between fascinations. i get caught up in some things: video games, endlessly scrolling through social media, online shopping, digital art. however it’s not the same as having an abundance of passions. i’ll play the same video game from 2011 over and over and over again. i hated school. i used to like reading and writing but my teachers made me do it every day for 18 years and i never want to do any of that again. i don’t like art enough to make a career of it and i’m not even good at it. i just use it to dump my jumble of thoughts out. i used to play sports but without a school team to play on, i don’t exercise at all. in short, i’ve lost every piece of myself that i used as my identity, and now i have… nothing. i work and i sit and scroll and sleep and it starts all over. i want to go back to school for something that makes me look smart and cool and interesting and pays a lot of money. i have no passions and i doubt i have a future if things go on this way.

i guess my main reason is to vent a little and seek out others with similar experiences. and, naturally, i don’t have the self-awareness to objectively draw parallels between noted symptoms of bpd and my personal struggles, so i’m probably looking for some reassurance as well. i want to know if this is an expression of bpd or if they aren’t close enough to the symptoms as to be caused by other factors. thanks for sticking around.",1641875421,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-11 04:30:21,1,0,
A mantra that helps me with envy/jealousy (especially of friends’ success/happiness),"something that triggers me a lot is when my friends have something good happen to them that i think might make them leave me. a new job, a good response on a project they’re working on, a date going well, etc. i’m obviously happy for them, but it’s hard not to feel like i’m not good enough/they’re gonna find something better and leave me behind.

so i started repeating to myself “others’ success is not my failure” and it actually helps me a lot. repeating it to myself when i start to get angry about someone else’s success helps me calm down and alleviates the guilt i feel over not being happy for them at first. once the anger passes i’m able to re evaluate the situation and celebrate my friends :)",1641875241,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-11 04:27:21,1,0,

It’s okay to fuck up,"i don’t know about you, but i have an unequivocal habit to beat myself up. i never thought i was good enough, and every little mistake took all the wind out of my sails. if i forgot to take my medication, or left the pizza in the oven a little too long, i looked at myself as a failure. when healing didn’t come easy i wanted to just give up because i thought “what’s the use? i just can’t do it.” when i felt like i was in over my head, i would just sink to the bottom. if i picked up a new hobby and realized i wasn’t instantly gifted, i was so bummed out. i just really felt like i was worthless. not until very recent i thought this way, would self sabotage everything because i didn’t believe i was good enough. then someone told me “if you can’t treat yourself the way you deserve, then treat yourself like you would your best friend.” at first, i brushed it off, then i had a friend reach out, needing someone to talk to. after talking for awhile i hung up the phone and sat there. i realized how many praises i gave her because she deserved them. how many times i told her she can do it, just keep trying. even said the words “it’s okay to fuck up.” and i then knew what they meant. nobody is perfect at everything. nobody has walked through life untouched by the ugliness of the world. we make mistakes, we take risks, and that is okay! it’s okay to ask for help. it’s okay to burn the pizza, because nobody is even going to notice. it’s okay to make mistakes because if you use them the right way, you learn something every single time. even if you have to make the same mistake multiple times before you get it right. don’t give up because you’re scared to fuck up. it’s okay to fuck up.",1641872659,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-11 03:44:19,1,0,

I am the FP and I am getting threats. What do I do. Help.,"tw: suicide threats, verbal abuse. 

i have had a friend with bpd for the last 3 years. it started off with hooking up twice (but not sex) bc i was in a vulnerable place getting out of a relationship. i realized i didn’t like him like that and was honest. we did have a good connection though as friends and said i would be down to be friends. 
we were close friends for the next couple years but when he got drunk there would be frequent proclamations of his love and obsession with me.
it has now gotten completely out of control. he has been showing up to my apartment building at 1am some nights banging on the front door of my building if i have gone to sleep because he feels abandoned. he refuses to get mental help realizing that i won’t be with him romantically anyway it’s not worth it for him. i have told him i can’t hang out in person anymore because it doesn’t feel safe anymore especially if he isn’t getting help for his issues he is putting on me. he is now threatening to sending out an email to a very large email list he has about me that could get me fired, create websites about me, and that if i tell anyone about this it won’t be good for me (a threat). he owns weapons and has been to prison. then sometimes he will shake out of it and call me crying saying he didn’t mean any of it and just wants me to care. lots of suicide threats, and verbal abuse. his last text is now saying he is out of control but won’t get help and can i just tell him if i am done. he has posted revenge porn of exes and sent emails to their workplaces so i know what he is capable of. i feel sick and don’t want this person in my life but i don’t know what to say anymore to also keep myself safe. no response makes him even crazier. i am living in a nightmare. does anyone have any advice for me?",1641868670,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-11 02:37:50,1,0,
Advice for helping BPD wife,"so i was with my wife for 8 years, we had 3 kids and got married and everything was as well as a long term relationship should be.

year 8, she discovers adult content on my phone and a month later says she doesn't love me.

we decide to try and rekindle, but the following summer she has her first serious episode, starts talking to another guy and ultimately everything in her life seems wrong except for him.

it lasts awhile, but i convince her it's ok her family still loves her, we continue together. christmas comes along, same thing happens again only this time all bets are off. moves into her mom's place and is okay with me having the kids because everything is spiraling again. she ruins that relationship by cheating on him with me after i fixed her car one night. after that, she does to inpatient and ultimately gets the diagnosis.

i tell her there's nothing i won't face in order to see us through this, we can beat it together because i'm here for her. same time as last year, she does it again. this time, she moved into an apartment, filed for divorce and started an actual relationship with someone.

but every part of her life is still in a complete spiral. she can't keep up financially, though i've been helping since we do have kids together. it's like she only partially split. she wants to see if she can be happy with someone else, but she still wants to be in contact with me all the time and spend time together in a somewhat platonic sense. she almost failed this semester in school, her job is at stake and she can't get off of the couch at her apartment.

i know i can't change her mind about wanting me, although she admittedly still has feelings and won't allow the word 'permanent' to be said about our separation. but i still want to help. the pain i feel over this is worse than i thought anything could ever hurt, but she still needs guidance and emotional support that everything will be okay.

how can i be as helpful as possible without her thinking i'm trying to serenade her? as of now, i try not to talk to her so i don't ask for her to come back, but when she reaches out or when we see eachother i maintain a calm and supportive vibe even when she gets irritated and thinks i'm trying to fight. 

she still calls me when she gets scared over a noise in her apartment, even though i'm 15 miles away and her new boyfriend lives in the same complex as her. this gives me hope that if i am still important to her  in the black phase, i can help her through these times and eventually be able to get her in therapy when she calms down.

any advice on how to be the best influence or support for her would be the best. thanks. 
i mean i'd also take advice on what may cause her to want me again, but that's second place to her just being okay.",1641867259,FALSE,BPD,2022-01-11 02:14:19,1,0,

Started a new birth control. It isn’t going well. This story peels like an onion.,"so over holidays my new boyfriend and my mom had a long conversation and she confessed she “thinks i have bpd” i’ve been in inpatient rehabs and therapy since i was 10 so i know that if she “thinks” i have bpd, i’ve been diagnosed with it. i’ve never been permitted to see a copy of my diagnoses ever so i guess it makes sense now why. my whole life it’s just been “depression and anxiety” causing everything and i couldn’t figure out why nothing intended to manage those disorders would work for me. i had one or two great therapists who helped me try to cope and the best of them used dbt but once i wasn’t at that rehab anymore receiving dbt i figured i was just too far gone. 

anyway my boyfriend told me about the whole conversation because me and my mom have a *really* rocky relationship and i had set that boundary with him, that he has to be honest with me about that stuff. my mental health kept rocketing downwards for the next week or so but i figured it was just because i was back in my hometown and my childhood home where i have a lot of trauma. 

a couple days later bf said he wasn’t sure he’s done the right thing by telling me i have bpd. just thought i should include that part. i’m really not trying to self diagnose here. it’s just that i’ve done some solid research over the past few weeks since christmas and it’s explaining a lot about me that “depression and anxiety” didn’t. i have more than 5 of the traits required for diagnosis. i know i need to go after an official one but that’s not the focus rn. 

anyway it’s been about two or three weeks since we went for the holidays and i started nuvaring like five days ago. i know before that i wasn’t doing great but now i’m plainly, plainly worse. i’ve been having suicidal ideation for two weeks so that probably isn’t connected but it’s sure as shit getting worse. i don’t like any other method of bc and i’ve tried all of them at this point (started at 14) so this is my best option for my body. i’ve been lashing out at my poor boyfriend who’s doing everything he can to help me. he had the bathroom ready and candles lit and wine for me last night, and i yelled at him because he wasn’t *immediately* excited about a (incredibly generous) offer from one of my clients. 

i’m trying harder than i ever have to cope and handle myself and be functional, and i feel like instead i’m just sabotaging myself. i’ve never wanted to give up this bad. in the time since i figured out it might be bpd i’ve come far closer to relapsing and starving myself than i have in years and i don’t know why. please someone help me.",1641856262,TRUE,BPD,2022-01-10 23:11:02,1,0,
