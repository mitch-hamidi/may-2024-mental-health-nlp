"I’ve been seeing a therapist since the age of 25 and I’m 47. I’ve had to change up who due to whatever circumstances at the time but I’ve experienced therapists that act more like your friend and don’t really offer constructive feedback. I’ve experienced therapists who immediately find additional resources that helped immensely. My therapists haven’t really focused on diagnosis, but more on how I’m feeling and managing those feelings. I will probably continue with therapy for the rest of my life and I’m ok with that. It’s a tool.",ChocCoveredSarcasm,1bmk9m2,1
"i’ve been in and out of therapy (mostly in) for the past 10ish years. some of it has been helpful, some hasn’t. my current therapist is a dbt therapist and is the most helpful i’ve had, but they can be hard to find.",oddthing757,1bmk9m2,1
"Been in regular (twice a week) therapy for over ten years now, and have just started an additional program specifically for BPD to run alongside it. It's called structural clinical management and looks like it'll be more practical dbt style skills workshops. I don't feel like there will be a conflict between the two, and tbh I'm open to anything that might help. My regular therapy is great, and allows me a safe place to explore trauma stuff as well as looking into the reasons why I am the way I am, whereas I'm hoping the new program will skill me up to be more functional in life.",bedrock_BEWD,1bmk9m2,1
In therapy since I was 14. It's been over 20 years now. I've learned a lot over the years but I don't even try anymore. Just kinda going through the motions at this point. Meds help a lot more than therapy for me.,Own_Collection_8916,1bmk9m2,1
"Tried CBT for years, and never got anywhere. 

DBT IOP saved my life, and now I just have weekly sessions (might go down to once every two weeks) for maintenance. 

It’s different for everyone, but it took about 3-6 months for me to notice a significant improvement. That said, I do need upkeep in a way that not everyone else does. 

DBT was created as a treatment for borderline, and I’ve found it to be incredibly useful. I don’t have the diagnosis on paper because my psychiatrist is an ass, but my therapist believes I have a pretty standard case. 

I don’t think I’d go back to regular CBT again. There just wasn’t enough for me to work with to actually tackle my problems. I needed more clear instructions and tools.",sky-amethyst23,1bmk9m2,1
"I tried a few different therapists until I found the right one. I was in weekly therapy for a year. Bi weekly for another year, and now i just go see her once a month. I have less to talk about now because I'm understanding a lot more about myself and got through a lot of the hard stuff with her a few years ago. Now I just go see her because I enjoy talking to her and sometimes I just need that. Someone to talk to. 
My psychiatrist also wants me to maintain a therapist relationship because I do go through the mud from time to time. 

Everyone is different. I do think it's important to stay with the same one if you have good rapport so you're not constantly restarting. I had to see a psychologist that wasn't my therapist because it's all my insurance would cover and I didn't have a good time trying to do things over again.",drowningeliander,1bmk9m2,1
"It is complicated. There are a bunch of variables. Do you have the right therapist or the right course of treatment? I have found for example that I can only tolerate old man therapists for some reason. Somehow they comfort me. I don't know why, but it is true. Also they have to be at least as intelligent as me or I can't make myself trust anything that they say. In the end therapy is what you make of it. I'm just trying to say that it helps to understand what works for you.",Entire-Net5908,1czg16p,1
"Medications keep me at baseline, but therapy is what keeps me alive.  I've had a lot of therapists, not all of them great, but at least three that have changed the whole game for me.  For me personally, I look for a therapist with BPD experience, that's knows the difference between bipolar 1 and 2 (I'm bipolar 2 also) and is versed in DBT or CBT.  It's like dating, not every fit works but it's 100% worth it!",lastskepticontheleft,1cpjgso,1
"It seems in your case you have little choice. I would suggest asking your doctor for an enzyme test, or whatever the last test it for medication sensetivities or allergies. I struggled with medications and that test is what helped me find one.

That said, therapy is the crux of treatment for me. Meds suppliment that. If I relied on medication only then I would not be better. For BPD, the skills are incredibly important. So yes, absolutely get into therapy with or without medication. Use the tools you can.

And I wish you best of luck!",princefruit,1cpjgso,1
"Lamictal send me to emergency i got discharged 4 days back. Most medicines give me side effects. It’s either horrible weight gain or some hormonal issues, sometimes migrane and usually vomitting, chills, fever. I want to see if therapy will do me some good. Def not an ego thing. I want to get better that’s all.",Extension-Bath1590,1cpjgso,1
"You need to keep trying. There is a right medication, right dose and right combo for everyone. They put me in antidepressants twice which made me gain bunch of weight and killed my libido. Now I’m on Lamictal and I feel much better.",AssumptionEmpty,1cpjgso,1

"Talk to your therapist about your feelings, definitely. Therapy is weird in that everything that comes up is grist for the mill or whatever, all of it is useful to bring to therapy if you have a good therapist. 

I remember being really frustrated with CBT specifically because it felt very invalidating for my feelings, which I'd already had a lifetime of and caused unhelpful cognitive dissonance. DBT I had this a little bit with, but there are some skills in it I really love and find valuable (opposite action, wisemind, Dearman in particular, and I really like the structure it has because it helps me organize myself).

So I'd say if it's resistance to the skills because you need them but feel foolish for needing them, do the opposite action stuff and process your feelings with your therapist as you work through them. Find ways to cope with that feeling and resistance and understand yourself better through them.  Depending on the approach being used, you could also see if there's a subreddit for it (likely) and reading others' experiences as they work through it might help it feel less like a ""you"" thing if you see other people are feeling similarly. 

If it's more feelings about the skills because you already know them or it's invalidating to you, ask your therapist to use another approach. A lot of them default to CBT and CBT isn't actually the best thing for a lot of issues, and you sometimes have to ask for something different. 

I really like ACT because it's about working with reality and making choices aligned with your values, and that helps me in all areas of my BPD issues, and majorly helps my shame. IFS and somatic approaches have also been helpful for me, and I find these three way more useful and validating than anything else I've tried, and they help me feel more connected to myself where CBT made me feel more fractured and disconnected. Obviously this will be different for everyone. Gestalt, schema, and MBT are supposed to be helpful for BPD as well, although I have no personal experience with those yet. I also have a therapist who specializes in trauma and attachment- based issues, and has a specific interest in personality disorders, which has worked way better for me than someone more general as BPD can be tough for a lot of therapists to work effectively with.",IndependentEggplant0,17qzcf9,1
"This is the most helpful way to view this issue that I’ve seen… I’ve also always struggled with DBT and therapy in general, and my brain rebels against it like it’s a “trick” and does feel patronizing. But I feel like I could be more receptive to it thinking of it as yes, I do need to figure out how to adopt skills to regulate my emotions and anxieties.",gerturtle,17qzcf9,1
"I suffered a lot, I had no choices but therapy.
There are pros and cons to it.

I did EMDR (for traumas) and schema therapy (for mild BPD or quiet BPD and codependency)

The pros

It help reduce the high and lies, EMDR did reduce my triggers by 80%, once upon a time I felt really peaceful if it wasn't for my bad choices due to ingrained coping mechanisms.

Then I started schema therapy.

It helped me name where I am in my head.
Am I leading the trajectory or is fear leading ?
Am I dissociated or still anchored in reality?
To quote one horrific person but still a good quote ""you've gotta name it to claim it"" (Dr Phil, I know just his name gives me nausea, still...)

Allow the above where emotionally very demanding.
Therapist needs to be well trained and accustomed to PD and Trauma (meaning either they're gifted or they suffered a lot too)
(Very few are gifted, dome pretend to, most of them had a lit of extreme feelings to)

It's great when done well.

You get to know yourself and you win control over your life and emotions.

You start yo understand that all isn't gloom and doom and you'll start to feel like life has worth instead of wishing daily to ve out of the game.

The cons

While you're doing that your life seems ""on hold"" which can trigger anger and frustration.
Although your life is definitely on hold with a PD if you learn how to live with it you can still function.

You can't hide and you'll have to face yourself. This is the hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life.
Blaming my abusers, feeling like a victim felt like a breeze compared to that.

If you are in the US the Golden standard for BPD is DBT. I find it somewhat abusive myself as I am also a cult victim
I preferred schema therapy,  that gave me the source of the pain and the solution. 
I can chose to use it or not, at my own expense 

Therapy IS REALLY demanding for PD's. You've got to destruct your identity to built a new one. This is now in the cons but should be on both side.
It's excruciating but salvation. 

Therapy IS DAILY COMMITMENT! If you do not want that, do not even start.
Either you'll feel more as a victim or worse end up more damaged.

You've got to want it really bad in order to make it work.

Conclusion 

If I had a comfortable life and my PD in check I would never have searched for therapy. 
Life threw me so much lemon that I couldn't slip away.
I mean the pain was unbearable.
It was either therapy or suicide. 
I chose to live.


I do not blame anyone avoiding therapy. 
If there was a magic pill I would have gladly taken it.

For PD's there isn't,  unfortunately. 

Unless you want to be numb all day (which I would totally get btw)

Good luck to you on your way forward.
I do believe in the fact that all roads leads to Rome anyway.
As long as there is life, there is A way...",SavorySour,1bepwvs,1
"I don't have the option to be in therapy either, I've spent 10+ years in and out of therapy, and after doing more harm than good, I have no choice but to give up on therapy. The help I needed wasn't avaliable here, the therapists were honestly horrible, and just gave up on me. Instead of giving up all together, I decided I was worth helping, and started figuring out how to help myself. It is 100% possible to better yourself, learn to manage your symptoms better, and feel more okay on your own. You have to put in work, but there's plenty of resources online, and people who share what helped them in the same position. I find that taking care of my physical body, drinking enough water, eating enough nutrients, moving my body and getting more sleep, really helps me, because I have more energy and feel better, and am in turn more patient with my my mental health. Learning why I feel the way I feel is also helpful, and trying to sort of gentle parent myself. Not be so hard on myself, understand that feelings can take overhand one minute, and you can use that to learn what to do or not to do next time, and get out of this cycle. You can help yourself, and you can become a healthier, happier version of yourself without access to therapy 🤍 Just try to be kind to yourself, because it's not an easy journey, but you can make a difference in your life still, one day at a time.",sorrengail,1bepwvs,1
"DBT and EMDR were necessary for my recovery. I had no idea where to even start with myself. Even if we’re incredibly self-aware and insightful, it would be incredibly difficult to navigate through all that jumbled stuff. I’ve always thought I knew what my problems were but my therapist seemed to pull so many forgotten things from my brain! 

It might just mean therapist shopping, which can be expensive. You might not connect with the first ones you meet. And yes, actually applying skills is needed - and I always sucked at that, however once I got into DBT I started using the skills almost unknowingly. I also made it a habit to write down every emotion I felt and discover the reason I felt that way and ask myself if my reaction was necessary/appropriate. Shit like that. It got easier every time. 

Aside from that, I did have to get clean from drugs, start sleep meds (insomnia) & do regular meditation. It was actually quite wonderful, even though I was still suffering, I look back on that period with fondness.",gospelofrage,1bepwvs,1
"Unfortunately, CBT and DBT mean working with a trained third-party. It's also a matter of them having the objective view to see trends and warning signs, to guide, and to drive to insights that you can't do to/for yourself. It sucks, but here we are. Stay focused and keep at it.",BabyFishmouthTalk,1bepwvs,1
">Sorry for being presumptuous and unkind. 

You just reacted quickly, we all do here. I know how I can be sometimes,  it's OK really.
Don't overreact do not overexcuse, I try yo remind myself that every day. Not always lucky. 😉😘

>Thanks for sharing your experience. EMDR has been difficult for me to pick up but maybe with the right therapist it can work.

Depends where you're at. I was in the midst of a storm PTSD then. It helped me be more mellowed in response to some triggers and core beliefs.

I have a dear friend (BPD too) that couldn't do EMDR, it didn't work for him.

I'll still suggest it , maybe it helps someone else.

It can be retraumatizing for some persons.

Not one size fits all. Some here found solace in DBT.
I can't have it due to my past experiences. It reminded me of the brainwashing of the cult, I can't deal with that.
But it works for many !!!

Schema therapy and ACT are for me more reliable/less controlling.

You can find a lot of exercises books online and you can do the test yourself online too.

If you want to/feel the need to.

Internet helped me a lot when I was really down.
It still does.

I hope that I can give that back 🙏 

Sometimes just opening a conversation or sharing your experience can be valuable to someone else.
Sometimes not.
That's OK.

It's not because I say I was happy with something that you have to be happy with it too.

I hope you find YOUR way through it, share it when you do. It's precious!",SavorySour,1bepwvs,1
"I've been in DBT for 1.5 years and it's the only thing that has helped me actually see results.I recently completed a year long group therapy class whereg you're taught a specific skill that week and do homework on how you applied  that skill in your daily life. That was on top of a weekly hour individual therapy session. In that you go over your weekly diary card and talk about what stands out to discuss because of what specific issues you're tracking...for me it's self validation, trying to control others etc. At the end of this year I will switch to individual therapy only twice a month and then I'll be discharged from DBT. So...for 80hrs being a ""max"" DBT journey I disagree. At the moment I have 182 hrs of DBT and still have a year or more if I'm accepted into phase two of DBT which is processing trauma.

"i was in therapy for almost 4 years but i bounced around for a while until i found the right one. at the time i was only diagnosed w major depressive disorder and severe anxiety disorder so we focused a lot on CBT. i can’t recommend therapy enough and especially the correct form. although i didn’t have a complete diagnosis i learned so much the last 2 years i was with my therapist. it took me a really long time to open up the way i needed to to begin making progress but once i did, i progressed semi-quickly and she believed i was ready to be independent after about 2 and a half years but honestly its all up to each person individually and which type of therapy because i was also dealing with a lot of repressed trauma.",BuildingFantastic651,1ctz4zk,1
"I was with a general talk therapist for 2 years and didn't help much at all. 

I then got another therapist at local women's shelter and she did more help in the month I had her then those 2 years with my other therapist. 

She was only a temporary therapist,  but she really put me on the right track with my life and idk what it is but her technique just really clicked with me and I'm so thankful for her. 

I also have done dbt therapy 4 times. 

The last 2 times I really slacked and quit half through. The timing was really difficult 7 to 9 pm which is right at my children's bed time and I'm a single parent. 

I was getting more agitated with my kids and it was becoming distressing trying to get it tha timing to work.

I'm now In a group therapy thar takes a look at how you where raised as a child, and how I can make the necessary changes with my own kids. 


I also did coda groups briefly for a bit in 2022 and found it pretty helpful.  

Dbt was helpful too, and I will take it again at some point",6995luv,1ctz4zk,1
"I was initially in a DBT IOP program for 3 months. It was three hours, three days a week. 

It changed my life. I graduated and managed to maintain a lot of my skills for a year, but after being retraumatized a lot I was finding skill use to be difficult. So two years later I started seeing a DBT therapist one on one. 

I still see her, but now it’s every two weeks instead of every week. It’s mostly as upkeep to make sure I’m still using my skills as intended and to talk through any issues that come up.  I’ve been seeing her for two years now. 

So in total (not counting failed therapy because I didn’t know what I needed) that’s 3 months + 2 years with a 2-year gap in between. 

I could probably stop going if I wanted to, but having outside accountability and perspective has been really helpful.",sky-amethyst23,1ctz4zk,1

"Definitely agree. 

I should be starting DBT in the next few weeks (I got a call yesterday saying a spot opened). My psychiatrist said it usually lasts about 1.5 years for the initial round, plus if you need to extra time before transitioning to just individual sessions. 

She used this analogy that I love: 

“What’s the first thing you do when you lose power at your house? You call the electrician, but the plumber shows up. They do the best they can to help, but you still need an electrician so everything is fixed properly.” 

She’s the plumber. I need extra help from the electrician. But I’ll still be seeing both.",Sad-Grape5887,1ctz4zk,1
"Yes! Am in a combination of both. My therapist likes to do individual and group with a session of both each week. Group is on Monday morning and we learn and train the skills, and individual is later during the week and we talk about specific happenings",LaraVermillion,1cd7oer,1
"I got better through therapy, but also largely in part to finding the right medication. My bpd is mostly managed, but if my lamictal gets fucked with it 1000% knocks me down a peg.

"I don't know what country you live in, but in my country a psychotherapist does not make a diagnosis.  He only does therapy.  The diagnosis is made by a psychiatrist.  In my country, to be diagnosed with a personality disorder, several conditions must be met: age over 18 (because the personality is still developing during childhood and adolescence), documented symptoms lasting at least a year (so you have to go there for at least 1 year, but even so in my country usually  even more years, in my case it was perhaps 7 years since my first contact with a psychiatrist at the age of 13, even though the suspicion fell much earlier) and they must send the patient for a complex psychological examination of the personality to an accredited clinical psychologist.  Based on these results, the psychiatrist will give the final official diagnosis of personality disorder.  The patient can receive this diagnosis much earlier, but usually it is only a ""working"" diagnosis for experts, which is not disclosed to the patient.  It can still change a lot.  Usually, before the diagnosis of bpd, a person receives various others, such as a depressive or anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, adjustment disorder, or the pre-stage of personality disorder in juvenile patients is ""disharmonious personality development"".  I went through all these diagnoses before the final dg.  BPD.  And anyway, I think that BPD is caused by a combination of innate and genetic predispositions with trauma, most often developmental (CPTSD).  So more important than getting a BPD diagnosis is to work on where the symptoms originated, process the trauma and your inner beliefs/patterns in psychotherapy.  

What symptoms are you experiencing? How long do they last?  
Did you grow up in a dysfunctional environment? 
How old are you  
Do you work on yourself, do you go to psychotherapy?  

These are probably the things to start with.  If you don't start with psychotherapy, but immediately take medication, it's not very good.  Although the pills saved me at one time, they also caused me a lot of negative consequences and they don't cure the cause, they just hide the symptoms and try to keep you alive.  I hope it helps",BoxOk724,16rvhpl,1
"Yes. I’m in php and I constantly fear that my favorite staff are going to quit or get fired OR that they don’t like me or are annoyed with me. It literally destroys me and everytime a staff DOES quit or get fired it feels like I’m being punched in the gut and it hurts me so deeply. It feels personal even though I know that rationally it’s not about me at all. The other day I literally had a breakdown because I was told I couldn’t get transported anymore and would have to walk, and my borderline immediately stepped in and was like “omg that staff doesn’t like you anymore and he doesn’t want to support you anymore” which caused a spiral and I had a HUGE panic attack and break down, and THEN I got more upset because I was embarrassed and thought I’d be abandoned because of how upset I got.

"I've seen 14 therapists over the course of 9 years.

Some of them were very good. Understood things about me that I was not aware of. Others wasted time focusing on things that did not matter.

I didn't get further than that but that's my two cents.",TheRealTishn,148dr42,1
"I had similar situations. Then I met my first male therapist and psychiatrist. Turns out I couldn't work with other women because instead of helping me with my mental health they'd treat me like a motherless child. Like thanks no thanks. I had a mother and she failed me. I don't need you to try to be a coddling parental figure. My male therapists would straight up tell me I'm being ridiculous, tell me HOW im being ridiculous then helped me find coping skills and a ""method of madness"" in order to cope.

"Therapy is …. Hard. I love going to therapy. It has thankfully helped me immensely but also at the same time it’s important to know that therapy doesn’t make it go away.

Now it’s been about.. 6 or 7 years and I still have bad days for sure but the frequency and intensity of everything has changed significantly 


But also that therapist sounds like a shit therapist and I’m really really sorry she was like that to you. Honestly, I would go to the next appointment and ask her why she was quiet about it and I would tell her how it makes you feel. Just to see what she says",Just-a-ghost-at-most,148dr42,1

"I relate to this so much; feel like I could have written it myself. I’ve been in therapy on and off since I was 6 (35 now). 

I’m wondering, have you thought about describing the thoughts you have when you have a trigger, as well as the specific emotions that are coming up? I used to give some details like I did x after experiencing y, but until I was 33  I had very little experience in actually describing the emotions I have and what thoughts correspond to what emotions. It’s specific I know, but it helped me in getting my self-awareness to work for me.",fairylint,xv0o70,1
"Knowing that your therapy sessions can stay private can be a huge relief. I remember when I once had to live with and work very closely with a textbook narcissist, she started to resent me journaling. She began to make demands that after I journal, I let her read it? And somehow letting me know before hand that she would read it made it okay? I told her point blank, “There is no point in having a journal at all if I have to write knowing you’ll read it.” 

I suspected that she was going to read it anyway while I showered for example, so I stopped writing in my journal completely. Which contributed to me basically having a breakdown and losing my mind just two weeks in 😬

I do therapy weekly, and sometimes I like to share with my husband what I learned or talked about. There are times, though, that I need to talk about my husband with my therapist, because I am pretty sure that what I’m feeling or thinking is unhealthy and I don’t want him to have to deal with it. My therapist is extremely good about advocating for my husband and helping me recognize his needs and wants and how valid they are. She is someone I can trust to help me be good to my husband and to support our marriage. It is so important to have the space for that. And I know that if my husband does therapy, in order for him to feel safe and like it’s valuable, I let him know that he of course can talk about me and that I’m not going to ask him afterwards about the session. 

I know that hearing either of those things may not be very helpful right now to you while you feel jealous. Remember that your boyfriend’s therapist is literally being paid to talk to him, and there are ethical boundaries that make it so she isn’t disclosing very much about herself. This is her job, and she’s probably got twenty more clients to think about. Their sessions are not going to be anything close to the two way give and take that you will have with your boyfriend. 

With my husband, I have a system of when I get anxious, I ask for “mush”—verbal affirmations. My husband will then tell me that he loves me, that I’m his favorite human, that I’m fun and interesting to talk to, etc. And if I still feel anxious, I just keep asking for mush. And if I’m STILL anxious, it’s probably because I’m having negative self talk, so I’ll try practicing affirmations to counteract whatever negative self talk there is. Usually that’s enough to calm me down. It’s kind of a nightly ritual with us. He used to stress about it because he felt like he needed to come up with truly original stuff every time I asked, but I told him, “No actually it can be really repetitive and still very effective. I’m listening more closely to your tone of voice than what you’re saying anyway.” That made him feel much more relaxed about providing reassurance. 

Most importantly, I make sure we both know that if I can’t calm down and feel reassured, that is my responsibility. BPD typically entails trying to get other people to help us regulate our emotions for us. My husband can be helpful, but if his help isn’t quite enough, then I know I need to start digging into DBT skills to calm myself down.",PlatypusDouble2331,wb2f5q,1
"The only type of therapy that has ever been remotely helpful is called EMDR therapy. Every other therapist never understood the depths of my struggles… except my current one. She’s the first I’ve seen doing this type of therapy and it’s been life changing. 
It is heavy and I find myself canceling a bit… but these therapist understand that these feelings come from past trauma… a reason. You work to go back and heal that part… and they truly understand.

"I'm sorry you had a bad experience. I think a good therapist is getting harder to find. They're in high demand right now. My last in person therapist was very obviously new. She was young & obviously nervous. She would read off of worksheets she had & would like.. have the paper on a table & put her elbows on the table & put her hands on her forehead, like hiding herself, while she read it out loud to me.. it was strange. She didn't know what the amygdala was. She kept calling it weird/different names every time she read it. I felt bad because she might just need practice but with the level of trauma I have, I didn't think she could handle it so I had to go elsewhere. I could only get a therapist on zoom after that & apparently I don't do well with that. She was good. But I didn't like being able to see myself talk & I felt a lot more on the spot & uncomfortable on camera. So anyway, keep trying to find a good one. Someone once told me to interview your therapist first. It's not just about them getting to know you. They've gotta be a good fit for you too.",Jimfkingcarrey,183v30f,1
"I've honestly been researching it for years and I think the data sucks on it.   It is a huge money maker so you need to be careful who you ask about it or what studies you look at.    I had one office promoting it like it was a God send and was not open to any other options.   Then kept throwing data from there own studies that are not accurate in the least.   I've also talked to many people that have done it and not one has had lasting relief.  Asked multiple therapists about it and not one lasting relief in their patients.   I feel there is a placebo effect in the beginning.    Lastly it is something that needs to be done everyday so unrealistic for people with very severe debilitating depression.   And better hope your insurance covers if fully because it is rediculously expensive.   It is basically a cash register for the offices doing this in high volume.   

I found major relief from depression using ketamine infusions.   Not the low dose prescription available but actual 45 min infusions at high does of 200mg.    Again probably saved my life during my most suicidal periods.   

I've considered ECT because so many people have gotten relief from major depression including many people ive met personally.   But for bpd it hasn't shown as much success and can make anxiety worse so that became a big no for me.  

The newest thing that has shown very effective in bpd is microdosing.   Sadly it is still only legal very few parts of the US.    Using mdma with therapy has shown major effectiveness in bpd.   Again not legal only in studies.   

Finally deep brain stimulation where they surgically implant a device to stimulate of the brain has shown very effective for depression in studies.   Has not been offered on any large scale or any fda approval for depression.",Ctoffroad,xk9d3q,1
"Group Therapy is actually VERY nice.

Ive done Intensive Outpatient 3 times as I was first finding myself. Its basically 3 or 4 weeks of group Therapy with many therapists teaching you wonderful skills, you get a weekly therapist AND Psychiatrist session. In my US state they could also hook you up with DBT. 

The group was nice cause I didn't need to fake being fine. I wish I was more sociable then but my BPD really made me attach heavily to people.",Support-Muffin,yljlok,1
"Yes I have been on almost all kinds of meds and so so so many anti depressants what I didn’t know is that it makes bpd worse. I had a bad doctor whom lost his license over the way he treated me. I got my dose upped and changed every time I saw him,weekely, I was instantly suicidal. I was trying to end my life basically weekly. It made me acutely  suicidal everyday. 

A few weeks ago at detox I had a seizure and they don’t know if it was caused by my withdrawal(fentanyl) or the antipsychotic I started that day. So I can say I am very very scared to take them. 


I belive with bpd you can get treatment without meds I don’t think they are necessary and only make things worse personally I don’t want to just throw shit at a wall hoping one sticks when my life is on the line and you shoudnt either. Personally for me I will only take anti anxiety’s and sleep aids sense that’s the main reason I used fentanyl and I find them actually help me. You have so dbt and all kinds of other kinds of treatment that aren’t medicine based.

If you worried about an overdose or you ended you life that’s a good reason to not take medication and personally I wouldn’t. It’s your life on the line! Taking meds and bpd in my opinion don’t mix 


My mother dosent understand and keeps telling me I need to be on them for bpd and when I’m not taking them and tells me that’s the only way Ill get better which just isn’t true it only makes things worse!",SwanComprehensive574,17t6dpo,1
"Omg me to!!! It’s hard to trust psychiatrists because they keep changing my doses and meds every two weeks!! I was given gabapentin for anxiety and I was prescribed the highest dose the first time and was put into the hospital because I had a stroke. 
Then I also was prescribed medications that made me hallucinate and gain 10-13 pounds in 3-4 weeks and was gaslit by him asking if I’ve ever been diagnosed with bipolar: like no motherfucker, it’s the fucking meds! I don’t have hallucinations until the meds you fukbfuck. 
God I hate psychiatrists: always making me an experiment and shoving different antidepressants down my throat. I’ve probably tried almost all antidepressants and even did two rounds of TMS for depression. Like I’m starting to think I’m either medication resistant or I just straight up don’t have depression. 
My psych is out until January (lovely) and I met with him last week for an emergency for the hallucinations and he just gaslit me about maybe having bipolar (I dont! It’s the meds) and he just disregarded it and lowered my dose and told me to call him in a week. I called him and he didn’t call me back. I was then told he’s out till January. and so I stopped the meds that made me hallucinate and not have to see my primary for medication refills. God I hate my psychiatrist.",Blondly22,17t6dpo,1
"I have a severe fear of taking ANY medication at this point.  I've taken them all.  I have both faced severe dependancy, even addiction (benzos and pain killers) and faced tardive and dystonic syndromes when taking mood stabilizers.  I also may have aquired a rare neurological condition from taking too many meds, but I will never know.

Frankly, my life has improved each time I cut a med out of my life.  I no longer listen to doctors and controll my own care using some more gentle things like tea to calm me and also signed up for DBT.

Most clinicians don't even know what they're prescribing and once you realize what really happens to us when we take these meds for long periods of time it's quite terrifying.

Good luck and you're not alone.

"First off, I want to say that the process can be very grueling. Don't give up! was just recently diagnosed about 3 weeks ago by my therapist who I have been seeing for a little over a year. Here is my experience: 

I have always thought that I suffered from BPD but the two therapists I had previously wouldn't even acknowledge the thought. I had found my current therapist online and she was an amazing match for me. Around 6 months into seeing her, I mentioned how I thought I had it. She giggled a bit and told me that she respectfully disagreed. I didn't bring it up again for a few months. The next time I did, she told me she still didn't believe I had it but was open to the idea of looking more into it with me as I know myself better than anyone. Over the next couple of weeks, I had to be 100% open and honest about some of the shittiest things I have ever done, my symptoms and honestly the deepest/darkest parts of my mind. Three weeks ago, she finally said she felt comfortable with the diagnosis. I was referred to a psychiatrist for medication management for my other non-BPD related symptoms (bipolar depression) and am actively doing DBT with my therapist. So technically, to answer your question, it took about a year. 

The first step (and the hardest) is finding a good therapist that you feel comfortable with that is willing to hear you out. Once you do, you're going to have to put the work in and talk about the hard stuff. They can't diagnose you if they don't know the full picture; that includes the bad and the ugly. Be honest with your therapist. I honestly feel this expedited my diagnosis. 

As for medication, I was like you as well. I didn't want to take it. But I had gotten to a point where I couldn't live like that anymore and was desperate to try anything. It is always worth a shot. It might help. 

Good luck OP! With persistence, it will all work out in the end :)",Finding_Myself16,w2tuzm,1
"I was diagnosed with GAD and depression in April 2020 and was diagnosed with BPD in May 2021. It took trying lots of different medications, seeing 3 psychiatrists, 2 hospital admissions, and many ER visits.

"I dropped my lexipro after a few months of therapy because I decided being able to NUT was a valuable coping mechanism and the SSRI reminded me of how I felt pre-transition (numb, perpetually dissociative and unreal) and made my suicidality no better.

Hello! I was diagnosed with BPD back in 2018 and I've been going to therapy on and off. I'm currently taking Prozac for my daily medication. I guess my question to you is does it ever go away? I hate being hyper-aware of everyone around me and always feeling like I'm walking on egg shells. I currently have a therapist but with Covid-19 we've been doing video chats but it's just not the same with talking to someone in person. :(,Ninapants97,hp9yzy,1
"Hi! Thank you for doing this and I definitely appreciate you taking the time to answer questions. With COVID/pandemic losing jobs & health insurance has made my weekly DBT skills group inaccessible for the time being. I’m doing what I can with low cost/free resources such as 12 steps groups etc, but it’s nice to be able to ask questions.

I’m still trying to figure out the medication component of my treatment with my psychiatrist. I felt pretty defeated the other day because I feel like after a decade of treatment, I’ve tried so many medications and I seem to have issues with everything. My psychiatrist is working with me to figure out the mood stabilizer component of my medication - we seem to have the anti anxiety, anti depressant, and PTSD/nightmare meds down finally. I’m trying to find something that doesn’t inflame my BED, cause migraines, and now I have to look out for aggravating TMJ/lockjaw at night. I know that the medication is not a cure all and therapy is the much larger component of my treatment, but it would be nice to have a mood stabilizer that works decently and doesn’t make me miserable. Is it wrong for me to want these things out of my medication? Am I asking too much/being too picky? Do you have clients that were able to find liveable concoctions without too many side effects? I guess I am just looking for encouragement.",cop_a_sheel,hp9yzy,1

Quick about me:

Diagnosed BPD 3 years ago. 
Accompanying Dxs: pure ocd, add, anxiety, clinical depression, chronic fatigue, IBS. 

I take 4-5 meds (1 is as needed only), see therapist and psychiatrist regularly, and have a great support system. 

Full time worker (op tech), full time student, wife, mom to two young (and perfect) little girls. 

I have A LOT going on, I know that. And I wouldn’t have it any other way tbh.

Any tips or advice?",misc001,hp9yzy,1
"I have done a lot of DBT inpatient, IOP, and outpatient groups, and I have a skills breakdown when I'm feeling my emotions really intensely and I had a bad skills breakdown when I lost a meaningful relationship about 7 months ago. 

What I've learned is this: it helps to tell others how they can help you remember your skills when you know you're likely to have a skills breakdown. For example, my husband knows how to walk me through a breathing exercise. It helps to practice your skills as much as possible  when you don't need them so when you do, it starts to become a more automatic response. And, build community of support with other fuck freaks like me :)",Alainasaurous,rcrsgc,1
I think DBT has helped me a lot with irrational thoughts. I do agree that some of stuff is common sense which makes it very frustrating. At the same time… Its actually been helping me idk.

"I know this post is kind of old, but I'd like to offer some advice! I struggle with remembering which skills to use when (thanks ADHD!), so I made this thing I call a crisis box. It has the things I need to use during a crisis, like:

* Notecards w/self-soothing ideas (ex: take a shower, smell perfume) in an envelope that tells me WHEN to use them (in this case: when I cannot calm down!)
* Checking the facts flowchart. This is also in an envelope telling me when I need to use it
* Photos of pets, loved ones, and pretty places (good distraction)
* Numbers of people I can contact in a crisis (tip I got from the ER) and my local hospitals Psych ER phone number

"as a child i was abused/manipulated by therapists and forced to take harmful medication as a teen. i swore all of it off in my teens. then i started having severe bipolar symptoms in my early 20s and realized i needed to utilize psychiatry/therapy and have had a huge issue finding not awful, bigoted, manipulative therapists and psychiatrists. most of the decent ones i've had have been interns. i do fortunately now have an awesome lcsw.

the one single time i got into a proper personality disorder program, the first day, IN GROUP, the fuckin director of the program singled me out for dressing ""provocatively,"" because i had just come from work. it was 90 degrees in july in manhattan and i was a bicycle messenger. i was wearing shorts and a tank top cuz otherwise i would die from heat stroke. she starts group by sexualizing me, humiliating me and kicking me out first thing my first fuckin day.

had another lady try to hospitalize me the first couple of minutes of our first ever interaction, during an intake.

had another lady drop me suddenly for being late to a video appointment. she just dropped me in the middle of an appointment and told me to call some places for a new therapist, saying that's all she owed me. it took me months to find her, there was nothing in the are at the time and i was driving like a 45 minute commute i couldn't afford to see her. i was applying for ssi, under her encouragement cus she was ""so incredibly concerned about my stability."" she was treating me for cognitive dysfunction and knew how chaotic my life was. 

then she wrote this really nasty letter saying she ""discharged me for illicit drug use. and i do not tolerate illicit drug use in my clients!"" but i was taking medication assisted therapy and she knew that ahead of time. i didn't say i was a drug user on my intake form cuz i'm not fuckin required to, i wasn't doing drugs at the time and that's not what i was seeing her about, and i knew she wouldn't accept me but i desperately needed some help and she was the only person i'd made contact with after trying for months to find a provider. she treated me like a pathetic helpless child. then she tried to stir up legal trouble for me.

and most recently, my new ""psychiatrist,"" who i was discharged to from intake, i start getting pretty acute (and had not hardly been stable since getting out) and i call him telling please help, ive been hypo am not sleeping, had just been very depressed, and i am feelin big girl mania is about to happen if i don't sleep. i'm begging for a phone call for liek 5 days, like bro i just got out of inpatient!! finally after calling back at random times for like several days, he just leaves a voicemail saying ""i'm gonna be leaving the clinic, so you'll have to call to schedule with a new provider. best of luck to you.""

....fuckin best of luck to you. lol i contemplated hurting myself so i could sue for malpractice :0

there are some gems for sure in the mental health/psychiatric world, but got damn does it take a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of diggin and frustration and honestly, so much unnecessary harm. like bro this shit is life n death to me and you just treat me like i'm a kid crying for ice cream! or like my mental illness is the punishment i deserve for being so naughty and it's your job to make sure i suffer",-brokenxmirror-,1b1001g,1

Cognitive behavioral therapy changed my life for ever and for the better!!,Lucky_Ratio4127,19ek4xo,1
"DBT helped me immensely. I was able to join a 6 month course with a coach, and it was life changing. 

It created a completely new dialogue for understanding and approaching my emotions. It helped me learn new skills to bring awareness to my emotions, to gain more tolerance for feeling my emotions, to cope through them in healthy ways, and to effectively deal with interpersonal relationships in a new way. It helped me get in touch with who I am on a more core level, without the emotional chaos. 

I will say though, it's not the ""solution"". It helped immensely for laying a foundation framework that was never taught to me before. That being said, it focuses mostly on skills in the present moment. Unfortunately, when factoring in trauma, especially early childhood or capital T traumas, it doesn't do much for healing those issues. At least it didn't for me. 

I've relapsed a lot in the three years since I went through that program, both with mental health crises and addictions. However, it can be an incredible stepping stone to building skills and finding some stability, which in turn prepares a person to continue to do deeper work beyond that.

I would 100% recommend anyone with BPD to go through a DBT program if it's available to them. You have to commit to it fully though, and make sure you are practicing skill so they can have a lasting effect. 

The last thing I will say, if people report having that kind of harmful experience, I would imagine their trauma is severe enough that trying to sit with their emotions in any capacity likely causes them to become retraumatized. I'm sure there are other reasons someone would have a negative experience, but I think that's an important one to consider.

Mine was mostly negativity, criticism and blaming but every once in a while there would be an uncontrollable subconscious outburst of anger.

One thing I will say is be careful who you disclose your mental health diagnosis to. You probably wont experience any overt discrimination (I certainly haven't). I found that most people who don't know you very well are very accepting and understanding. For those who do know you (family and friends etc) there can be major problems. Be prepared to never be ""right"" in a dispute or argument ever again! Because ""its your BPD talking.""

It’s not easy and can leave you a little raw, but it can help restructure the way you think and react to a lot of situations.",chuggachuggachewchew,gnhzuh,1
I've been doing EMDR for almost a year and it's done a lot of good. It is tough and exhausting sometimes but it is very useful for trauma. I think it's weird how it works but in a good way :),Raphael_Wanders,gnhzuh,1
"I did EMDR when I was 15 & 16 (about 7ish years ago now) and it was uncomfortable for me. At the end of each session I left feeling confused, overwhelmed, and exhausted. I hadn't talked to anyone about it or their experiences with it until recently, with my moms friend (who's in her late 60s) that also did it a few years ago and had a similar experience with feeling uncomfortable with it. We both found it distracting and find more comfort in talk/art therapies.",theletterqew,qwxw3b,1

"Great question. EMDR doesn’t really “fix” BPD, but it’s a tremendous help.  I just got back from therapy. Had a horrible trauma we were working on.  There are these things called “tappers”, you hold them and go over the trauma a few times, while checking in on where you feel in your body in between.  Once you’re at least semi-relaxed, you relieve the trauma again.  It sucks.  But then you keep going, and you’d be surprised what pops up.  

Like, my trauma is my sister right now, and it took 45 min, but I was able to understand that I misunderstood and that my sister overreacted.  It’s sad, bc my therapist said my sister is displaying all sorts of BPD symptoms.  She’s just under too much stress.

As for remembering your trauma, it will probably surface.  It’s the way the EMDR works.  It’s neurological, as opposed to talk therapy.  There’s some talk, but mostly time is spent with the director ‘s cut.

My 2.5 years inpatient was almost straight through.  It was because of the self harm, but also because my Godparents and Mom wanted me to get help with all of my BPD symptoms.  I don’t mind telling you where.  1 month was in the local psych ward.  It was posh for a psych ward.  Then I was off to Silver Hill, where they do DBT.  It will have been my second time through the 4 rubrics.  It didn’t work for me, but my peers did.  I almost kicked BPD.  

After that, my DBT therapist sent me to Jersey from Philadelphia everyday, and I got depressed again because it was taught so poorly, and I always crossed a suspension bridge.  You can imagine what happened next.  

Back to the psych ward for a month and a half, trying to get to Frederick, MD’s “Clearview Communities.”  That’s where I spent about 1.5-2 years (pardon, I overestimated).  After that, in 2017, I was discharged from inpatient and met everyone and did all the classes from outpatient. Living with my loving, amazing husband.  I give a lot of credit to my mental state to him. And he was doing EMDR, with success, so when we moved and I still had symptoms, that’s when I discovered EMDR.

Finally, I find myself doing “opposite action” the most.  And distress tolerance, like ice shower, etc.  DBT didn’t do much for me, though, and I’ve been through it 2x.   I strongly recommend EMDR: (short article).

"I did a lot of talking therapy over the years, it was pushed in me and that you need to deal with your childhood, experiences, trauma. I tried so hard but it could only get me so far, I was not able to process all of it, but I would always hit wall and not further. Felt like a failure. This was since I was 18yrs on.

I was diagnosed with BPD in my early 30’s, and this time when there were really pushing CBT and mindfulness which did not work for me but continued this was best approach from professionals who didn’t listen. 

When I was diagnosed by the psychiatrist, who recommended DBT and talking therapist- in Uk, there is support via mental health services in NHS, however, it is underfunded and understaffed. My local service, the psychologist are ones who make the decision about the therapy they provide. They would alway refuse me as I functioned too well, so I was on my own. 

I had find support myself and found NLP which I found to be approach for me. 

Talking therapies also feel like a way to re traumatise me. What I’m NLP therapists said of talking therapies, we have trauma experiences which are represented by a one light of each experience. Talking therapy aims to deal with one light at time, however, NLP wants to bypass all this and switch them off electricity",Possible_Laugh_9139,16yrcyr,1
"It really depends on the type of therapy and your therapist. I got 4x a month and see a DBT therapist and used to do DBT group every week. It was really helpful.

Maybe express to yours you don't feel like it's helping and see what her plan is forward. Or just move to a new one.",Dream_Thembo,16yrcyr,1
"what helped me personally with this is keeping my needs in check (self check-in, I can send you pics in DM if you'd like). If all my needs are met and I identify emotions and overstimulation etc. and deal with them before a trigger arises, I am way more equipped to deal with it.

other than that, I try to ""catch"" myself getting angry, and take a step back to catch my breath and practise skills if necessary. I only go back into the triggering situation knowing and upholding my boundaries (if they start raising their voice, I am going to leave the conversation, or, if they start cursing, I am going to leave this conversation). This also makes it less likely to escalate.

If I do yell or raise my voice, I need to apologize and take a step back to have the conversation when I am more equipped to do so.",NikitaWolf6,101shcg,1

"MBT is great therapy, I think a lot of people would prefer it to DBT for reasons.

However, feeling trust and connection with the pros you work with is one of the strongest ways to guess if the results will be positive in the end. So you hate working with this therapist, and that's a pretty bad sign. It could be them, if they are inexperienced or not right for you maybe; or it could be the difficulty of talking about issues with anyone - do you imagine feeling OK or better if you could talk with someone else about the same stuff?

My opinion is that MBT, DBT , treatment title matters less than how you feel doing the work.",TranZeitgeist,11njshz,1
"I have found DBT not helpful for me but i know others finds very helpful and if it works for great.

I know a little about MBT and I know that it would not be good option for me where it could work for other. I find talking about my past and trauma all it does is take me back to then and pain.

I chose and found NLP most helpful for me. 

But at the end of the day, there has be comfort and trust with the professionals you are working with - without that it doesn’t matters the approach, you are not with the right professional and need to find someone who works for you",Possible_Laugh_9139,11njshz,1
"I have BPD and PTSD as well. Did therapy for 6 years, 3 of those involved EMDR. It would have been closer to 1 or 2, but my therapist went on maternity leave in the middle of our time together, and we had to start over. EMDR is intense. I, in all honesty, thought it was a joke and stupid and wouldn't work when we started. Now I'm no longer in therapy for my PTSD, and only my BPD bothers me. For me personally, my PTSD became much more manageable through EMDR. I wanted to self harm less. I don't want to kill myself every day. I still have bad days. I still have nightmares. I still have flashbacks. But no where near as often as I used to. I'm not saying it's for everybody, but I can say it genuinely helped me heal.",social_lee_awkward,u48czi,1

"I kept quitting therapy and tried other things. I minored in philosophy in college so I thought I could just logic myself out of it. I couldn't. Then I tried other paths.

I spent twenty years trying to do something other than therapy. Religion,  AA, self help, you name it. Nothing really worked because my BPD traits would take over and get in the way of whatever help was really available through those paths. So many of those things were more attractive because they required less of me. They were exciting and offered emotional highs in a way therapy does not. All I had to do was ""surrender"" to the group beliefs and become dependent on other people in the group. That was very attractive to me.

With religion I would get these emotional highs like nothing else.  But the lows made me feel like God hated me and I was evil. I would split on every AA sponsor I had. I did stay sober but I was still out of control and miserable. Through self help I got so far into the anti-victimhood rhetoric that I believed when they told me I didn't really have BPD. But the behaviors kept happening and I just wound up hating myself for not being able to get it together. 

Just my experience. Regular therapy is hard and slow and boring sometimes.  But I have not had a screaming fight with anyone I love for five years and that it very important to me. Just my experience.
Also BPD treatment has gotten so much better over the decades. Best wishes.",ElizAnd2Cats,u48czi,1

"Before anything, thank you so much for responding, I feel really lost right now and this means a lot to me.

I do remember seeing some stuff related to stress when looking up more information about my hives yesterday, so that could definitely be it honestly, I won’t lie I am very stressed out. I have managed to calm down a bit since I posted, I cried about half an hour ago again but I’m somewhat calm now, just feeling empty, I am attempting to distract myself once again.

For more information on my meds, I just recently started seeing a psychiatrist after being unmedicated for everything i got going on for so long, we’re starting off with Prozac but my psychiatrist did state I would be put in more medication further down the line, it definitely had been helping but now I don’t know how to even describe what I feel, I keep texting him (my fp) knowing I will receive no response, nothing bad, simply telling him about what I’m doing so he knows I’m not hurting myself while he gets back to me. 

I attempted to get back in contact with an old friend who was genuinely like a brother to me, Ive known him for nearly 7 years but he’s honestly always been flaky, he has not responded despite being online, I’ve been left on delivered for 7 hours. I don’t expect him to, i know I’m not entitled to a response and I’m doing everything i can to try not to take this personally but it really does hurt to realize that you have no one but your fp and now that he’s gone, I’m alone and lost.

"I take effexor and seroquel, let me tell you it was like a breath of fresh air. When I’d first gotten on medication I was shocked, thinking ‘is this what normal people feel like?’ My BPD was extremely painful when it went unmedicated, and even though I am on medication it does persist, but it’s not nearly as intense as it once was. However, if I miss even a day of medication, it’s like I revert back, PLUS the withdrawal symptoms are the worst—headache, nausea, imbalance, etc. So the pro is that I actually feel in control over my emotions and don’t have mental breakdowns as easily as before, the cons are that I’ve become dependent on them and it’s only really helping my BPD while I’m on medication, no lasting effects. What I can say though, I’d take any of those sucky side effects any day over feeling that tumultuous mental struggle every second of every day.

BPD wasn't my only problem during that time. I had a lot going on and had been hospitalized for trying to end my life and increasing anxiety, so it wasn't just about my BPD.

typing that all out now seems insane to me, but it worked for a while. my psychiatrist would adjust/add things as needed (that's how I got to be on them all at once). I think the Lamictal helped, but at the same time, was it the Lamictal or the Lamictal in combination with one or more of the other meds? not 100% sure. I think at the end of the day, it helped me get to a place of self-management with my BPD. but it was still a lot of work; it's always a lot of work. 

meds are so personal. a friend of mine was misdiagnosed as bipolar and they put her on Lamictal. she hated it and said it made her incredibly irritable. sometimes, it's exhausting trying to find meds that help since it's so much trial and error. don't be afraid of trying medication to help relieve the BPD hell spiral, just remember it can take time. medication is a great tool when you find the right one(s).",Inn0c3nc3,16ddz3d,1

"Escitalopram. Iv been on nearly every anti depressant out there (I started taking them at age 11 and I’m now 32) when I was 18 my BPD started showing its ugly face. So I was then put on  quetiapine and then olanzapine after that. I think at that time I was also on sertraline. Anyways I managed to get well enough to come off the antipsychotic medication. I soon started having horribly real nightmare. I found out that they are a side effect of sertraline. 

I was then put on Escitipram for the first time. I have no side affects and my mood has been the stablest it’s been. Anyways about 7 years ago I had to stop taking them. They couldn’t get them in anymore, the pharmacy told me that the price of Escitipram had gone up that much. So I had to come off them and try yet another one. None of them helped me like Escitipram did. I got worse again and had bad thoughts and had to leave work for a couple of months. 

I finally went back to my GP and thankfully she told me they were coming back into stock again. So I went back on them. Took a few months but I finally got stable again. Iv been back on them for a long time now and it’s extremely rare I have trouble with my mental health now. I actually work in a pharmacy now! I never thought I’d be able to work.

out on me - been on Prozac, Effexor, Sertraline and Mirtazapine.

the vortioxetine came along at exactly the right time. i was in a very very bad place and it was either offing myself or ECT. i had the first approval for ECT and it was when i saw the second psych to sign off on it she suggested the med.

"Buspar is tricky. I didn’t feel it helping me until 15mg then went to 30mg twice a day to have it truly help me

Notes: Buspar needs to be taken constantly and you can't miss it, you will know if you miss it. It also needs you to have some food otherwise you can become nauseous, I throw up personally if I don't eat and I take Buspar.

The 10 mg didn't help me much, being honest I was on fluxotine or however you spell it. I was irritated all the time and had all it's bad side effects. Once I stopped fluxotine i was a bit better, but then sophomore year came in 2020 (covid)
I was always stressed and even the 10mg wasn't enough
It took a month to two months after being on 20 mg to tell psychiatrist needed a bit more support and so I went to 30 mg
On 30 mg I felt what someone would say is normal. I still have panic attacks and anxiety, but they are mich more controlled with how long they occur for.
Now they last 10-15 min instead of 40 min to three hours.
Overall it took a while to have the right dosage for me, but I felt after a few weeks on 30 mg much better

I have combined type adhd and BPD and they put me on antidepressants for years. I was like on maybe 10 different kinds … they made me sick physically and one of them gave me serotonin syndrome and put me in the hospital . So yeah never again . So I gave up started drinking again and then down the road when that became a problem they eventually assessed me for adhd got diagnosed prescribed vyvanse which was life changing . My doctor at the time also put me on an anti convulsant (cause I have a history of epilepsy) I guess stimulants lower seizure threshold idk anyways .. ironically it was also a mood stabilizer and my god the most balance I have ever felt in my fucking life was being on those two I swear it’s like I need an “upper” and a “downer” at the same time for my brain to get shit right 🥲.

"Every person will have a different med combo. I am on bupropion for depression, I’ve been taking this for 7 years. I know it works because although I still feel sad, I can manage daily tasks, actually get out of bed. Also when I go off of it thinking I’m better, I ultimately crash into a horrible depression.

I’ve been on buspirone for anxiety just over a year, this  helped me a lot, I didn’t feel like I couldn’t breathe anymore. My anxiety was so bad that I couldn’t like communicate my thoughts or feelings because I didn’t understand them. I couldn’t speak because I was so in my head about people judging me. I have had to up my dose since I started but I feel better since then.

I started taking lamotrigine for mood swings about six weeks ago. My moods were so out of control, it was getting to be too exhausting so yeah. For the first two weeks I was really irritable but is was obviously a side affect, that has stopped and I am feeling a little more stable. 

Just because these work for me doesn’t mean they will work for you. When you start something new, take note about how you are feeling everyday. Don’t be quick to stop taking them, give it 4 weeks at least. It is not good especially for BPD to be changing medication frequently. 

I know how scared you feel right now, but you will feel better with the right medication. This is a life long battle and you may have to switch meds throughout your life. That’s something tough we all have to come to terms with. The most important thing is that you feel okay.",t_monster13,k8ra1g,1

I used to take quetiapine alone but felt I needed something more so now I take it in combination with lexapro, I always take it at night as sleeping medicine and find the combination of the two to kind work for me.
