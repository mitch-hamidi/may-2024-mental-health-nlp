0,i ve been seeing a therapist since the age of       and i m       i ve had to change up who due to whatever circumstances at the time but i ve experienced therapists that act more like your friend and don t really offer constructive feedback i ve experienced therapists who immediately find additional resources that helped immensely my therapists haven t really focused on diagnosis but more on how i m feeling and managing those feelings i will probably continue with therapy for the rest of my life and i m ok with that it s a tool,ChocCoveredSarcasm,1bmk9m2,1,"['i', 'therapist', 'age', 'm', 'due', 'circumstances', 'time', 'experienced', 'therapists', 'more', 'friend', 'constructive', 'feedback', 'additional', 'resources', 'diagnosis', 'feelings', 'therapy', 'rest', 'life', 'tool']",['the age of'],[]

2,been in regular twice a week therapy for over ten years now and have just started an additional program specifically for bpd to run alongside it it s called structural clinical management and looks like it ll be more practical dbt style skills workshops i don t feel like there will be a conflict between the two and tbh i m open to anything that might help my regular therapy is great and allows me a safe place to explore trauma stuff as well as looking into the reasons why i am the way i am whereas i m hoping the new program will skill me up to be more functional in life,bedrock_BEWD,1bmk9m2,1,"['regular', 'twice', 'week', 'therapy', 'ten', 'years', 'additional', 'program', 'bpd', 'structural', 'clinical', 'management', 'more', 'practical', 'dbt', 'style', 'i', 't', 'feel', 'conflict', 'anything', 'great', 'safe', 'place', 'trauma', 'stuff', 'reasons', 'way', 'new', 'functional', 'life']","['two', 'ten years']",[]

4,tried cbt for years and never got anywhere dbt iop saved my life and now i just have weekly sessions might go down to once every two weeks for maintenance it s different for everyone but it took about             months for me to notice a significant improvement that said i do need upkeep in a way that not everyone else does dbt was created as a treatment for borderline and i ve found it to be incredibly useful i don t have the diagnosis on paper because my psychiatrist is an ass but my therapist believes i have a pretty standard case i don t think i d go back to regular cbt again there just wasn t enough for me to work with to actually tackle my problems i needed more clear instructions and tools,sky-amethyst23,1bmk9m2,1,"['tried', 'cbt', 'years', 'iop', 'life', 'weekly', 'sessions', 'weeks', 'maintenance', 'different', 'everyone', 'months', 'significant', 'improvement', 'way', 'treatment', 'borderline', 'useful', 't', 'diagnosis', 'paper', 'psychiatrist', 'ass', 'therapist', 'standard', 'case', 'regular', 'problems', 'clear', 'instructions', 'tools']","['two weeks', 'weekly', 'years', 'about             months']",[]
5,i tried a few different therapists until i found the right one i was in weekly therapy for a year bi weekly for another year and now i just go see her once a month i have less to talk about now because i m understanding a lot more about myself and got through a lot of the hard stuff with her a few years ago now i just go see her because i enjoy talking to her and sometimes i just need that someone to talk to my psychiatrist also wants me to maintain a therapist relationship because i do go through the mud from time to time everyone is different i do think it s important to stay with the same one if you have good rapport so you re not constantly restarting i had to see a psychologist that wasn t my therapist because it s all my insurance would cover and i didn t have a good time trying to do things over again,drowningeliander,1bmk9m2,1,"['few', 'different', 'therapists', 'right', 'weekly', 'therapy', 'year', 'bi', 'month', 'lot', 'more', 'hard', 'stuff', 'years', 'someone', 'psychiatrist', 'therapist', 'relationship', 'mud', 'time', 'everyone', 'important', 'same', 'good', 'rapport', 'psychologist', 'wasn', 't', 'insurance', 'things']","['weekly', 'a year bi weekly', 'a few years ago', 'another year and now']",[]
6,it is complicated there are a bunch of variables do you have the right therapist or the right course of treatment i have found for example that i can only tolerate old man therapists for some reason somehow they comfort me i don t know why but it is true also they have to be at least as intelligent as me or i can t make myself trust anything that they say in the end therapy is what you make of it i m just trying to say that it helps to understand what works for you,Entire-Net5908,1czg16p,1,"['bunch', 'variables', 'right', 'therapist', 'course', 'treatment', 'example', 'old', 'man', 'reason', 'true', 'least', 'intelligent', 'anything', 'end', 'therapy', 'm']",['don'],[]

8,it seems in your case you have little choice i would suggest asking your doctor for an enzyme test or whatever the last test it for medication sensetivities or allergies i struggled with medications and that test is what helped me find one that said therapy is the crux of treatment for me meds suppliment that if i relied on medication only then i would not be better for bpd the skills are incredibly important so yes absolutely get into therapy with or without medication use the tools you can and i wish you best of luck,princefruit,1cpjgso,1,"['case', 'little', 'choice', 'doctor', 'enzyme', 'test', 'last', 'medication', 'sensetivities', 'allergies', 'medications', 'therapy', 'crux', 'treatment', 'suppliment', 'better', 'bpd', 'skills', 'important', 'tools', 'best', 'luck']",[],[]

12,talk to your therapist about your feelings definitely therapy is weird in that everything that comes up is grist for the mill or whatever all of it is useful to bring to therapy if you have a good therapist i remember being really frustrated with cbt specifically because it felt very invalidating for my feelings which i d already had a lifetime of and caused unhelpful cognitive dissonance dbt i had this a little bit with but there are some skills in it i really love and find valuable opposite action wisemind dearman in particular and i really like the structure it has because it helps me organize myself so i d say if it s resistance to the skills because you need them but feel foolish for needing them do the opposite action stuff and process your feelings with your therapist as you work through them find ways to cope with that feeling and resistance and understand yourself better through them depending on the approach being used you could also see if there s a subreddit for it likely and reading others experiences as they work through it might help it feel less like a you thing if you see other people are feeling similarly if it s more feelings about the skills because you already know them or it s invalidating to you ask your therapist to use another approach a lot of them default to cbt and cbt isn t actually the best thing for a lot of issues and you sometimes have to ask for something different i really like act because it s about working with reality and making choices aligned with your values and that helps me in all areas of my bpd issues and majorly helps my shame ifs and somatic approaches have also been helpful for me and i find these three way more useful and validating than anything else i ve tried and they help me feel more connected to myself where cbt made me feel more fractured and disconnected obviously this will be different for everyone gestalt schema and mbt are supposed to be helpful for bpd as well although i have no personal experience with those yet i also have a therapist who specializes in trauma and attachment based issues and has a specific interest in personality disorders which has worked way better for me than someone more general as bpd can be tough for a lot of therapists to work effectively with,IndependentEggplant0,17qzcf9,1,"['talk', 'therapist', 'feelings', 'weird', 'everything', 'grist', 'mill', 'useful', 'good', 'cbt', 'd', 'lifetime', 'unhelpful', 'cognitive', 'dissonance', 'dbt', 'little', 'bit', 'skills', 'love', 'valuable', 'opposite', 'action', 'dearman', 'particular', 'structure', 'resistance', 'foolish', 'stuff', 'ways', 'approach', 'subreddit', 'likely', 'others', 'experiences', 'thing', 'other', 'people', 'more', 'lot', 'isn', 't', 'best', 'issues', 'something', 'different', 'act', 'reality', 'choices', 'values', 'areas', 'bpd', 'shame', 'ifs', 'somatic', 'approaches', 'helpful', 'way', 'anything', 'else', 'connected', 'fractured', 'everyone', 'gestalt', 'schema', 'mbt', 'personal', 'experience', 'trauma', 'attachment', 'specific', 'interest', 'personality', 'disorders', 'someone', 'general', 'tough', 'therapists']",['three'],[]
13,this is the most helpful way to view this issue that i ve seen i ve also always struggled with dbt and therapy in general and my brain rebels against it like it s a trick and does feel patronizing but i feel like i could be more receptive to it thinking of it as yes i do need to figure out how to adopt skills to regulate my emotions and anxieties,gerturtle,17qzcf9,1,"['helpful', 'way', 'issue', 've', 'dbt', 'therapy', 'general', 'brain', 'rebels', 'trick', 'receptive', 'yes', 'skills', 'emotions', 'anxieties']",[],[]
14,i suffered a lot i had no choices but therapy there are pros and cons to it i did emdr for traumas and schema therapy for mild bpd or quiet bpd and codependency the pros it help reduce the high and lies emdr did reduce my triggers by       once upon a time i felt really peaceful if it wasn t for my bad choices due to ingrained coping mechanisms then i started schema therapy it helped me name where i am in my head am i leading the trajectory or is fear leading am i dissociated or still anchored in reality to quote one horrific person but still a good quote you ve gotta name it to claim it dr phil i know just his name gives me nausea still allow the above where emotionally very demanding therapist needs to be well trained and accustomed to pd and trauma meaning either they re gifted or they suffered a lot too very few are gifted dome pretend to most of them had a lit of extreme feelings to it s great when done well you get to know yourself and you win control over your life and emotions you start yo understand that all isn t gloom and doom and you ll start to feel like life has worth instead of wishing daily to ve out of the game the cons while you re doing that your life seems on hold which can trigger anger and frustration although your life is definitely on hold with a pd if you learn how to live with it you can still function you can t hide and you ll have to face yourself this is the hardest thing i have ever done in my entire life blaming my abusers feeling like a victim felt like a breeze compared to that if you are in the us the golden standard for bpd is dbt i find it somewhat abusive myself as i am also a cult victim i preferred schema therapy that gave me the source of the pain and the solution i can chose to use it or not at my own expense therapy is really demanding for pd s you ve got to destruct your identity to built a new one this is now in the cons but should be on both side it s excruciating but salvation therapy is daily commitment if you do not want that do not even start either you ll feel more as a victim or worse end up more damaged you ve got to want it really bad in order to make it work conclusion if i had a comfortable life and my pd in check i would never have searched for therapy life threw me so much lemon that i couldn t slip away i mean the pain was unbearable it was either therapy or suicide i chose to live i do not blame anyone avoiding therapy if there was a magic pill i would have gladly taken it for pd s there isn t unfortunately unless you want to be numb all day which i would totally get btw good luck to you on your way forward i do believe in the fact that all roads leads to rome anyway as long as there is life there is a way,SavorySour,1bepwvs,1,"['lot', 'choices', 'therapy', 'pros', 'cons', 'traumas', 'schema', 'mild', 'bpd', 'quiet', 'codependency', 'high', 'triggers', 'time', 'felt', 'peaceful', 't', 'bad', 'due', 'mechanisms', 'name', 'head', 'trajectory', 'fear', 'reality', 'quote', 'horrific', 'person', 'good', 'ta', 'dr', 'phil', 'nausea', 'above', 'therapist', 'needs', 'trained', 'pd', 'few', 'dome', 'pretend', 'most', 'lit', 'extreme', 'feelings', 's', 'great', 'life', 'emotions', 'understand', 'isn', 'gloom', 'doom', 'daily', 'game', 'hold', 'anger', 'frustration', 'hide', 'hardest', 'thing', 'entire', 'abusers', 'victim', 'breeze', 'golden', 'standard', 'dbt', 'abusive', 'cult', 'source', 'pain', 'solution', 'own', 'expense', 'identity', 'new', 'side', 'salvation', 'commitment', 'worse', 'order', 'conclusion', 'comfortable', 'check', 'much', 'lemon', 'slip', 'unbearable', 'suicide', 'anyone', 'magic', 'pill', 'numb', 'day', 'luck', 'way', 'fact', 'roads']","['daily', 'all day', 'us', 'one', 'the golden standard', 'rome', 'dr phil']",[]

29,i don t know what country you live in but in my country a psychotherapist does not make a diagnosis he only does therapy the diagnosis is made by a psychiatrist in my country to be diagnosed with a personality disorder several conditions must be met age over       because the personality is still developing during childhood and adolescence documented symptoms lasting at least a year so you have to go there for at least       year but even so in my country usually even more years in my case it was perhaps       years since my first contact with a psychiatrist at the age of       even though the suspicion fell much earlier and they must send the patient for a complex psychological examination of the personality to an accredited clinical psychologist based on these results the psychiatrist will give the final official diagnosis of personality disorder the patient can receive this diagnosis much earlier but usually it is only a working diagnosis for experts which is not disclosed to the patient it can still change a lot usually before the diagnosis of bpd a person receives various others such as a depressive or anxiety disorder bipolar disorder adjustment disorder or the pre stage of personality disorder in juvenile patients is disharmonious personality development i went through all these diagnoses before the final dg bpd and anyway i think that bpd is caused by a combination of innate and genetic predispositions with trauma most often developmental cptsd so more important than getting a bpd diagnosis is to work on where the symptoms originated process the trauma and your inner beliefs patterns in psychotherapy what symptoms are you experiencing how long do they last did you grow up in a dysfunctional environment how old are you do you work on yourself do you go to psychotherapy these are probably the things to start with if you don t start with psychotherapy but immediately take medication it s not very good although the pills saved me at one time they also caused me a lot of negative consequences and they don t cure the cause they just hide the symptoms and try to keep you alive i hope it helps,BoxOk724,16rvhpl,1,"['i', 't', 'country', 'psychotherapist', 'diagnosis', 'psychiatrist', 'personality', 'disorder', 'several', 'conditions', 'age', 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'symptoms', 'least', 'year', 'years', 'case', 'first', 'contact', 'suspicion', 'patient', 'complex', 'psychological', 'examination', 'accredited', 'clinical', 'psychologist', 'results', 'final', 'official', 'working', 'experts', 'lot', 'bpd', 'person', 'various', 'others', 'such', 'depressive', 'anxiety', 'bipolar', 'adjustment', 'pre', 'stage', 'juvenile', 'patients', 'disharmonious', 'development', 'diagnoses', 'dg', 'combination', 'innate', 'genetic', 'predispositions', 'trauma', 'developmental', 'cptsd', 'important', 'inner', 'beliefs', 'patterns', 'psychotherapy', 'long', 'last', 'dysfunctional', 'environment', 'old', 'things', 'start', 'medication', 'good', 'pills', 'time', 'negative', 'consequences', 'cure', 'cause', 'alive']","['years', 'at least a year', 'first', 'one', 'at least       year', 'don']",[]
