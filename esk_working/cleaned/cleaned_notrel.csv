"adding to your question, did anyone have a therapist who directly gave them tools/advice on how to go about situations? my therapist says she can't do that and im not sure if that means I should change my therapist. i really like her and im really comfortable with her so the thought of finding a whole new therapist really scares me",grassycroissant,1bmk9m2

I also cringe at anything to wanky or â€œwoo wooâ€. Most of my therapy is just talk therapy so we just talk through things that happened and she tries to help me reframe things a bit.

"For me, how things are framed is crucial. If I get the scientific basis for the stuff I'm supposed to do, I'm more likely to do it. However, I need to trust that the therapist ""gets"" me and how my brain works i.e. it'll have a logically sound argument against whatever it is I'm supposed to do. They need to trick me into thinking it's my own idea (like you need to do with a cat or a intelligent and independent dog) or I'll just nod and say *okay* and then not do the thing anyways.

Talk with your therapist about this. For example, mine had me read *The Myth of Sisyphus* to help with my suicidality before giving me excersises.",nextraordinaire,17qzcf9

"Yeah I wrote it this morning. It's an expression of a certain feeling that sometimes come over me when I think about the relationship I was in. It was ultimately abusive And I'm slowly unpacking how much of what became normal was absolutely not how anybody should ever be treated. But at the time it felt like I was part of something beautiful and special, almost like I've been put on this earth to meet her. At first it was a very nourishing relationship and then slowly it devolved into me constantly having to accept a very one-sided dynamic where I really didn't matter at all to her unless I was actively reassuring. But she simply wasn't capable of returning any of that, or if taking any responsibility for the way that she would be behave for the things that she would say. It was like, if I could just shower her with enough love her cup would be full and she could pour some back into mine. But eventually my cup was empty and all I had to pour was blood. And when I realized that wasn't enough, and that eventually I'd be bled dry, I had to walk away. I know that was the right decision but sometimes I feel like I abandoned an angel. Therapy is helping me understand that that that's a pretty common dynamic of people who fall in love with someone who has border getting some of those more complicated feelings out is difficult but I find poetry to be the best medium so far.

Sorry for rambling lol",PabloTFiccus,1clr556
"Thank you for sharing! It definitely sounds like she was not in the right place mentally and emotionally to give towards a relationship. You didn't abandon herâ€”You showed her an important lesson, which is that it's not okay to be abusive and to expect all effort to be put in  from another person. Being borderline myself, I feel for her and hope that she one day gets the help she needs and learns how to be responsible for her actions and good to her partners. But you did the right thingâ€”we have to love ourselves and see ourselves as worthy of better before anything. 

I'm so glad you found this wonderful outlet and I wish you well on your healing journey!",princefruit,1clr556

I get what you mean about healthy habits vs therapy. I didn't go too in depth into my progress but I think I am doing pretty alright. I was diagnosed at 19 and I'm in my mid 20s. I also have IBS, anxiety, sleep disorder, depression, severe weight gain, and obsessive-compulsive traits that co-exist with my BPD. 

I recently graduated uni, quit all substnces and started to focused on a healthier lifestyle. Literally just having a full night of restful sleep doesn't make me want to scream at people and shit myself when I'm stressed. I am journaling and focusing on self regulation of emotions. I'm trying to have healthier relationships with family and friends. I have been doing much better since the last 2-3 months than the last 6 years. I am on the lowest medication I have been on since 2018 and I think I could even be in remission in 2-3 years.

"One thing to remember is that many bpd are over sharers. We are chronic over sharers and are generally more open and happy to share than the average person. Most people do not share what they talk about in therapy with their partners. 

It's also really good that he likes his therapist, it will hopefully mean he is getting the help he needs with her and feels comfortable enough to actually do therapy properly enough for it to help him. I know it's easier said than done when our jealousy flairs. But the relationship he has with her is very different to the one he has with you,. With her she is only there to listen and guide and help him, like a mentor almost, and that is very different to the relationship he has with you, and him having this boundary is very healthy. 

Bpd often brings out these negative feelings when people do not have the same actions as we do or would like them to, but alot of Bpd actions are unhealthy, the thoughts are incorrect, and they make us have negative emotions that effect the relationships around us.",chanely-bean1123,wb2f5q
"My partners and I talk about basically everything and every detail but we never really talked about therapy. Sometimes I wanted to know and I kinda get why you're feeling this way, but I had to learn to accept that this is their privacy. 
At least for us there were a number of reasons why we usually didn't talk about therapy: we talked about ourselves a lot already and didn't wanted to repeat it again; we don't want to talk about traumatic stuff when were safe at home; it wasn't the time or mood for serious and exhausting topics; we wanted to try learned skills and exercises for ourselves and didn't want the pressure of expectation; we talked about our partners in therapy (and I know that can make you especially paranoid, but if you look at youself you may find that we all need some sort of neutral party sometimes to tell our feelings to); we communicate our feelings in different ways when we are talking to a stranger and already expressed those feelings to our partner in a more intimate way; a problem was solved bc the therapist showed us new ways to handle situations and we wanted to focus on the solution...

Maybe those explanations will help you to stay a bit calmer about it. It may feel secretive but usually there's no intention of keeping secrets if your relationship feels open and trustworthy otherwise.",TetraBall,wb2f5q
"Wow ....

I really appreciate you sharing. Many people on here don't have great access to therapy, so I always wondered what the quality of online therapy would be.

Apparently it's dog shit! Jesus Christ, who fucking says that??

I'm really sorry that you're feeling the way you are. I know it sucks. And I know that it feels like there's no end.

But, there is. Well, mostly. Piece by piece you can begin to remove the pain you feel by addressing it. Your brain is an unreliable machine, so while you may think you are feeling x because of y, it could actually be something entirely different that you never would've considered. This is where a good therapist comes in.

I don't mean to make it sound like an easy job, but each session should kind of be like, ""So, how are you feeling?"" ""Miserable."" ""Ok, why are feeling miserable?"" ""I just can't keep myself from having these bad habits."" ""Ok, what habits?"" ""I'm eating too much, I'm drinking too much..."" ""Ok, how much is too much?"" ""This many."" ""Ok, how does it make you feel?"" ""Like shit. But it's comforting."" ""What's comforting about it?""

You seeing the pattern here?

Imagine you're inside your brain and it's like this huge underground tunnel that's completely dark, and all you have is a flashlight. You've been lost, wandering around in there, trying to make of things that make no sense to you.

The road to recovery is like having a strategy on how to navigate this tunnel.

The first thing you do, is you start to make a map. ""I think this because I feel this"" you take that thought and you go down the path to explore it. This is where having a good therapist really helps, because it's here that they can help course correct you by showing you the influence that's behind those feelings. You may have thought you were doing something good, but were really doing something bad. Once you figure it out, you immediately stop feeling that way.

I did this constantly. I've always tried to be the nicest guy on the planet, and I always wanted to everybody's best friend, and I just handed out love and trust like it was Halloween candy. Whoever comes around gets some. I thought this made me a really good guy that was doing the right thing. Then I come to find out that I really just didn't have an identity, and so I would use anyone around me to supply me with one. That was a big bummer, lol, I really thought I was being the good guy. But I was only hurting myself and using others.

So, you know, had to swallow some pride there. But it was such a wake up call to the reality of my life vs the story I'd been telling myself. It really gave me a new lens to see through, and it was scary as hell. So many embarrassing moments that I felt so justified about at the time. Just recognizing how my emotions took total control over me.

All I'm trying to say here is to please keep up hope. There is a way out of the pain you're feeling. Everything in your body is working against you. You are not expected to be able to handle this on your own.

So don't settle for a therapist until you know that they can do their job. Try to start slowly, establish some trust, but always be honest. No matter what.

If you continue to have trouble, there is literature that can possibly help, and you've always got us if you ever need.

"My therapist used a metaphor for my thoughts.

Imagine your brain is a fridge, and the items inside are your thoughts. The fridges ONLY job is to store the items, and that is it. If you put a block of cheese inside, it will keep it cool. Put butter inside, it keeps it cool. Put an old dirty boot inside, it keeps it cool. 

So basically, your brains job is to store thoughts, and thatâ€™s it (obviously thereâ€™s more to it than that, but you get my point.) The boot is a negative thought is this analogy, and despite being there, the brain does itâ€™s job and stores it. Nothing more, nothing less. 

So basically, donâ€™t dwell on these negative thoughts and donâ€™t act on them. Just know theyâ€™re there, and thatâ€™s all theyâ€™re gonna do. Is be there. And eventually theyâ€™ll become easier to deal with.",VanillaExtractt,xq7asa

"Hey! I am a mom to three little boys. My oldest is just about to turn five. I am so empathetic to your situation. My kids bring out the best of me and the worst of me. Itâ€™s really hard! Itâ€™s okay to walk away and calm down for a minute when you need to. Remember when he was a newborn and you were hammered with â€˜if you need a break, just put them in a safe space like their crib, calm down and come backâ€™. It took me too long to figure out that once they are moving around, you can still use the same strategy. For me, that means I might throw Peppa on for a few, go do some mindfulness in another room, and come back when I can. Some days that looks like three minutes, some itâ€™s longer. Thereâ€™s this concept of coregulation that I am working on too. My eldest has autism and has some really similar triggers to me so we often end up in a puddle on the floor together. But Iâ€™ve been working on modeling calming strategies for him during those moments. Itâ€™s so so hard and takes a lot of practice but I think weâ€™ve both benefited from it.",othersideofthesplit,19fek0t

"Thank you for your reply. You are very right, talking does help. Always. The thing for me is, I've been struggling for more than half of my life now and whenever it's getting a little bit better I'm like all over the fucking place telling everyone how good I'm doing and I'm going to change myself, my image of who I am, basically my whole life will change for good now. Eh, u know the game. A day or two later I'm back in my hole of dirt going nuts about everything. In fear of disappointing others, friends family and also my therapist I play the happy role and pretend everything is still super amazing for me. I know I should be honest to those around me who actually care and lying to my therapist won't get me anywhere but even into deeper.

Maybe it's because I'm scared of telling others the truth about me because in scared they might turn away one day because all these ups and downs are so hard to take... I don't know.

"You have nothing to be embarrassed about. A year ago I was in a similar situation. Not exactly the same but I was living with my dad and he got a girlfriend shortly after my parentâ€™s divorced and she was an abusive alcoholic. I had to cut contact fast and moved into my momâ€™s apartment overnight, bringing only my clothes and I left my 2 cats and dog at my dads because my moms place wasnâ€™t pet friendly. I also couldnâ€™t hold down a job and I was so miserable and lonely. There wasnâ€™t much anyone could say or do to make me feel better, honestly but I understand the loneliness and grief you feel. Nothing made me feel better either. I donâ€™t have the words to explain how much this post is relatable to me because even though I was living with my mom (who is great), I felt homeless. Iâ€™m in contact with my dad again but going back to that house, the one I grew up in is such a dissociation, it really does feel like I never lived there because it was stripped from me so roughly that I too felt naked and vulnerable, like a fresh wound that life kept picking at. I donâ€™t have a solid solution of an activity that will make you feel better, because it took a long time for me to recover but all I can say is take it moment by moment. Thatâ€™s all I could do, thatâ€™s all anyone can do. Taking it day by day is overwhelming so take it second by second. Everything you feel is valid, youâ€™re going through A LOT. And itâ€™s not something thatâ€™s easy to just make a comeback from. Truly the only thing that helped me was taking it second by second, focusing on exactly where I was (not situationally but physically). Take a second to try catch up with your breath, even if it feels like you canâ€™t. Donâ€™t force yourself to do self care activities, if you have the energy go for a walk, if you donâ€™t then just sit and breathe. There isnâ€™t a quick fix for things like this, and Iâ€™m not saying it to be discouraging, the grief you feel is 100% valid and that needs time to be healed. Situations like this suck the life out of you and forcing yourself to do something that people tell you will make you feel better can further drain you and make you feel worse. Just take it second by second. Iâ€™m sending you so much love and I hope that your next second is peaceful, and the next second after that. But even if itâ€™s not, you still have more seconds where it could feel better. You might feel alone but youâ€™re not alone in this feeling and it wonâ€™t last forever, but thatâ€™s not what you need to focus on- what you really need to focus on is rest. Rest is vital for any type of recovery. And I hope you give yourself the space to get some <3",Level-Wave5143,18xf6fb
"I do that. I hate conflict, was around it constantly for 22 years. Physical, emotional, and verbal abuse. Even sexual abuse from my uncle. 

The other day I was on the phone with my mom. Normally I try to just do small talk. But she kept challenging me, saying â€œlet me ask you this.â€ It was about my mental health and God. Me and God have a complicated relationship. And she argued on every question she asked. I did actually take up for myself. Iâ€™m normally a door mat. 

Get off the phone and Iâ€™m shaking, chest is tight, I start stuttering. This is my lead up to a panic attack. I try to keep it together, my son was due to be home from school at any minute. My son knew something was wrong, reminded me to breathe and to go to my safe place. He is only 14. 

My parents are a big trigger. My dad only speaks to me when he has no other option. My sister doesnâ€™t either. My mom tries but my god she is good at manipulating and guilt tripping. Iâ€™m LC with them, Iâ€™m basically a holiday child, we see each other 4-5 times a year. 

They have been a source of anxiety and panic attacks for me for years. The relationship was already strained, got my diagnosis of 5 mental health disorders and they dropped me like trash. So I understand. I also do this with my husband, I cannot take constructive criticism. I get overwhelmed and then I go into a panic attack. He is supportive and our marriage is like everyone else, we have our disagreements. I just wish I didnâ€™t react like I do. Panic attacks suck.",Upset_Reveal_5738,1aiqnrh

In addition, (I don't know if this will work) sit her down. Talk to her about these things, tell her what else you need to do to help her. Sometimes, we have a moment of clarity and realize the things we were doing were unreasonable. 
Keep giving reassurance.
Maybe tell her what was the reason that made you start having the family in the first place.
Or tell her, what made you guys get into the relationship in the first place.
Show her photos of vacation or family stuff and explain to her how happy she was in that moment and that it's not the end.
And try to give her a bit of things to do so she gets busy and get her mind out of those thoughts. At least a bit of distraction.
Try to get her into arts, if she is into it. So she can learn how to express it without self destructing.
Get her to walk and exercise as well.
Try to help her set a goal. A goal that she made and try to support her on it.

"Be careful that you don't just redirect the abuse from outwards to inwards. Hurting yourself  instead of hurting others doesn't actually address the problem. 

It is important to understand the formula for a genuine apology. A good apology acknowledges the other person's hurt and focuses on that. You don't *need* to explain why something happened, unless *they* want to know. The next part is how you are going to fix it now. Again, you need to take *their* feelings into account and not just decide for them what will make it better. Next, a good apology addresses the future. What will you do better next time? Don't fall for the emotional trap that there ""won't be a next time"" because even if the *action* may not occur again, the thoughts or feelings leading up to it probably will and you need an out *before* you get to the action in the future. Have a plan and share it with the person you hurt.

Lastly, you need to realize that the person doesn't *owe* you forgiveness. Some things are unforgivable and the person you hurt has the right to not accept your apology. It isn't about how sorry you are, it's about *them*. Even if a person accepts your apology, you don't have a right to continue your relationship as it was or even to be in their life. To allow you back in after serious misconduct is a vote of trust, but you still have to earn it back by following through with your plan to make things better and try to prevent poor behavior in the future. The ball is in their court.

I know this may sound harsh, but I think a lot of people apologize for the wrong reasons. If you'd like a better explanation of a good apology there's resources online that explain it better than me. Also keep in mind that an apology usually means change. If you aren't going to change, then you need to accept whatever it is about yourself. Maybe you chew with your mouth open and no amount of apology is gonna fix that, so maybe people who get upset about mouth noises just shouldn't be in your life. That's okay and it's probably better for everyone. Some people are only in our life for a short journey and not the long haul and that doesn't make either of you a bad person. 

You also need to forgive yourself. Follow (most) of the steps above when doing this. Understand that you probably will fuck up again, but that's what happens when you're learning something new. Trying to be better and failing neither makes you a bad person nor undoes all the progress you already made. Drinking a beer after 6 months of sobriety doesn't erase that 6 months. 

I didn't mean for this to get so long, but hopefully it helps. You've already made HUGE progress by even recognizing that you acted in a harmful way. You now have the opportunity to use guilt as a tool to improve your life. Don't let it become a weapon for self harm.",Azrai113,1992ohm
I feel this. I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's painful watching ourselves hurt people we care about but for some reason just can't stop.,sunflowertimer,1992ohm
Iâ€™ve found the best way to deal with it is to move forward. I think itâ€™s a trap to do anything about the past. Especially apologizing because people we hurt donâ€™t want to hear it. The realization youâ€™ve made is progress whether it feels like it or not. You canâ€™t change without awareness so you can say youâ€™ve already made the first step toward being less of a crappy person.,melodyinspiration,1992ohm
"Give yourself grace for not knowing then what you know now. Iâ€™ve done some awful things in my alcoholic BPD rage. I realized that I cannot heal from these things unless I forgive myself.

"I think you should reconsider your belief that people youâ€™ve hurt donâ€™t want to hear an apology from youâ€¦ sure that may be true for some people depending on the relationship, what happened, and how long ago, but personally Iâ€™d love to hear a sincere apology from my ex pwBPDâ€¦ if she would just acknowledge the abuse and take accountability for how hurtful some of her behavior was then at least I would have some sort of closure and could move on without feeling so resentful.

I learnt quite a lot from the bot. Though it's mnemonics are useless,

"Whoops...sorry folks, I‚Äôm a boomer...

Actually, much as I‚Äôd love to say you‚Äôre completely wrong, you aren‚Äôt. 

Yea, I‚Äôve met boomers who, like me, have no trouble talking about our mental health and even exchange info when we find a good therapist. 

And then there are those who are exactly like you describe. 

When I was open about my diagnosis friends were appalled that I spoke so openly about it. 

When we took our 3 millennial kids to therapy, family and friends said we were going to ruin them with that ‚Äòmumbo jumbo‚Äù, to quote one. I was also told that all my kids needed was a belt to the ass. That was from my mom of course.",MikiesMom2017,gh3qmr

"Had a huge family tragedy six years ago, so my wife made me start seeing a therapist. Noticed my parents were also having a hard time with said tragedy, so I gave them my therapists number.

Ever since they started seeing the therapist, they've become slightly less Boomer-y,y mom, specifically. She's is much more open and honest about things, feelings, etc. My dad has gotten a lot better, but is still more boomer than my mom.

I think they've also recommended this therapist to their friends, too. So, boomers can change!",CreauxTeeRhobat,gh3qmr

And hes also the one that says vitamins are complete bullshit and they have no proven effect on people. I'm like hello have you seen my blood work???

"Ngl being a boomer is kinda a dumb thing to do with your life, but then again being born in general is kinda a dumb thing to have happen to you. At least you make people happy, unlike me.

So I see a psychotherapist and it can be hard for people to understand processes that are a bit left of field unless they have full context. A conversation I have with him has years of context that most people are unaware of.,,gh3qmr
"Definitely, but she‚Äôs gone now, so it‚Äôs a moot point. 

She was from the generation before the boomers, a narcissist with BPD traits(my husband is a therapist and he figured it out, lord knows she wouldn‚Äôt go see someone), and, as you can probably tell, was abusive.",MikiesMom2017,gh3qmr
"Oh hell, if I could choose it sure as shit wouldn‚Äôt be a boomer! 

I was born in the last five years of the generation, so I‚Äôve been bitching about them since my twenties. 

I laughed my ass off when ‚Äúok boomer‚Äù started. Even if it applies to me as well. 

As for making people happy, I‚Äôm not so sure I have. One thing I‚Äôve learned though, we shouldn‚Äôt always depend on other people to make us happy.",MikiesMom2017,gh3qmr

"Awe man, inserting foot in my mouth now! I'm so sorry! I lost my mom in October and oh my did she need therapy too!! She was incredibly loving, and did everything she could for us kids, but she was a tad bit  psychologically abusive. I also figured out once I was diagnosed with BPD, that she was too. She would always conform to her husband. Her personality always changed to fit him. She'd become his carbon copy. Dressing the same, acting the same, liking the same music, hobbies all that fun stuff. And no one believes me. Towards the end she had started to want to get help for her depression, but it was just too late.",LGEllie,gh3qmr
