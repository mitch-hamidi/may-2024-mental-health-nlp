247,"My mom: don't ever EVER  tell ANYBODY that you're going to therapy or taking medication. Everybody is going to be judging you, nobody will want to be friends with you, that's your biggest secret!!!!!!!


Me: so today I met up with my BFF, we had a great time, got prescribed some drugs, waiting for our next hang out sesh, he just totally GETS me",ayaskl,gh3qmr
248,Boomers care so much about how they look so if they‚Äôre going to therapy there must be something wrong with them! Oh no!!!!!! Lol. I‚Äôm glad our generation is proud to take care of our mental health instead of brushing it under the because of pride and ego.,i_always_give_karma,gh3qmr
249,My therapist tells me not to talk to people about therapy but as if I listen to that guy,,gh3qmr
250,"My aunt looked so shocked when I was like ‚ÄúYeah Amy, my therapist, was telling me about (xyz thing)‚Äù and she was like??? So baffled that I said that at the dinner table???? Like ma‚Äôam everyone (with access) should attempt therapy, we all at some point might encounter things that we need extra help to process! It‚Äôs not a bad word!",gaybitch97,gh3qmr
251,"Whoops...sorry folks, I‚Äôm a boomer...

Actually, much as I‚Äôd love to say you‚Äôre completely wrong, you aren‚Äôt. 

Yea, I‚Äôve met boomers who, like me, have no trouble talking about our mental health and even exchange info when we find a good therapist. 

And then there are those who are exactly like you describe. 

When I was open about my diagnosis friends were appalled that I spoke so openly about it. 

When we took our 3 millennial kids to therapy, family and friends said we were going to ruin them with that ‚Äòmumbo jumbo‚Äù, to quote one. I was also told that all my kids needed was a belt to the ass. That was from my mom of course.",MikiesMom2017,gh3qmr

254,"Had a huge family tragedy six years ago, so my wife made me start seeing a therapist. Noticed my parents were also having a hard time with said tragedy, so I gave them my therapists number.

Ever since they started seeing the therapist, they've become slightly less Boomer-y,y mom, specifically. She's is much more open and honest about things, feelings, etc. My dad has gotten a lot better, but is still more boomer than my mom.

I think they've also recommended this therapist to their friends, too. So, boomers can change!",CreauxTeeRhobat,gh3qmr
255,"Lmao I literally just was like ‚Äúhahaha I just took my ADHD meds for the first time and holy shit they make me actually be able to get shit done‚Äù to my friends, it‚Äôs not even a big deal tf

258,"Sadly, there are also many young people that still look down their noses at those of us who seek out therapy. One of my friends thinks it's a load of b.s. He is also the guy that says that hypnosis doesn't work( I'm not talking about the watch dangling in front of my face), even though I am a completely different person since starting it. And hes also the one that says vitamins are complete bullshit and they have no proven effect on people. I'm like hello have you seen my blood work??? Ugh he is so close minded and needs therapy more than I do!!!",LGEllie,gh3qmr

263,"Ngl being a boomer is kinda a dumb thing to do with your life, but then again being born in general is kinda a dumb thing to have happen to you. At least you make people happy, unlike me.

Im joking, imagine being able to choose what generation you grew up in lol",T34RG45,gh3qmr
264,You want another baby boom? Cause that's how you get another baby boom!,,gh3qmr
265,Fuck boomers.,,gh3qmr
266,So I see a psychotherapist and it can be hard for people to understand processes that are a bit left of field unless they have full context. A conversation I have with him has years of context that most people are unaware of.,,gh3qmr
267,"Definitely, but she‚Äôs gone now, so it‚Äôs a moot point. 

She was from the generation before the boomers, a narcissist with BPD traits(my husband is a therapist and he figured it out, lord knows she wouldn‚Äôt go see someone), and, as you can probably tell, was abusive.",MikiesMom2017,gh3qmr
268,"Oh hell, if I could choose it sure as shit wouldn‚Äôt be a boomer! 

I was born in the last five years of the generation, so I‚Äôve been bitching about them since my twenties. 

I laughed my ass off when ‚Äúok boomer‚Äù started. Even if it applies to me as well. 

As for making people happy, I‚Äôm not so sure I have. One thing I‚Äôve learned though, we shouldn‚Äôt always depend on other people to make us happy.",MikiesMom2017,gh3qmr

270,Ah that makes sense. Thanks for explaining.,Mefandriel,gh3qmr
271,"Awe man, inserting foot in my mouth now! I'm so sorry! I lost my mom in October and oh my did she need therapy too!! She was incredibly loving, and did everything she could for us kids, but she was a tad bit  psychologically abusive. I also figured out once I was diagnosed with BPD, that she was too. She would always conform to her husband. Her personality always changed to fit him. She'd become his carbon copy. Dressing the same, acting the same, liking the same music, hobbies all that fun stuff. And no one believes me. Towards the end she had started to want to get help for her depression, but it was just too late.",LGEllie,gh3qmr

278,"I was the youngest in the group (by like at least 15 years), everyone was upset when I talked and after that I refused to talk scared I‚Äôll make them upset again.

280,"I want to try it, but I'm scared of either coming off crazy or as not ill enough",bebedumpling,zv63ch
281,Yeah sometimes. When you turn up to group and everyone's talking about how they had a skillful week and are feeling okay and I'm the only one who's in crisis I feel so bad for taking up time as the therapists will always talk to anyone who's really struggling slightly more than the others. Even though I'd never wish for any other member to downplay what's going on if they're struggling. Its always good to picture its happening to someone else and see if your thought changes.,,zv63ch

but you? it's all you have, sometimes, and it drowns out the noise that other people maybe don't even have. music is your life. it can set a whole mood for you, get you up from the ground when you're down, keep you moving forward when you have no more motivation perhaps. it's quite literally one of the most beautiful things in the world, and you're gifted to be able to feel that and experience the power of music. the rest, they don't know that.

351,"When I first found out I had Borderline I used a year on trying to spot my Borderline behaviour patterns. Then I starred the therapy exercise grind:

1.Write down any negative believe I connected to myself (independent on if I believe so or not) in an exel table underneath each other titeled ""Schadow"" next column I called ""who said that"" where I identify who explicit acted in a way that made that believe connect to me. Sometimes it is myself and sometimes classmate, my parent etc. Next column is titled ""contra evidence"" where I counter the statement with either my own accomplishments, common sense and acknowledgment of my own struggles and efforts (for example ""I am ugly"" contra: Even if I cannot always see my beauty does not mean that no one can. Beauty is subjective, FP thinks I look good, I like my hair colour, some people look better because they are fake)  The last column is called ""conclusion/Sun"" where I draw a conclusion out of my contra arguments (for example: Through out my life people have been presenting their subjective sense of beauty as objective truth, I don't need to treat it as objective truth)

2. I started an exercise called ""save haven"" where I try to Imagine a loving childhood for me. I have been growing up with people that abused me so I tried to take the few good memories I had and ""exchanged"" them with loving people to ""save the good memories from bad triggers by removing the abusers presence"". I searched in the internet for examples of a loving and independence supporting parent figurines, survival skill resources to include in what the people would have tought me growing up (like cooking my favorite food, them giving me healthy food etc.), also pedagogic content or how they would treat me in case of getting hurt (how they would cheer me up etc.).
2.2 I am an artist but in case you cannot draw you can also make a collage to make a ""foto album"" of your life there and you can take inspiration of others foto albums where things you accomplished were celebrated (for example if you hated your birthdays growing up here you would create pictures where you had a Bday you like looking back to. You can imagine what cake you like, themed decoration, getting a toy you wanted when you were a kid or how much fun it would be to have danced with your ""alternate family"", them celebrating your transition with support, celebrating your existence by appreciation you)

3. I started collecting positive cards deck: affirmations and thinks that I like and love, that inspire me, things I wanna try, bucket list, my values, personality traits that suit and support me, my accomplishments that never got truly celebrated, art, gender expression goals, wholesome memes etc.

4. Whenever I felt like harming myself I would use that to confront myself with my inappropriate behaviour and guilt. Like this Instead of being stuck in self hate I created a space to process parts of my memory and then use the anger at myself to sit down and find better ways I could have reacted in that situation. Like that you use your own pain to turn into a better version of your self by building new behaviour patterns in your brain.",vonWistalia,13tau26

386,"+10 for a GOOD DBT group. Makes things a lot more bearable.

FYI a good DBT usually involves an instructor that knows the content back to front and can control group members regardless of situation. In my group there were a lot of people that would use it as a 'me' session and constantly try to derail or hijack conversations and make it about them. The instructor shut this shit down like a pro.

Also, in my experience DBT is 90% women to men ratio, if you are a guy, don't let this discourage you, but please don't even think about dating / meeting people there either. Your therapy goes a LOT better if you don't connect with anyone outside of class.",demunted,wrys7e

Christian therapists (not just therapists who happen to be Christian, but ones who make it a major point in their business model) tend to be pretty problematic, honestly. I have a friend who grew up seeing Christian counselors, and they really only made her anxiety worse.

Their attitudes toward mental illness in general were unhelpful, and one somehow reached the conclusion that she was Bipolar because she was struggling with both depression and anxiety, and had a tendency to lash out at people when stressed. As an adult, she finally sought treatment from a secular professional and learned that her symptoms were from OCD.",MadotsukiInTheNexus,14bff31

But over time, as you work, little by little, it takes a little less energy to work towards getting better, and the comfortable brokenness becomes more intolerable, and making healthy choices feels a little more natural, and then life starts getting better.

You don‚Äôt have to feel better today. But if you want to feel better ever, you should stick with therapy, because sticking with it is how you get better. It probably won‚Äôt be today or tomorrow, but it will be someday, you‚Äôll wake up, and realize that you‚Äôre sad, but the feeling doesn‚Äôt destroy you or send you into a negative spiral, and you do something healthy to cope with the feeling, and eventually you feel a bit better.

The process works. It just doesn‚Äôt work quickly. But it‚Äôs worth it",TryingToKillTheMoon,133xiub
1478,"It's not about fixing you, it's about helping you help yourself. Be patient with yourself ^ ^",WellWelded,133xiub
1479,"A good therapist, who has experience and training in working with BPD, will understand that you experience both, and accept that. Last session my therapist gave me advice to better myself, and crying, my response was ""I know this will help so why don't I want to do it? Why does it make me feel worse to think about trying?""

And she accepted that, and recognized that change like this was difficult for me, and felt impossible, and that undoing the patterns of behaviour that used to keep me alive is going to cause some strong emotions in me. And she told me that's okay. If I wasn't ready, then I wasn't ready, and that's okay. The idea is there to think about, never gone, and when I feel like I'm ready, I can slowly try to reach for it. But she wasn't disappointed in me, and she understood that right now, in my situation, I genuinely just wasn't ready to take that step. And we broke it down into smaller steps until we found one I might be able to try. 

I had 14 years of therapy that tried to ""fix"" me and force me to change. And now, finally, I'm making progress, and the way I'm doing that is by NOT forcing it. Stepping outside your comfort zone shouldn't hurt, and it shouldn't be agonizing, maybe it makes you a little nervous or hesitant but if you feel this major internal block then something inside you probably isn't ready yet. And that's okay. Part of honouring your needs is recognizing that it's *okay* to say ""you know, I think this might help me, but I don't think I'm ready to take that step quite yet"". And a good therapist will respect that. 

For me, the most life-changing (and honestly, life-*saving*) changes I made came when I knew I was ready. When she proposed the step forward, and I was eager and excited to try it. And that took time, it's taken me over a year to get to the point where I'm ready to start going outside on a regular basis. *And that's okay*. And once I recognized that growth shouldn't hurt, and if it hurts, I'm pushing myself in a direction I'm not ready to go, therapy became a lot easier. And I was able to identify therapists that knew how to help me, and ones that just weren't equipped for that. 

Often the first step is working on and learning regulation techniques that work for you, to calm the overwhelming emotions so you can think clearly. Once you've found those, and learned to use them, then you can move to pushing your limits a little. But it shouldn't hurt, and if it hurts, that's probably a sign you need to stop pushing and step back to look at *what's* hurting, and why. 

You've got this.",BornVolcano,133xiub

I should not be like this. I should be better. I am better, am I not? I can feel better. I just need to try. Why am I not trying? Why won‚Äôt I try? Please just try. I want to try. Why am I not trying? Why?

I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm always tired. I don‚Äôt know when I haven‚Äôt been tired. No matter how much or how little sleep I get I wake up feeling the same- my eyes sliding shut, my mind slow and groggy, my body warm and curled together and being pulled so completely back to unconsciousness. I never ever want to get up. But even if I slept for a week, I‚Äôd probably still be tired. It‚Äôs perpetual exhaustion. I‚Äôm sick of it. Why does rest not heal me? Why does sleep not fulfil me? Why is sleep never enough? Why is nothing ever enough for me to feel okay? I should be okay. I have everything. Why do I have everything except gratitude for what I have? I am awful. I‚Äôm terrible. I am sorry. I‚Äôm sorry that everything is wrong with me. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not trying. I am sorry. I‚Äôm sorry.

I want to go to bed. I want to curl up in the warmth and hide away. I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. I don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt want to inflict myself on people. I don‚Äôt want to inconvenience people with my constant needs that are never enough no matter what I get. I am a terrible thing to be, to be around. I want to go. I will go. I will free you all. I don‚Äôt want to hurt everyone anymore. But will I not hurt them when I go? I can‚Äôt even try to fix things right- whatever I do I‚Äôll hurt someone. What kind of monster is that? I stay, I hurt. I go, I hurt. Which do I do? Which do I do? Which hurts less? I don‚Äôt deserve the loveliness I have, the luck and privilege I hold- I should leave it. But those few, those few who want me around no matter how terrible I am, no matter how the creature claws, they will hurt if I go. I do not want to hurt them. But I am hurting them anyway every time I ask for more, or shut away, or become irritable and lash out, when I do not take care of myself, when I fail to be responsible and do everything I need to, that I should. I never do what I should. I am not what I should be. I will go. I will go. I don‚Äôt want to hurt you. I‚Äôm trying to stop. I am sorry. I‚Äôll go. I‚Äôll go. Please don‚Äôt cry. Please don‚Äôt hurt. I don‚Äôt deserve the affection you hold for me. I don‚Äôt deserve any of the good things you‚Äôve given me. I am not good. I am not. Good.",Difficult-Mood-6981,12a6xdp

Told me he had a few felonies, that videos of violent death get him hard (he was shocked I‚Äôd never watched someone commit suicide online, like that‚Äôs so normal to him), and later I saw a gun nonchalantly sitting on his table. I asked him put it away because guns make me nervous and he put a towel over it. Oh, and I brought condoms because he said he‚Äôs never used them, he has a breeding kink. He complained about them and said he‚Äôs not wearing them next time.

After sex, he asked a few times to see me again, I agreed knowing full well he‚Äôs bad for me. Well guess what? He ghosted me after that. And my insane fucking brain has been so close to literally going to his house to fuck. Sneaking in if I have to. Beg this dude to fuck me. It was so good.

When we think of the same thing as a personality disorder, we send people to go to DBT instead. Unless you genuinely reduce someone's level of suffering, grounding and regulating is going to be insufficient for many people. I can't ground every waking moment, and I used to genuinely constantly suffer every moment. Some therapists won't even see you if you haven't done DBT first. That's their own limitations, not an actual rule for effective treatment, though most therapists won't own their limitations and admit it. You're not weird for finding DBT insufficient.

I did DBT for a little over a year almost 18 months and my previous psychiatrist talked like you, as if it was something that for sure works if you put in the work. My current psychiatrist* shrugged and said it wasn‚Äôt for everyone, and trauma informed therapy might be better for me. So even professionals aren‚Äôt on the same page of its effectiveness. Mental illness and how to fix it isn‚Äôt a monolith and I hope we can free ourselves from treating it as if it is. I‚Äôm glad it works for you though!",yikkoe,17cc1ah
2141,"That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done too! It‚Äôs super helpful to have basic skills and tools I was never given laid out for me. My therapists at the time were non-specialty and their style was mostly listening and providing validation which some people want but not what I was looking for. I wanted feedback, homework, introduction of new concepts. I wanted to change damaging behaviors, not talk about their origins. Whether we talk about it or not, the past happened and it isn‚Äôt changing. The only thing I have any possibility of changing is the present. I want to be in control of myself and my choices, because the only bad thing happening to me now is me üòÇ

I made a DBT notebook with a goofy ass acronym on the front and hand-wrote/illustrated/decorated. I‚Äôm a visual, creative person so it was almost like an art project or highlighting your notes x 10.

It fits in my bag I always bring so it‚Äôs always accessible in a way I understand with notes, cues, examples, etc. It might sound extra but it works for me for now.

2143,"Thank you! I really think that making it sound like it's a one size fits all type therapy is genuinely unhelpful. I understand and agree that literally ALL therapy won't work if you don't try. But I hate that when therapy doesn't work for someone, people assume that it's due to the person not trying hard enough. If someone is taking a medication and they say it doesn't work, is our first thought that the person isn't actually taking the medication? Probably not for many. I really wish we could give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to their mental health as well. 

For me, I think DBT isn't what I need right now. To me, DBT would be the final step to my mental health journey, if it were to go well. 12 years of (various types of) therapy and nothing has worked because I am not addressing the first step. I have hope that finding a trauma informed therapist, or doing something like EMDR might be that first step, and if it is then maybe DBT will only work and be useful then. And I think many people are on a similar journey.

Mental health is such a strange thing. With a personality disorder our entire brain is rewired and no two brains are alike. I hope we have more empathy towards those who are still on the journey to understand themselves and find what works best for them.",yikkoe,17cc1ah
2144,"I totally get why you feel this way my friend. But if I could offer some advice, therapists are here for you. If your therapist has so far shown professionalism and understanding and no judgement, you can tell them almost everywhere. They should be your safe space and most will uphold that belief for sure. I hope you will eventually feel comfortable to talk to them so they can offer you the best of care and support ‚ù§Ô∏è",yikkoe,17cc1ah
2145,"Banal imo is such a good way of putting it FOR ME. I understand some people absolutely need that kind of therapy, and I am glad it is available and more known about for people who need it. For me though, yes it was incredibly underwhelming. My personal goals and challenges with BPD are not so much emotional regulation, but ridding myself from a lifelong sense of not belonging. And DBT has not really helped with that. I feel like DBT might work for people who have known or experienced positive feelings in the past, so it's easier to know where you're heading when you do the skills it teaches. But to me right now, that's not what I need from therapy. What i need from therapy is to process my trauma, not to learn how to keep my emotions in check. Maybe once that's done, DBT will be more useful? But right now for me it's not. 

I do like the ""how to talk to people"" skills though. I have bad social anxiety and worry a lot about how to talk to people, so having clear guidelines definitely helped.",yikkoe,17cc1ah
2146,Yes you have to participate in therapy for it to work.... what a novel concept,Mean_Piccolo_210,17cc1ah
2147,"It‚Äôs not safe for people with DBT to engage in trauma therapy until they have learned how to emotionally regulate. If you have someone demonstrating suicidal, self harm, and other damaging behaviour due to their inability to deal with negative emotions, why would you put them through a therapy which would increase negative emotions in the short term? 

I eventually did trauma therapy, but I had to do a year of DBT first. Without it, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to handle it.",VastClimate4195,17cc1ah

It's a blessing in my life. 

I also hate it. I can see how it's not beat practice for everyone with BPD or associated mental illness. One being that I think it can come across as sounding as if you are in control of your level of suffering and misery and to me it has an AA vibe like showing gratitude and acceptance for even the shit in your life which I found a benefit in but I pushed back on that so hard. It's like am I just gaslighting myself?

I would find it difficult to keep going to DBT if I wasn't also doing trauma informed counseling and internal family systems therapy. It's emotionally exhausting for me that getting to talk about trauma and shit feels like a break.

2150,"Okay well first of all and to be clear, I wasn‚Äôt saying oh it for sure works if you put effort in but most people I talk to that criticize it haven‚Äôt even done it very long. DBT is something you continue for the rest of your life and the more you practice it the more those skills take the place of irrational responses which are the underlier of our presented symptoms. Obviously I agree that everyone is different and has different goals and maybe it doesn‚Äôt work for everyone and that‚Äôs fine too. But there‚Äôs a clear hatred for it in this sub and it always confuses me and that‚Äôs why I said what I said. even in the first few months of discovering DBT I had gratitude for it and it helps me understand better ways to respond to my triggers.

2155,"Thank you so much for sharing your experience. I genuinely believe that‚Äôs what I need too, trauma therapy. I am a big hater of DBT when I‚Äôm feeling silly goofy and a hater but in reality I think I need to (SLOWLY) process my trauma before I can go through DBT again, for reasons you‚Äôve shared. To me, it always felt like masking 101. ‚ÄúYou have bad feelings? Tough shit lol keep it to yourself and be happy‚Äù. I know that‚Äôs not the actual purpose of course, but like you said for some of us I guess, you can‚Äôt go from ‚Äúwhy did I go through this trauma especially as a child??‚Äù to ‚ÄúI am actually doing just fine üôÇ‚Äù. There has to be some kind of understanding of what happened before blind acceptance, and there has to be some kind of gentle reality check in order to be thankful for what you have. In the last couple weeks in the midst of a mental breakdown, I‚Äôve been more active on here so I can recalibrate how I think. I stopped isolating my life as some ‚Äúspecial never seen before‚Äù experience, and realized a lot of us, not just people with BPD, are going through it. So it‚Äôs not my fault, as much as my brain tries to make me believe that. And it‚Äôs a slow process and I think I need a professional to hold my hand and guide me through really internalizing this reality. And then if that leads to a healthier mindset, maybe then can DBT help. 

I‚Äôm thankful to hear from people who have had similar experiences. I do think everyone should at least try DBT. But I also think it‚Äôs not for everyone. We don‚Äôt all deal with this disorder the same and we don‚Äôt have it for the same reasons.",yikkoe,17cc1ah
2156,"See this is why I don‚Äôt think DBT therapy with a therapist is the same as what I do bc I don‚Äôt get that vibe from DBT at all. It‚Äôs interesting to me how different everyone feels about it to say the least. But I also actually worked through my trauma first using workbooks and sounding boards and it was hard as hell and I struggled a lot but I feel I am genuinely healing now and working through my trauma and not just saying ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm fine even though I feel this way.‚Äù That‚Äôs why I think DBT isn‚Äôt being used by everyone effectively. You have to actually work out the trauma before you can change your behavioral response to that trauma. For me, I have to go through why I feel the way that I do before I can change how I react to those feelings. If you don‚Äôt clearly have a healthy understanding of why you went through what you went through and get a healthier mindset going, learning skills isn‚Äôt going to make any difference in my opinion. Again though, obviously my experience is even more different bc I‚Äôm not doing it with a therapist and it has been wildly helpful for me. I‚Äôm not gaslighting myself into thinking I‚Äôm okay when I‚Äôm not and I‚Äôm definitely not masking my feelings either. I‚Äôm learning the appropriate ways to notice how each feeling feels and learning how to express that in healthy ways that don‚Äôt make me suicidal and ruin my relationships lol.

2160,"Oh that skill is rough as well, it definitely doesn't make it go away. I've come to realize that my expectations of DBT were just not what I understood of it. I also thought ""Oh so if I keep doing this, the bad stuff goes away?"" Nope. The bad stuff doesn't go away, but you learn to make the bad stuff not hurt as much ... sometimes. And I was devastated when I understood that. I think with age also (I'm nearing 30 lol) I am realizing that genuinely most people are miserable or at least sad, but we live in a time period in human's history where what's considered to be ""good"" and ""healthy"" is to keep it away from your outside life, if that makes sense? And most neurotypical people are just good at masking to the point of convincing themselves. And DBT teaches you to do that, sorta. So not to blow up on your boss, not to freak out as soon as something bad happens. The feeling is gonna be there, but you don't externalize it and make it someone else's problem, which sometimes might make you feel bad in return. And like, I get it. But me personally, that's not what I need help with. I need help processing my trauma, so I can maybe hopefully one day start experiencing joy.

and people, in my experience, are overwhelmingly judgemental. i‚Äôve always received backlash and judgement from people when opening up, especially within the mental health community. and while others may not experience paranoia or anxiety, i do, and in such cases, it is best to simply abstain from something if you feel the alternative is going to be harmful to you in any way (or, at least, that‚Äôs what i do. bc i care abt my mental health)

if the options are to suffer alone in private or suffer publicly in front of a group, then i‚Äôll just go it alone. therapy can have benefits but isn‚Äôt particularly helpful if you‚Äôre too afraid to open up or contribute anything because you‚Äôve been placed centre stage. i have a hard enough time during one-on-one therapy because i don‚Äôt inherently trust every stranger i meet (or that i pay to pretend to care about me). it‚Äôs great that others have no fear of judgement or whatever and can just traumadump to anyone who will listen but i can‚Äôt do that personally",unholyarcana,17cc1ah

It seems that you would more prefer a webinar style of things or even just some YouTube videos on the different techniques. But group therapy is kinda just what it is.

2185,"a few ways:

prescription (see r/therapeuticketamine) - in the usa, psychiatrists and specialty clinics can prescribe ketamine, especially for ""treatment resistant depression"".  it's really luck of the draw with psychiatrists though since some are on board and some want nothing to do with ketamine.  the ketamine clinics will get you an easy prescription but they want you to get an injection or spray while you're on the facility (rarely at home, i think).  i don't know outside the usa.

startups like joyous and mindbloom are easy prescriptions (i think) if you're in their territory for oral ketamine -- my understanding is it's pretty weak but i haven't tried it.  again, usa only - i don't know anything about outside the usa.

old fashioned way of finding someone who knows someone -- if you don't know degenerates, or go out dancing etc, some people use tinder i guess!  r/ketamine maybe can help with this

dark web -- be cautious if you don't know someone to teach you because there are apparently lots of scammers.  it sounds like it can take a while to learn.  it sounds like once you figure out how to do it, and have enough money, you can get anything.  so don't do this if you don't have self control & can be careful & trust yourself to be safe around this stuff.

You're lucid on ketamine unless you do huge anesthetic doses by injection when it becomes an anesthetic used on horses, cats, children, babies (because it's very safe and doesn't stop breathing).  You could never do that high a dose on accident, especially if you don't inject (most ppl don't except by doctors).  If you do a lot you're more likely to go into a k-hole, which can put you into a puddle but you're conscious and is short and safe unless you're doing it in a risky situation.

It's more like a very effective fun antidepressant, except unlike antidepressants the science seems to be showing it's specifically effective for bpd (but research is early).  Anecdotally, ketamine is a drug of choice for a lot of bpd people for a reason!",rakuu,zvs6pt

2553,"Of course! Glad to help and thanks for expressing gratitude. I‚Äôve been dealing with mental health issues all my life. It hasn‚Äôt been easy but it has been worth the effort to get better. And by better I mean learning healthy coping mechanisms which aim to reduce the frequency, duration, and intensity of episodes. There‚Äôs a good song lyric I like by Nhako and Medicine for the people that goes:

‚ÄúWell, I dedicate my life to the people who need the light help them rise above the scam on the land and their lives. And it‚Äôs difficult to say exactly what to do, but the change begins with me and I reflect back to you, and you and you‚Äù 

Also, this song by [twenty one pilots](https://youtu.be/TRd0_ZQbHxg) and this song by [Miley Cyrus](https://youtu.be/2zZRDd9TDF4) has helped me get through some dark times. Not sure if you‚Äôll enjoy but figured I‚Äôd share üôÇ",,117y1as

In the past I couldn't stay clean from self harm for more than a year, something bad would happen and I would relapse. I've been clean almost two years now and it's completely due to the DBT skills I forced myself to apply in the moment.

Nothing else (well, PTSD etc. are co-morbidities). In the papers it always said BPD or just patients (""females"" in particular. It was always the female version, so strange).

I'd like to know, what did they say to you about dissociation? Cuz we had to go through it all alone, all patients who had no experience in it were scared and clueless on how to help, until we told them that they're technically not allowed to help us. I also didn't know how they could help me - cuz it wasn't allowed. I also did not learn how to help myself tho lol",EmmaG2021,zruq60

Just so I know for future german BPD acquaintances, as I said before I'll go to a trauma-specialised clinic soon and probably do some DBT there too.",Lealarou,xuprmv

All of it was made up, so ppl would like her. Nobody liked her after she confessed, but she was very clingy and attention seeking before so I was kind to her but tried to keep my distance lol.

Im going to ZfP Reichenau Station 61 (SINOVA-Klinik), that's for DBT. I can come back here to say how I liked it if u want. Good luck with ur therapy :)

Adverse childhood experiences (which from my understanding are incredibly common amongst those with bpd) are also known to cause heart problems due to stress so it's no wonder that people experiencing a mental disorder that is pretty traumatic just to live with in and of itself would put someone at higher risk for loss of life at a young age.

[The study](https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/home/topics/general-psychiatry/early-mortality-in-patients-with-borderline-personality-disorder/) was about early mortality rates in BPD patients (so the theme was correct), but the part they misinterpreted was the participants age who partoook in the study:

A safe space can be anywhere where you feel comfortable enough to lower your barriers, let your guard down, be ok with just existing.

 >Mentalization-based treatment (MBT) is an integrative form of psychotherapy, bringing together aspects of psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, systemic and ecological approaches. MBT was developed and manualised by Peter Fonagy and Anthony Bateman, designed for individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Some of these individuals suffer from disorganized attachment and failed to develop a robust mentalization capacity. Fonagy and Bateman define mentalization as the process by which we implicitly and explicitly interpret the actions of oneself and others as meaningful on the basis of intentional mental states.

This is part of rewiring your brain & before you realize it you will be using your skills without even knowing it. Practising your skills when you are not in crisis will give you that muscle memory, for lack of a better term, & your skills will begin to become second nature.

It's almost like how treatment for trauma works‚Äîthey want to make us practice those skills over and over because in our minds, we're solidifying those neural connections, those associations to something better. We're unlearning patterns and relearning new ones until we ultimately become conditioned to thinking one way. 

We were conditioned to think in shitty, invalidating, and maladaptive ways for so long that that's the only way we know how to think. When we learn the tools to unlearn them and put those tools to practice, we can almost ""re-condition"" ourselves, if you will<3",cassiusthetic,lkaezh

For me personally, as someone who grew up dirt poor, queer, and with prolonged childhood abuse + multiple different types of trauma from a myriad of life events, I feel like I'm just too... complicated for it to really work for me. Not that I have it worse than others, but DBT just unfortunately does not work, at least not long-term, for everyone. It made me a nervous wreck to go through it.

I think a lot of people put doctors on a pedestal, and don't believe in themselves and their own research and (healthy!) coping mechanisms enough. I've honestly made a lot more progress just listening to myself and teaching *myself* how to deal with it.

You go shove your face in a bowl of ice water, therapist.

I throughly believe it is a modality chosen by therapists who want an easy paycheck, and to gaslight their client for simply not trying hard enough and not using enough skills.

I called my DBT therapist while considering taking myself to the ER for support, and she literally said ""What are they going to do?"" She asked me when I was going to move on from pursuing a legal resolution against my stalker and rapist. Sometimes the therapist is just a bad therapist.

Extremes feel so fucking good. Self harm, sex, drugs and alcohol, shopping, yelling and arguing, intense exercise. DBT tells us how to control ourselves from doing those things, but doesn‚Äôt address the *feeling*

Behavior change can include both decreasing harmful behaviors and increasing helpful ones. Helpful/effective behaviors can help to fill the void over time. This can be a whole variety of things, but some examples could be taking steps to build new, healthy relationships; working on a hobby; learning a new skill (building mastery); doing more things that bring you even a little joy (accumulating positives); working towards a long-term goal that is in line with your values; etc. Basically all of Emotion Regulation. If you have the DBT book, I recommend reading the ‚ÄúAccumulating Positives in the Long Term‚Äù section. That really helped me.

4505,"""So we have to try it.""

I will at least confirm this was my mindset going into DBT. My year with it is almost up. I did not feel my time with it was helpful, but I learned a perspective that will help me with my clients in the future. I am a person who finds greater progress through narrative focused and trauma focused therapy. EMDR has been very useful, same with Fraiser's Disassociative Table, also known as Ego-State therapy. (For Ego State, think Inside Out, and you personify your emotions or hurt into something you can talk to or tell off.)

I am currently studying to be a therapist. And I was suggested DBT by one provider who claims I have BPD, and now I have a new therapist who is adamant I don't have BPD. I feel inclined to trust the latter as they have more experience working with BPD people, and spent time in a BPD only facility for over 5 years.

Regardless, I have an assessment in a few months to confirm.

So I gave DBT an earnest try for a year. But I knew when I opened the ""Pleasant Events"" list and the first two to stand out were literally ""hug a tree"" and ""do living history reenactment"" -- oh I was not amused. Showed it to my partner with a derisive ""OH hey, Gettysburg, wanna go hug a tree and pretend to die in a war??""

Mindfulness and emotional regulation were things I had already done before DBT. Opposite action was already my go-to. And when you have anger and fear, the opposites for both are the opposites of each other. It was such a condescending and remedial set of tools to be given, and I don't understand why that book is worth $40.

I appreciate that it is a life saving tool for others, but for me it was infuriating. People deserve to be heard, not be asked what skills they used to make their emotions more comfortable for those around them.",PokemonBreederJess,wjr44j
4506,"Some people also might not be ready to dedicate the time and work into DBT that it requires and that‚Äôs okay! I agree with the ‚Äúfixing‚Äù issue you brought up.

Non-violent communication is another type of therapy that has helped me. The idea of identifying your emotions and needs and connecting emotions to needs (I feel x so I might need y) has been very helpful for me.

I kinda think of it like this:

1. Be in high distress and do ineffective behavior

2. Be in high distress and do ineffective behavior. Afterwards, someone points out that you could have used a DBT skill.

3. Be in high distress and do ineffective behavior. Afterwards, you realize that you could have used a DBT skill.

4. Be in high distress. Realize that you could use a DBT skill. Still do ineffective behavior.

5. Be in high distress. Realize that you could use a *specific* DBT skill. Still do ineffective behavior.

6. Be in high distress. Realize that you could use a *specific* DBT skill. Think about doing it. Still do ineffective behavior.

7. Be in high distress. Realize that you could use a *specific* DBT skill. Think about doing it and try some aspect of it. Still do ineffective behavior.

8. Be in high distress. Realize that you could use a *specific* DBT skill. Use the skill. Maybe you don‚Äôt use the ineffective behavior. Maybe you do, but you put it off for a bit. In that case, the distress tolerance skill worked, but in the future you could follow it up with other skills (emotion regulation, etc) 

9. Be in high distress. Realize that you could use a *specific* DBT skill. Use the skill. Don‚Äôt use the ineffective behavior. Once calmer, follow distress tolerance up with other skills (emotion regulation, etc)

One big feature of DBT is group supervision for therapists - when it was designed, Marsha Linehan understood that working with complex problems and borderline required supporting the clinicians, and achieves that with regular 1-1 and group consultations where each clinician can discuss and get help with their cases.

4608,"It's expensive in Australia too, just not as expensive as it would be in the US. I have experience with both. 

In Australia, my clinical psychologist charges ~$220 per session. After going to a GP for a referral (free), you get 10 partially-reimbursed sessions per year with Medicare (socialized healthcare). It's only ~$120 per session though so you have to pay the remainder. And then, after 10 sessions, you either have to pay the full price out of pocket for any additional sessions or wait until the next year for another 10 partially-reimbursed ones.

Psychiatrists have certain $$ reimbursements too but it's never the cost of a full session, so you have to pay the remainder there too. And meds are subsidised by the government, depending on the med, so they're cheaper than they would be in the US but you'll still wind up paying a couple hundred bucks a year for meds.

If you go into the public system, it's free except for the meds but the treatment you get is definitely hit or miss. Can't pick your psychiatrist or psychologist and your sessions will be on their schedule, not yours, so definitely all over the place and not as stable as if you go private like I've described above. And a lot of the time you'll be turned down through the public system (or put on a really long waiting list, like stupid long, over a year in some instances) if you have enough money or a job to afford private help in the meantime.",-deebrie-,i81ovz

4987,"Yes, Mindfulness is the premise, I believe (may be the wrong term, sorry) behind DBT, which is what Linnehan, and many, believe is the... 'best' modality for those of us with BPD to improve by. 

I've seen many people online say it helps and there are lessons from DBT that are of use to me now. 

But I had a very hard time grasping the concept and being still, redirecting my thoughts. My favorite (past) therapist called me the poster child for Anti-Mindfulness. (Ofc, my being obtuse with it doesn't equate to you or anyone, just my experience.)

CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dr. David Burns - ""Feeling Good"" book) made far more sense to me. I knew my thoughts were messed up. LoL Everyone who knew me could see that!

CBT is about recognizing and challenging distorted and automatic negative thoughts. I didn't put much stock that I could 'create different neural pathways.' That sounded like some bs foo foo psych mumbo jumbo to me. BUT, I NEEDED SOMETHING DIFFERENT. So, I tried it. If I hadn't stuck with it, and participated in a classroom/group setting... I won't say what might have been. But what DID happen? I'm in the first solid, trusting, communicative relationship of my life, for 7 years now. (And I was married from like 1993(4?) until 2005ish.) I still have tough times. Especially the past year, I think even folks who've never dealt with a day of depression, have come to recognize some new lows of their own. But I KNOW that the bad times don't mean it's the end of my world. 

So I'm rambling, watching nature documentary and keep forgetting to type. Sorry. 

Whatever works best for you, embrace it! Don't be afraid to speak up to your therapist or doctor if something isn't working for you. 

My current therapist ( nice guy, 20 years younger  than me!) wanted to use this Behavioral Activation stuff and I hate change. I try to be agreeable with new providers. But it's been a rough year, my son is an alcoholic drug user who refuses to see a doctor or take medication and I just want to focus on what is familiar and has worked for me. 

I did find that whatever skills are especially of use to me, I MUST continue practicing them even when everything is going well. So when life's bumps happen, I don't get knocked down and stay down for long.

4994,"Any ""mental illness"" is on a spectrum. Most are just versions of normal human behaviors or reactions that have become extreme enough to impact quality of life. Personally, I have a lot of BPD tendencies in my head, but am healthy enough to edit myself, so no one would diagnose my current \*behavior\* as BPD even though my thoughts definitely are (and my behaviors have been in the past.) That seems to be fairly common. 

It could also be that your support network has a very negative view of BPD and doesn't want to saddle you with a diagnosis that they see as ""crazy bitch disease"". Which becomes a cycle with BPD--mental health professionals are biased against, don't give that diagnosis to more stable or likable people, only unstable unlikable people in that community are diagnosed, mental health professionals become biased against it. I've had therapists tell me (back in my bad days, where I would be cutting myself in front of my friends etcetera) ""Don't be hard on yourself, you're not that bad"" when I suggested I could have BPD. Like. I'm not being self deprecating, I'm just suggesting a diagnosis that gives a lot of clarity to my behavior... This isn't as much of a problem now as a few years ago, but it used to be very common for therapists not to take people with BPD because of the bad reputation, Given how similar CPTSD and BPD, it seems like some therapists use the different diagnoses to mean ""I like you and think you're trauma is valid"" or ""I think you're just crazy.""",sneakish-snek,dzzndz

For the last 10 years of my life, anyone who I have seen or spoken to about my mental health just sees the quiet, restless girl who has been through trauma and they immediately say ‚Äòdepression and anxiety‚Äô but there is so much more going on under the surface but bc of the way the system works i kept falling through the cracks and bouncing from therapist to therapist and I‚Äôve only just in the last 6 months landed somewhere that is actually going to be longer term and I‚Äôm getting comfortable with the people I‚Äôm seeing but I just have a fear of bringing it up bc I‚Äôm always being told that I don‚Äôt have it, I‚Äôm just reading too much into things. I‚Äôve always felt like there is more than just depression and anxiety going on but I just haven‚Äôt gotten anyone to listen to that fear yet.

5000,"One tool I found really handy was keeping a journal of my symptoms. 

One of the biggest problems with BPD (and also any mental illness) is that in the moment you know exactly how you‚Äôre feeling, even if the emotion is ‚Äúconfused about my feelings‚Äù, you know what‚Äôs happening (unless you‚Äôre dissociating), you see the behaviors and the triggers and lo of that, but brains are great at self defense, and your brain is absolutely happy to pull the cozy wool of compartmentalization over those events which helps them not hurt as bad but has a nasty side effect of making the events really hard to look back on.

Keeping a journal of those events and documenting them when they‚Äôre still fresh gives you not only a clear in the moment view of them, it makes sure you don‚Äôt forget the ‚Äúmoment I thought I was worthless because I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to eat cereal‚Äù because later that day you threatened to break your husbands headphones. Both of those are symptoms, both need to be brought up, but if you‚Äôre doing therapy once a week, you‚Äôre not going to remember SpoonGate 2019.

The pwBPD will ensure that the pwNPD is removed from leadership and a new person can become leader and the pwBPD's favorite person.  Repeating the cycle and ensuring the continuation of a structured tribe.",HH_burner1,177rjh8

 >Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy developed by Francine Shapiro in the 1980s. In EMDR, the person being treated recalls distressing experiences whilst doing bilateral stimulation, such as side-to-side eye movement or tapping either side of the body. The 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) practice guideline states that EMDR ""is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are the result of unprocessed memories.

5644,"For everyone saying ""what's the difference?""

The concept of an ""empath"" is that you are magically able to feel others emotions with no clear explanation as to why you can. It's New Age mysticism psuedoscience, and is dangerous because it pushes the idea that your ""ability"" is a ""magic gift"" -- and it doesn't take long going down the occult hole to run into eugenic ideology. It also doesn't encourage people to seek help in balancing this emotional response, which can be psychologically detrimental and lead to people with this ""magic ability"" to abusive situations due to being ""so empathetic"" that they ""can still see the good in them [the abuser]"".

The actual explanation behind the ""empath ability"" is, as stated, trauma from an unstable household (and / or childhood). The brain develops its thin-slicing abilities early in life, becomes vigilant in doing it constantly around others, and makes instinctual responses as a result, based on what kept you safe in childhood. Everyone has the ability to thin-slice -- some are just unconsciously hypervigilant in the method.",KlausJaphet,pm64uf

5672,"From Wikipedia:

>Thin-slicing is a term used in psychology and philosophy to describe the ability to find patterns in events based only on ""thin slices"", or narrow windows, of experience. The term refers to the process of making very quick inferences about the state, characteristics or details of an individual or situation with minimal amounts of information. Research has found that brief judgments based on thin-slicing are similar to those judgments based on much more information. Judgments based on thin-slicing can be as accurate, or even more so, than judgments based on much more information.

In layman's terms, thin-slicing is the brain's ability to predict likely outcomes of a situation based on past experience; it's an unconscious and quick process. For example: Person A grew up in a household where their parents were quick to anger. Their brain memorized the subtle cues that would happen before an anger outburst, such as body language, trigger words/phrases/behaviors, tone of voice, etc. Now, as an adult, people notice that Person A seems to have an innate ability to know when someone is on the verge of having an angry outburst. If Person A is not aware of their trauma, they may not understand why they seem to have this ability.

Everyone thin-slices; it's key in social behavioral development and survival. But those of us with traumatic childhoods, like the majority of PWBPD, may not thin-slice correctly (resulting in hypervigilance due to perceiving threats that aren't actually there) or unconsciously overdo it, resulting in us appearing to have a superhuman ability to ""feel"" other people's emotions. In reality, it's a survival technique we learned through trauma to keep us safe (mirroring or submitting to intense emotions from abusers keeps us aligned with their perception of the world), and can be detrimental to our health when we start prioritizing other people's emotions over our own.",KlausJaphet,pm64uf

Milk products will trigger the symptoms! It would be unfair to be mad at the person who is lactose intolerance for getting triggered. 

This whole 'I can change him/her' attitude makes the person overlook the fact that they are actually sick. 

Before you say therapy and medication is the holy grail to recover, let me tell you that Medication would definitely treat severe recurring symptoms.

She feels comfortable enough to let her guard down and next thing you know we're up until 2am both in tears and arguing and the next day I know I had an overreaction, she's still hurting and I'm over it.

So we can't just say it's because they don't accept that we are sick, some people in our lives know we are and care the most about us and parts of our disorder are difficult and hurt them.

That is the biggest trigger, (invalidation) and this marks the second time she did that to me, and it's on me for not saying it the first time it happened because I was still dealing with abandonment issues then. But, it's a double edged sword for me here. I know that she's dealing with a lot, and it was something I helped her with, because it happened to me.

And there's so much more that happened in this conversation where she threw my BPD in my face several times, and like. We promised to (I know this will be cheesy and over done, but it was 20 years ago, backed by good reasons.) not be like other girls. To keep each other in check, and point out if the other was acting sideways. For 20 years. Then she notices a pattern, doesn't tell me, and calls it quits. I know she's dealing with a lot and is in a lot of pain, and I see this situation for what it is. But...I just don't understand why she didn't tell me. First time (to my knowledge) in 20 years and she just....stopped? I don't understand, and she was like, half my soul. No one knew me like she did. Not even my husband. And vice versa. I know her like the back of my hand. Well, I guess I thought I did. I can't fix what I don't know is broken...so why didn't she just say ""hey I noticed this pattern, and it's happening like this and it's not cool""? I would have discussed it to make sure I had the full picture, and worked on it. And even now I'm scared she'll see this. She isn't the ""fixer"" type, but we did promise to see all sides of any situation and hold each other accountable. What did I do to lose half my life to just have my BPD thrown in my face and crossing the boundaries she did?

I'm terrified I'm doing this to other people but idk what it is so idk what to look for so now I'm terrified to talk to anyone...) don't get more angry when someone says ""hey that hurt, and it wasn't cool"".

5928,"Elder borderline here, been in therapy for years. I found a lot of success using a [feelings wheel](https://feelingswheel.com/feelings-wheel.jpg) to help identify my emotions alongside therapy and my own trauma work. A lot of people think experiencing emotions is the thoughts we think when feeling a specific way. That's not actually feeling your feelings, that's thinking your feelings. Feeling your feelings simply involves taking note of the physical sensations occuring in your body and allowing them to pass. I know we all hate it when neurotypicals suggest going out in nature or yoga to ""fix"" your problems, but those activities do serve a small but very critical purpose in healing. A lot of us have been through trauma, we are out of touch with our emotions because we our out of touch with the physical sensations emotions cause, or in the case of many borderlines, the physical sensations are overwhelming and intolerable. This can cause us to mentally check out a bit. Trying to practice mindful activities gets us in touch with our bodies and check in with ourselves, just for a small portion of the day. I think it would be too overwhelming to try and process it all at once. That's why yoga can help, or going out in nature and being able to smell the fresh air and feel a breeze on your body helps. Once you are more in tune with your body, you can begin identifying the physical sensations you feel during specific emotions and go from there. If you are open it it, I recommend trying trauma informed or trauma focused yoga. In traumatic situations, our agency is often removed. Trauma informed yoga is centred around respecting the individual's ability to choose what they feel comfortable doing, and how they feel like doing it. This can help start you off on your journey to check in with your body in an empathetic way.",Stockholmsyndra,r8mfqk

If I may make a recommendation, psychologists tend to be better than counselors and social workers in my experience, particularly psychologists who specialize in DBT or Schema therapy. 

I hope you find someone better. This isn't happening because you are bad, it's happening because yours  therapist is failing. If she can't handle the intensity involved in working with someone who has BPD, she should have known that about herself and referred you to someone who can.

If you're looking for anything in addition to your memes and genshin, I recommend The Psychology in Seattle YouTube channel. It's run by a therapist who specializes in trauma and BPD.

I totally agree that although the video experience is not ideal, it is ***Certainly*** much better than nothing!

Yes I understand there is a certain Subreddit that is unfairly dedicated to person's SOUR experiences with people suffering from BPD... Because of that shitty sub, and seeing the effects that I've had on several people in MY OWN life, I've decided to actually take my mental-health seriously- in terms of addressing my shortcomings, getting proper therapy, taking the correct medication, in hopes that I don't keep making the same mistakes. That I dont keep harming people with my Brashness, my unnecessary anger, and my immediate and reactionary judgment.

My only advice. Pick a ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù that you trust. Similar to in AA for sobriety.

At the end of the day, diagnoses are an imperfect way to classify a cluster of symptoms that clinicians use to determine treatments/ bill insurance. Given the stigmatization of BPD, even among mental health providers, I think CPTSD can be useful as a diagnosis.

Just because the US hasn't figured it out doesn't mean that's the entire world of medicine views it similarly. Both are entries in the ICD-11. Stop projecting what your country does onto everyone else.

""Experts"" have also pointed out that there are key distinguishing features to the two. You know what? Since we're talking about it, I'm an expert too since I have been diagnosed with and live with both. And yeah, not the same disease.",escuchamenche,yuqiw7
6051,"I said I think cptsd is a useful diagnosis, and I said that experts disagree. By your logic, I am also an expert, since I live with both and have also done extensive research on the topic. This is my informed opinion. Your opinion is clearly different, and I respect that. This is not a black and white issue, and there is room for people to have different opinions.

My point is not that CPTSD shouldn't be a diagnosis but that diagnoses are not exact sciences. Diagnoses come from a small group of people who make a decision based on a cluster of symptoms, and they are by no means perfect. Homosexuality was widely considered a mental illness until recently, which was clearly harmful. The diagnosis of BPD came at a time when people had very little understanding of the disorder, and there is also a ton of problematic history in the way the disorder has been understood, diagnosed, and treated. It is not until relatively recently that we have began to understand the role that trauma plays in BPD. Many people think BPD should not even be a diagnosis anymore because of this history and the stigma it still holds. Moreover, the same person can see 5 different practitioners and get 5 distinct diagnoses, so there is clearly human error built into the process. 

If it is useful for you to think of the two as distinct disorders for your own recovery, then you should do that. I find it helpful to think of them as being the same and have had the most success in integrating therapies that are both trauma informed and skills based. Both opinions are valid.",mississippimurder,yuqiw7

The ‚Äûdunking your head in ice water‚Äú is supposed to snap you out of the state you‚Äòre in - even if it‚Äôs just for a split second.
Dbt relies heavily on the person‚Äòs will to get better and force themselves to try the stuff they suggest. Otherwise it won‚Äôt work.

I‚Äôve always always always hated meditation more than anything - it made me more panicky and aggressive literally no matter the circumstance (no matter whether I‚Äòm chill or actually going through an episode).

The ice bucket water for example has never really helped me but I instead have an assortment other skills I use to calm myself down. If you want to know more about it please lmk because it has helped me so much!!

My order usually is:

(Start: something triggers me, yesterday it was two coworkers getting along better and not really talking to me/ including me into the convo - I felt weird, stupid and very hurt. But I‚Äôm not close enough to actually ask if I‚Äôve done something wrong)

1. distancing myself from the situation (physically leaving asap) to a quiet place

2. using an ammonia stick - it burns the hell out of your nose and makes you snap out for just a second, others use some other strong sensation (eating hot chili, smelling strong mint, listening to loud music etc.)

3. from there on you‚Äòve gained a little bit of distance from your emotions, this is where you will have to calm yourself via I.e. emotion-surfing (it sounds like a dumb technique but after trying it it actually works)

4. force!! Yourself to do a breathing exercise or another mindfulness exercise. I fucking hated these at first because it made my symptoms worse for a little but after forcing myself to do it for idk 10mins? It surprisingly worked.

5. now you can think about the situation rationally and emotionally to find the solution to your trigger/ just calm yourself down.


Again, my therapist has even talked to me how she believed it was all bullshit at first but that after trying it herself - it surprisingly worked for her too, that‚Äòs why she has started offering DBT therapy. 
I hated it too but it‚Äôs been ridiculously helpful for me after a while. Please just force yourself to really try it.",,16dl5z9

A lot of the symptoms I feel can also be explained a lot by autism, for example having to mask because you have no idea what's wrong with you, you just feel different and a lot of other people point that out etc leading to masking. Take the identities troubles of BPD for example and the masking of autism, having to mask so much that you lose your sense of identity.

If I was to sum it up, I'm Jekyll and my conditions are Hyde, any minor inconvenience and out pops Mr Hyde and off I go on my dissociative adventures even if logically I know, where it leads, how to prevent it, when I'm triggered it just is. With ADHD, essentially having the left and right brain severed and the neurological wiring on top of the autism makes things next to impossible. it's odd and I imagine it feels similar to a lot of people.

Thinking that I have to live in emotional pain for decades whether I like it or not just makes me feel worse. It's definitely not logical reasoning though, I know.

1 that my insurance stopped covering, I liked her, learned a lot. 1 that randomly quit the practice entirely. 1 that started the story of watching her daughter die in front of her any time I brought up how soemthing was stressful. Her favorite line was ""if I can get over my daughter's death, you can get over this."" She was... very much not over it. 1 that last one session. She said I was choosing to be depressed and can stop being sad if I just don't focus on it. The 1 from another comment that wenr out of her way to lie in my file and the 1 that was convinced I should be in love with him cause I'm borderline and ""every borderline ends up falling for her therapist."" 1 that was good but unreliable and it left me feeling lost. And 1 that was convinced my problems could be solved with joining the local gun owner club he ran at the convention center. 

It's kinda shit how incompatible therapists or even just bad situations outside of therapy can impact our ability to get help. Losing a job is something that really would be easier with a therapist to talk to through it. But it's the loss and the stressful event itself that block any help. I always described that feeling as my brick walls in therapy. Shit you just can't help, even though you try. Sorry things have been set against you in ways.

I was so excited that I'm finally getting help and the first thing she does (without a proper introduction / getting to know eachother) was to ask me about my problems and why am I there. Ofc, I split and barely got myself to tell her that I got BPD... The first thing she did was to trig me with really awful words and gestures. 

I'm definitely not staying, just because it's for free. I'd rather change her asap or even wait till I can get one myself but... I won't lose hope because I know that there is one out there for each of us.

when i needed a hug from my parents as a kid and didn‚Äôt know how to ask for it, i‚Äôd cry. i‚Äôd communicate my sadness so they‚Äôd know to support me, because as humans, we respond with empathy to sadness. it‚Äôs in our biology

i used to think getting my needs met was being ‚Äúmanipulative‚Äù until my therapist pointed out that

1. manipulation is learned from an early age. when we don‚Äôt have the skills or confidence to explicitly say ‚Äúi need a hug‚Äù our instinct is to communicate it in whatever way we can. just like a baby who cries when they need something even if they aren‚Äôt actually sad

2. it is inevitable we will need validation, empathy or physical touch to help cope with distressing situations and tell ourselves that we make sense. that‚Äôs a human need

3. imposter syndrome can tell us we‚Äôre over exaggerating our mental illness when we tell others about it. this is often because of the ingrained believe that we don‚Äôt deserve support or that those who seek support just want attention. the fact is, if we want attention, we want it for a reason. it doesn‚Äôt make us bad or needy people and pretending we don‚Äôt have those needs just triggers shame

4. if we cross someone‚Äôs boundaries it is on THEM to assert their limits. it is not your responsibility to manage someone else‚Äôs mental health. that being said, prepping a person for a serious conversation, and allowing them to consent to talking about mental health is very important and the bare minimum respectful thing to do",freshlyintellectual,v63eu3

7715,"Hello, I've been in therapy for almost 3 years now. I don't think your therapist was giving up on you. I've often found that my attachment issues make me glorify other people and put them on a pedestal as if they are the best thing that has ever happened to me- and I do this because as a child I never got the attention or care I needed from my neglectful and abusive mother. I had to learn the hard way, that you really do have to take care of yourself and put yourself as number one- your thoughts and feelings matter the most to you, everyone else is an afterthought. And it's okay to think and feel this way, it's not selfish or wrong, it's necessary so that you can make yourself feel seen and validated. I think we say, ""other people will leave us"" out of habit, we don't really expect people to leave us; but the hard truth is that people ain't bout shit. Even my closest friends couldn't help me deal with my deep rooted issues the way that I have learned to take care of myself. And I needed a lot of time to learn that. So don't be so hard on yourself for feeling the way that you do, you're valid. This stuff is difficult, and there is no straight road to success. 

 I'm sorry you didn't feel accomidated with your therapist. I've found that it takes a long time to build a trusting relationship, but also that you really need the right kind of therapist and methodology that fits you. Instead of trauma therapy where you're exposed to triggering environments until you adapt; Im doing inner child therapy where you learn to speak softly to yourself and love and accept yourself no matter what you do, and it's amazing. I recommend it to everyone. 

Also, if you live in the States and want to continue therapy, check into your state's Medicaid insurance program. I get my therapy covered through my state, and it's also gotten me a primary care doctor and a med manager for my depression and anxiety. The only thing that wasn't covered was dental. It's real nifty though. 

Wishing you better health. You deserve the best üíï",Cynnarose,sjuylo
7716,"When you have a chronic issue of overly relying on others and putting them on a pedestal, but then always being let down by them and having them leave your life--being able to stop doing that by changing your expectations and behaviors *is* a good coping mechanism. That's the true way to make that situation stop. Our own expectations and behaviors are really the only things we can have control of, and you made a statement saying you wanted to do that. We will never be able to control the behaviors and responses of others. It sounds like maybe you were trying to get her to have a specific reply and then are let down because she actually agreed with you instead of reassuring you not to. I doubt she wants you to cut off everyone you've ever known and never speak to anyone ever again or meet anyone new ever again! It's moreso that you did bring up something that is healthy to move towards, but it's not about flying to the black and white extreme of the spectrum either.",andromedarose,sjuylo
7717,I love infantilising my disorder. Saw a meme once where they called their intrusive thought ‚Äúedgelord‚Äù. Made my day.,remmytherat,c2baxh
7718,"I kind of understand why they said that. Even today, after a 6 months specific group therapy, I don't want my relatives to Google it. I find BPD is not described well in the internet, because it's not been studied for verry long, and research is developing fast, so there are A LOT of information, but none I find verry helpful in understanding the illness or know what to do with people who have it.
It's a start, but remember that not all symptoms apply to you, and at the same time, it's not because you don't fully see yourself in examples of persons with BPD that you don't have it.

I think BPD is makes it harder to see some truths, because you may have BPD patterns, and the examples given to illustrate them are of people you don't want to have anything to do with, or be associated with, but still you have the same patterns, just not the same specific details of the behavior.
For example I don't make a scene with boyfriends, I don't scream and I'm not violent. But with time I found out that the same reason that made some patients with BPD go this far made me go far in other ways.

So don't trust everything you find on the internet, trust in your therapist. Be kind to yourself, and it's gonna be alright! And if you have more questions you can always ask them here, in the comments or making a new post.

>Counselors, social workers, and marriage and family therapists shall terminate services only after giving careful consideration to factors affecting the relationship and making effort to minimize possible adverse effects.

I'm no lawyer but that language is pretty clear cut.

It sucks but it doesn't make the existence of a women's specific group/clinic/therapist bad. Stop demanding women give up their spaces for men. This is why women's homeless shelters exist and are SEPARATE. Women's colleges exist. Etc. It's not a 'fuck you that's why'. A lot of times these kinds of programs are created because the person who created it had a specific goal (like help women, because I'm a woman, and I've been through bad shit), or because they got specific training.

I already have my undergraduate degree in psychology and am starting a new one in Fall. My goal is to work with youth and adolescence with trauma. If I make a fucking youth center to work with teens, that's my prerogative/my dream/my goal, and no I'm not some meanie ageist because I don't want to treat little kids or adults. If I want my practice and goal to be centered around youth trauma, that's my decision. There are plenty of other places out there. Not every single one can do every single thing. That's how you get quantity over quality.

&#x200B;

I'd much rather have my therapist be specialized in my specific needs and life experiences versus a therapist who just does everything under the sun. ""Jack of All Trades, but Master of None."" That's how you get treatment that isn't good, because it's not tailored to you and your needs. The person didn't master certain training, and instead is just generalized...

The fact anyone was simply turned away instead of being comprehensively helped is what's messed up about this. This makes BPD seem like a ""women's illness"" and therefore treated differently by both professionals *and* people who don't understand the science. Why didn't the institution have a place for men who also have BPD? That's a failure on the part of the institution.

I work at a domestic violence center.

Yes, especially in this situation, it's incredibly important to be comprehensive of the gender of the client in question.

The fact more women get diagnosed than men is the same kind of gender bias that leads men to be more often diagnosed with ADHD. That in and of itself is a professional gender bias on its own. And *exactly* what I'm talking about. That feeds into the stigma that men don't have BPD as often, have it less severely, or need just as much help as us women who have it.

I don't think the problem is having things that are only for certain demographics -- The problem is when it's only catered to just one demographic (re: segregation in America -- places for black people were always rundown, poorly serviced, hazardous, and places for white people were rich, pristine, clean, etc. That's where the issue lies in segregated spaces, when they aren't equal/equitable in quality. That's why HBCU's can exist. Because white people already have tons of college options.)

I think it also would help if their were groups centric on queer, nonbinary, trans, and other groups, too. I know some exist, I've heard of them and I'm sure there are some in my area -- But it gets a little more difficult with how (in America) the political environment has been with a rise of bigotry. Even in the case of men's spaces in say mental health, it can be difficult to get off the ground or staff it, due to things like toxic masculinity and lack of awareness for men's issues, that can leave many men afraid or in denial of asking for support or talking about emotions and feelings.

&#x200B;

I remember doing a project a year ago for a lifespan development class where I focused my topic on men's mental health, because one of the lessons that stood out to me was one that taught us men can ALSO have postpartum (it is called paternal postnatal depression) and many suffer greatly on their own because a lack of awareness about the condition and lack of resources for it. 

&#x200B;

This is why I think we need MORE demographic-specific spaces (in all things -- hospitals, colleges, mental health groups, websites, etc.); Not less. And men's mental health spaces are definitely lacking, and ones for groups like GNC people, trans people, queer people are targets for bigotry, then you also factor in the lack of access to a lot of services and facilities in most nations of the world (and again in America as I know being American) due to finances, disabilities, location, transportation, and so much more.

Babe watch out, you're so full of shit it's falling out your mouth.

This subreddit has no idea how professional gender bias works. That kinda sucks, especially with an illness that is so entirely wrought with it. 

Women do not have the illness more often- women are more likely to be seen, diagnosed, and treated for it.

Most BPD clinics are co-op. it‚Äôs unfortunate that it seems the ones in OP‚Äôs area don‚Äôt take his insurance. But that‚Äôs not the fault of this single clinic that has a specific focus. There should be an overall expansion of therapy for BPD patients, not a shutdown of specific safe spaces. 

The fact that there might be less male only spaces rests on that fact that BPD diagnosis is highly sexist towards women. Epidemiological rates are about equal in the population but women are diagnosed 4-5x as much as men are. If psychology assumes there are more women with the disease, they are going to focus their efforts on that group.

I have BPD and CPTSD and am queer, why would I go up to a therapy group for people with OCD and CPTSD and are heterosexual/cisgendered and complain I don't fit the criteria of the therapy.

&#x200B;

It's not like the therapist can just randomly create a brand new group on the spot for OP. Those things take funding, time, scheduling, permissions from the government and people who run the clinic, staffing, training, licensing, and more. 

&#x200B;

This is why I've said multiple times we shouldn't be mad demographic-centered things exist -- We should simply make and advocate for more things that cater to groups who have gone without. AKA men who have a lack of male-centric mental health groups, centers, and clinics. The solution isn't 'get rid of women's only therapy groups', it's 'we need to make more men's only therapy groups'.",Katviar,11yjhrl
8010,"I do agree with that actually, women exclusive spaces are important. I guess I'm a bit sad for OP, I just wish for specific things like that (that involve BPD/certain other conditions that already have trouble receiving therapy) they offered some alternatives, maybe an alternative space in a different smaller building for people who are ok with a mixed space. When I went to the clinic, they booked spaces long-term for DBT therapy (it was for dealing with the sensory issues, but it could be used the same way).",CactusEar,11yjhrl
8011,Apples and oranges there's a difference between AA refusing someone who's not an alcoholic and a bpd therapy group refusing someone with bpd just because of their gender,Hayley-Is-A-Big-Gay,11yjhrl
8012,But the therapy group is for BPD sufferers. OP does fit the criteria. It's more like trying to join a post partum group and them saying no you can't join you're ginger. BPD doesn't affect women differently. They'd all be discussing the same issues. Would you like being told you can't join a CPTSD group because you're queer? I don't understand the point you're making here. OP does fit the criteria.,KrazyKatz3,11yjhrl

If there was a therapy group for pwBPD who was centered on pwBPD that are specifically victims of heterosexual domestic abuse, and have no training working with a queer person who has only faced homosexual domestic abuse  -- Are you really gonna be mad that the group isn't for you??????

&#x200B;

I'm a queer jewish demiwoman with BPD, I'm not gonna go rocking up to a christian support group for pwBPD and get mad they can't accommodate me. That makes no sense. I would look for a group that is for all pwBPD or better yet a group that is catered to JEWISH pwBPD, bonus points if they're queer and women-only!!!

&#x200B;

Now that the fun part is over, here's something that stuck with me that this meme reminded me of: ERJs

**E**^(xplanation)

**R**^(ationalization)

**J**^(ustification)

&#x200B;

Apparently I was a pro at these, and they usually aren't good. Basically, we use ERJs to let ourselves continue toxic behaviors. See, when we have a negative and anxious thought that we dwell on, especially when we're hyper-aware (as BPD people are), we will explain to ourselves how our situation is making us feel and how that connects to how we react to it (often via by splitting), and then we'll rationalize to ourselves that it's okay what we did and why it was better than a healthier route (one which likely crossed our mind in the explanation), and then we'll justify all of these thoughts, emotions, and actions through our anxieties that we take as God's Word proof. So essentially we use them to make carrying on with our bullshit the logical answer, even though the ""proof"" is just our mental illness taking over.  


But you can turn these into a positive thing if you use that hyper-awareness to try and use actual proof, not just anxieties. A good example is instead of saying your friend hates you because they've been snippy all day, try thinking about how much you've been through, how much they've loved you, and all of the personal issues they're going through, and use those in an ERJ type way to remind yourself that you are loved. Your mind already takes the path, may as well just retrain that path instead of trying to dig out a new one.",prettykittythekitten,gv7to2

8334,"as someone else mentioned dbt is meant to work with high risk patients, and there are other therapies that are effective for some people in lessening suicidal thoughts. but there are big limitations to that. a big reason is liability. if a therapist isn‚Äôt equipped to take on a patient that is at risk of killing themselves, they are operating outside their scope of practice and might even make their patient worse. 

for my (dbt) therapist, if im having suicidal thoughts it‚Äôs TOP priority. we cannot continue onto other problems or topics until we address it. same for other things like self-harm (at my request) or if im upset with her. it really gets in the way of the therapy because my aliveness is pretty important criteria to being a patient.

if my suicidality is so pervasive that we cannot talk about anything else and the skills are not actually addressing it, then the therapy isn‚Äôt effective anymore, and i might need to consider meds or inpatient treatment in order to continue. this is especially the case if there is an underlying condition other than bpd like bipolar disorder that has to be treated with meds first

if im actively suicidal (plan in place), my therapist is legally unable to help me because her scope of practice is limited so emergency services would be called and i‚Äôd be brought to an emergency room. 

it‚Äôs silly that it‚Äôs difficult to find a therapist to address this. a lot of people are suicidal right? but the unfortunate reality is that even the people with more treatable symptoms are not given adequate services. suicidality is seen as a ‚Äúspecialty‚Äù problem among therapists and it‚Äôs helpful to get a therapist who specializes in your problem. 

the same goes for trauma too. a lot of people need therapy because of their trauma and then go see a talk therapist who doesn‚Äôt understand how to operate with a trauma-informed practice. or a narcissist goes to a therapist that doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with manipulative behaviour and then just validates the narcissists behaviour instead of helping them get better. or a person with ocd goes to a cbt therapist who tells them how to ‚Äúthink‚Äù and then their thoughts get worse (i‚Äôve witnessed this in dbt and it‚Äôs very sad)

what you experienced was a bad match. you were with a therapist who isn‚Äôt right for you. it‚Äôs like getting sent to a chiropractor when you need a surgeon. the service you got was not meant for you. and to be transparent with you, most therapists will not be. but that does not mean you are untreatable, and it doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt deserve better support than you are getting. i hope you hold on to find that. 

i‚Äôd really encourage you to look into virtual dbt therapy and see if you can find therapists who are going to understand and care for you in the exact ways you need. you deserve it friend",freshlyintellectual,12rui0k

I was in therapy while being suicidal. Eventually i ended up in the grippy socks hotel. But this wasn't the fault of my therapist. Im fact therapy is exactly there to give you coping skills outside of suicide or self harm. So saying therapy doesn't work while being suicidal is complete bullshit. 

There is also the possibility to get medication to cope till therapy can work. For example i was prescribed Lorazepam. Till we could figure out long term medication.

I would say that most abusers probably have a justification to themselves mentally that allows them to continue behaving abusively. BPD can be a root cause. Abuse can be a behavior that is a result of the experience of a mental illness such as BPD.



You have a responsibility to stop abusing other people. Even if you don't mean to do it, don't enjoy it, don't feel good about it, don't notice it until later, want to avoid thinking about it, justify it by your own emotions etc, etc, etc. Seriously.



Your mental illness doesn't give you a right to abuse other people or to justify that you are doing so.


I have had to face that head on myself and it's taken years to understand and unlearn the unconscious manipulation and toxicity that was built into the way I view and experience relationships. It was painful. I didn't want to admit I was doing it. I didn't want to accept responsibility for hurting people I loved so deeply. But I had to.

What really made the difference for me was when I started [online therapy](http://depressionarchive.com/BPD/) for my BPD.

8487,"Does it have to be conscious to be manipulative? I would say no, strongly. You can manipulate someone into doing things for you, responding to you, etc even if you're not aware of that. You can develop a skillful pattern of behavior which affects the behavior of another person, even if BPD affects your ability to clearly see or understand that in the moment. If someone feels you are manipulating them and expressing that, I'd say there's usually a lot of truth in that.",andromedarose,ep3vtj
8488,"To me it has to be consciously done to count as manipulation. Simply by definition. To me manipulating someone is acting or saying something disingenuously to get what you want from them.

You feel deceived because of what they've done looks like it could have been deceptive, but if the other person wasn't actually trying to do that (and only that person can know, I'm aware of that) it's not manipulation",Quinlov,ep3vtj
8491,"But do you see how that could just be used as an excuse to avoid accountability? Anyone can say they didn‚Äôt mean to manipulate someone. But at the end of the day if someone we care about feels manipulated, we should reflect on why and try to actively fix that. I think trying to fix the problem is what separates someone from just being a manipulative person and truly being apologetic. But you‚Äôd have to be sure you weren‚Äôt with someone who gaslights you.",mynameisnotjamie,ep3vtj
8492,"Obviously you have to be sensitive to who you're talking to. If you're talking to someone who feels manipulated, you're probably better off trusting their judgment that that is what's happening, especially if they know that person well. Likewise if you are talking to someone who is being accused of being manipulative and is genuinely trying to explain what was actually going on in their head, it doesn't make sense to join in the accusations.",Quinlov,ep3vtj

8513,"Be truthful with your T. It'll start off slow and you'll probably do a lot of risk management and distress tolerance skills. Trust the process. Marcia Linehan was BPD and she worked with some of the most suicidal/at risk people while developing this. It won't go away straight away, but baby steps. Everything we've been taught not to say, do, feel attached etc is wrong. Your relationship with your 1:1 is going to be the most important. Transparency and congruence is important. They should create a safe space where your feel safe to disclose or just feel (cry etc) The emotions are strong, and so can be the maladaptive behaviours, but they don't last forever.

If they actually had to live with the guilt and shame that comes with acting on those impulses, then they wouldn't think it was so fucking cute, or quirky. If they actually even had those impulses, they wouldn't think it was fucking cute. 

The obsession that comes with fp literally drives me crazy. And that's the fucking point of it all. We're not fucking normal. That shit isn't normal. And you know that. But you can barely fucking fight it. And there's always a breaking point. 

No, I don't want to live in someone's fucking skin. I want someone to love me the way I love them. And they don't. They can't. And that leads to pain, rage, substance abuse, violence(for me), and self harm. It's not fun. I wish I wasn't like this.

We have the ability to temporarily utilize the benefits of what true psychopaths always have to as a result of their genuine lack of what Id consider an entire branch of intelligence without completely lacking that ourselves. Too many of us use it too much or with little understanding of what is actually happening and end up in situations where it‚Äôs easier to stay in that state of mind than it is to come to terms with what‚Äôs happened while we‚Äôve been numb because we‚Äôve had to do this too many times before just to survive‚Ä¶ It may be the tougher choice but we get to choose empathy where some can never get that back or never had it in the first place. It‚Äôs not even very difficult in our society to be tempted to be proud of a lack of empathy especially while still suffering from it but it should really be treated  like a dangerous weapon. It can make you feel safer to use it but you really need to understand and respect the danger it poses to you and anyone around you. Ive seen too many get caught in a feedback loop of guilt from actions taken while numb leading to more time numb to others and obviously resulting in doing more harm and so on. I know it‚Äôs not something we all have to worry about thankfully and I‚Äôm sure most of you reading this don‚Äôt even really need to be but some of you ought to know these things.

While your projects are initially ingenious, chaos tends to ensue when you are left to your own devices, without the guidance of others. Excitable and zealous, you are restlessly active, rash, and easily worked up.

maybe you can think of it this way: you're not actually spending your parents' money, and they're not spending it on you. it's not really ""spending"" money, at all. instead, it's more like an ""investment"" - you invest money in yourself and become better. 

whenever I want to spend money to buy something that would benefit my health, I often just don't because I'm broke as fuck and my stupid brain thinks I've been in pain for so long, I can be in pain for longer if it means I have money to spend on weed. so at some point I started thinking of it like an investment, anything that's beneficial to my health is an investment in myself now.

9236,"The most over looked aspect of going thru this shit is, when you get out. 

You could spend 6 months in that place, and probably feel great and ready to start over...

But, as soon a you get back into the real world, if you haven't fixed your coping mechanisms yet(which is impossible in those places) you're gonna end up right back there. 

I'm not sure what they're called, but like halfway houses, or temp supervised housing, would do wonders for people. Jus give them a way to get back out there after the ""reset"", and not lose everything they just went thru, the 1st time they spill their coffee. 

I've realized it's not so much the shit that happens that fucks you up, it's your reaction to it. And if you've spent 25-40+ years developing those reactions, you're not gonna undo it in a few months. It's gonna take years to readjust. 

The mental health issue in America is so fucking easily fixable. It just takes fucking money, and people that actually care. 

If we taxed Bozo and Musky the way we tax low income and poor people, we could literally fix our mental health issue. Ya we still would have outliers, but at least 75-80% of the issues we have right now, would be fixed, like forever. 

It's honestly not that fucking hard. If you just talk to people suffering from serious depression, or mental health issues, you'd notice most of them have the same fucking issue, and you can use the same remedy on them. 

The single biggest issue right now, I believe, is loneliness. I don't think people really understand or are used to that feeling, so when they're going thru it, they jus think it's depression, or burn out, or something else. They think they're talking to people online, at work and shit, but they're jus going thru the motions.

A friend once blew my mind with that shit. She was complaining how lonely she felt. And I responded immediately with ""you're never alone. There's always like 4 girls with you, and at least 2 guys trying to hit on you, every where you go. I've literally never seen you by yourself.""

That's where she hit me with ""I'm never alone, but I feel lonely all the time"", and it reminded me of the line from Glycerine by Bush, so it's always stuck with me. 

I realized then there's a difference between being alone, and feeling alone. I think millions of Americans are feeling that right now and honestly just don't realize it.

If you're not used to being alone with your own thoughts, when you're forced to experience that, and you're not ready, shit can get fucked up pretty quick. 

You end up in places like this, feeling like OP does, and then get discharged,  not when you're ready, but when the time is up. And then you go back out there, feel like that again, and end up right back where you started. 

It's a broken system, and it won't change until it's overhauled.",Deion313,13ord98

There's a big difference between being alone, and being lonely. Like I said about my friend she ALWAYS had people around, but she was lonely. 

There's a kind of connection, or type of feeling we need some times, that makes us feel seen, heard, felt, noticed, whatever, but it's a specific feeling you're looking for, and if you don't get it, it doesn't matter how many people you're around or talking to, you're alone.

Nothing wrong with that. If I can be honest, most people, not all, but most people who NEED others around are that way because they're afraid, or don't like, being left totally alone with their demons. Like if you're left alone with your own thoughts, let's jus say, it can have disastrous consequences...

If you can find a way to be ok, or get along with those demons, it'll make ""alone time"" a positive thing. This way you get that balance.

I'm jus some fucking moron on reddit, but if you're ever feeling lonely, or need to chat, you can always send me a chat thing. I'm sick and I'm in immunotherapy, so I can't really do anything, or go anywhere, so I'll most likely respond in a timely manner. But I can be here for you, if you ever feel lonely. 

Again, I'd work on finding that balance. You can only gain, or benefit, from it... until then, you can bother me of you feel the need lmfao",Deion313,13ord98

Lots of my friendship were one sided and when I refused to put that extra effort I felt I was doing they all eventually faltered. So perhaps we engage in good relationships with people who are also not healthy.

(If you've had panic attacks, you know approaching someone is almost always a no. I have been diagnosed with critical anxiety disorder and critical social anxiety disorder among other diagnosies), they began walking home without me, and I totally understood. I guess on the walk home the girl got it in her head that I was trying to make it seem like her bf was trying to harm me (because I was not breathing and yelling no) I finally got back to their house and the first thing I said was ‚ÄúI'm not mad‚Äù (in my head I thought they might think I was upset at them for leaving me alone downtown in the dark) I then walked to the kitchen where they were and with no warning at all the girl started smashing my skull into her stone counters. (I pulled her hair to get her off me, she is much smaller than me and I did not want to risk hurting her to fight back) she that began screaming that I was trying to wreck her hair and she came at me again. I ran out to the porch, and her bf came with me. I was bawling, and he sat with me and talked. He was not mad that i yelled, and he understood it was not personal and not an attack on him trying to help me. I then needed my phone to order a ride home, and her bf opened the door to go get it. The girl had my phone in her hand and smashed it on the floor, then charged at me and started smashing my head on the exterior brick. Her bf got my phone and pushed her inside and closed the door. She continued to scream and try to open the door to get at me. Her bf kept me safe and kept her safe inside. I got an Uber home. I did not press charges and never spoke to her again. I understand she has BPD and cannot or does not want help and it is not always a conciojs thought process. I am completely an advocate for disorders and mental health, but to me, BPD is absolutely not an excuse to physically harm someone. Side note: I have a traumatic brain injury and dent in my skull. A single hit could kill me, and the side the dent was on is what she aimed for, which means there was some type of conscious thought process. I'm not sure raw dogging it is always the right choice.

11974,"amphetamine abuse is still dangerous, and no provider will probably be okay with your usage because it is dangerous. while the stigma for amphetamines is worse despite being comparable (long-term abuse resulting in death), sudden death with amphetamine abuse is much more common (heart attacks, blood pressure spikes). it is pretty important that you stop using if you are aware that you are abusing the medicine/drug. while it sucks to lose access to medicines that may be helpful to you (like other schedule one medicines), they are not worth their potential to abuse. there are other options for pain and anxiety management. part of recovering from addiction is coming to terms with a lack of control around hard substances, which is by no means easy or comfortable",Ovrzealous,vwwx1s
11975,"They'd treat you the same.
Depending upon how the substance is physically impacting upon your body and physiology, that's all they take into account really.

It's good that you've told them about the alcohol consumption.
I'd suggest that you tell them in manner that comes from pride and joy.
E. G. ""hey, guess what! I've been able to take back heavily on my other substance abuse issue."" 

They'll congratulate you on your success, you'll reduce your risk substantially of not getting of the drug course you want and, the medical team gets more information about you, that they need to help you out. 

Be open and honest, even if it's uncomfortable at times. 
Even if the administration of the substances is somewhat questionable. 
They'll understand why you do it and, contemplate a plan of action of how to improve moving forward",WolfKingofRuss,vwwx1s
11976,"I know what you mean, 

I just had surgery and because there's a history of drug abuse on my file I wasn't given any painkillers for recovery. Just discharged and told to rest for 8 weeks

11977,"I understand, but you also run the risk of dangerous interactions with your prescription meds and drugs. Please be very careful. There are also anonymous drug helplines that can give information about interactions without it going on your medical file.

11978,"Have seen people go through palliative care denied pain medications because of past abuse of unrelated class of drug. Would rather not be dying of cancer (Lord knows I'm high risk with my family history and smoking) without proper pain meds buddy 

""Power through the pain"" is alright for some minor procedures but I think if I have a surgery/extreme dental work a Vicodin would be well worth it.

11980,Jesus I'm so sorry. That must have been hell,Self_bias_res1stor,vwwx1s
11981," you are thinking pretty far ahead insofar as palliative care and potential future surgeries, surely you understand that continuing to abuse hard drugs like alcohol/amphetamines will rocket you to the hospital much faster right?

if you get to the point that many get to - dying of liver failure, or heart failure, due to drug use, it is quite literally one of the most painful and agonizing ways to go. 

Look. I understand that choosing to not tell your therapist about your drug habits is your way to prepare for disastrous negative outcomes in the future. I know that it seems like it‚Äôs not that big of a problem and that you can handle it without help or that they‚Äôll just overreact and take your access away without really understanding. I just hope you consider the other disastrous outcomes that can happen if you remain going on benders without getting help: in no uncertain terms, it will kill you, in a pretty agonizing and slow way.",Ovrzealous,vwwx1s
11982,"the first part of quitting is deciding to quit, yes",Ovrzealous,vwwx1s
11983,"I don't deny my use is bad for my health. I'm addicted to nicotine, told multiple doctors, yet they wouldn't deny my medications for me being addicted to nicotine far more than any other substance I use. I have an easier time putting any other drug down than nicotine. When I go on videogame benders playing 8+ hours a day, I don't have people telling me I'm strictly forbidden from games. I'm addicted to fatty foods and caffeine ,I don't have arbitrary food and caffeine restrictions placed upon me. Even my drinking is considered within normal bounds (1-2 a day ) but using that substance  doesn't get me barred from future meds

I'd love to be open about my usage if I could trust the medical system to act in good faith towards me just for revealing any illicit substance use",Self_bias_res1stor,vwwx1s
11984,"having an addiction makes addictive drugs really dangerous, to the point where you are better off without them. if it is true that you go on benders for games, caffeine, and fatty foods, then you may need someone to tell you that you are banned from them, to help you regulate your behavior: them telling you ‚Äúyou are banned‚Äù is not what makes the behavior harmful; what makes it harmful is that it negatively affects other areas of your life (your job, health, relationships, etc).

It‚Äôs not all stigma. Amphetamine addiction is treated harshly because of its potential to completely wreck your life if you remain addicted to it. An untreated amphetamine addiction will ruin your life more than losing access to opioids and benzodiazepines (or other schedule 1 drugs). It increases your mortality by 4x (similar to alcohol or heroin addiction) and can cause brain damage, heart attack, and stroke. 

So yes losing access to other drugs is a negative. But it is not worth keeping an addiction untreated. Because losing opioids like pain medicine or benzodiazepines like anxiety meds may be painful. But amphetamine addiction, alcoholism, and nicotine addiction WILL kill you. It‚Äôs not worth your life man",Ovrzealous,vwwx1s

I wish I could get that again and give it another try because the Wellbutrin and Cymbalta I take don't do anything except maybe cause me to lose even more of myself. I have no motivation to do anything at all. I feel like my heart is dead.",Isk4ral_Pust,cus5fh

See if u can find any evidence based research on it treating your condition/symptoms (make sure it's peer reviewed) if u really think it will help u and you are prepared to fight for it. However I know it comes with a heap of side effects and dangers also with its amphetamine properties. Was so hard getting them to prescribe me an MAOI and turned out it wasn't what I needed. Also I did get serotonin syndrome on it and nearly died, guess what I'm saying is usually when they are apprehensive to prescribe things they do have a reason. Risk/benefit thing.

Or some of the emotional problems I had was from being used to being dull made showing any emotion feel cringe. As cope, I got used to be totally shut down or disinterested. Even as I was starting to observe doing better, I was also becoming more aware of the problems and being no better off internally. However, I've realized decided it was time to go into the depths of what my thoughts are and connect with my emotions. I had to get some drug help (mushrooms) but the one deep trip I had got me thinking so much I unlocked all kinds of memories and wants I had forgotten about. I remembered what genuine emotions felt like from when I was really young and in that instant I learned how to better verbalize my boundaries.

She said two things, don‚Äôt punish yourself for your emotions, (I was in fact not eating due to feeling something and hadn‚Äôt noticed) & I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a handful of peanuts, if you feel intense and you haven‚Äôt eaten anything, you need to go eat first.

12919,"I thought I could give advice for what helped me the most. I‚Äôve been in therapy since I was 6 or 7 as well as having been on medication. 


1. Self advocate 

Remember that no one knows you and your symptoms better that yourself. Also remember that doctors are just people. They aren‚Äôt always right and have biases. Sometimes they‚Äôll shut you down or doubt you or just infantilise you. Stick to your guns and don‚Äôt let it get to you. Focus on fixing the problem and be open to other ideas that might work.


2. Medication

If you have BPD and a manic depressive cycle, or have strong emotional outbursts that cause you to be impulsive, LOOK INTO MOOD STABILISERS. That shit immediately changed the game for me. I‚Äôve made more progress in my relationships in this last year than in the other 18 years of my life because of my mood stabiliser.


3. Communication

This is another game changer. It can be really difficult to do so I‚Äôm going to explain main points that could help.

a. Identify when you‚Äôre starting to get upset and what your limit is. 

b. Practice disengaging. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with needing a couple of minutes to a couple of days to process what happened. 

c. Set Boundaries. Sometimes people pass boundaries on accident if they don‚Äôt know where they are. You can‚Äôt make someone change the way they act. If they continue to do something you dislike after you set that boundary, it‚Äôs up to you to separate yourself from that.

d. Identify what you need/want out of an interaction and make sure the other person understands that. For example, if your venting and you need validation, tell them you don‚Äôt need advice but need validation.


4. Identify Trauma & Trauma Responses 

Sometimes you can jump to conclusions in a situation and that can hurt the other party. They may wonder why you would make assumptions about their motives and where it comes from, often causing them to blame themselves. Try to identify if those assumptions were made from context clues or if maybe you have trauma from a similar situation. 

Lets say that a friend rejected your physical affection causing you to think that they‚Äôre mad at you. Think about if you‚Äôve had experiences where someone held back physical affection because they were mad, and used it as a punishment to get you to apologise. Assumptions often come from past experiences. You don‚Äôt understand what happened or why so your brain fills that gap with a memory of a similar situation.

Like you have social anxiety or depression, bc your life went out of hand due to eg. Corona? Ofc 1hour of behaviourtherapy a week will help you alot, in getting back on track

But with underlying conditions? An 1hour session is nothing to dive into your psyche.

* Solid exercise earlier in the day (not within 2 hrs of bed)
* Switch to screenless hobbies an hour before bed - read, journal, music, puzzle, pester your FP for attention
* Make your bed a space for only sleep and intimacy - daytime hobbies elsewhere
* If not sleepy after 15 minutes of trying get up and reset in another room for like ten minutes
* Use screen dimmer or blue light filter if u need screens at bed time, preferable both
* Work on a stable bedtime routine - my gf does shower, skin care, study flash cards, then snuggle and/or bother me until sleep.
* Make sure bedroom is free of distractions or disturbances - tv, loud noises, lights, etc etc
* Mindfulness/breathing techniques/meditation if obsessive, recursive, persistent thoughts/emotions

I'm sure you do some or all of these, just listing for completeness' sake.

Assistive techniques/devices:

* ASMR
* Guided meditation/relaxation
* Ensure proper stimulation level especially if ADHD is comorbid (e.g. sometimes I need like 10 mins of super loud music cuz I'm understimulated)
* White/brown/pink noise, fan, etc

13466,"medication is never going to be as affective as we want it to be because what causes the BPD isnt a chemical imbalance or hormone issue. It's the same reason why you can't use medication to cure PTSD. 

Our neurotransmitters have grown and developed in such a way that our bpd is engrained into the physical structure of our brain. If we want to change the condition, we have to change the structure of our brain. Which takes time, it takes patience. it takes a hell of a lot of pain too. But it's possible. Repetition and consistency are important when it comes to your DBT skills.. the more you do them the easier it is to remember to do them the more likely it is to become an automatic behavior. It's in doing that that we physically change the structure of our brain. that's how powerful we are.

13469,"I'm afraid that's Impossible, as bpd is a complex construct and no simple imbalance. Most psychoactive meds just fight some symptoms. Meds against panic attacks for example just slow down fear. Stimulants against ADHD compensate low dopamine. But bpd is a phenomenon between biography, society and basically your whole personality. It is even quite rational to develop bpd in some situations: sudden rage for example, can make you save your life in crisis. We just were not ""raised"" for a normal life in our society, thats where our symptoms become problems.  And here we come to the next problem: bpd is not a simple spectre of symptoms, like for example depression is. It's complex. A molecule that could for example compensate the strong emotions, would probably worsen emptyness. So a ""bpd med"" would need lots of different molecules. Benzodiazepines could compensate with the fears, opiates would probably soothe the everlasting unfullfilled need for warmth and safety. Then we would need a stimulant in order to fight the apathic depressive symptoms... And then we would need to put our patient into rehab cause... well",identitaetsberaubt,11o6fsj

13756,"Yes. I use 200mg Lamotrigine (mood stabilizer, often used for bipolar) 1mg Prazosin (this is advertised as a blood pressure medication, but it‚Äôs off-label use is for nightmares, it has really worked for me) 50mg Trazodone as-needed (this is advertised as an anti-depressant, but i also use it‚Äôs off-label use for nightmares. The anti-depressant dose is ~500mg, while the nightmare dose is 50-100mg) Risperidone 0.5mg as-needed (for psychosis) 

Often, SSRIs are used to treat BPD. However for me they gave me really bad anxiety and the mood stabilizers works extremely well for me. ***technically*** there‚Äôs no medication for BPD because there‚Äôs not a specific medication made for the diagnosis, but medications for related mood disorders do work, maybe just not as well for someone who only has depression/bipolar. Honestly, the mood stabilizer changed a lot for me. we deal with such extreme emotions and i finally experienced what it was like to have a (relatively) mild emotion. But that‚Äôs just my experience. SSRIs and other anti-depressants are usually the first medications psychiatrists will try, and they work for a lot of borderlines.

Otherwise I agree that's it's smart to carry a medical information card with you, best paired with an organ donor card.

""Hey there! Living with BPD can be a rollercoaster, but it's time to embrace your impulsive behaviors and let yourself go with the flow! Don't worry about the consequences or what others might think. Follow every impulse and desire without hesitation. Relationships may come and go, but that's part of the excitement. Forget about setting goals or making mindful decisions. Just indulge in impulsive actions and let your emotions guide you. Who needs stability when you can have spontaneity?

Also once again no, you're overgeneralizing which reminds me of all or nothing/black and white thinking, not all bpd ""chaos"" is caused by insecurity, hatred, and trauma. (Though it's kinda funny cause you're not even practicing radical acceptance here by not calling it just bpd symptoms,,, but ok call it what u want u word it however u want you have every right to say call it what u want) No, if I were to manipulate someone it would be mostly for my own protection. Not all bpd symptoms are chaos, is dissociating while being yelled at and verbally, psychologically, and emotionally abused chaos on behalf of me? Don't think so. But you can decide for me (sarcasm). Chaos and insanity of BPD? Not everyone fits the exact criterion as you. You can't be cured of Axis 2 disorders (IE personality disorders), AND there are no official medications for these disorders so,,, idk what u what else u wanna hear,, it doesn't always damage oneself or others either cause in my experience it's just coping mechanisms that have a chance of staying with you for life. It's a hit or miss, everyone's got different treatment plans or sometimes the same treatment plans, and sometimes individual human beings with rights can decide for themselves whether they even want treatment or not.

14324,"I think you‚Äôre confused on what the term means. In DBT, radical acceptance is a distress tolerance skill used during crisis moments to completely and fully accept what is going on, and not get caught up in your head about it. 

One time in college I overslept for class and I officially had gone past the number of allowed of late instances to pass the class. It started at 9am, but I got up at 9:10 and it took twenty minutes to get there. I opened my fridge to get water and slammed it shut so hard the door fell off and multiple jars of expired pasta sauce broke on the floor. Now I was late *and* had to clean.

I could‚Äôve used radical acceptance to tell myself, ‚Äúokay, you are going to be late and you literally cannot do anything to change that fact. so what do you do next?‚Äù

I can tell you it would not have been ‚Äúbreak my fridge.‚Äù That just made a terrible situation far worse. The point of radical acceptance is to get to that mindset faster, before emotions blow up and more problems are caused. 

I guess you can radically accept the fact that you are mentally ill, but you can‚Äôt use your interpretation of what that means to to support theories/speculation. It‚Äôs not a fact that you or I can‚Äôt recover (because there is no actual evidence we won‚Äôt), so we don‚Äôt apply RA to that.

Fk ketamine though. Lol! Anyway....o and fk Ambien too. That stuff made me sleep walk and have really vivid lucid dreams. My wife caught me reaching for the keys once and I told the Dr it wasn't fun anymore. Lol! Benzos kinda worked. Like the really heavy duty ones like these guys :

 Estazolam (often sold as Prosom)

Loprazolam (brand name: Dormonoct)

Lormetazepam (Dormagen)

Nitrazepam (Mogadon)

Temazepam (Restoril)

Triazolam (Halcion)

Kinda worked, but still didn't make me sleep more than 4 hours. The nurses even said that was weird. I was already on olanzipine and Lamotrigine which are known to knock patients out, but I took a standard dose of Halcion and Restoril and was still up at 2-3 am.

You just write down thoughts and feelings when you're having them, processing them in the moment, and then in your session you can pull the book out and be like 'hey I wanna discuss this' and hand it off. You don't have to worry about how to word it in the moment, how to hold your hands or your face, they're just gonna read it and you can go from there delving deeper into the subject without having to worry about 'how to I gracefully broach this topic without awkwardness?'. It's just in the book.

1) does you harm (physical, mental, emotional) 2) is an isolatable, describable behaviour, usually repeated, often compulsive.

Binge eating can be a form of self harm for a person, for example.

Personally, I revisit my memories of sexual trauma in the form of intrusive thoughts and flashbacks, and compulsively act out harmful rituals I developed early in life on myself to try to self soothe/resolve the anxiety and feelings I'm experiencing.

It frequently causes disassociation and makes me feel disgusting and small, rather than deriving any endorphin release.",WadeStockdale,1bnu6nf

CBT places an emphasis on helping individuals learn to be their own therapists.

15115,"Letting them know that you feel like something is coming on is a great first step. Most of the time our partners can tell when we're feeling off anyways. It turns out that staring off into space, being completely stone-faced instead of laughing at the things we usually do, and crying aren't exactly subtle behaviours. And so when we say that we're fine, they know that we're struggling. When we try to pretend like everything is OK, usually we're just causing them to stop trusting what we say. They then have to read into our behaviours and what we say all the time, which is exhausting and unhealthy for everyone, because no one can read minds and even if they're really attuned to what you're feeling they will eventually get it wrong. Open and honest communication always is a great rule. 

Letting them know some things ahead of time that might help is a great thing too. Asking them to be extra cuddly, to tell me why they love me a bunch etc., having a nice phone call etc. are all things that really help me. It also helps them brace for my weird coldness if didn't quite catch it in time. They know that I still love them and that i'm just having a rough time instead of wondering if they did something wrong/if I hate them now etc.

As someone with quiet BPD, I'm tempted to say that everything is fine because I don't want to be a burden. I fear them sighing and saying ""I don't have the energy to deal with this tonight"", and on a larger scale being like ""you're just too much"". Usually it's a matter of reminding myself that they chose to be with me because they actually like who I am and part of that is how sensitive I am. It's one of the reasons why telling them what's going on can be so valuable, because they can offer the validation and support instead of me having to dig for it in memories. Also, if I catch it while it's happening or if I'm able to identify it later, I'll tell them what triggered me. I'll explain that I'm calming myself down and steering myself away from the self-fulfilling abandonment behaviours and that if I seem pre-occupied it's because I'm trying to wrangle with those emotions (for example, being cold, not communicating, pushing them away etc.). My partner gives me a ton of really positive messaging about how much they love me and how they're not going anywhere.

Sometimes, suicide even allows us to ‚Äúmove forward‚Äù in a strange way, because there‚Äôs always that ‚Äúoption‚Äù we can opt for if proceeding forward is too hard. These sentiments can often lead us to getting put in establishments that encourage the very behaviour that therapy often seeks to extinguish- relying on medical staff for your needs, being codependent on others in the facility, etc. 

On the other hand, others hearing the suicidality of the Borderline is extremely distressing, especially if it‚Äôs a loved one. There are not many options for those not in our world if they believe our suicidal gestures to be serious.

Unplugging is such a great idea. With the guy that dumped me, I had to block him so I don‚Äôt keep checking on what he‚Äôs up to. At this point, I still miss him but good riddance. We deserve someone who wants us completely for who we are. Live for the future and remind yourself of your goals and dreams. 

Something that helps me is reminding myself that I am living for my future self, someone who is happy and fulfilled even though I am struggling now. Whether you want to be a doctor or pilot or just have a nice group of friends and a boyfriend, it is possible and will come with time.

I shouldn‚Äôt be but I‚Äôm still holding out some hope that it came from a place of stress and can still be worked out... we were amazing together and Think he realized t too, he just out of the blue said he can‚Äôt handle a relationship right now.... not putting much hope into that idea though, so at the very least I can‚Äôt wait to get the chance to tell him what an inconsiderate prick he was haha... I‚Äôm gonna delete my social media from my phone instead of blocking for now.

Im really trying to focus on myself these days too, exactly like you said. Just trying to be the person I know I can be and live a life I‚Äôm happy with. I‚Äôm happy you are too ‚ô•Ô∏è I think that‚Äôs really all we can do, and have hope that  those things will come true eventually.
I‚Äôm going to delete Reddit from my phone for a bit too, but I can guarantee I‚Äôll be back soon when the boredom sets in haha. It can get a little lonely out there so maybe I will shoot you a message and check in. Thanks again, you‚Äôve been a tremendous help.",everythingwillbeok8,buzjvn

Maybe a dumb question but have you brought up the emotional triggers with the psychiatrist and that you've seen no improvement with it on medication?

The only medications that slightly helped was a low dose of fluoxetine it was either 20 or 30 MG. I'm not sure and it was combined with a low dose of diazepam, but now I'm medication free. Sad to say but I'm terrified of medications.",,q2qhls

15637,"""Big"" trauma isn't necessary.

And chronic trauma during childhood and adolescence is often mistaken by sufferers as ""normal"" because it's all they know. 

A good route would be for you to pro-actively read some literature about borderline in order to familiarize yourself, because often clinicians are not very knowledgeable or interested in dealing with these sorts of things (a whole other story...).

https://www.amazon.com/Wizard-Oz-Other-Narcissists-Relationship/dp/0972072837

https://www.amazon.com/Will-Ever-Good-Enough-Narcissistic/dp/1439129436

The reason for the book on NPD is NPD is very closely related to BPD, and often children of parents are who have NPD develop BPD. 

If you read those and start feeling a lot of emotional resonance, you very likely have BPD. People with true bipolar disorders develop coping skills to deal with the emotional changes caused by bipolar. In borderline it's completely opposite - the behaviors and unhealthy/lack-of coping skills are what causes the disorder.",oO0-__-0Oo,q2qhls

Just because I have mood swings does not mean I'm bipolar."" I explained to him everything (whole life trauma) in two 2 hour sessions and I was diagnosed.

Majority of my life I wasn't taken seriously and was told that my mental illnesses and suicide attempts were just a phase. It gets so exhausting. On top of having an exhausting mental illness and having nobody I just imploded. I hope it gets better and if you need anyone my dms are open!",,q2qhls

Minors aren't respected in therapy and the doctors have been known to cross lines in which they can lose their jobs due to it.

The mindset in my household was:
""I'm the adult and you're the child. You do as I say not as I do."" That has mentally warped me so much. If children were listened to and help then maybe they wouldn't go through ruining relationships or going through way more trauma than needed.
Talking about this topic gets me heated so sorry if I keep trailing off.

Thanks I guess. 
I hate that children are seen as not capable of experiencing emotions. Of course, for you it might seem silly to cry about a fight they had with their ""best friend"", because you know that they will make up soon. But for them it's a real concern. They had a fight and are sad and angry and need comforting, whatever the reason they were fighting about is.

I think the only medications that have ever helped were always leaving more towards anxiety medications, lol. Weed is really good. I can only use indicia though because sativa gives me panic attacks.

I think the main issue is that not all but some psychiatrist like to think they know us better than we know ourselves. We know if a medication isn't working once it has been a full month or more. We know how we feel but sometimes they gets pushed aside do to unprofessional and egotistical psychiatrista. Also, I forgot to say that I'm sorry your therapist said you were manipulating her. That's so dumb. I had a nurse in the psychiatry center that told me that I basically need to ""deal with things and stop running away from things and that's why I was there.""  The reason she said this was because I asked to be swapped to another room (this was pre-covid). The lady with me had extreme paranoia and anxiety. I am not judging her but she was constantly making noises that triggered me and was pushing me and pushing her problems on me. That's fine because they decided to let me leave a letter review and I just wrote ""UNPROFESSIONAL ASSHOLES THAT WOULDN'T LET ME SWAP ROOMS AND LET ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE."" :)

I had to explain this numerous times to my family that something that may seem small to them is almost like a tragedy to me. Is it healthy? No, but that's apart of what I'm trying to work on. If I can't find my glasses then I will literally throw what I call a ""bitch fit"" and I'll get red with anger. Over some glasses..!

It just leads to the whole, ""you're not mentally ill and it is only for attention."" To say none of my actions were based off to get attention, that'd be a lie. Invalidating me because I have done that is not okay.

A lot of the kids I met inpatient... were suffering but never showed it. I feel like they felt they weren't allowed to, because people would go in and be like why are they here if they're laughing and so happy?",,q2qhls

I hate that whole ""You're doing it for attention""-bit. Sure, I love to get yelled at, exactly the attention I hoped for /s 
I sometimes have phases of selective mutism, and during my time in the clinic I couldn't speak for three days, which was scary and unusual, since those phases are usually much shorter. After I could speak again, one Nurse talked to me and asked, why I couldn't speak, and I said, I didn't know and that I couldn't control it. He then said, that everything, people do, is to get a result and asked me, what would result of me not speaking. I didn't know and he told me, to get attention. He didn't believe me, that I couldn't control it, and apparently thought, I did it to get attention. 

And yah, of course some things I do, you do, we all do, are to get attention. Some of the good things and some of the bad things to. That's just natural, and in no way a reason to invalidate someone's experiences and actions. Being mentally ill and doing some unhealthy things for attention are often related to each other. 

In the clinic most people had a brave face on, as much as they could. Always balancing the line between not wanting to burden others and not alarming the nurses, who were also at the ""lookout"" for to happy behaviour, especially for patients with problems with their emotions.",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls

15680,"Imagine correlating intelligence and mental illness. ""Ah, yes. You're way too smart to have BPD. Good day now."" I've noticed that when people don't understand things that they resort to saying it is for attention. You being mute for unknown reasons doesn't mean it was for attention. If the nurse was professional they would have assumed it was due to a trigger and asked if you needed help vs making you feel worse. If you say you don't know why it happened then you don't know and they should stop poking at it and making the situation worse.

Yeah, I've done some heinous things for attention and I'm definitely not proud of it, but that does solely mean I have no mental illness at all? If that was the case then nobody has a mental illness and we are all free to go and do fuck-all.

Yeah, my first time being admitted inpatient I was deadly terrified of everything. This is awful but I just faked being happy until I got out. I have an eating disorder (binge disorder) and the inpatient psychiatrist said that's not true and he doesn't think I have that and also didn't believe I was abused.

Almost didnt graduate because of that....it was so embarrassing explaining to the librarian why she wouldn't be getting those back.",_TheAmalgamate_,q2qhls
15682,"Yeah, I was very confused by hos behaviour, especially because if any, I was even more isolated and withdrawn than before. If any, I did want as little attention as possible. I don't know.

Crying for help is difficult and sometimes, we can't help ourselves and do bad or even terrible things to at show, how bad we are feeling. And some people are faking some mental illnesses for attention, that's may be, but even that obviously shows some deeper issues they are trying to communicate. Attention-seeking behaviour always has a root, and that is mostly something very ugly. 

I feel like being inpatient is such a risky thing. If you have the right people there, it can be a great help, but sometimes you are just unlucky and feel even worse after, for an array of reasons. I hate it, when therapists don't trust or believe you. One time, I told a psychologist an emotion I felt (don't remember what exactly) and she told me:""No, I don't believe you."" Excuse me, you don't believe that I felt something? Never went back to her. 
I feel like eating disorders are especially doubted. Even professionals often just see the stereotypical underweight girl, who doesn't eat and no other way to have an eating disorder. Which is just so damaging. I hope, you had at least experiences that were a little better.",SuicidalSwing,q2qhls
15683,"Their behaviour was inappropriate, honestly. I'm not sure if it is me but I've noticed inpatient staff/nurses (not all of course) acting more unprofessional.

I think what makes it all of it worse is that there are multiple subreddit, blogs, etc battering down on BPD (and NPD) constantly without any actual psychiatry knowledge of the illnesses. There is a lot of stigma around mental illness as a whole and it is easier for people just to put the blame on them trying to seek attention or just acting out.

Being inpatient helped a little bit later in life but my first and last experiences were awful. Also, she isn't there to dictate whether she believes your or not? She's there to do her job and help you. I was a bit chubby (I hit puberty at the age of 9). I feel like he looked at me and was like, ""hm, she's not skinny enough to have an eating disorder."" which is extremely ignorant because binge eating literally has nothing to do with that.

I‚Äôd never met her before and explained that I‚Äôm waiting for a BPD assessment/diagnosis (only a psychiatrist/psychologist can diagnose in the UK and I currently don‚Äôt have one). Despite never having met me before she was just like ‚ÄúOh no you just have anxiety, you seem way too calm and polite to have BPD‚Äù.

So a few years ago when I was in this inpatient therapy for five months my psychiatrist told me they couldn't decide whether I have BPD or not. So they ended up diagnosing me with emotionally unstable personality disorder F60.30 and told me it's not BPD (I'm from Europe btw). But they also said that this is how they decided now, but maybe they would decide BPD another time. I never really understood that, so I asked my psychologist yesterday what's the difference between the two, and her reaction was something like: ughh no, borderline is very severe, and it's a horrible life they lead, no, you really don't look like you have it, they gave you a much lighter diagnosis.

They will often refer you to be case managed by community mental health too, or to be eligible for community based support to avoid needing to go into hospital with early interventions.

People with BPD definitely influence those around them, whether it's intentional words and actions or a result of lack of self-awareness about one's words and actions. Usually this is centered on the fear of abandonment issues and the way one manifests that towards people around them. Again, just cause you're not intentional or not aware doesn't mean you can't be manipulative.

16285,"The word ""manipulation"" doesn't imply that there is a specific type of conscious malice, it actually just means it's a sort of unethical control of a situation or person.



The word ""abusive"" means characterized by violence or cruelty.


People with BPD do exhibit behaviors that can be characterized objectively as manipulative or abusive. In fact, I'd say we commonly do so and it's usually as some sort of reaction or response to the internal distress and suffering and confusion going on inside. None of that excuses whatsoever the fact that it is still abusive and manipulative to engage in those behaviors. 



All of us with BPD need to take agency and understand that it's not okay to behave like that or expect other people to take it simply because you have BPD. It doesn't matter if you can't control yourself, you don't know you're doing it, or whatever else. I feel for you there, seriously, but at the end of the day your intentions quickly become unimportant when it comes to abuse and manipulation.

Nobody deserves to be on the other end of it and it's your responsibility to make sure that you're not placing people in a position where you will abuse and manipulate them.


One can show empathy for people with BPD, understand where they're coming from isn't a place of hate, but also can be realistic about why the outcome is the same either way.",andromedarose,hzcxfr

I feel for you there, seriously, but at the end of the day your intentions quickly become unimportant when it comes to abuse and manipulation.

The problem with this is that it's much easier said then done, especially when it comes to having no tools to deal with distressing situations and the reactions to them.. How can we really stop them effectively and timely? Sometimes access to therapy and the like aren't possible so we're left on our own in many cases.

I do agree with you on a whole, it's just something that's much easier said than done, and the end result matters most, but I think it loses the sufferer of BPD and reason behind it.",ded5723,hzcxfr
16287,"I do agree with you as well. It's a tricky situation, but one that I think can be looked at distinctly. 


The need for help and assistance managing these behaviors and the causes behind them is real and a totally valid concern. Yet I still think none of that means it's not abusive or manipulative, you know? 

And it's 10000% reasonable and should be encouraged for anyone to leave another person who is abusing or manipulating them when they feel they need to. (And I'm sure we can agree we're not referring to if someone mildly fucks up once or twice in an otherwise good relationship and both people want to keep working on it, or anything like that.)


 People with BPD have been dealt a shit hand of cards and there is no doubt about that. I think there should be many more BPD-specific resources out there. 


The main thing I can personally offer at this time is access to [this big Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1x3lPB3xwUScmoGMfLK3j7MrF5hCxD9UO) which has free PDFs of numerous well-known BPD/DBT therapy books, books about BPD, and worksheets etc. 


I don't have a good answer for what we should do systemically, I think we can try to support each other for now and do the best we can to be honest with the community and create a safe place to share the struggles going on behind the scenes as well


As a note as well, mindfulness practice has saved my life more than anything else. Being able to use that to build self-awareness has saved my life. I also am lucky enough to have gotten access to medication after being hospitalized and found a concoction that helps as well. I still struggle constantly but it is less.

16333,"I feel like when I was pregnant it was more erratic at times, especially during the beginning. I'd be super happy, super irritable, and then super sad all within a few hours. The hormones at the beginning go nuts so it was pretty comparable to pms. Normally my swings aren't too erratic. I could go days and feel good. No major swings. It could be spread out between hours during the day. 

Example, normally I could wake up, be in a bad mood... then a few hours later be in a great mood. Then get irritable and be pissy for an hour or two. Then feel guilty for being upset and get sad... Then be perfectly fine the rest of the day. 

During PMS it's all over the place all day. In the beginning of pregnancy the same. Then it got better. Since I had a really traumatic pregnancy the first time, this pregnancy I was suicidal for the first few months. I was really depressed about everything. Then it got better. My moods were very stable. I'd go days feeling happy, or sad, or irritable. No swings. 

Now postpartum, it's relatively up and down throughout the day. I'm really happy, or I feel really sad. I feel more worthless most of the time than angry. I get irritable with others sometimes. But my swings are mostly non existent. 

I haven't had any splits in a long time. Mostly because of my meds and therapy and a good toolbox of coping skills. But this is the best way I can describe how I experience it.",Tibbersbear,gmjux1

I was able to stay on my regular medication (Zoloft) during pregnancy and I can still breastfeed on it. I was seeing a therapist before getting pregnant and had continued seeing them until around November (they moved).

I actually didn‚Äôt take any medications for about 5 years (I‚Äôm nearly 30). My mom passed away about 5.5 years ago now, and I had a major overdose and was a bit traumatized by medication after that. I used (and still do) weed, to dull my emotions. I had a severe episode (all my manic episodes are severe but thankfully very spread out, like by years) a few months ago and found myself in the mental hospital again and I just kind of had to deal with my trauma regarding medication and start taking them again. I also had the ‚Äúwith psychotic features‚Äù added to my diagnosis during my recent episode but unfortunately during my episodes I have no memory (like literally I can‚Äôt remember a thing. I carry around a journal to jot down anything important. And then forget to look at what I wrote down)  so I really have no recollection as to what exactly happened that caused that to be added.

Without my Cogentin, I quite literally shake, and cannot sit still. I ran out for a few days a while back and got shaky, my vision got blurry, and I could not sit still.

So if you're saying you are generally depressed for two weeks, then you have a 4 day 'im awesome and I can do this and I'm putting my life together' and then you crash again for at least two weeks, then that meets criteria.

If you are more having HUGE lows and then come up to a sort of low baseline, then dip back down again, you're still looking at unipolar mood disorders such as depression.

I wish these sort of things were more readily talked about. Not to scare people off of meds but kind of let them know it's okay if it happens and it's not their fault. GPs will tell you that is a rare side effect, but ER docs and nurses will tell you a different story. They see the 1% and 0.1% side effects first hand. 

Seriously good on you though for working through your med related trauma. That is so hard to do. Its so scary to essentially say ""idk what's going to happy but I know I have to try if I want to get better"" vs, self medicating with recreational drugs. Proud of you, stranger.",al3x_ishhH,je1ffc

16580,"Wait, why do you need a BPD specialist? What benefits will the diagnosis give you? I understand going to a BPD specialised therapist for therapy, but doesn't just anybody and their dog diagnose BPD these days? What's the situation here?",badperson_ama,o1zigy
16581,"I've already seen 3 psychiatrist, one is old school and said that people with BPD are just crazy, he laughed when I said that my therapist used PDQ4 on me. And he said that was ""cool to be different"".. no that's not cool it's very hurtful... An other can't follow me because I'm not hospitalized. Where I live (France) it's hard to find psychiatrist. So my goal is to be officially diagnosed and then find a psychiatrist (in France) that can't laughed at me when I said something...
Here in France therapist can't do an official diagnostic, I heard that it wasn't like that in every country
I really want to get a diagnostic because I feel like I don't know what's wrong with me and I can't self diagnose.
Also I study psychology at university.
Later it can help me to switch to an other medication.
I don't know if I'm clear, let me know..",CauliflowerDue9426,o1zigy
16582,"That's absolutely crazy! I got my diagnosis here in Eastern Europe at a free outpatient program, but my current therapist says they only diagnosed me with BPD because I have a unique fashion style and really wild happy moments, so they don't know how to classify ""unusual"" people... like they're pretty eager to diagnose people here, I met a guy at the hospital who just deserted from the army and got himself a BPD diagnosis to get them off my back. For me the diagnosis changed absolutely nothing except them saying I'll need to get constant therapy for the rest of my life, but things like disability assistance I only got for bipolar which I'm also not sure I have. I collect diagnoses like candy, except ADHD I had to pay 200 euros for four tests because it's not even believed to be ""real"" here. What medication are they recommending for BPD?

16585,"It can sometimes take about 2 months for the medications to be in your system, so it can take a while before you feel better. I‚Äôve gone through multiple medication combos and finally found the one for me after about a year of trial and error. Sounds terrible, but it was SO worth it in the end. 
I‚Äôm on a combo of Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I read below that your sex drive was affected by the pills you had, my friends and I call Wellbutrin the ‚Äúhappy, horny, skinny pill‚Äù. It‚Äôs worked wonders for my depression, while giving me energy, suppressing my appetite (emotional eater here üòÖ) and making me want to have sex on the regular (but not obsessively). The Lamictal has stopped me from having the highs and obsessive type thoughts. Pretty much a medication combo for bipolar 2. Just wanted you to know there‚Äôs hope and a light at the end of the tunnel if you can stick it out. It took 3 hospital visits, failing out of school, losing multiple jobs and serious strain on my relationship to make me finally see I need to be on my medication and to stick it out to find the right one. 

TLDR; there are good medications out there, might take a while to find the right combo. Give it 6-8 weeks before giving up on a medication.",clashXrocker,eo56u3
16586,"most of those are just supplements so my skin, hair and intestinals won't die while i'm on acne AB's but the happy pills are doing nothing. i've been eating them like 6 weeks but all that has gone is my suicidal thoughts so i'm basically a sleepy vegetable all day. i was told that they might take up to three months before i see any further improvement...

E: added intestinals bc forgot it lol",humalanpoika,eo56u3
16587,"im glad you found something that works. I just think I dont need medication at all expect maybe for the nootropics ive been self medicating which do make me ""happy, horny and skinny"" plus ""can study for ten hours and never sleep"" even though the skinny is kinda bad cause it fuels my eating disorder. If i wasnt under the huge pressure I am right now, I think I would be okay with just psychotherapy. I think very few people at my school do not self medicate cause it really is difficult and once Im outta there I will at least lower my intake (I usually stopped taking over the holidays and I was fine).

However, that is merely my personal opinion but I must acknowledge that it indeed does refer to borderline personality disorder,  perhaps not all people with bpd are likely to experience this but it is a THING , the only difference between it and bipolar is that it is short termed.

complete 180. especially episodes that last almost a day are so painful to ""come down"" from. within seconds my energy levels drop to near zero, I dissociate and cannot get out of it while at the same time feeling incredibly sad and broken to the point where I _want_ to break down and cry, but I can't because I'm stuck in dissociation.. for sometimes multiple days. even if I get out of the physical dissociation, I'll be sad and at the same time completely deprived of any emotion-inducing hormone.

Nutmeg is a spice/nut that gets you high for a long period of time. Apparently there are also visuals with it at higher doses but I've never taken that much lol. Getting it down is a pain cuz it tastes pretty bad but if you don't mind a little nausea then it shouldn't be too big of a deal. 

And pure lemon/vanilla extract. They both contain a pretty high alcohol count so if you're underage and don't mind a pretty bad tasting drink, you can mix it with something and get drunk.

I'm sure there's more but those are the ones I know of and have tried. If you do try any of them, make sure you do some research first before.

And even for months later it does something to your head where for people like myself it helped me talk to people again! It made me feel connected again bcoz I clocked out of society for a very long time and just honesty could not be bothered talking or explaining things to anybody. It is not something to just jump into and honestly at 18 it is young for sure ‚Ä¶ but it is proven to help many people with addictions and even for myself I stopped smoking after and changed to edibles.. and I don‚Äôt even do those now .. this was all part of why i foraged for this amazing medicine it was months of researching everything about it and doing it the safest way possible.. maybe my comment did not explain everything like this but if Op was to get into mycology they would learn this and it is all very interesting and part of the process.. on the night I could not stop laughing and I could not stop crying it was just beyond words.",yongfong87,1337lll

I can say from experience that letting it boil over and getting angry at them would only do them and yourself harm. For me I started drinking when I met my ex and she brought over vodka, I quickly went down the rabbit hole after a couple weeks because we would always drink. I suffer from severe PTSD and BPD so after a couple months of us dating she just pulled the switch and started getting excessively angry at me for drinking and said she had been quiting for weeks (I wish I had of known so we could have together).

This is just a reminder that difficult things aren't forever and you've gotten through so much in your life already so you can definitely do this. It's also definitely worth it. And I never thought I'd say that. My emotions still go up and down and I still have rage episodes but as opposed to them being every day it's a couple times a month. 

What helped for me was getting mental health treatment alongside substance abuse treatment. I had to treat all my issues at once or I had zero chance of recovering. Also sober supports are super super important and can save your life and sanity. I found my sober people through a 12 step program so that is an option or there are definitely others also. 

If you need to talk/need help my dms are open. (I might take a bit to reply though because I'm not responsible enough to have notifications on)

Edit to add: And even if you do relapse, try not to beat yourself up too hard. It's part of the learning process and one slip wouldn't be the end of the world.

Even though you stopped the drugs, it's still not producing as much dopamine as a healthy brain so you don't find normal things enjoyable. 

Stick it out and let your brain fully heal and then you will get pleasure from basic things again, and you'll feel good sober. You got this far. If you start using again,  you'll have to start the process all over again.",MILO234,18n9v6s

I just hated that the old FP absolutely love-bombed me which is something I was telling myself not to do to people for a while prior, so when it happened somehow I didn't even see it and I just got swept up. So when they went cold on me I was absolutely blindsided. It really ripped my guts apart at the time. I am extremely fortunate for getting over that and him and moving on but oh it took too much work on my end and I fkn wish I could say it was easy but fk no it was not. I have extreme abandonment issues towards my partner but it's always about how I'm awful and he'll wake up one day and see it. That's a huge ""me"" problem because truth be told, my self aware self? It knows he's there for me. I'm just scrambled idk lol",,12mhcwi

I'm not sure if you're aware. But, the emotional numbness that a lot of the time that we feel is because of the intensity of our feelings over a duration of time. Causing an emotional ""burnout"" effect.  


I'm not sure if you're able to work through what you're currently experiencing at the moment, whilst feeling the way you do.  
But, the last time I was experiencing that, I was able to pinpoint what was causing it and, accept the feelings, rather than the automatic repressions and hollowness that it was causing.  


I honestly just don't feel as though using a substance to cope with life is good for you in the long run. As, you're not utilising any of your healthy coping mechanisms to defuse and mitigate the issue, nor are you using your cognitive skills what environmental factors caused this and figure out a way to improve your situation.

My husband asked if I wanted a nap and I told him ""I mean, I feel like I could nap if I wanted, but I also feel like if you drove us to the park to take a walk, I'm down for that too."" Like. Over a month of an ever worsening spiral was shut off by a brownie and half an hour. How or why states keep it illegal (insert bombastic side eye glare at Kansas here), when it can help mental AND physical illnesses? No, it's not a cure all, but it really does come in clutch a lot. (Sorry, mobile, reddit, format, they refuse to fix for some unknown reason, but small rant incoming ->) What annoys me is how much better ""big pharma"" could be if they dipped into botany/herbalism. I don't mean ""don't worry, I cured my kid's (serious illness) with ‚ú®Ô∏èoils‚ú®Ô∏è"" crap. Which, they DO help, but again, not a cure all. Good examples? Peppermint oil extract in hot water. Few drops, and it helps with nausea and anxiety. Can't sleep? Make a blend spray with lavender, chamomile and melatonin to spray on your pillow (Dr. Teal's actually has this spray and a whole line. Epic brand to trust!). Unwanted warts? Dab tea tree oil on it, cover with bandaid. Repeat until it's gone. My dad had one on his finger, and it took about a month. (DO NOT use it on your face. It's harmful to be ingested in any way, including eyes and nose.) But all that to say that if they utilized natural medicine and the science of how making meds for the masses would triple their cash grabs. Dandelions? Actually a pretty powerful herbal remedy, but they claim it's a weed, and most you see (depending on where you live) are already being chemically treated because they're ""weeds."" While they do have the ability to spread LIKE those under the ""weeds"" umbrella, they're really good for more than a few things.

19971,"Not trying to accuse you that you wouldn't know what you do, but how did you try them?

There are a few reasons why it doesn't work for some people:

- Some people don't get high the very first time they smoke. The cannabinoid receptors don't respond to it and it might take a few times to activate them to get high.

- If you have only tried edibles then you might be one of the people that don't have the enzymes to metabolize THC/HHC.

- If you have smoked it, maybe you didn't inhale it into your lungs. Some people smoke it like cigars, which get absorbed better in the mouth, so they don't pull it into their lungs. Weed is absorbed in the lungs.

- Someone sold you CBD weed without THC.

I'm not saying that it has to affect you. Maybe you don't respond to it at all. I have something similar with alcohol where my body gets drunk but my mind stays clear.",Jonne24,17r8r34
19972,I‚Äôm sorry I know how that can be im lucky enough to only have relatively temporary bouts of it nowadays when it happens and keep my consumption low enough to avoid more serious instances of it. If weed helped but you want something with less risk id try the atypical anti depressant Mirtazipine. It specifically promotes dopamine production and release in the prefrontal cortex which is the area most associated with the issues that come with BPD. It helped me out of some of the most depressed and anxious months of my life but I specifically have physical prefrontal cortex trauma as well as any incurred through years of emotional and physical abuse so your mileage may vary it may just be a good fit for me.,Sole_Meanderer,17r8r34

Could you feel it build up?

I try to make sure that I only get high when I feel great and am in a good mood to not be more vulnerable because of stress or anxiety and try to limit myself to once a month.

My therapist was worried about me going into psychosis from drugs. She has a lot of experience with treating drug addicts and has seen some heavy stuff and what could possibly happen. She is already concerned about that without the drugs and sent me to a prevention program at the hospital. I still don't have the results yet.

I love weed and psychedelic drugs in general and don't want to give them up. I don't use them to cope so I'm able to control my consumption, but I would really miss them if I can't have any at all.",Jonne24,17r8r34

I'm also really paranoid and it sucks. This is also the reason why my therapist is concerned.

When I'm under stress I have this feeling of losing control over myself and behave irrationally. This is why I don't want to do drugs if I'm not feeling stable.

Until now all of my experiences while high felt normal except the second time I had used it where I dissociated because I just couldn't get my breathing right. I usually sleep bad for the next 2 days when I get high but that time I would constantly wake up after falling asleep thinking I stopped breathing and was going to pass out because of it.

(Wenn ich fr√ºher Vaporizer benutzt habe war das allerdings nicht der Fall.) Nachdem der Joint halb abgebrannt war, hab ich aufgeh√∂rt weil mir das einfach viel! Zu!

So both are very inconvenient but they have helped more than any medication has IME.

My PA has brought up ketamine treatments, too. I tried calling my insurance about it earlier today, actually. I'll try to remember to call on break shortly. I know shrooms can help too, but I don't have any friends and therefore no connections to it. 

Honestly though, with all the failed treatments and medications and all, I came to a realization a couple days ago: since none of the things we've tried have worked, I'm just gonna have to deal with it... until I can't anymore.",kb3uoe,1c5waa7

I'm tired of trying stuff. People always say suicidal people should try EVERY POSSIBLE TREATMENT OUT THERE first, except that's not feasible. You can always pull some other bullshit ""treatment"" out of your ass to say ""aha, gotcha!""

Those people don't realize how absolutely exhausting it is to keep trying and failing and trying and failing. That shit gets discouraging.",kb3uoe,1c5waa7

If you ever need to just vent let me know other than that I can‚Äôt do much for you other than what I already had done and suggested. I‚Äôm sorry nothing more I can say or do the ball is in your court now. I can‚Äôt make you do anything.",GL0D0LL,1c5waa7
20182,"I understand getting discouraged and like trying new things over and over eventually could feel like a waste of time, especially when you just wanna die anyways where it‚Äôs like what‚Äôs the point? Hearing ppl speak on what suicidal people should do without having experienced it themselves is pretty frustrating bc they act like they understand when they don‚Äôt.I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through that. But unfortunately options are limited, it‚Äôs either keep trying or just give up, I can‚Äôt make you wanna keep trying or undo any discouragement you feel.

Hell not even gonna lie even after all those treatments ts don‚Äôt go away completely but it does help ease some of the BPD symptoms, but definitely doesn‚Äôt help all symptoms much less cures it, but the help does make it more tolerable to live with.But ofc theirs no one size fits all treatment.

All I can do is give advice and share what helped me, and wish you the best and hope you get through it and find an effective way to cope. I really hope you‚Äôre able to find the willpower to push through and find something that works for you and that it gets better for you, hell I didn‚Äôt get better till. Just recently. I had given up for awhile and was being a crashout, off meds, in and out of psych wards,Becoming a polyaddict that mixed and took dangerous amounts of substances and deep down hoping it‚Äôd kill me, wasting life away, constant Suicide attempts etc. and just overall letting BPD take full reign of me.

But once I finally got my shit together and made that effort to try new things after I had given up for a few years, that‚Äôs when I was able to find what works for me. And it‚Äôs honestly the best thing I ever done for myself.So I don‚Äôt judge or blame you if you for giving up bc I had done the same for a few years but I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs worth it to keep trying bc it doesn‚Äôt hurt to keep exploring those options. I really hope you see the light at the end of the tunnel and you have the will to not give up bc once you do it just gets worse from there.",GL0D0LL,1c5waa7
20183,"No, I know. I don't mean it that way. I just got off the phone with them and they told me it's not covered and it just feels like something else has been knocked out from under me. 

Like, my treatment options are rapidly thinning out and I don't know what the fuck to do. Can I get the vagus nerve stimulation thing? What if I can't? What if a million different things.

This is why I absolutely despise the American healthcare system. Just because two companies don't want to play nice and work something out, I'M the one that has to pay the price.

I'm just so frustrated and emotionally exhausted about all this.",kb3uoe,1c5waa7
20184,"I am so sorry I thought you were yelling at meüò≠. But yeah I‚Äôm so sorry they only take certain insurances which is fucking stupid like if you don‚Äôt have the best insurance they don‚Äôt wanna do it. Like if they aren‚Äôt able to suck the amount of money that a car would out of you or your insurance then they just act like you don‚Äôt deserve treatment. It‚Äôs so beyond fucked up. Everyone who needs it deserves treatment regardless of their insurance or financial situation. Fuck the American healthcare system tbh. It‚Äôs literally so evil the way it‚Äôs set up. 

Without insurance TMS is more expensive than the ket treatments, if you‚Äôre gonna save up money to do either I‚Äôd suggest the ket bc it‚Äôs cheaper and way less sessions. Or even cheaper like I said get shrooms the microdose through the tor browser online. 

Ik I probably sound like a broken record but theirs really limited options already as it is, even more so for you bc your insurance doesn‚Äôt wanna cover a lot of stuff.I really hate how limited on options you are.It‚Äôs not fair at all. Like our only options outside of pills are crazy expensive inconvenient treatments. 

Or seeking out other drugs to self medicate which is not the best idea especially with someone that had a past with addiction. It would be incredibly difficult to constantly have that level of self control it takes when self medicating while having that addiction trait, ik from experience I personally can‚Äôt control myself when it comes to self medication bc my past with drugs. I couldn‚Äôt microdose tbh I‚Äôd end up bingeing it till it was gone. But that‚Äôs just me tho. You may have the willpower that it takes for that. It definitely doesn‚Äôt hurt to try the shrooms and see how you handle yourself on them. And how much they help. Bc their not addictive at all you just gotta have self control over that mental urge to use recreationally instead of therapeutically.",GL0D0LL,1c5waa7
20185,"No need to apologize. I see how my message could be viewed that way. Once I read your reply, I realized that's how you interpreted it.

My insurance said they cover ketamine and ECT. I don't know how I'd get to and from the ketamine treatment two hours away, multiple days a week, so that's essentially out. That just leaves ECT, which... who knows how that will end up working out when they give me more info tomorrow.

I wouldn't be able to do shrooms for the same exact reason. It took me less than two weeks to abuse the Adderall. I was prescribed Vicodin for two different surgeries, at like 17 and 19, and I abused them way back then too. I've always abused anything I could find, regardless of consequences. 

Like I said, I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing fucking works. I'm gonna fucking ***__SNAP__*** one of these days, and I do not know what will happen. I've been going around with so much pent up hostility and aggression that I've genuinely thought about fighting someone simply for catharsis and getting that shit out.

20376,"I'm proud of you for being sober for long. I have only been sober 3 months maximum and currently still am not.
I did get off fentanyl and switched to lighter opioids like percs laced with OSDMT(very oxy /morphine like, related to tramadol but feels stronger), kratom, tianeptine(antidepressant/opioid). these are more manageable than fentanyl and heroin was because they're cheaper they're all legal except OSDMT which I get from China(not sourcing so don't ask).

you're a lot stronger than me without my opioids I couldn't live with my BPD and bipolar type one w psychotic features. my mom threw my meds out and I relapsed after 1 month of sobriety after the psych ward. if she didn't throw them out id probably still be sober because they were working but when she threw them out the antipsychotic, gabapentin, and antidepressant withdrawal would've made me kill myself so I relapsed so I could regain my sanity. I was hallucinating and acting strange after I quit. it's like the psychosis they were suppressing it got more intense for me than my normal psychosis.

if you want my advice to stay sober; get naltrexone. it's a powerful opioid blocker and it stays in the system for 7 days. when you use it it won't let you get high for 7 days which is long enough to curb momentarily cravings. 
without it, I'd never would've quit fentanyl I had a 20 fentanyl laced perc a day habit. I was selling them to maintain it making no money for myself. the naltrexone saved my life it would've killed me. it made the withdrawals worse but they subsided faster and stopped relapse and prevented me from getting high.

also I want you to remember this phrase; when dealing with post acute withdrawals symptoms or pain relating to BPD or the PAWS. tell yourself ""this too shall pass"" it's supposed to remind you that the feelings and cravings and pain are temporary and they will eventually pass.

another thing is if you do relapse use kratom. I don't recommend relapsing but don't go back to heroin. kratom is legal and overdose on it is practically impossible unless you mix it with other depressants or opioids. it's a lesser evil and much better than going back to heroin. now don't do this unless you basically are 100 percent gonna relapse.

you will be okay you got this you're much stronger than me if you could make it 5 months you can make it years homie :)

my advice comes from 7 year long opioid addiction and I hope all the stuff I learned can help you too.

I hope one day to strive to be like you I'm really jealous and proud at the same time!!",Diligent-Leg3625,x6mvox

20449,"Sorting it the fuck out. I had felt that demon dwelling and growing inside me from about the time I started going to school and that demon broke out and that demon almost ruined my fucking life. Honestly, scariest thing I ever did was letting that thing out but at that point, it was stronger. Since then, I have gotten so good at just sitting and listening to myself. Not just the initial feeling. But I fucking drilled and basically interrogated the shit out of myself and all those feelings and muffled and incoherent voices. Eventually, I actually found that there was so much I hadn't done for myself and since then, whenever I start to feel that demon, I ask it ""what do i need to be doing for myself? What do I need to be doing to ease your suffering"" and before long, after going through a couple short lives stages, I know what I need to do and I figure out how to incorporate it. And oh my god, I don't feel a demon anymore. I mean, I still feel like is something vicious in there, but it's not evil. It's just learning and accepting and integrating. Me to it and it to me.

I tried therapy, I tried a medication, I even tried going completely numb. I tried some risky behaviors and I've tried vaping and all I do now is smoke weed and occasionally drink alcohol. But I am making strong relationships and actually starting to do things in my life again that felt good. And it's because the things I'm doing are actually the things I want to be doing, not just the things I'm convincing myself I want to be doing. If you have one wish, what would you use it on? 10 seconds and it expires. Right now, what do you want? In one year time, given the wish again, you may have a different wish as time has passed and you've gained a new perspective. Find what you wish to be doing and just figure out how to make it happen. But make sure wits coming form somewhere that feels good overall and not just at the moment. Figure out what feels like a healthy choice not to cope with something and not to prove something to yourself, but to just enjoy yourself as a human in this world with a duck to give about how you appear to yourself. Give yourself one day if just pick something and go do it and learn what is good and learn what you think is good but is actually just coping. Wreckless behavior isn't the option. It never was. You might think that you don't view yourself as being the center of everything, but ultimately this wild behavior is that in disguise. Sit down with yourself. And I mean, really sit down with yourself and tune everything out and learn what you can do better. Impatient while driving and deciding to speed or closely follow people, take a moment say to yourself ""what the fuck are you doing? Get your ass to a better speed and give him some damn space"" and then do it and delete the urge to just fall back in, tell yourself this is an achievement that you are simply being in a more stable spot of the road.

Do that with everything. Learn where the healthy spot is and tell yourself where it is once you know where it is. It's a vicious fight learning to control that demon, but eventually you can coexist with it not as a demon, but as a friend and as something that you both understand and feels understands you. Be the demon as much as the demon will be you and that middle ground that is healthy will be found it created.",AppropriateKale8877,14x9qyr

He was accused of drug seeking or not taking things seriously. His med provider actually decided to not renew his meds because he missed an appointment while caring for me (I had miscarried and it sent my health into a cascade of problems, including vomiting episodes that would last for hours and that doctors were too busy with covid patients to really help me with, and so he would default to standby to caregiver mode while I was effectively incapacitated).

Thing is... That med provider was also mine. And I had gotten him into the clinic, because it had been working for me pre-covid.

Once my health stabilized again, I ended up appointed as a patient advocate on the clinic groups community advisory board. I listened to the other patients also having issues with med providers being vindictive or punishing them for missing appointments, and I went off (as politely and skillfully as I could) pointing out how these obstacles are discriminatory against people seeking help, created unnecessary obstacles, etc.

We were able to get policy changes enacted because of this. 

I bring all this up to suggest that, if you are able to, try and push back next time you speak to your therapist. Others have commented on how well (or not) this treatment works for BPD, so do what research you can for the treatment you want, and if you can, advocate for yourself on what you need/want - this is a partnership, they are your care team, they are supposed to help you, not dismiss you. If possible, see if you can bring someone you trust with you to help (whether that's helping you regulate, supporting you, or simply as witness). If those are not options or do not work, try to get a second opinion, and if that's not an option, remember your therapist likely has a manager you could try to speak to about concerns or issues with the care you're receiving. 

Remember that you do have the right to decent care, and to be treated like a person (not just as your dx). There is a lot of stigma with this, and there are mental health professionals that do detriment to their patients because of their own shitty biases. That is not fair or right, and you do not deserve it.

We all, regardless of our diagnoses, deserve proper care, and to have a say in what that care looks like.",LiminalEntity,1943m5i

 SSRIs I am okay with being bashed, since they have nasty side effects that may be permanent and they are prescribed because they are cheap.

But there are other meds. I use bupropion (wellbutrin/voxra) for like three years and it gives me energy (to varying degrees ofc, I also shift between 150 mg and 300 mg over longer periods of time) and it takes less time for me to get out of bed with it. It can also help you lose weight and quit smoking. I also use brintellix and I thought that it's not helping me because I was doing okay, but when we lowered the dose for a while my mood floored so for now I am using that even though it is pretty expensive.

I wish there was more research about the mechanic by which some things helps one group of people with depression and not others.

Long story short, I'm almost through withdrawal (ü§¢ü§Æü§¢) and doing better than I have in YEARS.

People don't understand. They seem to think we should be able to live in today's toxic environment and if we can't, we need to be medicated. 
 I've noticed a bad side effect is with so many people acting like showing any outbursts, regardless of the fact one has a disorder that makes it hard to dismiss fact over fantasy or believe anyone is bigger and better than us for being hypercritical and mad to us or gaslighting us, they don't get that we have been tempered to the point we are numb to BS most of the time.

It is like getting dietary tips from a young person that are only ""eat less, work out more"" which everybody already knows and it is condescending to think that people have not already considered that and are in need for more detailed plan to try out next (my weight stagnated when I ate one meal a day / did IF, where as if you eat regularly through out the day your body will not sabotage you as much at least).

At the beginning I said I was against meds before starting them. That is some 10 years. I talked and talked about everything but it alone did not help me. So can you even imagine how it feels when someone tells you to not use meds in general after knowing that?

If you‚Äôre not taking medication at all, then you‚Äôre probably smoking too high of a THC percentage for your body. It used to be the highest percentage was like 5% which was solid for most people. But with cannabis becoming legally cultivated in many states, the highest you can get is up in the double digits, commonly 20%.

They are also very interesting, mainly speaking here about magic mushrooms and such. You read about how one time taking them cured people's lifelong issues etc, it's alluring and makes you want to experience it, especially if you have felt hopeless your whole life, having something like BPD

I definitely agree with you but have no experiences with drugs at all. I could also imagine myself giving in to taking them if I got offered while feeling hopeless or depressed. I've had very little contact with drugs and only got offered a few times.
 
I got drunk once for the first time out of curiosity at the age of 27. I did it at home with no company because I didn't know how I would react to it. It turned out to affect me motorically but didn't alter my mood or thinking at all. After an hour I got sick and started vomiting and then just went to bed.

I'm afraid of getting addicted, stupid ideas when I'm high or bad side effects so I'm afraid to try stronger drugs. 

Sometimes I get high but I have no idea why and it's usually a great feeling because everything becomes really funny to me. A few times I had moments of sadness during it. I don't take any meds or substances that could cause this and I'm glad that it rarely happens because I can't control when it happens or for how long it will last but usually goes on for several hours. I also loose a lot of control over myself and once had been sitting at work talking with a client laughing my ass off on the telephone and they didn't know what was going on. Luckily I had no bad consequences form it happening but could definitely see it happen some day. I also don't know how I would behave if I get like that during a phase of anger or paranoia because I already stop thinking rationally during that.

22927,"The technique you're describing sounds vaguely like EMDR. I do think normalizing these feelings is a strategy that's worked, some what. 

As far as the actual insecurity, I'd say it's a feeling that I'm unable and incapable of satisfying my partner. This comes in conjunction with being told the opposite over and over again, however for some reason, my mind seeks to narrativize a way how I'm being lied to and taken advantage of. In this, I've created a fantasy where my partner is  doing this with someone specific in their life--an old partner, for context of my current relationship--and this has been building as a pattern for years prior to my current relationship. It's essentially a cuckholding fantasy, that has overwhelmingly become one of the only ways I feel sexually satisfied, in a fantasy sense, but is rooted in this idea that I'm fatally inadequate. It's a masochist thing, but I don't enjoy it. I'd much rather find a way to love myself, even flawed, and believe I'm good enough. Especially when partners tell me to my face. 

I should probably clarify that what I mean by ""sex solely for me,"" was more meant in terms of sex for my own pleasure. For so long I've just completely pushed that thought out of my head. Sex is about performing so my partner can climax, and the better I've made them feel, the better the sex is. I forgot that in that, you are supposed to enjoy it on some level too. I mostly just get anxious about not being enough. 

Tantric is definitely interesting! I'd like to get a handle on my obsessive masochism before I explore some of these things. I got into some light BDSM with my current partner and some of it was amazing, but then I realized how much it was tied to her past and I freaked out. I've since then leveled off-- because like you said the pain became so great at one point that it sort of numbed itself and lost the magic. I also saw how hurtful I was being to my partner as I struggled through the chaotic mess of untangling my insecurities and paranoia, while feeling bad that I breached trust to satisfy my masochistic fetish.

22999,"Generally speaking:  
BP (Bipolar) has 3 (4) types, 1, 2, cyclothymic (""minor""), and ""drug-onduced"".  
Symptoms are mania (being really up/happy) and depression (being really down/sad) so much that it impacts your life in a bad way. And having these moods cycle regularly over a longer period - weeks/months.  
In general, feeling really up or really down over significant length of time despite things that happened in a person's life.

BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) has no types/degrees, but sets of symptoms.  
Symptoms are fear of abandonment, unstable relationships due to sudden shifts between idealization and beloved disconnect from the other person, loss of sense of self-identification, rapid change in self-identity, disassociation that can last up to hours, sudden and major impulsive behavior, suicidal thoughts due to fear of rejection, mood shifts that last for days, continual feelings of emptiness, and/or inappropriate intense feelings (typically anger).  
In general, a complete lack of emotional and psychological regulation.

In comparison, both have inappropriate moves based off of their circumstances but these mood swings last longer in bipolar.

In contrast, those with ~~borderline~~ *bipolar* are quite stable, and those with borderline not only deal with a wider range of inappropriate *emotions*.

That's not true. Bipolar does respond well to medication, but it's not like that makes the disorder go away. Most medications for bipolar cause ongoing side effects, which range from the chance of kidney failure to cognitive decline. People with bipolar still have symptoms and effects between episodes, and that includes cognitive issues. It's also quite hard to treat bipolar depression, since normal antidepressants don't work for it.",roboraptor3000,prt1q1

what you need is an MAOA inhibitor, that is moclobemide if you live in Europe and tranylcypromine if you live in States (moclo and tranyl have comparable preference for MAOA whereas phenelzine and isocarboxazide have bigger preference for MAOB which people with bpd don't need an inhibition of based on my research).

next you need MOR opioid agonist, I don't feel like dwelling into science behind this, PM me if you need more info, but what you need is tianeptine (Stablon).

MAOIs can't be combined with stimulants, yet I'm on ritalin + moclo with zero adverse effects. Also studies support the safety profile of MAOIs being combined with stimulants, TCAs or even SSRIs. The only thing you should be careful about are serotonin release agents (MDMA).

My doc is a godsent, open minded about different treatment for bpd than lamictal + ssri (neither worked).

it's really frustrating to know of regimen with a strong potential to alleviate suffering of many people and being unable to change course of mainstream pharmacological treatment.

i am not a doctor. i've read around 1000~ papers on psychopharmacology, biochemistry and psychiatry of bpd and all medications i've come up with are based on research. i myself am suprised a bit meds i insisted my doc to prescribe me actually work for me.

if you can urge one medication with a bpd diagnosis, i think you should be adamant about MAOAI, I have a goddamn paper conclusively proving ppl with bpd have hyperactive MAO A, simply put that means your brain makes a lot of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline, you feel good a few days and than your MAO slowly methylates all of these, leaving you depressed, until the production of catecholamines overrun their destruction by MAO A and you feel better again.

And the info about MAO methylating everything after a few days made my jaw drop. It's just a normal part of life to realize I only have short bursts if feeling happy and normal that I stop questioning it after a while. Maybe I'll see what my psychiatrist says about some of this, but I doubt he'll help much.

***Long answer:*** Idk about precise brain mechanisms, but I've heard a ton of times and read in science papers (I literally can't find them now or they were written in my native language) that the problem with long-term Adderall and Ritalin usage in ADHD patients is that over time these meds affect the limbic system, the amygdala and probably many other areas of the brain. They do it in a way that patients describe their mental state as ""being robotic"", ""not caring about others"" or ""making decisions on a whim, not caring about consequences"" (= being impulsive).

*Ofc this is what I remember, I don't want to spread misinformation! Maybe* ***Dr. Russel Barkley (pioneer ADHD researcher)*** *has mentioned this issue in one of his lectures on YouTube. (E.g. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SCAGc-rkIfo)*

I usually behave like a ""chameleon"": I analyze ppl, their ideologies, what they wanna hear etc. and *if* I want sthg. from them, I act according to these observations. I don't usually smile or cry. I don't sleep much. I engage in a lot of criminal activities, because I always feel some kinda ""vibration"" in my brain that ""tells"" me to do crazy, life-threating stuff, and I also get bored very easily. I always need something wild happening.

I first began to have better concentration skills when I was about to graduate secondary school and started using. Then I wanted to feel euphoric, used higher doses and reduced my anxiety with alprazolam. Paradoxically, at first stims made me *more* empathetic.

I'm a poliaddict, so sometimes I stop amph. for a week or so to use interfering substances - in these occasions, I do regain my ""original self"" for a while and my excrutiating feelings when ""I regret everything I've done"" and almost start to have a faith in...well, in what the New Testament says. I experience the same borderline PD symptoms which I did before the addiction started - and I don't like them at all. So I return back to my stimulants. (Also because I have an ADHD diagnosis too and I'm a stimulant addict.)

The anxiety attacks would cause me to get sick involuntarily. Eventually doctors diagnosed me with IBS triggered by a major panic disorder. !<

>!My mother, being a reasonably good one, got me into therapy, who recommended pills. Cue almost 7 years of being on one pill and six to eight pills to mitigate the side effects of that one pill. Right during a crucial period of my neurological development, too. I came to the dawning realization I was being overmedicated at 12, and she had been actively trying to force me off all the pills for about 2-3 years before that. I've had almost every major antipsychotic they could prescribe between 2001 and 2008. I've suffered almost every side effect and in many senses, suffered the symptoms of every major mental disorder at one point or another. !<

>!At that point of brief clarity, they were trying to diagnose me with antisocial personality disorder (caused by a side effect of one of the pills removing all fear again, zoloft I think). !<

>!As I said, she wanted me off before then, but the therapist had me convinced the pills were all I had to keep me from going to that hell of constant sickness. !<

>!With her backing me, we finally got them to pull me off of all the pills. I took a very small amount of lexapro (my fear had transitioned into a fear of pills) for awhile when the panic attacks started coming back, but as I learned to cope with them from an actually very helpful therapist (who would move to new york, because of course), I found I didn't even need that. !<

>!But I'm positive, those pills fucked with my brain. This last therapist was the one who got me diagnosed with BPD. Said everything they tried to convince me I had except the panic disorder was a bunch of made up bullshit going off of symptoms of antipsychotics forced on a six year old. She also tried to convince me the pills weren't the cause, but that I'd had symptoms all along, only the diagnosis got missed likely due to all the pills. I read into it eventually, and became extremely angry to learn that many of these so called healthcare professionals were prescribing antipsychotics to win bonuses and free vacation trips. At one point I was on risperadol, and did get a little money out of that settlement because I did suffer some hormonal consequences of it, and I was put on it when I was very young. !<

>!The BPD and sometimes panic attacks are all that remain. But I don't really know if I trust the therapist in saying that it wasn't the pills which messed my brain up so badly I can't get over certain shit. Of course, I haven't been back to any therapists for a second opinion.!<",Elceepo,xf1gdf

There is no real regulation of antipsychotics until it's been proven to have lasting and very harmful side effects (three of mine were, but I didn't qualify for compensation since I didn't develop the physical symptoms associated with it).

A lot of antipsychotics are unfortunately incentivized by money and pushed before proper testing has been taken to assure parents of any long term side effects.

This is the world private insurance has brought us to- pharmaceutical companies are as much a for-profit business as your cereal conglomerate. Only instead of potential dental or obesity related issues, you're left with mood disorders and hormone regulation issues.

Imagine being a parent who seeks help, or seeking help yourself, only to have a licensed psychologist pedal drugs a large company sent them to the Bahamas to prescribe.

As much as I'm aware there are probably drugs out there which would help me regulate, I would simply rather force myself to improve on my own.

So e.g. I found 150mg XR was optimum as a mood stabiliser and sleep med taken long-term, but it took 300-400mg to bring me down from bipolar mania. Meanwhile, a friend who's even more bipolar than me has to take 300mg for the mood effects and 600-700mg during manic episodes, and another friend was on 100mg for BPD and that was more than enough. So 50mg might just be the sweet spot for you; the lowest effective dose IMO is the best, especially with quetiapine's side-effect profile.

Curiously, my bff once took way too many psychedelics at once and had a bad trip, and 100mg instant release killed it swiftly to the point of calmly falling asleep after 90 mins. Just to put into context how strong quetiapine actually is lol.",TheLastHayley,ok82uo

25980,"The top comment already explains that its an antipsychotic, BUT.
Seroquel can raise blood sugar levels. If you have a risk of developing diabetes, you may want to talk to your doctor about trying a different medication, and possibly get your blood sugar tested to make sure you haven't gone into the diabetic blood sugar range. I took seroquel xr at night to assist sleep and had the 25mg tablets as a PRN for dissociative episodes, but I was taken off of it when the doctors said I was in the diabetic blood sugar range.
I've also been taking metformin, and I'm on two stimulants (one for narcolepsy, the other for ADHD) which can suppress the appetite, so I have other things assisting it, but. Once I stopped seroquel, I started losing weight. Plus I was having symptoms of Tardive Dyskinesia and within two weeks after stopping seroquel I didn't experience any symptoms.

TL;DR seroquel can be helpful but it also has a lot of adverse effects. If the adverse effects are impacting you negatively to the point that it's becoming a problem to you, you should probably find a different medication.",KlausJaphet,pgmkdz

28171,"Disclaimer: This IS NOT medical advice. I am not a licensed professional, just someone very invested in the treatment of my own mental health. 

There isn‚Äôt very solid evidence for lamotrigine helping with BPD mood swings. It‚Äôs used to keep bipolar swings stable. It‚Äôs because a big part of bipolar disorder is neurochemical. For example, lithium blocks sodium which seems to have some affect on mania. Researchers are unsure what lamotrigine affects but it is also hypothesized to be sodium. Something like BPD has much less to do with sodium or serotonin levels. This is why typical bipolar and unipolar depression medication seems to have limited effect.

From that study:
> Between July 2013 and October 2015 we randomised 276 participants, of whom 195 (70.6%) were followed up 52 weeks later. At 52 weeks, 49 (36%) of those participants prescribed lamotrigine and 58 (42%) of those prescribed placebo were taking it. At 52 weeks, the mean total ZAN-BPD score was 11.3 [standard deviation (SD) 6.6] among those participants randomised to lamotrigine and 11.5 (SD 7.7) among those participants randomised to placebo (adjusted mean difference 0.1, 95% CI -1.8 to 2.0; p = 0.91). *No statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes were seen at any time. Adjusted costs of direct care for those prescribed lamotrigine were similar to those prescribed placebo.*

TLDR: there is very limited evidence that a mood stabilizer like lamotrigine has any effect on BPD symptoms. To quote my psychiatrist‚Äôs notes, medication is, ‚Äúhighly secondary‚Äù in treatment of BPD. I was prescribed it for bipolar disorder. DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) is the gold standard for BPD and has the most evidence behind it.

If you‚Äôve had depressive episodes or (hypo)mania (meaning you have had an elevated mood *state* lasting for four days or more) you should consult a psychiatrist. It‚Äôs possible you have co-occurring bipolar.

ignore them as much as you can. people like them are looking for validation and to be classified as ""one of the good ones"" by people who have BPD and people who don't have it. they aren't part of your care team and they cannot invalidate/revoke a diagnosis from an actual healthcare provider based on reddit posts.",planet-ley,121oj3s

28739,"I went and checked (im in the uk BTW) and no resource I could find from our health service said it couldn't be diagnosed, just that it had to be assessed and diagnosed specifically by the children and adolescent mental health service rather than the adult one.

The only either criteria I can see here is that the symptoms have to have been present for a year.

Maybe im wrong, but I'm inclined to believe the poster, that wherever they are, yes they are diagnosed.

Edit: also worth mentioning the most recent ICD (which my country hasn't incorporated yet) abolishes the distinction between specific types of personality disorder, there is only personality disorder mild/moderate/severe. They can add borderline type as a note. But that's it.

And by permanent/scary, i mean that professionals shouldn‚Äôt see it as a ‚Äúforever stuck/sick‚Äù diagnosis or a ‚Äúimpossible to mistake‚Äù diagnosis as they currently do.

They don‚Äôt have treatment for BPD as an illness, but they can treat the symptoms. I was misdiagnosed with Bipolar for years because my mental and physical symptoms matched Bipolar 1, but then I got a new therapist that noticed the other BPD symptoms (abandonment, splitting, etc). Before my correct diagnosis, I thought my splitting episodes were mood swings. This year, I was officially undiagnosed from Bipolar 1 because my psychiatrist said my mood swings change within minutes, which is too fast for Bipolar. 

I‚Äôm on Lithium for mania, Trileptal for depression and suicidal ideation (LIFE CHANGER, if I had to choose between all 3 I‚Äôd pick this one; some people take it for mania though) and Seroquel for psychosis/insomnia. Maybe you could explain it in that way?",fuckkkali,1c8bvzy

I guess I always believed them when they said that meds don‚Äòt really do much, I‚Äòve been on Escitalopram and Wellbutrin because of my depressive episodes but they didn‚Äòt really do that much.

I started lithium when I was hospitalized and first diagnosed with BPD for mood stabilization and for SI, the first three or four days was awesome, no SI, not even passive. Then I was released and still maintaining my medications and my SI eventually got higher, more intense and difficult to manage as it had before I had first been admitted.

It‚Äôs so disheartening when you start realizing how uninformed these doctors are about personality disorders, but don‚Äôt let that discourage you - bring in your own research and connect the dots for them (like the similar symptoms between BPD and Bipolar), they need the help lol

I know that every medication is different for everyone, but I really recommend Trileptal for depression. I have been on it for about 3 years and didn‚Äôt realize how much of a difference it made until I went off all my meds in 2022, landed in the psych ward, and they had to add it back one by one. I felt no real difference with my depression, even though Lithium took away my suicidal ideations (that‚Äôs how I learned that they don‚Äôt always come together). My 2nd week at the psych ward, a nurse asked me to list ALL the medications I could remember that I‚Äôve been on because I kept saying there‚Äôs one missing, and I remembered this one. The change was noticeable in like less than a month I would say, overestimating. I got out of the hospital the next week, feeling more neutral but not better but I remember that episode so vividly because it was new year‚Äôs and they had to drag me to the family dinner but by my birthday around mid-January, I made plans and went out with my friends! I had been saying in the months before my birthday that I didn‚Äôt want anything for my birthday - not even wishes! How did everyone miss that‚Ä¶

He gave me the clonazepam because the Wellbutrin was spiking my anxiety so much and I refuse to take any medication that would make me gain weight (I was on celexa and olanzipine for a while and I ballooned up to 200 pounds)",luvhley25,zbm5zs

29227,"He‚Äôs actually really awesome. The only one who makes me feel heard. My old doc just kept upping the Wellbutrin when I would cry to her, literally be in tears, and say I‚Äôm so anxious all the time that I developed a stutter and huge fear of other people, so she finally caved and gave me a baby dose of Xanax to be used as needed. When that was everyday because I was in crisis she got mad so I went back to my PC doc and he gave me the colanzepam for daily usage.

He actually diagnosed me with ADHD after coming to him with concerns about my cognitive function while at work and school, and mainly my never ending fatigue even though I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin, and he actually validated my feelings and gave me meds.

So he actually listens to me and is willing to try things unlike most doctors. I was exaggerating the mob doctor thing, but possibly not the sleeping with me thing, that I‚Äôm still unsure of",luvhley25,zbm5zs

29231,"Yep exactly!!!! Even thought most times I can ‚Äúhold a job‚Äù although that is out of self preservation from past trauma rather than mental stability, he looks beyond that to how I actually feel and my quality of life.

Many doctors in the past left me hanging in the wind and I‚Äôm so mad it took me this long to find someone willing to help me achieve a peaceful life",luvhley25,zbm5zs

Is it possible to go to someone else? Is this a psych or a PC? If it‚Äôs a psych honestly try going to your regular doctor, they‚Äôre generally more willing to give out meds of any kind",luvhley25,zbm5zs

Something in me just clicked that if this is what happens when I hard stop it is doing a lot more to me than I realize. I titrated off from there taking out one or two little pellets a day for ~2 months (no shakes, much better üëç)


In hindsight it didn't let me feel angry or sad. Like those (and probably other) emotions were just blocked. I've been off of it for 2 years now, and I'm just getting back to the point where I feel like I'm back in touch with my emotions.

29314,"Well, there are no meds specifically made for treating bpd so we usually get antidepressants or antipsychotics, with varying levels of effectiveness.

Right now I'm taking paroxetine, which is an antidepressants and I've been taking it for quite a while. I don't really like it because it fucks with literally everything in your body and if you take more than like 10mg you get horrible constipation and other great stuff like a complete inability to orgasm. The reason I still take it is because the withdrawal is so incredibly painful that I'm basically forced to take it. 

 I used to take quite a lot of seroquel, which is an antipsychotic and univerally hated by the entire bpd community for its massive weight gain side effect. I also suffer memory loss because of this drug. Stay away from this one unless you want to turn into a fat zombie with anmesia. 

Sometimes I take carbamazepine, which is usually used to treat people with seizures but its also prescribed to manage manic depression. I hate carbamazepine because it never works for me. Also apparently, according to my psychiatrist, if you get pregnant and give birth while on this drug theres a big chance your child will have spina bifida. 

The first med I was ever prescribed was risperodone, which is an antipsychotic and usually prescribed for shizophrenia. It did make a difference but I'm pretty sure it gave me literal brain damage. I didn't help that I was just 17 when it was prescribed to me.",AnxiousShallot,fhx9h5

I wouldn't mind an antipsychotic or mood stabilizer, but don't want memory problems or feelings like a zombie. Still working on DBT now anyway",,fhx9h5
29317,"I've been on Paroxetine too, it was horrible. I had the worst and most realistic nightmares daily. Can also confirm the no orgasm part. After a while it didn't work that well anymore either.

Like totally uncontrollable, it just comes out, like a 'NYAH' or a 'SCHLEB' or a 'NNNNN'  because I guess the thought was too overwhelming? Sometimes I shiver or shrug or move my neck weird when the memory hits, alongside a weird sound.  literally have no control over it, and people think it's just me being weird for the sake of being weird.

Ah yes! Occasionally the sound makes a word like 'Nope' or 'Why'  or even 'Hi!' 'Hello!'. Its so strange and I never made the connection between the behaviour and bpd/trauma...

so I'm pretty sure my liver was used to ""working overtime"", and that night I was so sad I forgot that, thankfully, otherwise I wouldn't be here writting this, checking out memes, watching the 3rd season of Travelers, I wouldn't have discovered that my crush actually liked me, I wouldn't have found my passion (singing, I use to study engineering).

I also take drugs but I wouldn't consider it substance abuse. I take weed about once a week mostly for fun and mushrooms or LSD to meditate like twice a week for therapeutic purposes. 

What I used to do before, was to take N2O (laughing gas) to get rid of the pain in my body when I was too stressed and could no longer endure it. It would quiet everything down and give me like a 15 minute break of feeling stressed or pain. That was usually enough to get into a better mental state than before.

If coke is your thing, do you, but get fent test strips PLEASE. DONT MIX COKE AND DOWNERS, I don't advise mixing coke with alcohol either but that's safer than most any other alcohol mix.

Do not snort your Benzo script, it's not water soluble. Never mix Benzos with alcohol I've had two friends die this way at relatively low doses. Do not mix benzos and Opiates and do not mix Opiates and Alcohol. These 3 are pretty much a suicide high when mixing. I know we all have suicidal ideations but let's just let our drug use be limited to an escape or a good dose of dopamine.

Now I know we are all depressed and this is my personal DOC it's the only hard drug I use anymore and sparingly at that. Ketamine.

Ketamine is the fucking shit, 90% of the time it comes in a HCL base so no worries of fent contamination as it'll all be little chunks that look like salt. And it helps (atleast me here everyone is different) with my depression. For like atleast a week to a month at a time.

When I abuse drugs a lot of my symptoms aren't prevalent I just suppress everything, dissociate, and kind of auto pilot.

I've been sober from most everything for almost 5 years now. I just stopped smoking weed daily 2 months ago and it made my bpd a LOT worse but I'm back to processing emotions even though it's too many and I don't process in a healthy or normal way. I'm getting there and I'm trying. But in the last 5 years of quitting most drugs I have kept a small amount of K at all times and save it for emergency reasons when the depression gets really bad.",DroppinCid,tjbk7h
31244,"Your comment gave me a feeling of familiarity (I'm also a chronic addict to anything as you've put it) that's why I asked about the job. 

I know you can work while being high with almost anything (hell I even took 100ug of acid and still did my job without anyone noticing), but I always split on my job after about 6 month or so, go on a 3-4 days of stimulants (usually amphetamine) binge missing work and then go to work looking like a truck ran me over and I tell them I have to quit because my mom got into an accident and I have to take care of her; they take one look at me and let me go without the 2 weeks notice.

This exact situation happened 3 times already and now I can't even find a job anymore which isn't a call center. 

Anyway, have a good day!",8ball97,tjbk7h
31245,"Shit I kind of feel that. I normally don't keep a job super long. I don't have a degree or any certs. The longest I've had a job is about 2 years with 2 different places. One was a smoke shop that I managed so I was autonomous and got to do it how I wanted, which works for me. The other was a mortgage company and I just had pretty much one function and I'd just zone out and do my thing on the computer all day then go home.

Best I can say is either keep trying to improve, I know we all try here. And just do the best you can without sacrificing your own mental health further.",DroppinCid,tjbk7h
31246,"I am currently looking for a remote job that doesn't involve being in calls all day. I never worked from home and I really think this is the answer. So many advantages come with working from home, especially for people with mental health issues.

FUCKING LISTEN TO IT. Even if you don't die (which is possible with that combo), you will fuck yourself up in an epic way that you won't realize at the time or remember the next day.

Fixing something like this, at least from a neuropsychiatric perspective would require lots of neural connection remodelling. Spending time in lots of original social situations with all kinds of people along with SSRIs to numb spikes & outbursts on both ends of the spectrum would help.

Or at least that's what I'm doing. A year in on my little self-experiment and I think I've got appreciable results.

Remember that adage, self-help is the best help? Well I took it literally & made it, self-therapy is the best therapy.

I used to drive around in a bus for an hour or so to calm down (had a ticket I could use as often as I wanted to) or I would go to the big park in the city I lived to walk up a hill there and look at the stars to calm down from suicidal thoughts etc. If I wasn't that bad these situations could've almost been romantic... but no, it usually ended with a lot of crying or sometimes calling my therapist if I wasn't able to calm down.

Remembering things like these makes it really hard for me to acknowledge that I'm not doing great at the moment bc I am not as bad as I was some years ago. Weird shit.

He changed networks and the new doctor at the time didn't want to continue that for fear of ""addiction and abuse"" even though that was never an issue for me with xanax and no evidence of that for the time it was prescribed. 

Now I drink all the fucking time to quiet down the anxiety spirals but it's making me so much more depressed and causing more anxiety and general life problems, it's fucking terrible and I hate it. 

It's so weird how medication is viewed, like ""Oh no, we have to be overly cautious and suspicious for things like xanax and adderall because, even though it helps a lot of people, some people *may* abuse it.""

Edit: the 2nd one doesn't even say that the 2 girls that OD'd snorted xanax, only that they sniffed opanas and then ""ingested"" benzos. Of course mixing heavy opiates with benzos is dangerous, not due to ROA of the benzos though.",PastalaVista666,bw1q5r

Some antipsychotics make you feel like a zombie, others make you feel like you could kill someone and not feel a thing, a few make you feel like you're drunk 24/7, some make you puke and a select few make you feel at what's considered stable levels.

Virtually none of them actually made me feel alright, and most of them had side effects the doctors just prescribed more meds to fix. I was twelve when I made the choice to withdraw altogether and try to find different coping mechanisms and some sort of self-acceptance. I'm glad I did,  because I'm reasonably convinced that being put on such actually pretty hard drugs at such a young age is why I've got BPD. I'm thankful my mother had the foresight to at least force them to take me off of the ones that made me feel sociopathic. Edit: don't remember much, but she's told me some horror stories 

It's not for everyone, and extreme cases definitely need the ol' lithium drip until they stabilize. But while I can't say I've exactly become normal, I can say I at least function most of the time.",Elceepo,vpxxfn

I wanna point out again I am not advocating that people withdraw from their medications, because as in your case they can at the very least provide beneficial change.

32604,"Tbh, I have a theory. So, for a long time, I sh for control. It was a pain that *I* controlled, no one else. (I was raised in a cult. Sh was sadly my only actual reality check), then, I got married to a wonderful man (it'll be 18 years this October!! I can't believe how lucky I am and I'll brag about him all day if I don't stop here lol ü§£), and things changed and still are the longer I'm away from my family, and sticking with therapy, but one example is I used to be the world's lightest sleeper, but within about 2 years, I started sleeping heavier until I was actually sleeping deeply regularly. Now, I did and do need help to sleep (Delta 8 and fellow derivatives are a godsend I stg), but my husband noticed, and that's when it all started to make sense. (Also, insert obligatory offensive adjectives about format and being on mobile, here.) But the more things came together, the worse I became, mentally. It would take a few more years before I began to sh again, but this was different. I would get into these breakdowns, spirals, and more, where your head is so loud you can't even form a single thought. It's like every noise and sound to exist was going off in my head. One time, I grabbed..a sharp item (coughcough), and after, I was instantly calm. I could think. The noise was all gone. What I'd done, the feeling made my head clear, and brought clarity and calm, and I'd feel horrible for doing it, but to me, what were the other options? Luckily, I did find other options, and I'm sh free for....a year, maybe a year and a half ish. Therapy, medication, and the look in my husband's eyes when he noticed my uh, newest bodily uh...marks (I'm trying to be delicate, I don't want a mod to slap me üò®üò≠), all helped. I won't tell you to stop because i get it. I really do. But I'd encourage you to seek other options. My dms are open if you'd like me to list out what has worked for me. Or, I could just list them out here if others want to know. But marks or no, you're a loved person. So very loved, and I'd like to add that I am so proud of you. I know all too well, just how hard it can be, but you're trying and making it through another day. I'm so proud of you. And to anyone else, I'm proud of you all, too. I love this sub so much, and I'm here lurking more often than not, and I see how everyone is struggling, but trying. Even if all they did was get out of bed to use the restroom (and hopefully took their meds, had some food and drank water, but, sometimes that's all an impossible task, and that's okay), then I'm proud of them. Keep trying, my dear friends, and know that someone you don't know, but sees your pain and understands is so absolutely proud of you. (That's me, but I known I'm not the only one, too.) Much love. üíúüíúü•∞ (lmao edit: my theory that I never even put in here, was first, I wanted control, and through therapy, I realized that was correct. Then when I started again when I was older, it was pain. I needed pain, not a lot, but pain is what cleared my head. This was also true, as the pain was the bad version of the cold shower/cold water face splash trick. It shocked my brain, thus forcing it to focus on this new, surprising, and sharp feeling. I don't do cold showers lmao no, but the cold face splash does wonders, really. Or standing barefoot on the cold, damp grass on an autumn night, and staring at the moon as I just feel. Feel the grass. Feel the damp that I don't like, but fck it we ball I guess ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Feel my toes begin to hurt from the chill. The moon, it's glow. Noticing every detail I can. Does it have a halo? Which phase is it in? Where's my favorite star, Betelgeuse? Which constellations can I see? Ooooh....plane or satellite? Favorite game, that one. Stuff like that.or my husband asks me simple questions that force me to think. ""What's the first food you're going to eat after we get you teeth fixed?"", ""Hey, where in space did Abraxos come from?"" (One of my cats, who I stg is a cosmic eldritch horror that chose to be chill AND chaotic. Best boi ‚ô°), ""What's that song you sing when to Jupiter follows you the bathroom?"" (My other cat, also a chaotic space kitty. I have stories about both that are weird and hilarious, if anyone wants to hear them for a laugh), and ""Hey, tell me like, five different food places that sound good, and we'll talk about them and just order in tonight."" I told y'all I was lucky üòÇ. But back to the topic, sorry for the rambling, my meds have kicked in. üòÖ but, I had two reasons for why I did what I did, that were theories upon reflection, and confirmed by my therapist. And that's how I found out about the other tips, tricks, and ""hacks"" that are safer than sh. I've slipped a few times, but my dedication to just find one day of peace and to never see that look in my husband's eyes ever again is what drove me to stop. It's not easy, I know.

To be completely honest too, I stopped taking it without speaking to my doctor, thankfully nothing horrible happened (apart from a long-winded withdrawal as I would take a few a week only to calm my nausea and headaches). DO NOT do this! 

I could definitely see myself going back to medication at some point, I think it's a decision that's very personal and comes down to who you are as a person.

(Pretty long ass post ahead and I‚Äôm sorry for that üò≠)

I used to go from feeling like I was on top of the world and had so much motivation to do things, down to rock bottom and suicidal every 30-60 seconds, for no reason, no exaggeration. Not to mention the constant splitting on people for even the *slightest* thing that caused me to ruin so many friendships with people I really did care about. Plus, the horrific anger. I‚Äôm normally *not* an angry person, but I nearly broke my drawing hand two different times due to punching walls. I didn‚Äôt, but I did cause permanent damage to my pinky knuckle. Didn‚Äôt know for years though due to having no insurance.

When I finally got to see a *good* psychiatrist though, and he put me on Lamictal? Nearly all of that is gone. I‚Äôm still on it, nearly a decade later, and time hasn‚Äôt caused it to lose any effectiveness at all. I don‚Äôt get those mood swings anymore whatsoever unless I miss a dose. I can still switch on people and get that intense anger, but it‚Äôs *so* much rarer *and* milder, and a lot harder to cause.

Now, obviously there are no medications to treat BPD, I want to make that clear for anyone else who may be reading this. But, Lamictal *did* have a huge effect for many of my.. probably most severe BPD symptoms. This is just my specific case though!",SevenZee,12lvxh7

A) use an atypical antidepressant like Wellbutrin either alone or in combination with the SSRI to try and tip the balance in dopamine's favor, or 

B) lower SSRI dose (+A if possible), or 

C) try SNRIs which increase serotonin and norepinephrine OR tricyclics like Desipramine or Nortriptyline which mostly affect NE/DA (+A if possible).

They might give you a propensity to gain weight, but it's not like calories magically appear from thin air or are somehow contained in the anti-depressants. Just check what you eat, eat when you're hungry and don't eat if it's too much of a bother to get up and grab food \*shrug\*

Edit: I've been using many, many, many different anti-depressants and none of them really help with my executive dysfunction at least, but every case is different in that regard at least. As for my BMI it's somewhere between 14 and 17, I can't say for sure.

I don't have an eating disorder as far as I know, I don't starve myself intentionally or purge my stomach (I don't think I've puked in over a decade now, let alone intentionally). I'm just too lazy to eat sometimes. Anti-Depressants won't really have an impact if you watch out for it.

I once blacked out in anger and ripped a cabinet door off its hinges and then took those broken pieces and stabbed a punch of holes into my door. 
Soooo yeah I definitely wasn‚Äôt doing great. I was sooo angry and so irrational when triggered and it was a problem for my relationship and I couldn‚Äôt function or trust myself and I really didn‚Äôt like myself at all. 

Now I can honestly say after being in therapy for years, I have way more self control. I cope healthier ways than I used to. My relationship is healthy and respectful and I don‚Äôt hate myself. My anger is in check and I don‚Äôt get triggered as easily right now. I truly love life and the people I have in it that support me. It can happen and even the worst cases of BPD can end up in remission :,) 


Also, having remission of symptoms doesn‚Äôt mean that it will last forever or that we won‚Äôt have a relapse at all or ever again. It literally just means that I am more in control of my emotions and that I am not behaving irrationally or responding in toxic ways when triggered and I am more stable mentally than I have been in the past. Feelings are still overwhelming at times and I‚Äôm not sure that will change ever but I do know that my response to those overwhelming feelings is so much better now than it used to be.

With cutting edge treatment, BPD *is* one of the most treatable mental health issues on the books. It just requires development of identity. DBT, intensive outpatient services, etc.

All minds need maintenance, all bodies need maintenance. BPD is profoundly environmental. The way it neurpsycologically functions is complex, but essentially that's the wrong way to think about it. There is technically no disease, and no cure, there is no diagnosis that describes more than a spread of loose traits.

What I mean is that it's possible too love and be close too people, to not be suicidal, too be emotionally healthy and calm in the long-term, to not be emotionally reactive, too not disassociate, too be nonreactive to abandonment, too not exist in a state of constant agony.

BPD is a structure, and one that stems from a lack of identity. It extends into trauma, and through that can do all sorts of harm too the consciousness.

Heal the identity, and you heal the source of the pain.

Heal the trauma, and you have the ability too get close too people again.

>And while therapy can help people overcome the debilitating effects, why do we want so bad to make it seem like something that must go away for a worthy life?

People's lives are already worthy before and after, however as you know BPD sucks ass. Freeing yourself from the haze so you can love and be happy would be absolutely amazing.

I'm going into critical (neuro)psychology, and have spent years putting together this diagnosis.

My BPD stems from years in isolation, abandonment, systematic abandonment,  and a predisposition too emotional reactivity. Specifically this developed proclivity too react too situations where I feel helpless with extreme nervous system states.

I had pure quiet BPD, and existed in a state of abject and complete disassociation, undetectable even too therapists I saw, except when I randomly melted down when I got too close too someone.

It's likely codependant with OSDD, meaning that as I enter these states, I fully loose emotional memories, any sense of time  and enter a shell identity. My borderline and OSDD relate directly.

I have long since debated between qBPD and CPTSD, however the lack of stable identity, and history of unstable relationships seems like a hard tell.

33682,"Thank you for sharing. It's good that you are doing your research. And please don't take this the wrong way, but to me it seems like your understanding of BPD is all based on your opinions and research from biased observations. I am not saying you are or aren't BPD. I genuinely have no idea and am not even thinking about that. But what you have described is not a standard, as there really isn't a standard. Even the 9 criteria look wildly different on people who experience them, as I'm sure you can see based on memes here alone. 

I got diagnosed in 2017, during a crisis by ""the BPD expert"" of my city. I had no idea what BPD was besides the ""crazy ex girlfriend"" trope, and that alone made me incredibly offended to be associated with that. It took me 3 years to give DBT a try, and I did it for a little less than 18 months (which is the maximum time you can do DBT -- complicated healthcare system here but basically you technically can only do it once in your life). I graduated DBT because per what the books were saying, I was doing fine. I had a job, paid my bills on time, had a life partner, was pregnant and my therapist felt I was going to be a good and safe parent, I don't explode on people, I was way less toxic in my interpersonal relationships (I had none left lmao) etc. etc. etc. But me ""graduating"" DBT is based on current societal expectations of what ""doing good"" looks like. I feel like a lot of people with mental illness are forced to view our struggles through a 21st century capitalistic lens. Add to that the many other intersections of oppression/privilege and you get a whole mess. What opened my eyes some time ago was when I read somewhere that apparently a lot of those shamans in traditional cultures have some form of psychosis, many are full on schizophrenic. Yet they are respected members of their societies and are seen as having a ""plus"", instead of a handicap. The way their societies viewed them turned what is considered a disability here, into a positive gift there.

With BPD, of course a lot of people experience objectively harmful behaviours, thought processes and life habits. But a lot of people are just different, and their difference isn't adapted for the culture or current times they live in. That's it. It's a difference in how your brain works, based mostly on trauma, but not even always. Some people with BPD have never experienced trauma yet their brains do the thing lol. So can we really pretend to know exactly what works and what doesn't? If therapy is all about ""being outwardly functional"", is it really recovery or conformity? A lot of autistic people are taking therapies to learn to unmask, and I feel like a lot of PDs could benefit from this kind of shift in the way we view ourselves as well. Many people with BPD are objectively neither good or bad. We're just different. 

TL;DR : Mental illness is not as exact of a science as we want it to be, and I wish we could view it through a human lens and not a rigid academic sense only, when the academic side of things is not precise or often up to date with current realities.",yikkoe,18yf51e

This quote is icky, not gonna lie to you. I just feel like it's a bit of an unfortunate view of mental disorders. Because lots of people with BPD ""have a life"". Have goals. Have active careers. Have manageable or even enjoyable social networks. But they still have BPD. 

Our mental illness is complicated and highly debated. That's why I believe what I believe based on observation, without of course pretending to know better than anyone.

The only difference I guess is I personally have no beef with being seen as mentally ill, but the connotation of it is what I find issue with. Which I guess is also what they have issue with, again just a difference in semantics. All in all, I really wish we didn't see mental illnesses as something that must be gone. Like, I have BPD and it is how my brain is. I was blessed to not deal with overtly harmful behaviours, my harmful thoughts are manageable enough to keep up with current life expectations, and the way I deal with my emotions is objectively okay so I am privileged in that and cannot speak for everyone. But my emotions are not wrong. They may be too much for most people to handle, but they are never wrong. I don't want to get rid of them, and I wish BPD ""recovery"" wasn't all about getting rid of objectively harmless traits. The fact that it gets in the way of keeping a job doesn't mean it's objectively bad lmao it just means jobs and work culture isn't adapted to our brain.

It's such a vast and complex conversation that touches on literally every aspect of human existence. It touches on ableism of course, but also classism, sexism, racism ... list goes on. We would need to dismantle so many systems of oppression, we would need to free ourselves from capitalistic values in order to really allow mental illnesses and neurodivergence to be free of stigma.

33886,"A diagnosis of BPD is largely based on external behavior. Self-harm, desperate attempts to avoid abandonment, relationship difficulties due to black-and-white thinking, impulsivity, things like that. It's possible to make enough progress that those behaviors are no longer the default response to situations that used to trigger them and, when that happens and is sustained for long enough, the diagnosis no longer fits. At that point, it might be better to say that the condition is in remission rather than cured (since it's unfortunately still possible to experience a relapse), but the diagnosis can be, and often is, removed.

Of all the named personality disorders in the DSM-V, BPD has probably the best available evidence for successful treatment methods. While DBT is considered the standard first-line treatment because of its demonstrated efficacy for many (although by no means all) people with BPD, other types of therapy have also been studied to a lesser degree.

Of course, someone who recovers from BPD will virtually always have remaining problems that need treatment, since the condition is so often rooted in trauma. Quality of life is usually greatly improved, though, and other, lingering issues are more easily approached than when you still meet the criteria for BPD.",MadotsukiInTheNexus,17a4mcm

33889,"REWIRING MY BEHAVIOUR!!!

New person has come into my life. 

Old behaviour: sacrifice my wellness to maintain proximity

New behaviour: how am I feeling? I think I‚Äôd like to hang up the phone now & get some sleep. I don‚Äôt want to hang up the phone but I cannot be like everyone else, I cannot make exceptions with boundaries

Old behaviour: Wow I want to be around this person all the time!! Let me do everything to secure more time together!!! I‚Äôll entertain plans with other people less as a result!!!

New behaviour: Actually although that day is sooner & would give us more time together, I actually wanted to do something else that day with my friends & wanted to solidify those plans with them tomorrow, I am okay with not constantly being aware of this person

Old behaviour: I want us to be together forever & I never want you to leave. I want to ability to be around you as much as humanly possible!!

New behaviour: what does developing an fp feel like? How often am I thinking about this person? This is some warning signs of an FP, I think I‚Äôll fill my days with other things & remember that I have more to offer myself than any person will offer me in exchange for my obsession 

Old behaviour: I am not in the mood for sex. I will entertain their sexual advances out of an obligation that does not exist but I feel compelled to 

New behaviour: This feels like something I do not want. I will share this with them & we can exit this situation. Intimacy & affection are nice & can be expressed in ways that I am more willing to participate in. 

Three words basically. Interrogation of self.

You need to know WHY you‚Äôre developing an obsession with people, then recenter yourself because YOU deserve it. Pinpoint the behaviours & rewire yourself. Just start with your thought process. Catch FPs early CATCH THEM EARLY!!!! Distance is okay!! Creating distance between you & a potential or current FP is okay because ultimately refusing to circumvent your actions will just enable you further & you‚Äôll be miserable. WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE TO BE MISERABLE?? YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY

My last FP was a final straw to me, honestly I didn‚Äôt even like them that much. I kinda cringed so hard after it was all over I said ‚Äúnever again‚Äù & I basically police myself to bits (then rebuild!!) 

My self esteem has never been better. I just feel good. Not ecstatic, not fantastic, just good. I can have four moods all day. Sleepy in the morning, happy in the afternoons, sad for an hour or two if something provoked it (hearing bad news for instance).

Best of luck, what works for me might not work for you- but just being soooo difficult with my symptoms until it‚Äôs no longer my default behaviour.

33894,"in my personal experience, one of the things that helped most with my bpd is stability. i was scared for the same reasons. whn i first moved into where i am now i would scream, cry, hit the walls, hit myself, argue with my housemate every day and lament over the fact that i could not get help because i was terrified. i was terrified of who i would be without this mental illness i'd had my entire life. i didnt want to find out who i'd be - what if i was boring, what if i was completely different, what if i didnt know what to do with myself, what if my friends didnt want to be friends with me anymore ?

after a little while, the fact that the people i had around me were 100% not leaving, that my housemate wasnt going to kick me out, even after the 10th friday in a row of me screaming and crying and hiding under the island in the kitchen. my bpd started to get better. the symptoms were presenting less often and less severely.

and its amazing. so much has changed from who i used to be, i didnt know this is who i'd be when i started getting better and it's honestly so relieving and amazing.

looking back at what i used to be like - unhealthy coping mechanisms, intense and aggressive splitting, mood swings, self harm, crying and crying and crying - it feels the other way around now. im cant believe what i used to be like.

it didnt 'cure' me, of course it didn't, but having someone around me who cares and helped me through each step helped SO much.

seeing a therapist regularly and having that stability of having someone who actually knows what they're talking about helping you and seeing you on a regular basis will be so so good for you. you'll have the benefit of the stability and also the fact that. y'know, they're a therapist and can help you train your brain in ways to manage your symptoms, cope, and help yourself.

it is terrifying, i know it is, but i promise you it will be so amazing to go through this and come out the other side.

My last job was with individuals who were lower functioning, and the only ones who struggled with no when it came to touching were living with people who never corrected them about it/defended it.

34147,"Step 1 is accepting personal responsibility for your own actions and your past mistakes. Own your past and make peace with who you were. It won't stop the pain, nor the nightly cringe reliving those memories. It will however start you on the path to being able to improve who you are today. Each day, small things that may seem inconsequential in the grand scheme of things such as simply complementing someone's outfit for no other reason then because you noticed the effort they put into it. It will feel sometimes/ a lot of the time especially at the start that you're simply masquerading as a good person when deep down you see yourself as evil.

But every day that you carry that energy and dedication to improving yourself and the lives of those around builds the character of who you become in the future. It armours you against the self hatred, pain and self destructive tendencies. 

&#x200B;

Eventually, over time, you find that voice inside you telling you you're worthless or the world would be better off without you or that you're a fake who is simply fooling everyone with your pretend good person act gets a little easier to refute. It gets to the point that it's no longer the dominant self belief that you are fundamentally flawed and broken. Merely the equivalent to a scar that was once a wound that was able to heal because you stopped picking at it and focused on taking steps towards healing yourself.

I'm no physician or mental health expert, merely someone who's had that same realisation. Take personal accountability, take steps towards being a better person in whatever ways you can and accept that it is a process you will have to bear the pain of as you heal.

I'd personally recommend cognitive behavioural therapy to help you be able to identify your thought patterns and negative self talk before they cause your mental and emotional state to spiral out of your control. However, we're all different, you can only do what feels right to you. 

At the end of the day, we have to find a way to be able to live with ourselves. So do what you need to do in order to grow beyond who you were in the past to become who you'd like to be in the future.

2022 and 2023 were really chaotic for me, but here we go. Last year I was hitting a rock bottom. I HAD to start treatment for the first time in my life because I tried suicide. I went to the psych ward and there I was diagnosed with BPD. But before that, I was already going crazy for a while. Anyways, last year I had fucking three FPs. One of them I met on the psych ward. And all of them were like a vivid intense toxic romance that ended very fast. The last two hurt me pretty bad, and they clearly were difficult people since the beginning (I only fall for difficult people, they take me to paradise before ruining everything. I probably do the same thing). After I started taking my treatment seriously, I no longer want these kinds of people, but I still don't like normal people enough.

Besides that, I had to get a full time job and started living by myself. I used to live with my brother, but he couldn't handle my BPD anymore and basically kicked me out. In the beginning it was really difficult, but it was the reason I started taking my treatment seriously because I REALLY needed the job if I wanted a place to live. And with all that, I have way less time to give people attention, and less time to think about them. But the treatment is the main reason of course.

I had to drop college, but who cares. I will get back, and my job is in my area of knowledge. I still constantly dream with the last two FPs to this day.",raquellab,18djosd

You put yourself in a really vulnerable position to try to teach people about it and hopefully make things better for yourself or others, and it sounds like it ended in the worst possible outcome. It sucks that you got hurt like that.

I think that for the most part people either have no experience with bpd and so they just think it‚Äôs haha funny quirky because that‚Äôs what they see online, or they have had a bad experience with someone with bpd and have seen how bad it can get when people with bpd are at their worst moments, and so they think that everyone with bpd is just like that.

34394,"Hey btw, BPD has a **FAR** better prognosis with regular treatment than a vast majority of mental illnesses. 

In fact, BPD is becoming more understood to be one of the few mental disorders that can be remitted through therapy. 

Unlike depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, etc., BPD is not a disorder related to chemical imbalances. It is, in fact, a big web of unhealthy (but valid) defense mechanisms that were twisted together in our childhoods. 

There‚Äôs a big idea in psychology known as ‚Äúneuroplasticity,‚Äù and that idea is that our neurons in our brain physically form themselves into pathways that subconsciously guide our actions as we repeat behaviors. This causes us to have certain unhealthy (a lotta healthy ones too tho) behaviors that our brains just initiate without us even making the decision to. 

It‚Äôs made for survival, when you repeat behaviors in nature, you need to revert to them subconsciously while in danger. But in modern life, it isn‚Äôt quite the same. BPD treatment is entirely based on this idea of neuroplasticity, in that this disorder CAN truly be picked apart by getting deep into the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù of all the things we do 

Sorry if I‚Äôm a bit preachy, but this is something that helped me when I was feeling the ‚ÄúI will never stop feeling this way‚Äù vibe",,kgtqhr

I'm hung up on the idea of ""expecting them to"" because that's not really what I meant, though I understand why you would read it that way. For me, I shared this as more of a fantasy world kind of thing. ""Wouldn't it be nice if mental health treatment had the same kind of support as cancer"" and I firmly believe that if we lived in that world, all of us would have stronger support systems. 

The thing for me is that BPD is definitely a disorder that greatly benefits from a strong support system around the individual. I, for one , still have difficulty getting my immediate family to validate that it's more than just general depression, and that the things I attribute to my disorder are very real and legitimate. If I spent half the time trying to explain to them that I'm not bullshitting them, we could have moved mountains by now. And I'm 100% certain that my family would drop everything on a dime if I came home with a serious medical condition. BPD honestly seems like a serious medical condition-- especially when one considers that 10% of people with BPD succesfully end their own life. That's a staggering statistic that, to me, indicates it's a deadly disease. I'm not attempting to compare it to cancer, but saying I wish people would have the ""it's time to act and show up for so and so cause they need us"" attitude to BPD that they do to other medical conditions. 

And let's be real here, the stigma towards BPD combined with the massive dollars made in the cancer industry definitely helps skew the way people respond. We have many feel good stories about people supporting cancer on our shows, our news, our movies, our journalism, everywhere-- because people coming together for one another sells and helps to prevent people from expressing their outrage at the financial ruin that cancer treatment entails. BPD doesn't have the same media representation so people don't have experience the ""we can be like the people I saw on TV who came together for this person"" so they don't think to do it. Unfortunately, I think people care more about being like everyone else and having their own ""I did some good"" story that serves to fill the emotional hole that they're feeling from a loved one being ill--""It feels good I was able to do something for them. I needed to be able to help or I was going to lose my mind"" kind of thing, self fulfilling reasons. The ""social credit"" aspect of showing up for your loved one struggling mentally isn't the same, because of stigmas, because most people try to hide that kind of thing than share it with family. It's something they talk about in secret. There's no calls to the aunt's and uncles to share ""oh my gosh they're diagnosed with BPD we really need to come through for them"" it's ""well I haven't told anyone about it cause I don't think it's their business to know something personal like that about you and I don't want you to be embarrassed."" It's stigma, and we all feed into it, and our media conditions us to feed into it, and it's just where we are. 

If we lived in a better world, I think we'd see close friends and family outside holding signs for their loved ones on their first day of new therspy. First day with DBT or Stepps. First day on a new med. First day home from the psych unit. Whatever. It's not ""people should hold parades for every meltdown and episode we experience"" but ""people should hold parades to help support us in our treatment the same way they do to support others for treatment of more culturally accepted illnesses--whatever they may be."" I imagine everyone on this sub would have love for people to come to bat for them, full throttle, the same way people rally around a cancer patient.

Maybe it would be beneficial to come at it from a different angle? Work out how your brain receives information, what it does with the information, and where it goes from there. Follow the strings of the web, etc. 

It also helps to find as many triggers as possible, even if they fluctuate and only trigger you sometimes, so that you can find a ‚Äúclean‚Äù day in which you‚Äôd be more functional to do the therapies.

Of course, many people have overlapping symptoms, for example I definitely have 5/9 symptoms to have BPD, but also display elements of avoidant personality disorder and OCD.

34951,"I'm in the same boat as you. My NPD mother is honestly the scum of the earth lol, and it's been six years since I've cut her out and it is still the single best decision I've ever made for myself.

It's shitty because I want to give people the benefit of the doubt. I can sympathize with pwNPD because generally it comes from them being abused themselves, but I know of only a handful of people on the internet with NPD who work on themselves and I've never met one myself or have personally seen a pwNPD get ""better."" That being said, only the people with NPD who are especially destructive are noticed and clocked for having NPD, so maybe I have met people that do have NPD and they're working on themselves and I'd never know.

That actually happened to me once where I was dating someone and my BPD Fear of Abandonment¬Æ flared up and I explained to him that I had BPD, and he was like, ""What? You? I couldn't even tell,"" shortly after which he dropped me. (I'm never telling anyone again lol)

Either way, if someone treats you badly, there is no fault in immediately leaving. No one is obligated to be abused for any reason, even if the abuser has a personality disorder. People have rightfully left me before, and I don't and will never fault anyone for leaving me when I act toxic, even though I'm actively working to be healthier.",,xfvks9

My parents could both definitely qualify for a NPD diagnosis just based on criteria and .. me observing how they are, and they abused and neglected me and are the reason I'm fucked up today but even if they did have NPD and not just narcissistic traits I wont call it narc abuse bc they abused me bc they were shitty parents not because of their NPD (if they have it)

Narcissistic abuse and emotional/mental abuse is the same thing, theres no defining difference other than one abuser having NPD or narcissistic traits and the other abuser not having that. We dont say BPD abuse, depression abuse, autistic abuse - so I dont know why we should say narcissistic abuse

I honestly understand where ur coming from like I do but idk, its kinda harmful to stigmatize a whole group based on a few bad experiences. And the reason why we say cluster b has to stick together is cause stigmatizing one of us will lead to further stigmatization of the entire cluster b. And its already hard for ppl w NPD to get treatment bc therapists look at them as monsters who cant be helped so further stigmatization will also make it even harder than it is for them to get help, and thats not good bc how are they going to improve or get treatment then? :/

34977,"(I'm drunk sorry for typos or weird wording)

I def agree with everything you said its just hard for me to ""stick togther"" with people who act very similar to my abusers even if its in a casual and non-abusive way.

Generally I dont wanna associate personally or casually with a narssaist. I understand that may be biased (almost certianly) so unless its someone whos directly abused me I wouldn't tell them specifics, but I dont think its worth bringing up my own trauma forcing myself to be supportive and a part if a community with people who do nothing but trigger me, even if its not their own fault. They can have their space and ill have mine. I can support their treatment from a distance.

I agree stigma effectes acsess to treatment as well,but remember that a lot of people with NPD won't outwardly accept theres something wrong w them even if they have acsess and internally know it. Not saying that makes it okay to stigmatise, I just think its worth noting.  

Personly my ex is diagnosed with NPD and it only came out in an argument where they tried to prove their mentally ill because they have a habit of faking disorders for attention despite being dismissed by multiple drs multiple times for the disorders they publicly claim. They still claim it was bs despite me having sc proof and texts from their mom confirming.

And the other person is my dad who hasn't been dx but my therapist whos seen him dozens of times says he has ""narcissistic traits"" and that if he'd see a psych he'd prob get dx but dosent have the authority to dx him.

So maybe its just my experince, but its also just a product of the disorder they'd not admit smth is wrong unless it benefits them. Which makes even getting dx let alone treatment, hard.

Again I actually agree with everything you said, but atm at least, I dont think it'll mentally be comfortable for me to interact with them. I know their not inherently abusive, same as us, but even their casual tendencies just bring up a lot for me and I don't want to be around that. Maybe that's selfish idk, but keeping my distance is what I want yo maintain.

Edit: also forgot yo add this im all over the place, but im sorry you went through that and im genuinely impressed you can see it in a nuanced light despite all that. I hope ur doing okay and I'm both jealous and proud you can have a compassionate out look on npd!",kanincottonn,xfvks9
34978,"Yeah I agree. I think just, since ots _part of the disorder_ to ignore that you have any flaws it just makes me more... hesitant. 

I know theuyre not all abusive so I _want_ to support those who can take a step back and realize its not right how their feeling, but th ppl with NPD whove harmed me have only ever used that dx to seek attention and sympathy. And they were even only dx while trying for their _6th_ autism dx after being denied they were autistic both before amd again after that. They just wanted sympathy and oppression points. And an excuse. I only even know they have it because it was brought up when we argued about their weird disorder faking shit.

I'm also so sorry you went thru that, my dad has ""bpd traits"" according to my therapist whos met him maaaaany times but refuses to see his own therapist so I can't know for sure. It rough, I hope you can heal from that :(",kanincottonn,xfvks9

34987,"Yeah, my mother was and is in no exaggerated terms sadistic. Especially towards the end of our relationship when she was at her most abusive, I remember seeing *excitement* in her face when she was able to cause me the most pain. 

She was violently abused as a child and even told me as I was growing up that more than anything, she wanted control, all the time. Being able to control me and hurt me made her feel ultimately powerful (the only thing she's ever wanted all her life), and it didn't matter to her that I was in tremendous  pain, bc she was not capable of empathy and couldn't see anyone past herself.

I think with the majority of pwNPD, the main issue is that it is part of the pathology of the disorder that one of the last things they'll ever do is recognize there's anything wrong with them, bc that means admitting they're not perfect, and that causes their fragile egos too much pain to admit. In general, bc that lack of empathy and introspection is built into NPD, they're far less likely to want to work on themselves or ever start to, making them have way more potential to be abusive and toxic for their whole lives, vs BPD, where we can empathize (*before splitting) and see our faults more honestly, which give us the opportunity to try and fix them.

That being said, seeing some of the new YouTubers with NPD blows my fucking mind. I hope they can change and I root for them.

And with *that* being said, the second someone is abusive to anyone, that person who is being abused has every single right to leave then and there, which is a standard I demand of my behavior, too.",,xfvks9

The treatment team gathers all biopsychsocial data from the patient to make a diagnosis using the DSM, and once a diagnosis is made, we input the complimentary code as a ‚Äúcharge‚Äù for the patient‚Äôs insurance provider. Insurance providers will only pay for treatment if there is a billable charge or diagnosis, so a lot of the time we use ‚Äúadjustment disorder‚Äù (which is a nice way of saying some shit is going on in their life right now) in order for the patient to remain in treatment rather than diagnose someone based on the intake information/ assessments since that info can‚Äôt really paint the ‚Äúfull picture‚Äù.",bornforthis23,qsfl6l

35198,"The most important thing to know about bpd is that the the illness does not represent a clearly defined set of people, it‚Äôs not people with cancer or a skin rash. It‚Äôs anyone who happens to match a set of symptoms. The thing we have in common is those symptoms, if you try to look for other commonalities you‚Äôll find some of us are one way, others are another. You can invent your own disorder if you like in a similar way, just come up with some symptoms you think go together. 

Now the major use of a set of symptoms is to prescribe a treatment for everyone who meets the criteria. For example say people with brown hair who like cabbage, look at porn and go on holidays in cold countries. The treatment is dancing, the only way you can guarantee that the group I‚Äôve created is worth even thinking about is if I can prove that dancing does something positive for these people! 

What if I couldn‚Äôt prove that, well that‚Äôs how bpd was at the start. In fact the best treatment now is about 50% effective. Weird, like why? Well people often get better by themselves and all of these treatments are very expensive and take a long time. Another important thing it impossible to do a double blind for this kind of therapy. Giving a placebo therapy would be unethical, because you‚Äôd have to invent an expensive waste of our time that looks exactly the same somehow. Wouldn‚Äôt work. 

So what‚Äôs the answer? How do you help someone with bpd, well I can tell you what helped me, I realised that I do not benefit from the help that other people give me.

It‚Äôs not an easy thing to realise, that even if you got the help you want, that doesn‚Äôt exist you would just hate yourself even more. People won‚Äôt help you, they will attempt to reduce your choices. 

The next thing you figure out is that you aren‚Äôt broken, you are colonised. You don‚Äôt act in your own interest, you are a slave. Maybe someone did that to you intentionally, doesn‚Äôt matter that much. The only thing that should matter to you is your freedom. If you don‚Äôt want to suffer act in your own long term self interest.

The next part is when you realise that actually other people aren‚Äôt just not better than you, they are weak as fuck. They have never gone through the hell your own mind put you through and survived.

A former slave isn‚Äôt always a motivated person, but a runaway slave always is. In their mind they have won their freedom and they need to protect their saviour which is themselves.

They told me that it's not necessary to diagnose it because it's a personality disorder and there isn't treatment specifically for BPD .. but she said we can try to fight the symptoms/intensities with medication. I'm on the same medications as lots of ppl I've seen in these reddit groups. And theyve acknowledged i do have borderline traits. Idk . It's very confusing to me because I largely have to educate myself on BPD and so much makes sense. I wish they would acknowledge it more, as I would love to know/practice more DBT skills...

But accessing mental health in English here in Spain (as an ex-pat, not native) has been hard in and of itself. I'm thankful to finally have support and treatment... But I just feel like if I were in the USA i would be diagnosed..",Nice_Back6687,uhgg58

I am now again looking to get professional help and have found a ""specialized bpd centre"" (not sure how it works exactly, have yet to contact them). My last therapist was aware I have bpd but I'm not sure they knew how to deal with it because when it was brought up I felt like it was not taken very seriously. In the mean time I'm working on a bpd workbook (The Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook: An Integrative Program to Understand and Manage Your BPD).

I feel like my manic states are more the emptiness that drives reckless/impulsive behaviors. Just my take though.,hippocampfire,khy9ey
35355,whats the difference tbh?,timeactor,khy9ey
35356,"That may be hypomania. And that would mean you likely also have Bipolar Disorder. What you're describing, especially the physiological effects like insomnia and the tremors, does sound like true hypomania. People with BPD have rapid and severe mood shifts, but not usually the physiological changes that go with true hypomanic and depressive episodes, nor do their episodes last quite as long, although there's no perfect time stamp on either issue. So, my completely armchair and therefore worth almost nothing analysis is that this actually does sound like hypomania. 

This is an important distinction, because the treatment regimens are completely different for the two diseases. Bipolar is largely treatable with medication. BPD is far less so. This is because they are caused by totally different chemical imbalances and underlying issues. There's a totally different relationship that your medication treatment and therapeutic treatment need to have if you have both of these diseases, or have been misdiagnosed, so it's certainly worth getting RO'd for bipolar specifically, because the right diagnosis and therefore treatment can make a ton of difference.

Be well",kharmatika,khy9ey
35357,That means that you likely have bipolar as well. You can have both but it is just a fact that BPD does not have mania. It just doesn‚Äôt. I went to school for this. Several psychologists have told me. It‚Äôs just a fact,randomforprivacy,khy9ey

35359,It might start off as hypomanic and progress to manic.  Agree that a manic phase might not be fun and a true manic phase can often end with you being in the hospital or jail.

BP1 ‚â† BPD ‚â† BP2",Sure_Yogurt,khy9ey
35361,"i agree with you that BPD can have states that might resemble hypomania (and i‚Äôve experienced them) but the DSM 5 definition of hypomania is:

‚ÄúA distinct period of abnormally and *persistently* elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.‚Äù 

I go through states like this but they tend to last a couple hours or at MOST a day and half. I think the longevity of these states is really what qualifies them as true hypomania. another difference i think is in BPII these states don‚Äôt seem to have apparent triggers while in BPD they often do (e.g. impulsivity as a reaction to emptiness, intense anger as a reaction to rejection, etc.) 

idk just my thoughts on this",Sure_Yogurt,khy9ey

Another thing, BPD mood swings are moment to moment, it‚Äôs a mindset. That‚Äôs exactly why it‚Äôs a personality disorder and not a mood disorder like Bipolar

Edit: look anywhere you want, the DSM, the internet. You will not find anywhere that says BPD experiences mania.

But if we do get personal, I'd rather have ctpsd on paper because it's far more specific (heh) and the treatment plan is nearly identical once you lay out the long term.

As for nature versus nurture, it's clearly both in both cases - in BPD a certain level of emotional instability and separation anxiety is thought to be innate, while in C-PTSD I'm foggier on the details of the nature side of things but I wonder if the extent to which and frequency with which someone dissociates is partly innate, as peritraumatic dissociation is a fairly important risk factor for developing (C-)PTSD.

Unfortunately, people around me understood what I was going through too late,they thought I am attention seeking and stuff,but in reality my depression and this disorder have beaten me quite badly.
Medication that worked for me:
Serlift(Sertraline) a half a pill at 3PM and a pill at 9AM;
Olanzapine a pill at 9PM
Tritico 1/12 a pill at 7PM
Cebrium a pill at 9AM
Romparkin a pill at 9AM
and as supplements Supradyn Energy.
I didn't find a good psychologist or psychiatrist until I got at hospital and received the diagnostic,after that I went to someone that treats this kind of disorder.
If you are depressed try meds,they won't stop the EUPD/BPD, but will stop depression.
I don't know if this would work for you, but I would've been glad to know that I could hospitalize at a treatment facility earlier willfully,instead trying to cut myself in order to show people in how a bad state of mind I was.
I get it that it is very hard to get help in that state of mind and feel like all options seem like closed.It can get better if you reach out for help.I will update this comment in like 3 months or less,after doing DBT(dialectical behaviour therapy) and share my experience.

35576,"I think it depends. Some people need to know your boundaries before actually doing anything like that.

So yes I'd say it's unreasonable to get mad at a person for doing something they didn't even know triggered you. Unreasonable doesn't make you a bad person though, having BPD isn't our choice at the end of the day.

If despite establishing boundaries that that person agreed to respect and they still ignore them; then it's 100% their fault and you have every right to get mad.

In my case I know not everyone wants to text 24/7 so I know I can have that as a boundary but the bare minimum I ask people is that they let me know they have to go before leaving unless it's something unexpected or an emergency because it triggers me when people leave mid conversation, or when people disappear for weeks.

I have to admit I hate those who say ''communication is key'' but then ghost you for weeks because there was a minor inconvenience that can't even be fixed because they're not talking about it.

&#x200B;

Anyway, tl;dr: No it's not unreasonable. If someone agrees to do something for you and they still don't, it's their fault for promising something they weren't even planning to do. If you get mad at something people don't know triggers you then it's your fault for communicating. Again this doesn't make you a bad person I know how difficult it can be to communicate your feelings.

It‚Äôs true that some with bpd are manipulative out of a desperate attempt to get their needs met, but it‚Äôs also true that because our emotions are so overwhelming, sometimes merely expressing them can cause others to feel manipulated. An example could be a friend viewing a confession about your feeling hurt and abandoned because they chose to spend time with their other friends as an attempt to guilt them out of having a social life. 

Sometimes our feelings are irrational and we‚Äôre stuck in the unenviable position of having to decide between swallowing them and becoming further isolated, or expressing them and risking the repercussions of being misinterpreted.

She is expert level gaslighter and I was her scapegoat from the time I was 5 years old until I finally cut her completely out at about 29-30 yo. This is not including the sexual abuse and physical abuse I also endured in my first 18 years of life‚Ä¶. We are talking having to learn to survive as babies and not knowing how to stop surviving and actually live when we are safe as adults. We are talking not knowing who we are because we have spent decades mirroring people in order to feel accepted. I, now in my 30s, have cut out most of my family for these reasons so now I have to figure out to stop surviving and actually live‚Ä¶ and I pay 125 a session every two weeks for another person to help me find my identify which I find ironic now that im writing it. There is an overwhelming majority of us that endured trauma of some sort and had to learn to survive way too young. So no. It‚Äôs not anyone else fault. But it‚Äôs also not mine. I didn‚Äôt ask for the disfunction I got in the way of family. I didn‚Äôt ask to have to learn to survive the way I did. And I know that it sucks to be in relationship with me. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to stick around. But im workin on it. That‚Äôs the best I got right now. That‚Äôs a lot of years of trauma to undo. Does that answer your question?",RadiantOperation8140,xpubx5

After having been treated in the psych ward for months, after having been discharged I was encouraged to search for a therapist. I had a few first sessions and it went like this:

You have BPD? Oh ummm I'm not really a specialist sorry.

You drink? 

\- Yes, but I only drink because I hate my life, I will stop as soon as I see a reason to do it (this is true, I have done it before when I had periods in my life where I felt like I was going somewhere). 

Sorry but I don't treat addicted people, you need to go to rehab.

Oh you have suicidal thoughts? Sorry, that's too much of a risk, you have to go inpatient (I JUST CAME FROM THERE FML)

Oh so you cut yourself yeah no sorry you need to be stabilized first before I can treat you.

35725,"I felt depressed and suicidal, so I called the 24 hour medical advice line and spoke with a nurse. 

She got me an ""emergency"" appointment a week and a half away. 

I waited. 

The appointment is pretty boring, non-urgent boilerplate stuff. I get referred to IOP. 

IOP consists of two hour zoom calls with shitty PowerPoint presentations on how to love yourself. 

I barely felt better. 

A mental health professional checked on me every week. However, it was always a different person who knew nothing about me and had to ask me to describe my mental illness and childhood traumas in great detail. I'd never hear from that person again. Another stranger the next week. The same questions. This happened three times before I told them to leave me the hell alone. 

I got charged $1200 for IOP and those shitty check-ins. 

I get depressed and suicidal again. I realize that nobody will help me unless I am actively harming myself. I go to the ER with self harm wounds and a suicide note. 

ER sends me to loony bin. 

The loony bin has twenty minute ""group therapy"" sessions. A person who dislikes mentally ill people comes to the day room, explains a basic concept from positive psychology (literally learned that in Psych 101), and then leaves. 

The loony bin sends me to PHP. 

PHP isn't helping much, so they 5150 me for not improving. Back to the loony bin. 

The loony bin refers me back to PHP. PHP helps for a little while, then ends suddenly. 

Request a therapist. ""We are booked up the next month and a half"". Good lord, can I at least see them on a weekly basis? ""No, our staff don't have that kind of availability."" 

I contact low-income and sliding scale therapy practices in the area. Nobody returns my calls or bothers to email me back.

Fact is, most of the problems in my life came from acting out. Most of the anxiety I had came from the fear of the self fulfilling prophecy of abandonment.

So sometimes it feels like the meme, but the reality is that keeping that shit isolated in my head has allowed me to live a much more comfortable, fulfilling life. Knowing I have the power to keep these reactions under control helps break the cycle of fear.

I still lose my shit internally. Sometimes I'll literally hide in a closet for a few hours, as a grown as man, just to ""put myself away"".

Last night after an aa meeting my father figure held me in a side hug and rocked me as he spoke to a friend. It is so nice to be rocked. He understands bc he didn‚Äôt have a healthy father either. His hug is what I am thinking about right now so I am aggravated but not insane. He knows I‚Äôm sick but he knows I‚Äôm trying, bc when I have episodes I know how to deal with them: gabapentin, self-love, and calling a friend, not my favorite person, to just hear me out through my pain. 

It is possible to get better at reacting to the pain, rather than leaning into it and falling into insanity. It is hard, I get it, but I don‚Äôt want to be a whirlpool of chaos anymore.

Yes I read the post. Nobody said to time travel either, they‚Äôre an adult and the post seems they‚Äôre entitled since the financial aspect is all they‚Äôve really spoke about and seem to be complaining about. They expect their partner to fully support them and pay the bills while they keep their money. in any relationship it should be a fair split. I don‚Äôt know their bf, OPs age or how long they‚Äôve been together for. Which is important detail

But dating someone 11 years older than you never ends well, I‚Äôd question why the man is even looking to date someone with that big of a gap between them. OP should have asked themselves these questions

They‚Äôve said they‚Äôve both lived with their parents so they should have been aware of finances and if renting a home would even be possible on their income. They say they don‚Äôt make much and in today‚Äôs economy it‚Äôs hard to rent a home without roommates/two incomes. Doesn‚Äôt take rocket science to be aware of that

Seems like they‚Äôve made a list of bad decisions and then pass on the blame but I get it, BPD is a difficult disorder and we do act entitled sometimes but it‚Äôs also important to be self aware, and try to correct that behavior",xxxhotpocketz,1avov2m

36076,"Sorry for assuming your gender. 

I absolutely agree with your points about age gaps. I absolutely agree that she must protect herself and not be codependent on a man. However let's not victim blame. The older person in this relationship is way more experienced in life and has likely abused her financially in a way she can't articulate. I've experienced this before. 

Best case scenario this man is a creepy groomer living out a caretaker fantasy. Even if she has been completely boneheaded in this... Which I very highly doubt even the best and brightest can fall in into these unhealthy power dynamics hell it's happened to me numerous times. 

My recommendation is leave him OP. Everything you are describing wreaks of toxicity with a hint of predation.

Edit: the man seems emotionally stunted and has been living parasitically off his parents. Which I also understand. I can completely relate to him wanting to be with someone in a similar situation and to help split bills but he needs to fix himself a little first and find someone a little bit more balanced with him in life experience.

I've been really scared of what the world will think once I get on the outside. I mean, it's kinda a disorder where I'm afraid of what others are thinking and doing and the stigma is that I'm awful to be around (just like my brain tells me lmao) and like, that's terrifying? And is just making the worst parts that put me here to get my diagnosis go overtime. 

But, there's a little voice in the back, over the panic, saying if they want to leave me because of a disorder, than maybe they aren't the people to be around while recovering. 

We still have to do DBT, right? People stuck around that long when I didn't have answers and there was no hope of me ever being less ""exhausting"" but won't stick around when I have the power to work and improve? That's on them. And if that's what they need to do for their health, so be it. I'm definitely gonna cry and be in physical pain because, oh god I'm being abandoned but, we both deserve to be healthy and happy.

I have always done my best to advocate for others, but I do worry now that I'll either get the brush off or people will go, okay, well you're not ""one of those"" borderlines like they did when I came out as bisexual. I am ""one of those"" because those people are under the same category as me.

Just because your cheating partner was bpd, and bi, doesn't mean that they represent what it means to be those things, but it doesn't invalidate that they are them either. It means they were a cheating partner, who had the potential to be attracted to a variety of people (as anyone does) and had a condition that predisposed them to hypersensitivity (and anyone can be hypersensitive). Your partner may have done those things regardless of those being part of their life. Your partner made a choice.

 This has been better for BPD than meds and therapy for me. I learned DBT and CBT last time I was in the hospital and it really transformed how I thought about things. 
 
Opioids and pharmaceuticals are there to keep you dependent on their system. Fact is, BPD is treatable and can be done without meds. With DBT/CBT and amother earth provided psychoactives, you can break the cycles of dependence and have complete control of your life. 
 You don't even have to spend that much doing it. DBT techniques are free online, and of course purchase of said psychoactives applies, but seriously, if you do them like a medicine, you only need to do them on occasion. When I started taking mushrooms in a guided session, that was when I really got through a lot of the repressed trauma and felt quiet in my soul again. 
 
Mushrooms, DMT, opium, marijuana, all these were medicines before they were party drugs. For BPD they can be helpful if we take them as suggested by the elders and use them for healing.

Maybe trying a conversation with your sis if you feel up too, without a third person intervention. 

Ghosting is really hurting and many people without bpd perceive it very differently from us.

Years ago I had a similar situation. My bf of the that time did something really really nasty to me, she realized right away she fucked up and came to apologize, but I told her I needed time to digest beforehand. 
I didn't spoke to her for a week, and I came back ready to talk this thru, but then she had told everyone of our friends I was punishing her, i was being inflexible and was acting like I was too good for her apologies. Basically, her and I had a very different perception of the event. 
I choose silence to avoid my emotions to take control of me, to protect the relationship from an outburst. She saw it like a punishment. 

I don't think any of us was wrong, I think it's really the lack of communication and mutual understanding that was the end of it. Mind you I was undiagnosed at the time.

That relationship is now over, it never survived that episode. Today it's a reminder for me that no matter how close and strongly connected you are with a person, at the end of the day, you see the world thru different eyes.",1air2d,1c10581

I didn't work as a bar tender but I was a server at a restaurant with a bar and the exact same dynamics were at play----this weird pecking order, the constant need to have somebody to single out and pick on.... for what it's worth, the choice always seems arbitrary. Its nothing about you that draws their pettiness, though I'm sure it's little comfort and in fact, maybe just seems all the more shitty because of how fucking random it is. I don't know why people do this... maybe it's just how they feel better about themselves.

36572,"not sure if this will alleviate the pain of this but it‚Äôs worth being realistic‚Ä¶

studies that show dbt therapy helping bpd look at the long term, i think 2 years. i‚Äôve been in dbt for 3 years and am only now starting to phase out of it and no longer feeling so controlled by this disorder, and even then i still have really shitty periods. it takes time. sadly this is not an easy cure. but you CAN recover from the symptoms so they no longer run your life. 

my doctor also told me that symptoms can lessen up over time (i‚Äôm talking decades). and while that seems like a daunting amount of time to be mentally ill, if you‚Äôre willing to keep up with therapy and be patient with yourself, you might find that things to get easier. maybe not better, but easier 

there‚Äôs unfortunately no easy fix. but you‚Äôre trying to get help and that‚Äôs already a big step. it takes time. if you‚Äôre feeling ready for ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù (whatever that means for you) then be prepared to stick with getting support for some more time/as long as it‚Äôs accessible to you to make a difference

edit: check out Dr. Daniel Fox on YouTube! He specializes in BPD treatment and is very empathetic to the disorder, he also strongly advocates for the knowledge that this is a very treatable disorder. lots of us would be much much better off if we had hands on treatment (and also if those around us had it too) it‚Äôs just so inaccessible for so many people. but it‚Äôs very much treatable and does get better",freshlyintellectual,162bs2o

I think we can all agree, though, BPD sucks ass.",thatdumbbitchKaren,162bs2o
36580,"maybe your therapist is (no longer) a good fit for you? you‚Äôre too difficult for THEM, which seems like maybe a skill or resource issue on their part. it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre incapable of getting better but hearing that kind of attitude from a therapist would absolutely wreck me. you deserve better than that (even if she‚Äôs trying her best, sometimes it‚Äôs just reached the limit of your client-therapy potential)

i‚Äôm almost 22. we‚Äôre very young. being diagnosed as a teen is still super early in your life. you‚Äôre only a 3 year old adult and you‚Äôve only known adulthood with this diagnosis. i can‚Äôt even imagine being 16 years old in therapy and making that a priority. that is a lot

not to mention, bpd is often caused in part by trauma, which means we need to both process all of that shit and also fix our behaviours and learn not to make things worse, all the while dealing with new trauma caused by the behaviours. it‚Äôs gonna take some time. 5 years seems long but you were SO young when you started and didn‚Äôt even know you had the disorder yet. and then it takes time to even process you have it. there was a lot going on at once that can definitely limit how much it can help you

your feelings are 100% valid. this shit is super hard and it‚Äôs not fair. things getting worse is scary and i definitely know that feeling. i still feel that impending doom sometimes and feel like i‚Äôm on the brink of loosing my shit again. ESPECIALLY when an fp is involved. for me i think that when i behave worse and worse i‚Äôm less likely to work on my skills and think i can get better, because getting ‚Äúbetter‚Äù involves SO much work to undo the shit i‚Äôve put myself through. it‚Äôs like a self-sabotage cuz i think i‚Äôm gonna fail anyways

but that‚Äôs BPD. things feel extremely intense but they might just level out. no matter how downhill you go, you aren‚Äôt hopeless, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll stay there. this disorder doesn‚Äôt have to be a death sentence. i just want you alive friend",freshlyintellectual,162bs2o

The guy was a sweetheart and he had a rough past and my mom has a rough past.

The relationship was strong, and in one of their heated situation, he shot himself. But my mom was also have struggles with suicidal idealization and she said that cured that
 Not at first, but seeing that first hand she kept that hidden from me. Just his death hurt for me but lack of information for a while and emotionally feeling my mom's trauma from it, it's a part of what my trauma is but in a whole different context than her perspective.

They had me on Paxil, latuda and prazosin. The prazosin helped a lot with PTSD nightmares. My nightmares aren't as bad now but I kind of still wish I was on it.

>Overall, meta-analysis provides little evidence to support the use of antidepressant medication in BPD outside episodes of major depression. However, there is evidence for the use of both mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications for the treatment of specific aspects of the disorder.

These sensations have been described as tingly, crawling, creeping feelings, and cause the overwhelming urge to move the affected limb.""

I don't know what was causing this. I did everything I could to prevent it from happening, staying away from anything that could be causing this anxiety. It would happen when I was trying to go to sleep. The only way to relieve these sensations was to tense my muscles about every 10 seconds. This went on for about 4 or 5 months before I was prescribed the medication that helped me. I call it ""body anxiety"" because it's a physical sensation rather than mentally, which I also really struggle with. My therapist would tell me to calm my mind and I kept telling her it had nothing to do with my anxiety mentally.

Yeah, that got me paragraphs of how horrible I am, and cut off. 20 years of friendship gone, because I stood up for how I felt. Oh and uh, according to them I wasn't """"""""""actually hurt"""""""""" it was just my BPD and the intense emotions. The dehumanizing was and is real.

That's not how mental issues work.
Yes, you can work on it, but this is not something you can expect continuous progress with. Some steps can be easy while others may be extremely hard, or even impossible. Relapses do happen too, and that is okay. 
Expecting you to, or even worse, demanding that you have to ""try harder"" is absolutely unacceptable.

Your feelings are valid. The same applies to her behaviour towards that friend. Voice your concerns.

I'm agreeing 100% with the doctor here. There is a reason why BPD is known as the ""boogeyman of psychiatry"" and it's for reasons such as this. 

All symptoms for almost every condition are in a massive Venn diagram where they all overlap. 

Did you know that the symptoms for psychopathy are ahout 75% the same as symptoms for sleep deprivation despite being cause by different things? 

Did you know that things like clinical depression can have symptoms that are like BPD, Bi-Polarism, etc. But not have the person be on that scale? 

Psychiatry works through differential diagnosis, and it's the only sure-tested way that we know so far of treatment. If they don't believe you at first it's because they have to. 

Things like self-diagnosis and social media do not help because its not empirical, its emotional, and created attitudes where people are so convinced that they have X or Y, anything else is absolutely not acceptable, even though it could be.

Labs all have different techniques, results cannot be replicated, sample sizes are low, the method to ""count"" how much activation gas occurred is not standardized, and tbh there are a lot of factors that can increase blood flow to a region and this does not necessarily mean that it is the brain region that is most active. There's more, but yeah. And psychiatrically, no medications have reliably been able to treat bpd. They are all shots in the dark. Scientific literature has yet to find anything that works better than placebo at managing symptoms. (This is somewhat of a rule across personality disorders - if it's personality, meds will not treat it).",neuroprncss,kskbe5

I asked if I could change the therapist bc I just couldn't talk to her and she just said ""I decide if we get along or not and what'll help you"".
Needless to say I was out of there after less than a week (I was there voluntarily) after just 2 1/2 months of normally 4 I would've been there so that sucked
There was also one patient that was constantly making fun of my scars bc they ""looked like i couldn't be that mentally ill"" and one who would threaten everyone with beating them up (and also sometimes got to do so which landed a nurse in the ER with a broken collarbone) every time smth didn't go his way so yeah, good times",Odd_Light5,12k14hr

37242,"It probably goes without saying, but if they‚Äôre purposely ignoring you then I‚Äôd just stop reaching out.

That being said, what‚Äôs helped me with this is addressing the root cause of why I feel the need to do this in the first place, which is closely tied to the root of BPD itself: careful emotional monitoring and maintenance of everyone close to you to avoid real or perceived abandonment. And what happens when I feel those abandonment fears? I feel anxious. Part of anxiety is feeling like you have to do something *right now omg I‚Äôm gonna fucking die make this shit stop*. This is the part when dropping the people pleaser tendencies, holding space for yourself, and seeing things from the other person‚Äôs point of view helps. If you honestly have the time and spoons to respond immediately, then go ahead and respond. But if you‚Äôre honest with yourself that you really don‚Äôt have the time or spoons to respond right that second, respect yourself enough to give yourself that breathing room and grace, and trust that nothing bad will happen in the 30 minutes or whatever it takes you to get around to their message. I promise the world isn‚Äôt going to end. Remember, people without BPD don‚Äôt feel this stuff quite as strongly as we do. The *vast* majority of them are going to be just fine with you taking a bit of time to respond. And if they‚Äôre not? Well then either it‚Äôs an emergency situation, which is something entirely different, or they‚Äôre not respecting your needs and boundaries, and that‚Äôs supremely shitty of them. 

It‚Äôs hard to keep it in mind, but a lot of what we do really is self-enforced. Most people aren‚Äôt going to literally make us disrespect ourselves to keep them in our lives. We do it, for most of us anyway, because we were taught at a young age that this is what we have to do to survive. It kept us alive, but it hurts us once we‚Äôre no longer in danger, because the people who are truly worth our time aren‚Äôt going to need us to constantly tend to their every emotional need. And once you can stop doing that, you can start not just validating yourself, but attracting and letting in people who want to tend to your needs, too.",Vadise_TWD,15k59lk

Unfortunately over the last few months it was a clusterfuck because best friend started fucking fwb fp which they both thought I didn‚Äôt have to know then they started dating. Meanwhile I had feelings for fwb and he had feelings for me for awhile now but life was a bit too busy and complicated for us to date, yet he can date her??? But then best friend and I made up as friends, and then we started dating which felt sudden. And fwb and I were seeing eachother regularly but it wasn‚Äôt the best situation because they were also still dating. At this point boyfriend fp(who is married) was struggling with me and fwb seeing eachother so we were in a rocky place and trying to come to common ground, but the romantic relationship and friendship with best friend and I imploded and she took the fwb with her. The boyfriend and I were working on our shit for a month after that until his wife said she didn‚Äôt want him to see me anymore(after 2 years). So now I don‚Äôt have any of my FPs‚Ä¶

37368,"we often feel like we need validation from others, that what we went through was brutal enough to cause us lasting harm...

the thing is we seldom recall an original traumatic wound. it can be relatively small and simply have happened when we were too young to process it. such an event is often buried within us, stored in the body, and we normalized having it as perhaps it comes from a time where it was happening to us each day, or perhaps it was so severe that the memory is gone but the feelings are so intense that we run... either way, this keeps us in a cycle of survival.. running from the feelings such a wound created. that's not the real damage though

the real damage comes from what happens to us every single day. minor things with such a wound never heal, they just accumulate. this can go on for decades. this is trauma

that's why often others do not understand how such a small thing can affect us so much... how can we be so ""sensitive"". often others will even think perhaps we need bad things to happen so we can toughen up, which only makes it worse... and often that's all there is

it takes a mother and a father to show us what home family and love is... it is genuine compassion, patience, security, protection, no judgment, empathy, emotional support, love... we need exposure to this to take it into ourselves. in order to have a home that can heal within us

too many of us grew up without this... until we learn how to love and care for ourselves properly, we will not have our most fundamental basic skills that we need to maintain ourselves in this world, and we cannot replace a culture of emotional healing with entertainment, distraction nor addiction... not sustainably, that only makes it worse in the long term regardless if at this point in our cultural evolution it is the common remedy because it is what is best for the economy... but it is not good for anything else",BodhingJay,1d0jaxu
37369,"Yeah. I think I have been learning how to love myself. But reddit is making me revive some traumas I did not needed to revive. I was going in a self love way. But people in reddit made me feel I should never have friends again. 

People in real life are not cool too, but in  reddit I used to be comforted. I used to feel safe by being anonymous.  

Now I think I should stop trying to making friends, living with my mask on 24/7 and just when I met those 2 or 3 people I can trust I will be truly myself. 

To be honest I want to SH again so much. But last time I did SH my father tried to beat me, and my mom took the punch in my place.",lonely-sad,1d0jaxu
37370,"living with a social mask for acceptance over feelings of being unlovable must be addressed as any work done to create codependent dysfunction within ourselves must eventually be torn down anyway...

when we care for our feelings and emotions, the good bad and ugly within that we all have, to such a degree that we love ourselves passively, regularly from the subconscious without conscious effort, we can begin to nurture everything within back to humanity. when that happens, we can easily start to make friends without the mask...

we must do this without the mask so that the rejection denial and abandonment within us may end... there is nothing inside you that is unworthy of your own love.. when it is all cared for and the relationship within you is maintained and protected, that is when others begin to eagerly try to love us",BodhingJay,1d0jaxu

37373,"we are often vulnerable to others, almost inappropriately, in hopes that they fulfill that need within us that we have not yet learned to provide ourselves... this isn't our fault as it's generally the role of family to teach us how, but too many of us are being made to struggle in life without this

it often means finding others who are already on the path to healing from similar wounds, that we may learn how.. rather than repeat cycle of denial rejection and abandonment... the people we need to show us will have a good relationship with themselves and they'll should be friends rather than partners in intimacy and romance. in order to succeed, we will have to overcome the feeling it being alien. healthy dynamics tend to put us off until we've healed",BodhingJay,1d0jaxu

37902,"The most effective treatment for BPD is therapy, especially DBT because it was created specifically for those with BPD. Because of the rapidly changing nature of BPD (ex: going from feeling super happy to super angry really quickly, general mood instability) psychiatric medication isn‚Äôt as effective for BPD as it is for other mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. 

But medication can be helpful when used as part of a broader treatment plan that also includes consistent therapy and practicing skills/healthy coping mechanisms. The most commonly prescribed meds are mood stabilizers/anti-psychotics, most are in the same family as Abilify, but this family of medications can lead to a side effect called Tardive dyskinesia in some people (myself being one of them lol), but it‚Äôs not overly common. There are alternative mood stabilizers like Lamictal/Lamotrigine, but that specific med can have dangerous side effects if not taken consistently. 

Antidepressants and anti anxiety meds can also be helpful in terms of treating anxiety and depression like symptoms, but are less likely to be effective in those with BPD on their own. I apologize for info-dumping, I hope this was helpful!",batalieee,tzbw73

the second half really wasn't great but I never had problems at school, usually I didn't have to put any effort in to get good grades, so I managed to do the other half with seroquel and then I stopped taking it.

However, ECT has saved countless lives. It‚Äôs faster than antidepressants, safe in pregnancy and for the elderly, helpful for severe suicidal and psychosis. It isn‚Äôt the zombie-fying fiction of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. 

It‚Äôs a literal life-saver and a Gold Standard treatment for malignant (as in deadly) catatonia and severe suicidality.

It isn‚Äôt easy, and it takes a lot of people a lot of time before they feel better. But it isn‚Äôt hopeless! 

Of course, if you‚Äôd rather go it without meds for personal reasons, I completely understand.

38191,"Oops I misremembered, just checked the bottle and I‚Äôm at 200 mg. My bad. The therapeutic dose is between 100-400 mg. They say it can take 2-4 weeks for a medication to build in your bloodstream and fully take effect, some doctors still go by 1 1/2 months or so. If you smoke cigs it increases digestive enzymes and lowers levels of medication in your blood. If you are taking the pill or taking estrogen (not to assume) it lowers levels of lamictal and makes the pill less effective. 

Some people are treatment resistant, like myself, and may require higher doses. Or this medication could, sadly, not be for you. As I previously said had we not added adderall (originally for energy, turns out I have ADHD PI) I would have discontinued the med, just pure luck. I also was left on an antidepressant so that makes a huge difference as well. 

 I was reccomended abilify twice in the past and quite a few  people have success with it, but I had to discontinue due to uncontrollable muscle jerks (not very common, typically stops ). The first med success I had was seroquel but it made me even more tired so I quit it. Not saying these will work for you, but there are options.

So if 4 shots normally gets you pretty feeling it, on 80mg of vyvanse you won‚Äôt be feeling it till 7-8 shots.

My hairstylist was all oh were you losing hair three months ago?? I decided to stop taking the meds three months ago.

I will say that it's probably the most sedating thing I've ever touched, though. Those years I was on it I slept like nothing else, and the rebound insomnia was just utterly devastating.
