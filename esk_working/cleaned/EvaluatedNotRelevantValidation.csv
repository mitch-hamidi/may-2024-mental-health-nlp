Azrai113,502,"be careful that you do not just redirect the abuse from outwards to inwards hurting yourself instead of hurting others does not actually address the problem it is important to understand the formula for a genuine apology a good apology acknowledges the other persons hurt and focuses on that you do not need to explain why something happened unless they want to know the next part is how you are going to fix it now again you need to take their feelings into account and not just decide for them what will make it better next a good apology addresses the future what will you do better next time do not fall for the emotional trap that there will not be a next time because even if the action may not occur again the thoughts or feelings leading up to it probably will and you need an out before you get to the action in the future have a plan and share it with the person you hurt lastly you need to realize that the person does not owe you forgiveness some things are unforgivable and the person you hurt has the right to not accept your apology it is not about how sorry you are it is about them even if a person accepts your apology you do not have a right to continue your relationship as it was or even to be in their life to allow you back in after serious misconduct is a vote of trust but you still have to earn it back by following through with your plan to make things better and try to prevent poor behavior in the future the ball is in their court i know this may sound harsh but i think a lot of people apologize for the wrong reasons if you would like a better explanation of a good apology there is resources online that explain it better than me also keep in mind that an apology usually means change if you are not going to change then you need to accept whatever it is about yourself maybe you chew with your mouth open and no amount of apology is going to fix that so maybe people who get upset about mouth noises just should not be in your life that is okay and it is probably better for everyone some people are only in our life for a short journey and not the long haul and that does not make either of you a bad person you also need to forgive yourself follow most of the steps above when doing this understand that you probably will fuck up again but that is what happens when you are learning something new trying to be better and failing neither makes you a bad person nor undoes all the progress you already made drinking a beer after 6 months of sobriety does not erase that 6 months i did not mean for this to get so long but hopefully it helps you have already made huge progress by even recognizing that you acted in a harmful way you now have the opportunity to use guilt as a tool to improve your life do not let it become a weapon for self harm, be careful that you do not just redirect the abuse from outwards to inwards hurting yourself instead of hurting others does not actually address the problem it is important to

GastonsChin,53,wow i really appreciate you sharing many people on here do not have great access to therapy so i always wondered what the quality of online therapy would be apparently it is dog shit jesus christ who fucking says that i am really sorry that you are feeling the way you are i know it sucks and i know that it feels like there is no end but there is well mostly piece by piece you can begin to remove the pain you feel by addressing it your brain is an unreliable machine so while you may think you are feeling x because of y it could actually be something entirely different that you never would have considered this is where a good therapist comes in i do not mean to make it sound like an easy job but each session should kind of be like so how are you feeling miserable ok why are feeling miserable i just cannot keep myself from having these bad habits ok what habits i am eating too much i am drinking too much ok how much is too much this many ok how does it make you feel like shit but it is comforting what is comforting about it you seeing the pattern here imagine you are inside your brain and it is like this huge underground tunnel that is completely dark and all you have is a flashlight you have been lost wandering around in there trying to make of things that make no sense to you the road to recovery is like having a strategy on how to navigate this tunnel the first thing you do is you start to make a map i think this because i feel this you take that thought and you go down the path to explore it this is where having a good therapist really helps because it is here that they can help course correct you by showing you the influence that is behind those feelings you may have thought you were doing something good but were really doing something bad once you figure it out you immediately stop feeling that way i did this constantly i have always tried to be the nicest guy on the planet and i always wanted to everybodys best friend and i just handed out love and trust like it was halloween candy whoever comes around gets some i thought this made me a really good guy that was doing the right thing then i come to find out that i really just did not have an identity and so i would use anyone around me to supply me with one that was a big bummer lol i really thought i was being the good guy but i was only hurting myself and using others so you know had to swallow some pride there but it was such a wake up call to the reality of my life vs the story i would been telling myself it really gave me a new lens to see through and it was scary as hell so many embarrassing moments that i felt so justified about at the time just recognizing how my emotions took total control over me all i am trying to say here is to please keep up hope there is a way out of the pain you are feeling everything in your body is working against you you are not expected to be able to handle this on your own so do not settle for a therapist until you know that they can do their job try to start slowly establish some trust but always be honest no matter what if you continue to have trouble there is literature that can possibly help and you have always got us if you ever need be kind to yourself you deserve it,183v30f,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,0.9967,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,1,1,This information is minimally relevant.
