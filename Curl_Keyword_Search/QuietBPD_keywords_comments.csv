I never understood why I was so weird around other people I just felt odd out of place and never understood myself around others. Why I would react a certain way?

Have you struggled being able to recognize what you’re feeling and never seem to be able to communicate it leading to constantly feeling misunderstood?

My only worry about this being another wrong turn for me is that I don’t seem to experience anger, haven’t for years, but I think I may have just masked and muted it for years. I was an angry teen, but as I grew (I’m 6’3” athletic build, though far from athletic anymore lol) I feared scaring people and I do feel I have a kind heart that I began directing it inward then shutting it out almost entirely (or possibly burned out by a serious relationship with my ex who had typical bpd) but I noticed my anger does seep through when journaling/writing. 

Sorry just started to see the possibility of quiet bpd being behind my struggles so head is all over the place. 

I hope the diagnosis has brought you some relief just in itself from finally having an answer to why you’ve felt so out of place/broken and are able to get the right treatment to help you reclaim your life 😊",Standard-Holiday-486,ea6i4a

First, I’m glad that you finally have some answers and still exhibit such an admirable mindset after what I’m sure hasn’t been an easy journey. 

I was wondering if you had spent most of your life being diagnosed seemingly everything in the dsm and wondering why none of the treatments seem to ever really fix anything?

And also wanted to ask how your treatment has been going, and have you noticed much of a positive impact in your life? (Also I guess what the approach they’ve taken has been for therapy)

I worry that even if I find the answers I’ve spent half my life looking for, guess I’m afraid of how much of a difference it can make in terms of quality of life going forward. I was engaged but that fell apart a couple years ago, I’m still recovering from that, so I’d basically be restarting my life if I ever figure out why I’m broken, but guess I’m afraid that so much of my life has passed me by and don’t have to show for it, and nothing much from to build upon?

I realize your situation may be entirely different, but that 44 and just diagnosed jumped out at me so was wondering how it’s made a difference for you.",Standard-Holiday-486,ea6i4a

3,"I don't have a suggestion, but following in case there is one. Everything is so focused on acute-crisis, recently diagnosed, classic (rage) borderline. I'm 8yrs into recovery. That type of literature is not helpful and doesn't even come close to representing where I'm at and how I present.

And as a side not ""I Hate You, Don't Leave Me"" is one of the worst. It's so nasty about us. Painting us as intentionally manipulative and just plain awful. My parents bought it when I was diagnosed around 13, I didn't read it until about 25. That's when I realized that's why they accused me of just trying to constantly manipulate them. I love my parents, we have a good relationship now, but at the end of the day THEY ARE THE REASON I HAVE BPD. They have absolutely no awareness of this (that's okay, they don't need to for me to heal). I would guess that at least one of the authors of this book has a BPD child and was (hopefully unintentionally) deflecting blame about their part in causing it.",myholelove,huocc3

Edit: I’ve only read the first one so far. Written by a psychiatrist but the language is accessible and in my opinion a must read for anyone interested in understanding BPD.",Wide-Lavishness-6591,huocc3

12,That's a terrible experience and like you say adds a lot of shame. Where are you based? I think in the UK they won't diagnose BPD until 18 although I'm not sure why if it means early access to treatment,Entrance-Public,huocc3

0,"Holy shit. I could have written this myself. I can't tell you how many times I've had this experience with therapists and it is absolutely devastating. It makes me so skeptical of ever opening up to a new one. I've learned that despite my fear/resistance to boundaries, I desperately need them. DBT therapists typically have excellent boundaries because they know that people with BPD often need them. I almost cried at the ""Miss Honey"" reference because I used to watch Matilda over and over as a kid and just cry because I wanted that relationship/situation so badly. I wanted a mother figure to swoop in and save me and that dynamic has informed the rest of my life.",existentialdread0,hrdv1y
