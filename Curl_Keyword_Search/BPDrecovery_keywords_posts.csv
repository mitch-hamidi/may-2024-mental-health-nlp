2,1am wake up thoughts,"F 25. Just woke up and I have been uncontrollably crying. I was diagnosed with BPD around a year ago and have been in therapy since. Various shitty things in life have happened to me, but my first trauma came from my dad (shock!) when he abandoned myself (8 at the time) my older sister and mum for a 21 year old woman. This absolutely broke my mum, she was severely depressed and from this age until I was 15/16 I was always scared she might end her life. My sister became rebellious due to trauma, but I went the other way and hid everything else going on in my life to try and protect my mum from feeling guilty as I don’t blame her at all and she did her best. The issue is that this trauma response of hiding things that I’m going through has made further issues with things that have happened to me e.g. I didn’t tell anyone when I was being bullied at school because I didn’t want them to worry, I didn’t tell them I was self harming at 13 etc and it was never noticed, being groomed online, covered up that my partner was abusing me for 5 years. My mum says to me that she thinks I have BPD due to my abusive relationship. I wish I could tell her everything else but I worry she would blame herself, when the person I blame is my dad for leaving us and not giving a shit, to then have another child and he is a good dad to him. Why did I never get that ? Since then I have had a strained relationship with my dad. We currently speak only about once a month though. When I was in my abusive relationship (ages 18 to 23) my dad cut me off unless I ended it and this also created a lot of trauma for me. I’m now in a situation where I feel that maybe I should say something to them. Or just my dad. Or I don’t know. I don’t want to keep carrying this pain alone. I just want my dad to be sorry and take responsibility for the trauma he gave me. Not sure if even attempting to see if he will do this will just give me more issues.

3,Does doing DBT make you angry when you first start?,"My sister has BPD and was doing trauma-based therapy. For a while, she was doing better with her anger. But she recently started DBT and now she just gets angry over the smallest things again. Is this normal? To become angry when beginning DBT? For the record, she’s actually been enjoying the program so far and willingly joined the group.

4,I thought I recovered but now I feel ashamed.,"I (27F) have been dating my partner (29M) for almost a year now, this relationship is very meaningful to me because of the amount of trauma therapy I went through to be able to date again after a 4 year abusive relationship. I think I waited a good 3 years before dating again when I found my current partner at the beginning of the year. 

As someone who’s been diagnosed with BPD in the past it’s very hard to be in relationships, and I genuinely think I had come a long way in my recovery when it came to developing a more secure attachment style, communication,  and  self regulation. 

My partner and I have come a very long way from when we first started dating and I genuinely felt so proud of myself for coming this far in improvement and feeling secure, until today. 

My partner just left for a week long vacation with their family, and while I’ve been happy they’ve been able to do that, it’s been causing me some unease to the point I’ve been crying. They’ve gone on trips before where communication is limited and I was fine, so I’m not understanding why my separation anxiety all of a sudden has become so bad. It’s the first night and I’ve cried so many times because I haven’t heard from them and I just feel like I’ve taken a huge step back from recovery.",1698027448.0,False,10,5,BoysenberrySea3670,None,17e9seb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17e9seb/i_thought_i_recovered_but_now_i_feel_ashamed/
5,After all this time...,"I believe I've BPD.

I had a Psychologist assess me, and after a comprehensive analysis, I was catagorized as having an avoidant personality with multiple BPD markers.

I've had depression for years, and I put it down to unresolved childhood trauma, but I didn't make the connection between emotional dysregulation and my depression.

I've been in a psychiatric hospital programme for the past few weeks, and I've been finding the process really overwhelming.

It was suggested I take on DBT and Schema therapy. After also realising how many holistic aspects I need to integrate into my life from what has been covered in the programme, I'm now completely emotionally burnt out.

I'm lying here feeling like a heavy bag of cement, a metal band around my head and an empty hole in my chest. I feel like there's so much I need to do. 

The 'all or nothing' and catatrophizing thinking is in full swing.

I'm not sure if I'm venting, or asking for advice.

6,Inner child work and reparenting might have saved me,"Hey guys, I’ve been going to therapy for about a year and a half now and early in my therapist started talking about inner child work. It has honestly been a game changer. I know not everyone has the time, money, support or other means for therapy so I wanted to share a tactic that has really helped me take care of myself when I wanted to do the opposite, or it can just be food for thought. 
A lot of people with BPD are prone to self-harm and self-deprecating habits that stem from our childhood due to childhood experiences, as well as survival tactics and defense mechanisms to protect ourselves from more trauma. My therapist told me to imagine myself as though I was my own child. Would I think think of my own child as worthless, not worthy or food or care? How would I take care of my child if they were sad? Would I treat them the same way I treat myself? Would I treat them the way my parents treated me and my feelings? Would I validate them? Would I rationalize things for them? I know this can be hard, especially for the less nurturing type of person, but we also all want to love and be loved. It is only a small part of the bigger picture, but when it comes to self-love and taking care of myself, it has played a huge role in my process of recovery. You cannot stop other people from abandoning you. That’s a harsh truth. But you do not have to abandon yourself out of feeling worthless or acts of self-loathing. I want to hear your thoughts and how you see it, or what your experience has been with reparenting yourself or even the lack thereof. 

Also, book recommendation: The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk, M.D. It’s a popular book, but for good reason. Bessel encapsulates trauma in a way that is easy to follow yet so profound and has brought a lot of pieces together. There are sensitive subjects in the book that he gently discusses in order to explain the manifestations of trauma. TW for sexual assault, violence, abuse, etc.

8,"Lonely, clingy, emotionally promiscuous, hopeless case","TW: domestic violence

Not sure why I am writing this. I am 21. And I am losing hope. My borderline patterns started at 12. And they keep getting worse and more complicated with time. Never been in proper therapy. I was not compliant. Never found a good therapist. Was just heavily medicated with antipsychotics. But my patterns? Worse and worse with time. Dad died at 18. No financial stability and abuse at home of all kinds. Writing this post outside of my family house where my brother broke my nose. 

Just following with a convenient psychiatrist for the time. But no real change. Just staying afloat. CBT doesn’t work.

I am lonely. I do not fit in. People mostly bullied me for being autistic. In teen years and adulthood, I was sometimes repulsive. I lost my elementary school friends. I traveled and didn’t contact them for a decade. I don’t make real friends . I just act like a clown and mask. Or trauma dump.

Was stuck in a toxic FP situation for 3 years. Took my emotions and energy and complicated things. Much older person (3 times my age) and was pretty much groomed at 18. Finally left him . I was clingy desperate for a toxic person.

But I am always emotionally promiscuous anyway. Any guy shows the slightest bit of attention, I run into his arms regardless of red flags.

Epileptic and chronically ill. Health not stable.

Senior in uni and trying to push through to graduate.

12,Wanting to support others,"Hello beautiful people,

I am a therapist based in Australia who received a BPD diagnosis a few years ago (although I believe I no longer meet criteria) and has been facilitating DBT groups for the past year. 

Through my work, own research and lived experiences, I have learnt a lot, and I have reached a point in my journey where I feel the next step for me is to share what I know and help those who don’t have access to or can’t afford DBT or treatment for BPD/complex trauma. 

I am not exactly sure what this would look like, it would not be traditional/formal therapy - but I am thinking about starting a structured online DBT group or offer one-on-one online meetings where I could offer support. This would be completely **free**. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or would be interested in something like this!

13,working on myself,"I have not self harmed since last June and I’m honestly really proud of myself for doing that. I’ve lurked on this sub for a few months now and I’ve been in remission for 1.5 years now. I had a very intense upbringing filled with domestic violence, sexual abuse, and bullying throughout my early childhood years but I was known for being a very sweet girl, top student in class throughout my K-12 years, generally always having a “fawn” response because of my intense fear of letting others down. My worst breakup occurred close to 2.5 years ago and it made me reevaluate everything I knew about love so I took a 1.5 year break from romantic relationships and went to CODA meetings, attended therapy weekly (CBT), and graduated from university and got my first big girl job as a school librarian. I’ve been with my lovely boyfriend for almost a year now (in may!!) and this is the FIRST time in my life where I haven’t blown up a person’s phone with nonsensical paragraphs about delusional bullshit and trauma. Mainly, if I’m having a bad day, I let him know in a very loving manner and request just a bit of time to cool down. I was diagnosed with autism 3ish years ago so it’s been quite a journey. I don’t have the easiest living situation (I have a younger sister who has Down syndrome; she is nonverbal and blind) but I truly try to practice gratitude everyday because I have a roof over my head and that’s such a huge blessing. Anyway, I just wanted to say if you are really committed to doing the work, life can get tremendously better 🤍 this was a very hard week for me health wise (I have fibromyalgia and IBS), but I’m in bed and I took my meds and I’m feeling optimistic and generally not empty about life.

14,Success story: 3 years since I no longer met the criteria for BPD,"**Background:**

Diagnosed with BPD at 19: I would engage in extremely toxic and manipulative behaviours with my boyfriend at the time - spamming his phone if he didn’t reply within one hour, threatening self harm if he wasn’t spending all his spare time with me or felt he would leave me, I would split him every single day, within a matter of hours, no matter how hard he tried to make me happy or “do things right”. 
I was in college but couldn’t keep even a part-time job and failed countless classes because I’d lose motivation and had absolutely no sense of self.
I wanted him to hurt as much as I hurt from all my past unresolved trauma, putting it onto small things he might have misstepped, swinging from being extremely anxious/depressed to explosive anger. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn’t help myself - no emotional regulation, black and white thinking, the works.

When he finally couldn’t take it anymore, I broke down completely and sought professional help where I was diagnosed with BPD. When I first read the symptoms, it was like reading myself on a page. 

**Recovery:**

Recovery took at least 5 years: I had to take a long, hard, brutal look at myself and shared it (embarrassingly) with my psych - identifying my traumas, triggers, behaviours and accepting it. 

I had times (especially in the first 2 years) where I regressed and engaged in undesirable behaviours and would hate myself so much I wanted to die.
The most difficult to manage was my dependency on partners, I feared abandonment more than anything and would lie or threaten self-harm to make them stay. 
But I kept self-compassion, accountability for my actions, and persevered. The frequencies became noticeably less and I used that to keep motivated. 
DBT and CBT worked wonders, especially practicing radical acceptance, wise mind, mindfulness, GIVE, and self-soothing techniques.
I also worked on my trauma through multiple EMDR sessions and counselling sessions at the same time.

3 years ago I was told I no longer met the criteria for BPD. I’m so proud of myself for keeping up with all my improvements (still use the same techniques today).
I’m so much more stable and confident. I have never insulted my husband, breached his privacy, threatened self-harm, spammed messages, tried to control his actions, blew up on him, or shifted blame during the entirety of this 4 year relationship (I had already come so far then) - it’s basic respect, but before therapy this would’ve been impossible for me.

15,"I feel like I’m being used, a fill-in, I need a reality check","So I’m on the cluster b spectrum as well and didn’t know. I got into a relationship with someone who had BPD, and neither of us knew. 

I was the one who got hurt when she split, she got hurt too but it was moreso her delusions which caused the splitting.  This was one of the ways we discovered something was wrong and lead to the diagnosis.  

Anyway, I can’t talk to “normal people” about this because their advice is to demonize cluster b people and they only say to “run!”  I don’t find it helpful, I’ve been through years of therapy and I know what it’s like to see danger in everything and I empathize. I’m not an angel either and I’ve been lucky to have people who offered me grace and redemption 

Long story short, when I began to understand our relationship was abusive, my ex and I went no contact and it’s been over 2 years. I spent the time single and in therapy and wished her the best 

We’ve recently reconnected and it’s only been because she too has been in weekly therapy for at least a year now.  I immediately noticed we have new abilities regarding taking ownership of our emotions, and we’ve been talking every day.  For the most part it feels healthy, there’s been nothing strange with the correspondence. In fact, I enjoy it. 

It’s platonic enough… we do reminisce about memories and such, but we mainly just share our days with one another and discuss health and therapy. She told me she missed my friendship and wishes things ended differently.  

Thing is, I’m starting to think she’s just using me to fill a void until she gets into another relationship.  She did tell me she was single and I mean, I’m not her bf, she can do as she pleases

…. But I don’t want to get used or be a fill-in for anyone.  

She sent me a meme today that said something like: 

“me: I’m not going to be in relationships for now, I need to work on myself

The moment someone attractive looks at me: I’m ready to get hurt again”

I’m not interested in making jokes like this given what happened between us, not interested in being some stable friend for her while I watch her ruin more relationships, and herself.

I can’t tell if I’m catastrophizing and spiraling over something that was just a joke meme and it triggered me?

I just want to be the healthiest I can be and sometimes I can’t tell if my fears are valid. 

I don’t want to be used.  I don’t. I can’t.  But I also don’t wanna run away if there’s no real reason to and I know at least part of what I’m feeling is triggered anxiety. But that also doesn’t mean there’s not a real concern underneath it all. My go-to reaction is to jump ship and run away. But I’ve learned that isn’t healthy, so here I am trying to figure out what I feel and why, and then a healthy way to address those feelings. 

She wants to meet up in person and a part of me does…. Not with any expectations other than authenticity from both of us. I’m so happy that she put in the hard work to face her trauma, I’m happy for myself for doing the same.   But I think full recovery is a life long journey; one that I can understand.

16,Best kind of threapy for relationship abuse recovery??,"Was recently heavily abused by my ex who also has BPD. Both psyically and mentally. It was pretty bad. He is now facing jail upto 3 years including the cases from his previous ex. 

I'm now a shell of my old self. Today I was looking through all my old posts on Instagram and I cried. Because I mentally had forgotten who I was and how confident and happy I was back then. I didn't even realize at the time how much I had found myself back then. How free I was.. how courageous and inspiring and truly just nothing but my unapologetic self not letting anything hold me back. Fast forward 8 months and I'm a mess.

18,Relationships with other people w/ complex comorbid psychiatric disorders?,"(26m) Over the past 10 years of my life I've seen a multitude of therapists & other mental healthcare providers, and I've been diagnosed with Bipolar I/PTSD/BPD/OCPD/anxiety/SUD. 

I've had 3 serious relationships in my adult life, all of them with other people who have complex comorbid psychiatric disorders of their own. Partner no 1: Depression/BPD/anxiety. Partner no 2: Mania/anxiety/SUD. Partner no 3: PTSD/DID/Bipolar I/possibly ASPD/SUD.

Each relationship was it's own spectacular disaster, each one more unhealthy & intense than the last. The final one especially has left me feeling broken.

As someone with BPD/OCPD and other psychiatric issues, am I just not meant to have a partner that has problems similar to mine? Is it just too much strain on a relationship, period? Or was the issue with my specific partners not being willing to get the treatment they need? I'd like to think someone who understands could be compatible with me.

My mental health is at a critical low at the moment and I've not been taking care of myself, but I need to make a change. So, I'm finally digging out the workbooks I've had for ages but barely touched.

So I'm feeling fairly hopeful. I think it's going to be hard work, but I think this combined with some DBT books I have can help me get things in order the best I can.

22,What if I was the problem…,"So… I have been in several dysfunctional relationships in the past and pretty much always saw myself as the victim. And don’t get me wrong, I was badly hurt and affected by those; for years, some of the events were on replay in my head. The endless loop of despair and what-ifs and unmet needs from my caregivers who failed me spectacularly. Only I didn’t know at that time, I was just trying to survive.
Fast forward 15 years, hundreds of hours of therapy, and I finally realize that there are no villains and no victims, just hurt and faulty humans who made mistakes and that most of my hurt stemmed from misunderstandings rather than ill-intent.
I haven’t been the all-supportive, always kind, loving person that I insisted I was; I had been manipulative, pragmatic, deceitful and selfish. 
I was projecting and using many of my ego defenses to overcome the deep shame I was feeling, and I think I probably failed at honesty and some promises I should have never made.
I believed for decade and a half that I was the victim and powerless and that I was deprived of my chance at happiness because someone didn’t adore me enough.
In reality, none of that was ever true. I can analyze things 100x and make 101 things true in the process, but the core of the truth is that I am a trauma survivor who was in a tough situation and tried to make her fantasy of a novel parental figure/rescuer come true and completely ignored who people truly were in the process.
I discarded people immediately when they couldn’t meet my completely unrealistic expectations and be my living fantasies. Yet I blamed them for everything… 
Suddenly, at the likely half-point of my life, I am realizing I messed up and made poor choices and there’s nothing left but regret. 
Regrets and wondering what might have been… but finally I have no excuses and no finger to point.

24,How do you stop splitting once it's already started?,"TW: sex, non-monogamy, childhood trauma/abuse

Some context - I (36F) have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, BPD, RSD, and Severe Depression. I've been with my partner (38M) for 18 years, polyamorous that whole time. I'm not currently engaged in any outside relationships. My partner has a second partner (F) that he's been with for roughly 10 years. I love her, we're good friends and we all 3 raise a child together. 

Here's the issue I'm having, for a myriad of reasons my partner and his girlfriend don't get to spend much time together. I mean, months at a time go by between dates. Which means that I don't have to face the hard feelings of abandonment and comparison that come along with him having dates. I'm in therapy and we're working through a lot of trauma from my childhood and from our relationships.

my partner and i, overall, have a great relationship. we make great coparents, we run a successful business together..we just make a really good team and he's very understanding of my BPD and all the problems that can cause.  he's exceptionally reassuring and affectionate, and is aware of the impact my rejection dysphoria has - he works very hard to mitigate it. he's a wonderful beautiful human being and i love him with my whole existence.

here's the problem - last night he and his girlfriend had their first date in like 8 months and it was an overnight date. I was able to hold myself together all night without having an episode or a meltdown (which is huge for me). This morning he came home, eager to plan an evening with me to reconnect and enjoy eachother....

and i'm splitting on him because of fucking course i am right? i'm literally scared to be intimate with him in any way because i'm afraid he will compare me to his girlfriend and i won't measure up. i'm always afraid that once he has ""better"" he won't love me anymore. this is stupid, we've been together almost 2 decades. i KNOW it's stupid. why can't i stop it? help. please. i really don't want to push him away or be cold because of my own fear, i know that will make him feel bad when he's so loving with me but that's exactly what i want to do right now.",1637021047.0,False,21,7,Dealunbreaker,None,quu9xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/quu9xz/how_do_you_stop_splitting_once_its_already_started/
25,intensive DBT program without any processing work is destabilizing me to the point I'm terrified,"I have bipolar 1 as well. I was seeing a one on one for years doing processing work for trauma but once I was accepted to the BPD DBT program my other services were no longer covered (in Canada, while some services are govt covered, there are often stipulations). 

I see a psychologist who specializes in DBT for an hour every Tuesday and have group every Thursday for 2.5 hours. I also have access to phone coaching. While I'm beyond grateful for this support, I'm realizing how vital the processing piece is for me. Like many of us, I have C-PTSD and multiple events of PTSD. 

My mood is really destabilized, not just emotional dysregulation, but the bipolar component too is being deeply affected. I feel like I have no time to recover between sessions so I'm just always feeling unstable these days. I can't afford therapy that isn't covered. I don't know what to do. 

Group yesterday triggered me so hard, a particular group member, and I slept on and off for 16 hours since. I had to disconnect twice because I was about to lash out at her.

26,Seeking advice or experiences on how to cope with a very painful break up 🤐,"TW: breakup, being cheated on

Hey!

Does anyone have any experience or recommendations on how to cope after a very painful relationship ending?

 How not to drown in self-hatred when I contributed to this painful outcome?

Also on how to not slide into the next toxic relationship right away? 

It's been over for nearly 3 months. 

And I'm just not coping well.

And I want him back even if I should realise that we are obviously not good for each other.

End here if that's too long :3

We had a lot of ups and downs, started as an unlucky affair in a polygam setting, ended up monogamous, which manifested a lot of mistrust and fear on my side throughout the relationship. Nevertheless, we were incredibly close and I have rarely felt so connected. 

I was in a really bad shape mentally due to depression and life circumstances, in therapy yes but it did not help that much and he wasn't fine either. I always pushed him away bc I felt not worth it, felt too dependent and pulled him in if our distance intensified and he gave too much into it, nearly gave himself up for me without setting healthy boundaries. Which we would have both needed. 

Of course he cheated on me trough online sex dates when we were at our lowest. And he immediately replaced me when he was inpatient himself with someone he seeked relationship advice from and never mentioned towards me, telling me we both need to work on ourselves and need time.

My main fear of people leaving because I am too much for them when I am at my worst is confirmed and it hurts so incredibly because it was the first time I loved someone so intensely and felt safe in some way. 

I think we had a very explosive relationship because it was mutual love but at one point also trauma bonding on both ends (both being emotionally dependent on each other, me being PwBPD and him being mainly anxiously attached) 

I try to move on, live my life, continuing therapy, find myself again, start to depend on myself, being and enduring being single for the first time in over 8 years without jumping from one to another relationship, hobbies, seeing people, discovering new things.

But still I feel broken and scared to death to get close to someone again bc all of this is so painful.

28,Beginning my journey.,"I (28m) have just begun a long needed journey.  I have been the victim of my own life and BPD as well as the villain in many other lives.

Last week, it cost me the life I built with the person I love and spent 9 years with. It cost me good friends, a beautiful home, 2 loving cats, a decent job, and my understanding of the world.

It cost me who I wanted to be ideally.

I have 1 year to improve as much as possible, and even after that year, the rest of my life to commit to being the person everyone believed I was.

I will no longer be a product of circumstance. I will no long be trauma for others. I will not be my BPD.

I will not be the worst version of myself.

I will be accountable, transparent, honest, and most importantly I'll do things right.

I've begun therapy, and am preparing to move out and be alone for the first time in 9 years. I am in a state I've only been in for 2 years and have lost all of my local and most of my online support system. I have come clean to all of those who remain in my life so that they have a choice to be a part of this journey. I have begun journalism, I have ordered a reputable book about BPD called ""I hate you, dont leave me."" so I can better myself between therapy sessions. I plan on starting with 2 therapists for the first few months as soon as I can get insured as I am now between jobs. I found a gym nearby to channel my energy into being as healthy a body as a mind.  I will have to effectively restart my life alone.

I have removed every trace, every presence, and every artifact of my horrible habits and self destructive mentality.

I am the most miserable I have ever been in my life, and I am in the most emotional pain I have ever experienced.

And I am filled with nothing more than the desire to overcome. To invest in this year I've been given, to give returns to those in my life, to make the rest of my life a testament to the chances I have been given undeservedly by those I love the most. By the one I love the most. Call it my FP, call her my soulmate, call this whatever you want. I am not my issues. I am not my mistakes or problems.

""What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?""

# Its time to put in the effort.

If anyone has any advice, recommendations, guidance, or tips that helped you, please feel free to share. I want to do as much as I can everyday. I want to love and be loved. I want to listen and be heard. I want to be the person I pretended to be, and then I want to be better than that.

Thanks for taking the time to read my message. Thank you for being a community where I can start my journey.

29,BPDlovedones…helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I’m talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It’s all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that’s for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don’t really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I’m sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally. I feel like I’m trapped in the mind of a five year old as well trapped in the mind of 1000 year old person. I feel like I’ve lived 1000 lives and sometimes I’m not sure what’s real, what’s a delusion, and what is fact. This is why I love neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. It gives me explanations for why I am experiencing an emotion, why I am reacting to it, and to just remind myself that it’s not that big of a deal. I don’t want to make excuses for people who cannot take accountability of their actions however. I used to do that and thinking about it makes me ashamed. My mother has BPD and is closing in on 50. I have only repaired my relationship with her this year out of pity after cutting her off just as other people did. I understand how she does not see how her actions affect people, and that’s why the mental illness makes relationships difficult. She seems to think that she raised me perfectly fine even though sometimes I didn’t have food and we were homeless at one point and she constantly screamed in my face and hit me. She never hugged me. She never told me she loved me. I never felt like she was my mother. I don’t have a father. I don’t have siblings. I don’t have aunts and uncles. I grew up extremely lonely and the thing I struggle with the most as an adult is abandonment. I think I fear the way I felt as a child. I have had the thought “it will never get better” for as long as I can remember. And now I look around at the life I have created. With the person who I think is the love of my life, my wonderful friends and support systems, my education in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience, my ability to travel to different countries, and ability to have my own things. And yet there’s still a sense of chaos in my life and nothing can ever be stable. Am I doomed to live this way forever? All I want to do is fix this. And I don’t even know what “this” is. I fully support psychoactive compound therapy. From my readings of academic literature, and personal experiences, I think building neuroplasticity through psychoactive treatment is a key component to mental health rehabilitation. You obviously can’t just give people psychedelics and say go crazy—it needs to be monitored, and patients need directed therapy while they are experiencing altered states of consciousness. Becoming extremely emotional, and vulnerable has caused me so much grief, but has allowed me to discover so much about life and help me build extremely close personal relationships with people so I can learn more and give back to the field of neuropsychopharmacology.",1692082128.0,False,14,10,pthevslayer,None,15rku5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15rku5z/bpdlovedoneshelpful_or_harmful_idk_who_cares/
30,Should I be concerned?,"
I'd like to preface this post by stating that I have toxic behaviors in the relationship, such as invading space, being overly critical, heavy splitting, not listening to his side well, as well as my own yelling and general outbursts. I am in therapy partly to work on these behaviors.  
  
My bf does have some behaviors of his own that bother me, however I'm not sure if some of these are normal and I'm just splitting when I freak out about them. I've communicated about most of these and I've noticed some of it get better, however he's also told me he feels like I take everything as a personal attack and like I don't trust him. Sometimes when conflict has been very heated and I point out something that bothered me, he corrects it but explains he feels like he needs to keep a 'checklist"" of bad words/things to say. The behaviors that have been bothering me are:  
  
\-Swearing during conflict, but I've even corrected him when it isn't directed at me  
  
\-Yelling, he's also explained much of the time he does not mean to yell directly at me, but I have noticed it improve over time.  
  
\-Sometimes when we disagree he says what I said was ""stupid"", I've tried asking him to change it to say that what I'm saying doesn't make sense or something more neutral. I have noticed this get better as well, but he does get frustrated about it at times and doesn't always know how else to describe something  
  
\-Saying what I said was ""useless"", but this is often when I've repeated the same questions over and over or don't add anything to the conversation. He has gotten better about it but also does get frustrated about needing to stop.  
  
\-Saying that I'm being stupid/am stupid, however this has only been when I've highly bothered him and wouldn't give him space during the argument. He's only said this when I've split very hard and have had a giant episode where I won't let him calm down, so he likely does this because he doesn't feel like he has a choice. He does want to work on it, but I understand I provoke it and don't give him much of a chance to act differently.  
  
\-A few times he's hit things, such as the couch or his desk, but this is also often when I won't give him space when he's asked. He has thrown his phone once or twice when I was splitting very hard on him as well, but I've also done this to my phone much more. He's never thrown anything in my direction or near me, and I don't feel like he's trying to intimidate me.  
  
He does know these behaviors bother me, and when things are calm and we try to problem solve again after escalation he usually apologizes and wants to be better. However, sometimes he will say that I took some of it personally, such as swearing. Another thing that concerns me is that during arguments when I ask him not to call me stupid, he'll say ""I didn't call you stupid, I said you were being stupid."", I've read from some people that these things are forms of gaslighting, but I also know I provoke some of it after crossing his boundaries, and that BPD can often make us overreact so I am looking for input.  
  
Many of these things didn't start until I split on him more, however the yelling, swearing, and some moments of him saying I'm taking stuff personally did, as well as saying what I say in arguments at times is ""useless"".  
  
I've been bringing up couples therapy, now that our lives are less busy he said he'll try going. Going is very out of his comfort zone, as he's had trauma around therapists and doesn't think couples therapy is effective, but he said he'll try once a month then see if he's okay going more often. He's also told me if he can't figure out his behaviors on his own he'll try to see a therapist himself. For the couples therapist, he has said he doesn't want to do much of the work of looking for one, but it was my idea so I'm not sure if this is fair.  
  
We were trying to call each other out on these behaviors during conflict and then taking a break before re-engaging, but I've often failed at following through as I've explained. I am in no way trying to excuse my toxic actions. I'm just asking if his behavior seems like a valid reaction to my splitting and how I act, or if I should be concerned and he seems toxic as well.",1683955962.0,False,2,3,thelittlestone568,None,13g8f5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/13g8f5z/should_i_be_concerned/
31,book for my partner?,"I am hoping to buy my partner a book so they can understand BPD more. I have asked them to research it on their own and just send me what they find so i can let them know if its accurate or just stigmatizing BS. I think they may just be intimidated by how much bias and misinformation is out there and they have asked me about books. 

What (if any) books exist as a resource for partners of people with BPD that explains what BPD is, how to support us, and how they can hold their own boundaries in this sort of dynamic?

Maybe such a book doesnt exist but I would be happy with any of those 3 things.

EDIT: Anyone who responds to this assuming that im not putting in any work needs to fuck off. I've already sent them all sorts of stuff. I am in therapy. I have a workbook. I journal. None of my symptoms are severe they way they were even as recently as two years ago. I put in hard work every single day to manage this disorder that was given to me through being abused (reminder, none of us fucking asked to be like this). My partner fails to express external interest in my BPD. IMO if someone knowingly signs up to date someone with BPD they are signing up to do hard shit sometimes. It's not like I surprised them with this disorder, I told them on our 3rd date, well before we entered a comitted exclusive relationship, that I have BPD and that it is something they were going to need to learn about. It is immensely triggering to be in a relationship where half of the time when I am triggered it's at this point avoidable had they just done some research. But instead the labor of that gets put on me because ""im the one whose fucked up"" despite my constant begging for support, constant self work, constant self restraint. I am burnt out, suicidal, and at my limit. IMO reading a few articles on google is the BARE MINIMUM. If I had chronic kidney disease i know for a fact that people would not be telling me that its my responsibility to send people articles. A mental injury is no different then a physical one so take your ableism and shove it up your ass because what we have is a fucking disability. Why is this one of the only disabilities where the disabled person is constantly the one who is 100% responsible for their own recovery? That literally inhuman. IMO thats YOUR trauma speaking and projecting on to me.So fuck off with that because I know that I am worthy of a loving supportive relationship where people take interest in learning about my disability and take interest in how to support me.

My room mate took an entire class on how to have someone with BPD in your life and how to support them. I didn't even ask them to do this, they did it because they love and care about me and wanted to understand where i come from.

33,From the other side of recovery: realizations after 10 years of therapy,"I no longer identify with my BPD and rapid-cycling bipolar diagnoses, mostly because I do not fear abandonment like I used to, and I have fewer extreme highs/lows. It took 10 years of weekly therapy (sometimes 3 sessions a week) and lots of meditation/DBT/studying Buddhism, but I think I'm finally there. I told my therapist two months ago that I was ready to stop seeing her and try to work through things all on my own. 

It's been going really well, and my family has been supportive of my decision. I think they can see how much I've changed, which makes me really proud of myself. I've been considering whether my decision to end therapy was just another BPD splitting thing or manic decision. After two months of being locked in the same house with my family (thx COVID), it's clear that I've actually made progress, so I made a list of things that I am grateful for because of therapy/recovery from BPD--on the other side of it.

1) Having BPD means that you've been through the lowest of mental lows. I can't count how many times I felt like I was physically dying because of a BPD-related fear/sadness. Once you get better at managing BPD, you'll realize that other people don't have past experiences like that to help balance catastrophic anxiety. We already know what ""the worst"" feels like, so it's not as scary. And we know it'll get better (life has its own mood swings), even though that's hard to remember. Ngl-- knowing how deep in the dark I've been makes me feel kinda badass for making it out.

2) Our emotional depth lets us experience life in the most immersive way. Humans have something like 30,000 emotions, but I swear the people I know have 10 max. The capacity to feel is what makes life worth living. When you can manage how you respond emotionally to things, this is probably our superpower imo.

3) Compassion. The drama, trauma, and general intensity that comes with BPD has put me through a lot. Like with any hardship, getting through it has made me aware of how life is tough on all of us. I crossed paths with SO many people who had no idea I was struggling with BPD, and I'm grateful that some of them showed me compassion when I had hurt them. Now, when someone is unkind to me, I recognize that it probably has nothing to do with me. Everyone is going through something, and we're all just doing our best.

4) DBT skills are just awesome in general for everyone. I've had psychologically-sound friends tell me they need advice (read: anxiously rant while I make a mental list of DBT skills that could help them). When I share the skills that have worked for me, I realize that DBT was a HUGE stepping stone that helped me become more emotionally healthy and self-aware than the average person without a mental health diagnosis.

5) This one is personal, because I don't know how many people with BPD experience symptoms from a young age. I was diagnosed at 15 years old, and I am now 21. (My parents sent me to therapy for anxiety when I was 11, so 10 years of that). I can't believe how far I've come in terms of emotional maturation, and I'm still so young. It just makes me excited for future personal growth:)

TLDR; If you're working on recovering from BPD, you're doing great! Recovery helped me develop mental strength, capacity for emotional connection, compassion, widely-applicable DBT skills, and a better future.",1586820768.0,False,54,10,pancakes904,None,g0uafg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/g0uafg/from_the_other_side_of_recovery_realizations/

She takes care of me like I never was by my parents. Before I assigned her the role of caregiver in my subconscious mind I loved her for it. I still do. But it got twisted and warped into need. I messed up and told her I wanted more than friends. Then... She hurt me.


She had told me she just didn't want a relationship, that I was the best person for her but she really didn't want to go there because she's bad in relationships, she pushes good people away. I really fell into needing her after that. Until she met someone she wants to possibly date and blew me off for two weeks because she was afraid to tell me. It hurt like hell. All the rejection trauma from my childhood hit me like I freight train and I didn't know that's what it was. It just hurt. I stopped talking to her for two weeks it hurt so bad. Fast forward to now and we've made up. My BPD diagnosis and discovery of what a favorite person is helped me make sense of how I feel, especially now that I'm journaling about my trauma and discovering it's the same pain. 


There's a lot of work left to do on our relationship though. A lot of trust to be rebuilt. A lot of difficult questions I still have. She knows she's my favorite person and what that is but she doesn't know the why that I've explained here and I feel the need to tell her. I also know we need to talk about boundaries and concerns. She said she loves me and I say it often now but I worry I'm crossing a boundary. I want to just hug her and cuddle platonically with her and I don't know if that's ok. I need to find other comfort but I still want her to be comfort for me. I liken it to what parents are supposed to be like. You lean on them but they're not your everything, your sole source of comfort. She's said she wants to be whatever I need but we haven't talked about what all that is because I'm too afraid. Because I want to express my concerns about her not having time for me or this guy not being ok with the way our relationship is. But that involves thinking about the stuff that triggers me. About being abandoned, replaced, rejected, feeling not good enough in so many ways compared to him. It's a really dark place that I'm afraid of going into but I know if it's even possible to make her just my really close and special friend rather than my favorite person it's going to take a lot of communication, boundary setting and patience from both of us. I'm just scared of the hurt that I know I have to face to get there. I don't really know what I want from this post. Advice from someone who's been there maybe? Reassurance that I can do this?

35,BPD and New Relationship,"BPD Girly Pop Relationship Advice

I need some help. I recently started a relationship with someone. We have been dating for about a month and a half. I have done a lot of therapy and inner work for my borderline personality disorder, but this new relationship is flaring up everything. Triggers that haven’t happened since the beginning of my recovery five years ago are resurfacing. My nervous system has been a complete wreck. I cannot tell if it’s my BPD/ trauma that is causing my flairs, or if the person I’m with just isn’t right for me. 

I’ve been emotional and attempted to explain anxious attachment style to him. At first, he appeared really receptive but I am having to express my needs week after week. I explained that canceling, inconsistency, and lack of follow through create blocks for me when building trust. 

I had a minor surgery a week ago and over a month ago, he agreed to be my designated driver to and back since I couldn’t drive myself. Two days before surgery I checked in, and he told me no. He claims it’s because we didn’t talk about it enough for him to make plans accordingly, but this is hard for me to understand because I told him over a month ago and he said he’d make arrangements. Then, my surgery almost was cancelled because the hospital does not allow Uber to pick up patients but I had no other options for pick up/ drop off. 

Next, he said he’d make dinner for me after work. After work came, and I started driving to him place and he said he forgot and he wanted to cancel. This was one day after speaking about how it’s important to me to only commit to plans you are able to follow through with. I also acknowledged people are human, but consistent cancelling is not good for me. 

There have been other times where we have had great dates and fun times together. I could write more but I’m really struggling to see if it’s my disorder causing problems or if I am not okay with who he is. 

He also said he’d come to my birthday and meet my friends. Then today, he again went back on his word, saying he doesn’t think he wants to and that it is too early. I feel like I’m communicating and he isn’t doing anything different in response. Any advice would be appreciated thank you!",1678768252.0,False,2,3,Impossible_Abies4589,None,11qwkqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/11qwkqf/bpd_and_new_relationship/
36,slowly but surely I'm making it,"It's been a while since i posted on this reddit but so much has changed and grown. I grew a lot, got help, made new friends, found lovers along the way and with each passing day, I began to heal despite the new pain coming in. 

I don't really know where I am on my BPD remission journey... But it's possible. 

It's possible to have healthy relationships in both friends and romance without splitting so bad. It's even easier when they all understand that you're a human and need a chance to process and hold you accountable for the the things that hurt them. 

They gave me a chance to grow, believed in my potential to heal and be better, they aided me with peer review and accountability and of course with every friend and romantic partner i lost, I begin to realize, newer, better ones come in and offer new perspectives and different ways to cope and grow. 

I sit here now, writing this as I do my Relationship DBT questions on two new friends i've met, and reading through it, reflecting back on it, makes me remember how far I've genuinely have come. 

Abandonment is a horrible thing to heal from. It's hard it sucks and it's painful and sometimes healing isn't for everyone. But the friends I have now, the ones I make, and the ones who stay with me, they make me feel less alone. And yes while I'll rehash old traumas and deal with the symptoms as they come, 

I can honestly say that life has been a lot better the more i continue my healing journey from bpd. 

And BPD is terminal. It can't be cured with anything. Therapy and medications and learning ways to make things easier and healthier for yourself through coping strategies may be the closest thing to a ""cure"" but it's a lot of hard work. 

it's hard work that I actively continue in order to keep healthy relationships, strong boundaries and honest communications with, because I deserve a chance to be happy and live a healthy life while living with BPD. 

So I guess if you're reading this, It's possible. It's possible to heal and to grow from the severity of it all. While it'll always be with you, You can find comfort in knowing that it's at least possible to ease the symptoms, to live a normal and healthy life style as Someone wBPD. So to whoever needed a sign to not give up and to see if it was possible, 

It is. 

Here's to the long progression of my own recovery, and all the beautiful places and people it will lead me to. 

And Here's to you, the reader. 

Everyone's journey is different, it's scary and it can be hard. But peace is just right around the corner. So don't trip, move at your own pace and just know there's someone out there who believes in you.",1686345948.0,False,17,2,Kitchen_Case1862,None,145hbh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/145hbh9/slowly_but_surely_im_making_it/
37,Tips on making progress without a therapist?,"I've not had a therapist for over a year, I had DBT but moved away and couldn't find the right kind of support in my new city. (I'm in the UK so have limited NHS options)

I was so busy working and studying I just kept going but I know now I still have a lot of work to do and I need a therapist. I'm on a waiting list for high intensity CBT for anxiety, because I'm not in crisis I don't fit the criteria for DBT. Trying to remain positive but aware that it might not be the support I'm looking for.

Does anyone have any tips on working through trauma, negative thinking patterns, emotional regulation etc by yourself? Is it possible? Should I consider private therapy? 

I would like to be a therapist to myself and I know I've made a lot of progress. I have a lot more trust and love for myself. Sometimes it still feels like I'm faking it all and just as broken underneath. I guess I still want that external validation to get better. Maybe I won't ever be better than this? It's still so hard week to week. I hope I will find things easier one day.

38,About to embark on a 32 week DBT/Therapy program - spaces available in the group DBT sessions,"I am about to bite the bullet and begin a course of therapy and DBT training.  It’s going to send me into debt, but I’ve been in debt before and never for anything this valuable.

After searching online, I have found a licensed professional counselor and psychologist who is trained and experienced in working with pwBPD and in facilitating DBT Skills training sessions.

This therapist has a solid track record and (like Linehan) does not suggest medication – and very importantly to me, does not suggest facing or exploring traumas during this program.  This appeals to me.

I am in Asia, so I have been looking all over.  This counselor is based in the UK – and recommends a 32 week program – two sessions a week. One session each week will be group DBT Skills training, and the other will be 1 on 1 sessions exploring and applying the DBT training.

Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 2 (8 weeks) 	emotion regulation
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 3 (8 weeks)	interpersonal effectiveness
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 4 (8 weeks)	distress tolerance
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness

What is really tough for me is the cost – the session cost is 95GBP per session.  However, they would pro-rata this rate for the group DBT sessions – 95 divided by the number of participants.  That appeals to me because I learn very well in a group, and the pwBPD support group I take part in has been very valuable to me.

They are currently reaching out to colleagues to learn if there are others being treated who would like to be part of DBT Skills training and therapy.  So I want to share that opportunity here.

I recognize it is expensive.  I am fortunate enough that a close friend has seen how I suffered in the past 18 months and is lending me the money – it will take me quite a while to pay it back but its so much more important than anything I ever went into debt for.   It is also a solid commitment – they require we sign a contract  to commit to the program.

While it might not be for everyone here, I thought it might be worthwhile to present it to see who in this subreddit is interested.  I am eager to get started, to finally take a step I have never done and commit to 8 months of difficult weekly work.  It would certainly make it easier if the group sessions had 3-5 people, and not only me or me and one other.

IF you are interested, feel you can manage the cost (with a group session reduction as indicated), and want to know more; PM me.  I am happy to share the therapists profile and answer what I can, and connect you with them if you want to know more – they offer a free consultation session to help you decide if its right for you.

Thanks everyone, and please pardon if this is a weird thing to post… I am mainly trying to get started on healing myself.",1621955276.0,False,22,6,IraJohnson,None,nkry8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/nkry8m/about_to_embark_on_a_32_week_dbttherapy_program/
39,I’m over me,"I’m not being my best for myself or my partner.

Since the pandemic, I have become extremely codependent with my bf, increasingly stressed with work, lack of self care, and my mental health is deteriorating. I’m broke and can’t afford meds/therapy or I would definitely be on them by now.

I’m realizing that any time my partner leaves to go hangout with friends I get a flood of heavy ass emotions. For example: I’m not good enough, a burden, self hatred, jealous of whoever he is hanging out with, and most importantly suicidal ideations.  It’s like as soon as he makes plans I immediately feel abandoned. I think this is some sort of unresolved trauma/“daddy issues”. I want to stop reacting and obsessing over everything and just be ok if I am alone for a few hours without taking it personally.

When I’m having these episodes I blow my partner up almost immediately after he leaves and tell him I feel _____(insert unhealthy toxic emotion here). He never goes out and at this point is tired of my shit and I’m not delusional I understand- but in the moment when he is placing a boundary I lose it. It turns into a huge panic attack and it’s Extremely unfair to him. I’m going to lose him if I can’t get a hold of my emotions and insecurities. 

I’m not looking for judgements, but I figured venting here is a better outlet than crying :) I’ve looked into BPD and was wondering if anyone has some info on that. 

Everything always ends up with me saying  a “you don’t love me” thing and not just to my bf to anyone I feel hurt by. I am in control of what I do and say yet I say some really manipulating off the wall shit sometimes. Hopefully I don’t self sabotage and drive everyone away.",1613953642.0,False,19,6,Deritaf,None,lpaor5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/lpaor5/im_over_me/
40,Perceived vs real betrayal/abandonment - advice for me and my SO please 🙏 (tweet for reference),"TLDR; with reference to this Tweet that I showed my bf, he asked when I am triggered and experience this, how can he deal it in the best way possible to avoid as much conflict possible? I honestly don't know the answer to this so would appreciate some advice please.

More context: I (29F) showed my boyfriend (33M) of 4 years this Tweet as it applies to me and I try to educate him about my trauma and how it affects me and how my brain operates so he can understand me better. We are trying to work through and improve our relationship which is heavily affected by my BPD and mental health issues. Sometimes he will do or say things that trigger me to feel/think he is betraying or abandoning me and my brain fully convinces me that this is the case (and I never know if it is real or imagined), I guess subconsciously to protect myself from getting hurt which inevitably does the opposite and leads us to break into massive blowout fights, which ruin all of our progress up to that point, even when things have been going super well for a while and then before I know it we're suddenly on the brink of splitting up and he starts questioning if there is any hope for our future at all. All because of my fucking triggers, disassociations, neurosis when my mind perceives the threat of betrayal or abandonment.

He always claims he is not doing what I think he is and I have no way of knowing if he is telling the truth or lying. For me trust doesn't even matter at this point because after experiencing so many REAL betrayals and abandonments from people close to me who I never would have ever expected to do so, my brain is so hypervigilant and on alert to suspect anyone could do that to me, it doesn't matter who they are anymore. Nobody is safe, no one can be trusted. Whenever I let my guard down and allow myself to trust and be vulnerable, people take advantage of it and then stab me in the back. The pain that occurs inside of me is gut wrenching and makes me withdraw and feel suspicious of people even more.

I am nothing like the person I used to be. I used to be a social butterfly and musician, I could not go a week without seeing friends, going to gigs and performing and ocializing, but since I've been so ill and debilitated the past few years as well as other factors, I've become an empty shell of who I used to be, severely isolated and living a hermit lifestyle. I have not seen any friends in 4 months, back in active addiction, anxiety, depression, BPD at its worst. This is my rock bottom.

I have a plethora of personal and family crises going on constantly piling up (the list just never ends, my whole adult life has been in survival mode), causing me so much inner turmoil, pain, grief, distress, depression, anxiety. I have become disabled by my multiple incurable chronic illnesses, my social life has become non existent, I fucking dread waking upon every next day miserably existing and nightmares at night. It's unbearable to be awake and be not awake. There's no escape, no peace, no way out. My illnesses have stolen my life away and everything I ever enjoyed and loved doing. I have lost all purpose in life, my sense of identity, motivation and any hope of ever being happy. I'm constantly overwhelmed, started self harming for the first time in my life, relapsed on drugs a few months ago (landed me up in the ER one night in Dec) and I'm admitting myself into a mental health clinic for 3 weeks on Thursday before I finish my degree online (there is no way I can study like this so it has to be before). 

I am in therapy, medicated (although I need to adjust/change my meds), but we just had our end of year summer holidays and my psychologist was away for a month, my psychiatrist has become absolutely useless and unreliable and has ignored me since mid December and other times last year when I needed his help (actual abandonment). I've been seeing my psychiatrist since 2020 and he has let me down so badly and become impossible to get hold of, I genuinely don't think this man has any interest in helping me anymore and may have to find another one, starting new after 4 years will be so fucking exhausting.",1707169567.0,False,6,0,tabasco_kat,None,1ajskqw,https://i.redd.it/lyqzryvl7ugc1.jpeg
41,It actually does get better,"I was cleaning my kitchen today, and the song Wake Up Alone by Amy Winehouse came on.

This song and the whole album (Back To Black is basically BPD: The Album, seriously, if you haven’t heard it and feel safe to do so, have a listen CW for substance abuse) are associated with one of my lowest times of my life ever.

I started crying immediately as I felt those feelings flood back. The desperation, the loneliness, the overwhelming fear. All the nights crying, staring at my phone, calling them over and over and over in a dissociative haze. The way I only felt like an actual person when I was with someone, actively being focused on, giving myself wholly and completely to them. The numerous attempts to find ANYTHING that would dull the ache inside of me. The pure fear of night, and the crushing blow of waking up alone.

There’s a part in it that used to resonate with me so much:

“Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets”

I used to fear night time and being on my own so much. But here I was, it’s the evening, I’m alone in my kitchen cleaning after a nice meal, happily singing along to music. No fear, no dread, actually a “silent sense of content.”

It’s been about 10 years since that awful time, and things have changed. I got treatment, found a loving stable partner, who I have great communication with, have a pleasant and safe life. I’m not saying I’m cured, or I’m 100% happy all the time, in fact I’m currently in therapy to do trauma processing.

But I don’t feel THAT feeling anymore. The desperation doesn’t hit me like that any longer. I don’t have that crushing pain in my chest that drives me to do ANYTHING I can to get rid of it, no matter the cost. I still feel a version of it on occasion but it doesn’t command me.

I’m no longer living my life running away as fast as I can from that feeling.

10 years ago I could have never ever believed it. I thought I’d be stuck with it for life. I wish I could have told me then it wouldn’t last, there was relief ahead.

So, if you’re in the thick of it right now, please believe me, from someone who’s been tear stained and aching too, one day you’ll just be happily tidying your kitchen, and the feeling you feel right now will be a distant memory. 

Keep going, care for yourself, and you’ll get there.",1608344387.0,False,92,11,PancakePartyAllNight,None,kfz8uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/kfz8uo/it_actually_does_get_better/
42,My partner accused me of stealing his emotions (cross-post),"My partner (m38) is also extremely mentally ill. He's erratic, mercurial and has bouts of explosive anger. It's typically not towards me specifically but he screams and stammers in this high pitch voice and when I (m30) get upset or freaked out and say anything, he tells me that I'm stealing his thunder and that I keep him from expressing his emotions because I make everything about me. He even suggested that he could prove it by manipulating me by faking emotions to see if I copy him. It's gotten worse since he learned that pwBPD have the potential for elevated emotional mirroring.

This is not my intention. I try to stay quiet and keep a cool head but sometimes I cannot keep from saying something or being physically affected (i.e. crying or having an angry expression) He is currently in the middle of an ongoing breakdown and as a result, literally anything that upsets me is considered paltry. He constantly asks me, ""what are you so sad about?"" As though I don't have a personality disorder, cPTSD, GAD, depression and a myriad of other fucked up shit from both genetics and a shitload of trauma. Our relationship is toxic but hey, unstable relationships are part of the game, I guess.

I have no job because my brain is fucking fried and he's under an absurd amount of pressure to work a job he hates and so I try to minimize what I can because he has so much responsibility. If he puts me down or accuses me of only caring about myself, like he often does, and I begin telling him that he is obviously better off without a burden like me, I get the routine, ""ope, here we going. Swinging the pendulum."" Or again, accusing me of trying to make everything about myself. He also gets angry if I don't say anything to him and will start asking, ""are you not talking to me?"" I have extremely bad days too and I can't express them without him claiming that I'm one upping him. I'm so exhausted.

I can't leave him because I have literally nothing. No money, no car, no family to rely on. My family essentially cut ties because I'm trans. (Today he also guilted me about not getting along with the rest of my estranged, bigoted family because both of his parents have passed away, whereas my mom is still alive and I have 4 siblings) I'm also fairly certain that if I leave, he might cease to exist. That's not even an exaggeration. I can't have him committed because he'd lose his job and everything he has. I can't commit myself because I'd be seen as attention-seeking.

As the child of an alcoholic, I guess it's no surprise that my partner of eight years would end up being one too. He's been sober for 9 months and constantly reminds me that it wasn't his choice. (He had become increasingly emotionally abusive over a period of a couple years and I was trying to make plans to leave him.) I'm not sure two people with these levels of mental illness can be together without destroying each other. I can't fall apart because he's falling apart. I can't feel joy because he can't feel joy. I can't be upset because he is upset.

There's nothing left. I want to not be in existence anymore so so often but I'm trying. I'm in therapy and on medication that doesn't fucking help, I've done workbooks, done things affirm important parts of my life, I've set and achieved goals and in the end, everything in my life is a fucking wreck and so much of it feels like it's my fault. Maybe I really am an emotional vacuum.

I'm trying hard to keep it together. I'm trying hard to be the strong one. I am exhausted every day of my life, physically and mentally and it all just gets worse. Everyone leaves. My family, my friends, my other partners and my partner has emotionally checked out of our relationship. Every circumstance is fucked, the climate, the government, my family, my past, my relationships, my brain and even my pets. I don't know who I am from day to day. Apparently I am a selfish, attention seeking, spotlight thief.

Even now, I've made this whole post about myself, my needs and my emotions. I hate myself so much. I don't want this life or this body or mind. I hate me.

I know no one will read all of this and that it's filled with a thousand different directions of problems. I just needed to spill my guts somewhere where I can't hurt anyone else.

43,There is hope.,"I have no formal diagnosis but I firmly believe that I once had BPD. I used fit the criteria to a T. I'm writing this in hope that I can help others, give others hope and maybe inspire some of you. 

First, background, as it's all relevant. 

I had an unstable childhood, lots of trauma and abuse. I was thrown out at 15 and had to pretty much fend for myself. From the ages of 15 to 27 I lived a hugely chaotic life, moving from place to place and unable to hold down a job, relationship or anything meaningful. 
I was abusive in all my previous relationships, never physical, but emotional. I would lash out at the most minor inconvenience, I was angry and aggressive and I create an environment whereby all those around me felt as though they were walking on eggshells. I had the most poisonous tongue known to man and I'd hit people exactly where I knew it would hurt. I was never satisfied. I always wanted and expected far too much from those around me and when I felt I hadn't gotten what I deserve, I would attack with words and empty threats. I would threaten partners with leaving them. I would tell partners they were meaningless to me, I'd tell them I didn't love them, nor did I want them around. I would cause arguments with people literally every day of my life. I would ruin outings and social events. I used suicide as a threat and as a means of control. I don't believe, during these years, I had the mental capacity, or genuine desire to better my behaviour. Luckily for me I have a fantastic group of friends who have stood by me, regardless of all my faults, and regardless of pain I have caused them. 

Fast forward to my 26th year and I decided I needed to change. For me, there was no big event that led to this, it was a decision I made based on how I felt my life and relationships would turn out if I continued as I was. I wanted to be a better person and rectify my wrongdoings as much as is possible. I began reading self-help books and researched BPD. I was later diagnosed with ADHD, severe depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Eventually, after months of trying medicines, I was put on Venlafaxine. This was both a blessing and a curse. My moods became stable, I had better emotional regulation and I had no desire to hurt those around me, no matter how upset I became. Alas, this came with conditions: My sex drive is constantly low and I have to actively work on this, although able to understand emotion, I feel very little emotion and my passion for life and my previous interests has dissipated. It's a sacrifice I choose to make because I want to be a good person.
Since taking meds I have invested countless hours reading and educating myself on neuropsychology, BPD, trauma, neuroplasticity, anything I felt may help me to better understand my behaviours, and various literature, both academic and otherwise, regarding changing responses and behaviours. 

It's been a long road and it isn't over. I still slip up every now and again but I am so much healthier and better able to handle emotional situations. I am emotionally available, discussing feelings and thoughts with those in my life. I take my meds as I am supposed to. I rarely react with anger. I ask others opinions before I respond, so as to guage whether or not my feelings/reactions are in line with the situation. I NEVER call anyone names in malice. I listen before I jump to conclusions and I try to think with logic and reason at all times. I am now an asset to the people around me. 

I attribute my progress to a few things; education and understanding my conditions, discussing, with everyone in my life, all the negative things I had done and taking ownership of the damage I caused... This was paramount; taking Venlafaxine, for me this is a wonder drug, although please bear in mind that what works for one of us may not work for you; and taking LSD in a therapeutic environment, engineered for self reflection. 

I wanted to change so very much that I actively make it happen. It was my decisions alone that have led me to recovery and I cannot stress enough that recovery is only accessible to those who see the damage they cause, see the hurt and chaos, and then act alone (without need for encouragement from others) to better themselves. 

I still need therapy and I will continue to work on my flaws. I may have to do this for the duration of my life. I still suffer with the invasive thoughts. The evil remarks and hurtful comments still enter my head, but now I can observe these thoughts and I choose to act with compassion and understanding over anger and frustration. There is a better way. 

TL;DR Was an ar*sehole, sought meds and education. Now much better for it. LSD for a mind reset and discussions with everyone in my life led me to take ownership of my behaviours. Not an ar*sehole anymore.",1583850127.0,False,11,13,kitamajita,None,fgek26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fgek26/there_is_hope/
44,"I need help to understand, please help.","Okay, so this is going to be a long one. And I will throw in a TL;DR for those of you who want the spark notes, the full details are below. 

TL;DR: I (23M) have BDP, my partner (24F) and I have had a very hard year. Tomorrow is our anniversary. My BPD diagnosis is very recent, and it makes a lot of sense as to why I am the way I am. I hate that I have the tendencies to lie and distrust in the relationship and keep myself so guarded and try to grab control so badly when I feel I have none. I need help to understand where I’m going wrong and suggestions if possible on what I can do to better myself and to recognize when I’m splitting to stop dropping the ball in this relationship. I love this woman to death and I hate the way I am but it feels like I can’t help it. 

Okay, for those of you who want more of the picture, here you go, buckle up, because this is going to be very lengthy. 

I (23M) met my girlfriend (24F) last year in October on bumble. I haven’t had any relationship that has lasted or ended on good terms with the exception of a couple years ago (2019-2020) I was set to be married to a woman, joined the military, but shortly after boot camp and all that, she told me I changed too much and called it off. (Pretty much the longest standing relationship I had that was positive for me that was not abusive or a trauma bond, but I’ll spare your time and annoyance) I digress. We ended up chatting each other up, bonding and playing video games together and got into a relationship on New Year’s Day. Things for the first few months were stellar, but I kept secrets and lied to her about things in regards to myself because I hated who I really was ( I know it’s shitty and I hate myself for it). As time went on, I found that I only ever wanted to talk to her, be around her and do things with her because she helped me feel happier than I was. She noticed things were off and just not right. Caught me in my lies and called me out for it (rightfully so.) instead of owning up to any of them, I doubled down on them and I got defensive. I felt as though I was being attacked and threatened. The problem is this caused a lot bigger of fights and I felt like I did when I was a kid, and the way my dad yelled at me to get me to listen, I found myself doing the same to her and making her cry. I hated myself for it, but I just felt like I wasn’t getting heard at all. Like I was actively being ignored or blown off. Her attitudes about everything (justifiably) felt off, she seemed to be acting different toward me ( yes I know it was probably my anxiety and other issues picking up on things that weren’t there.) and she began talking to people I wasn’t comfortable with. And her response to the situation was “well, you need to deal with it. You need to trust me and it’s clear you don’t.” The problem is I do trust her, but I don’t trust the people she started talking to. I know she is okay and not going to do anything but I can’t seem to put the feeling off that someone will dupe her or steal her away or do some shifty things that will devastate me. This has caused a lot of issues between us because I can’t shake the feeling and she’s getting upset because she feels suffocated by me. (This has since changed because her stance is “I don’t really care anymore. If you can’t figure it out then you need to find someone who will put up with you doing this because I can easily find someone who won’t.”) so i have pretty much decided to just keep it to myself. Which truthfully messes with my head but it gives her the piece of mind so i will take that loss and try to turn it into a win somehow. 

Over time, i began therapy and she began telling me, “hey, I want you to answer yes or no to a couple things. Don’t explain, just yes or no.” And essentially asked me the questions that fall onto the MSI-BPD, and I answered 9/10 yes. She said to ask my therapist about her opinion on BPD, and when I did, she ended up telling me “actually, that’s something I have been wanting to bring up, I was looking at the notes from our previous appointments, and i would say you have anxiety issues, depression, BPD, and PTSD.” And this led into a whole rabbit hole.  I’ve kinda gotten to the point of noticing sometimes when I’m going to start having issues that are very abnormal and I chalk up to BPD and being over dramatic. Personally, I took the diagnosis really hard. Because growing up, I was a massive Star Wars nerd ( I still am) and always idolized Obi-Wan. I felt terrible watching Anakin go through what he did and the more I watched it growing up, the more I realized, I felt bad for Anakin (it’s assumed he has BPD, if you haven’t looked into it, please do, it’s actually very interesting to watch his journey through that lens.) I related to just wanting to be in control of my life and not have an obligation to what is supposed to be. I hated watching those around me that I love suffer and most of those times, I am the one to cause it. And getting the diagnosis to me, to me it meant I can never be like Obi-wan, always at peace with the lack of control. But it meant that I’ll always be like Anakin. And it broke me. I hate that I’m like this and have absolutely 0 control and that I feel destined to lose and fail at everything I do. 

Please, please give me advice, anything helps. I need help so I don’t lose this woman, she means the world to me and I hate that I keep failing her this much.",1703987661.0,False,0,1,MHRB010123,None,18uw9p9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18uw9p9/i_need_help_to_understand_please_help/
45,having bpd is the equivalent to having third degree burns all over your body,"long ass vent for myself tbh

""Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement""

Marsha linehan who developed the therapy method DBT said that about people who suffer from borderline.

It quite literally produces the most intense emotional pain of any mental illness, it has a fatality rate of 10% 45 times more than the general population. 

According to Linehan we lose all cognitive functioning during periods of extreme emotional distress which unfortunately for BPD can happen at the drop of a feather. 

Personally for me it used to be a raging burning feeling in my head. Where I couldnt hear the rational part of my brain telling me you love this person, this isn't you, you don't want to do this, it's not a big deal. The voice in the back of my head that shuts that shit down immediately now was practically silenced. I couldnt hear them no matter how much I tried. Or if I actually managed to hear them and gripped onto it to bring myself back; I would just spiral and fall right back into the pit anyways. Because I had never even started the true healing process. And because the person I was with fed the worst parts of my fears and insecurities. My brain was completely consumed with so much of that hurt/fear/insecurity/humilation and it turned to a unceasing completely blinding rage. I would fall back in again and again desperately clawing to get out but succumbing each time to the borderline insanity that involuntarily manifested in my brain. 

My most painful moments of BPD haunt me every day. The absolute loss of control I used to feel over the smallest most stupid things. Scream crying alone in my room again and again, feeling the extreme grief equivalent to all my loved ones being murdered in front of me repeatedly over a simple relationship ending, its literally hell on fucking earth. Right now my dog who I love more than anything (outside of my FP) even more than myself, could be murdered right in front of me and I still know it wouldn't even compare to what I felt in every moment of the nightmare that was my existence at the time. 

I remember thinking in those moments of absolute mania and panic that this was anguish beyond belief, nothing had ever compared or ever could. Not even the extreme torture and abuse from my childhood. And I got brushed off and told it wasn't nearly THAT bad and it just feels that way because I'm still so close to it. No way could the emotional pain ever match the insanity of what my step mum put me through. As if I wasn't the one who had to deal with and then overcome the unceasing years and years of nightmares, flashbacks and constant panic attacks. As if I don't remember how acute that particular pain is. 

Well it's been over a year now and my extreme physical pain experiences will never ever fucking compare to the absolute torture of those moments. I would go through the worst of the worst all again than feel even a moment of that. When I tell people that they really can't believe me. They hear what happened to me in childhood and then what my ex did to me and it's not even comparable to them. How could I even for a second say she hurt me more? 

People without BPD literally cannot even comprehend how painful and intense our emotions can get. How everything is dialled up to a billion and we have NO control over it. I truly believe the vast vast majority of them (even ones who have been seriously hurt) have never felt the amount of agony that BPD people (involuntarily) create in their own heads. I believe that, because I've been through extreme verbal sexual and physical abuse and it was nothing to how my brain blindsided and ambushed me when I got my first FP. I understand why it doesn't make sense to them they will never understand what we have to live with and go through every day just by existing. But for me personally no amount of my sexual trauma or physical torture will ever compare to the pain of just being with a favourite person who showed me my first experiences of ""love"", made me feel joy for the first time in my life and then had to leave me, moved on and no longer cared for me at all anymore. (Actually was actively out for my blood in my situation 😐) Especially when you only live for the people you love in the first place. They are your entire centre of existence. In your head it's absolutely inconceivable you could ever not dedicate every part of yourself to them. What do you do then...

Fortunately for me I healed. Back then, with the person I was with, my body did really feel like an exposed wound at all times. Any little thing could set it off and cause me extreme pain. She couldn't understand how much pain I was in because I was cursed to manifest it as anger. Of course that makes it hard to empathise with especially when you become a victim of abuse as a result. I truly couldn't control it, I didn't realise this at the time but she constantly unintentionally kept me in a state of fear of abandonment and continuously enforced insecurities surrounding my body and who I even am as a person. Every little thing would set me off subconsciously, it would effect my emotions and actions in ways I couldn't control or many times even notice. Because my feelings were constantly being hurt by her, constantly felt devestation bubbling under the surace because no one meant more to me, no one's effect on my emotions even came close. So sometimes it was overt and drastic. I truly could not understand my extreme reaction to something so stupid after. That wasn't me. No part of that was me I know now deep down to my core my need for control completely came from fear. I was 100x more sensitive, everything was so agonising all the time without me even realising. And unfortunately that led me to take it out on them which kept me in a constant state of shame and regret that I had to push down as well.

Throughout my childhood my brain learned that fight, not flight would save me. The only time the torture stopped was when I hurt them back. So when I feel pain or hurt or anything that destabilizes me; especially from the person who had grounded me the most and had once made me feel the safest and most loved when no one else has before. I became theirs. I quite literally belonged to them, I didn't even realise how miserable I was. Once they showed me that side to life I couldn't let go. I relied on them entirely for any sense of safety and comfort or happiness so subconsciously when they took that away from me my brain ""defends"" itself without my fucking permission. It haunts me that the people I loved the most I used to hurt the most. I wish it could have been anyone else than the people I care for so deeply. As much as I wish I internalized that pain...I couldn't, I really really fucking couldnt at the time. So I lashed out, again and again and again uncontrollably until she thankfully left me and I got to find someone I could actually have my skin and a true sense of safety with for the first time in my life. 

Immense healing happened so rapidly. She immediately made me feel secure in my body, and satisfied in general within the first few weeks, which gave me a huge boost of self esteem and motivation to actually practice self care and improve myself. I mean if she could find me beautiful this fucking girl then I gotta try. I had to actually be worthy of her. I will never let myself be unworthy again. I needed to stop being a depressed potato and actually be my best self. Be Bucky in a sense. Also she seemed so attracted to me, so into me and even my body. She saw something I never could I wanted to see myself for the first time through her eyes. See myself as beautiful. 

She gave me hope, actually hope I could be better and change everything. Undo all the excessive damage that was done to my brain. Figure out all the different personalities rattling around in there and learn to listen and focus on the ones that are actually me. Not manifested from the darkest, traumatised, survival mode parts of myself. I realised I had so many layers, so many different thought processes going on at once. Of course it led to instability. I needed to silence them... I started DBT. I grinded in therapy twice a week. I consistently took my Lamictal and started Vyvanse to help with the head buzzing. Worked full time while in school to afford the insurance. Let out my emotions through working with animals and working out. I felt satisfication with myself every day, not even exhausted cause atleast now I was trying. I was accomplishing something. Every day learning new things about myself and taking steps forward. I discovered crazy things about myself in therapy (not necessarily always fun stuff) but it opened my mind so much to hopefully bring out the best version of me. 



One of my most intense triggers was retroactive jealousy. It tormented me constantly in my last relationship it was one of the first big leaps to destroying it and continued to break it down further throughout. Every tiny thing used to set me off and make me feel incredibly insecure. It's hard to describe what it felt like it's been so long since I felt anything even similar and it wasn't quite as overwhelming as the black out split rages. So not as potent a memory for me. But it was a mix of masochism and deep deep insecurity and hatred of myself compared to CIS men, which led to rages and spiralling. I would make her confirm my worst fears again and again maybe just to hurt myself, maybe in desperate attempt to make it okay in my head. It was mental self harm and I didn't realise that. RAJ was completely new to me (in fact I didn't even know every through out what was really going on) and it absolutely blindsided me. After that I didn't even know how to deal with it, I didn't know where to begin. I don't think I even possibly could have with the person I was with. I could never have gotten to a point with them where I believed in myself, or didn't constantly hate myself, and wasnt stuck in perpetual loop of survival mode with.

I thought I experienced RAJ with her because she was my first FP but with my current FP I could prod myself all day and feel absolutely nothing. Not a shred of hurt or insecurity. She healed me so much by just making me feel unconditionally loved for the first time in my life. Physically being with her is incredibly important it's my #1 love language and she has built up my view of my body to heights I would have never imagined. We are so fucking intensely intimate all the time it's crazy (it's the bpd in us) Who else could fucking matter we are each other's universes. I know that I'm her world and no one else, even a CIS man could compare. (Seriously though retroactive jealousy as a transman dating a straight girl is the worst and made me act like a completely different person Jesus Christ) I know I don't have to feel jealous because every fucking day she shows me that. I don't feel completely disconnected and isolated from her. I'm so god damn lucky, she gives me such a sense of peace and fullfillment. I tricked myself into thinking my last relationship was anything close to love or feeling real love...when I don't feel that constant turmoil and instability, when I actually feel like enough, when I'm grounded in who I am and feel safe and secure with who I'm with; it's so so so much easier. Everything felt so out of control when my head was constantly scared and in defence mode with them. Constantly needing to win arguments because admitting I'm wrong takes vulnerability which I could not show to her. So easy to admit I'm wrong to my current partner and to just drop any disagreement because I feel subconsciously safe enough to give up all power to her anytime. Plus my current partner having BPD unlike my ex; she actually can understand the insane amount of pain we can feel over the smallest things. How it compares to nothing else. How out of that pain we can say and do things that aren't any part of us at all. She doesn't just write it off because its so extreme and irrational. We both can have so much empathy and understanding for each other and it's so peaceful. Never taking an us VS them mentality. Feeling like you're always on the same team with your partner. Constantly growing, learning and healing together. We don't argue at all because before it can even escalate we have already focused on listening and validating the other person in their concern and come to a conclusion together that works.

Along those lines she also helped me discover my severe sexual abuse, healed my ""partners family hating me trauma"" that I've experienced throughout the years for many different reasons, affirmed me constantly in every aspect of my body that used to destroy me, rekindled my relationship with my mum an old shame of mine. Basically pushed the kind, strong, grounded side of me to the surface with her unceasing support, and given me a first look at a stable normal happy healthy life. (god damn the way she went all out at Christmas for me, healed something deep to my little kid core) She was my first hope. Hope that we can actually achieve the dream future I've always pictured; become the person I always dreamed of. First real reason to have any ambition or to give a shit in life where my brain before was just in a dead end slump of hopelessness.

BPD is a fucking curse. But with the right support system and enough effort/ dedication it can actually be manageable. Life is so much easier when I can practice emotional regulation and actually grow my emotional skin for the first time. It may have been stripped from me as a kid but I know love, time, dedication and resources can heal me fully one day. I may always be a loaded gun because of what happened to me, and I've always struggled before to keep my finger off the trigger. But not anymore with the right toolset I'm going to destroy that trigger entirely.

46,Rant/BSsadstuff,"So
Sorry this is my first post and I’m sorry but holy crap I need to get this off my chest
And trigger warning: S/H and sewerslide mentioned

I’m not sure where to start. I (23F) have dated this guy we shall call Renegade (25M)
He and I met around 3 years ago. We were both single parents and freshly out of a horrible marriage and engagement. When we first dated things were awkward. His ex wife still lived with him and she hated my guts. Used her limited knowledge of my past against me (her go to ammo was the fact I had my daughter under surveillance for accused child neglect by DSS (side note that shit got thrown out the window and I got her back once the investigation was over and the accusations against me were deemed as false) and she would even go as low as the issues with my mental health despite the fact she had “self diagnosed” herself with the same disabilities that I have) 
Freaky right?
Anyway ex wife threatened to take Ren’s daughter away if I wasn’t immediately thrown out of the picture so I was stuck in a game of “how can I get rid of my new girlfriend without getting rid of her?” Until the game got too old to play for ren and he ditched me. 
After not hearing from ren in almost 2 years he reached out to me. Told me he finally moved out of his ex wife’s house and had split custody. For a few weeks I was hesitant on being involved with him again. I even mentioned the fact I can’t trust him because of the abandonment and the drama. But spoiler alert I eventually had no choice but to move in with him and restart our relationship. 
Weeks go by and things are decent. He helped me get back onto my feet financially however the issues still remained and even got worse with my mental health. I was constantly facing relapse after relapse with my self mutilation. He verbally expressed how disgusted and sad he was to see my scars and hated the fact that I was still addicted to the pain. Therapy and medications can only do so much sometimes. 
This was the start of the big downfall. 
Months go by and I’m finally trying to open up. If I could talk about my depression and suicidal thoughts maybe it would lessen to urge to cut?
Only downside is he hated hearing it. He would constantly bring up his dead grandfather and the trauma he had been given due to his death as a way to get me to stop talking. 
It seemed fair. 
And then when I got the memo to literally just shut up about my problems it created a psychological warfare. 
He would say or do something that would hurt me, I would shut down and not talk, and then he would go on a tangent about his problems with my problems. Even go as far as to set up timers for how long I would lay in bed crying and not saying a word to him and even use it against me. And when he realized that the verbal patronize on my issues wasn’t going much of anywhere because I can’t change overnight, he would go back to square one. 
The concept of “I don’t like how your body looks” 
And then cutting began all over again. And he would get angry. So angry as to yell at me, threaten to throw me into a psych ward and cut off all ties to me again. 
It didn’t stop. 
I couldn’t stop. 
I am a young broken hearted person that didn’t want others to fix me. I just want to stop being angry all the damn time. 
He wanted someone to fix; someone who had a happiness to control. 
Yes I did do and say things that were equally hurtful to him. He had insecurities too and I openly used some of them against him whenever I had the chance to walk away from his rant sessions of using my insecurities against me. Cat and mouse. Eye for an eye. A Mental western gun battle. 
And one day I had enough. Enough fights. Enough patronizing. Enough begging. Enough screaming and crying. Enough of asking him to show that he cares the way I want him to care. 
I was too angry to be civil so I went to war. 
I told him the way he talks to me when I’m already down is enough to make me want to die. I told him if he didn’t want to care (because he said it during a fight when it came to my emotions and why I was annoyed with him saying “I don’t care”) then I wasn’t going to ask him to try anymore. I was done for the last time. 
When I got home from work hours after that fight, my last moments with him were just a matter of time. 
I was drowning in guilt and sadness and anger. And I wanted to say I was sorry. 
I can’t remember much of that night. All I remember is him yelling at me for locking the bathroom door and saying I’m just a parasite. 
But sometime after the fight I had decided to take my life through OD. One second I’m sitting on the floor reading my text messages and the next I’m puking on a toilet and trying to allow my body to drift to sleep. The worst part of this was that both of our children were eating dinner. You read that right. I tried to take my life in front of our two 2 year olds. 
Some hours pass and I wake up on the couch. I can’t speak. Breathing is hard. I can’t move. All I feel is nausea and pain in my head. 
Ren wasn’t pleased with my condition and he knew. Eventually he put 2 and 2 together and realized that I was dying right in front of him like I promised I would do earlier that day. 
That was back in early august this year. 
Well I’m not going into the gory details of what happened afterwards other than I got help. Didn’t have a choice but I got it. 
I moved out of Rens house and into my manager’s house- let’s call her Aurora. 
Aurora and I have known and worked with each other for years and she always kept her door open for me. I’ve been with her for 4 months now. Our relationship truly is good and we only ever had 1 serious fight. We did agree on the decision to take things slow given the fact we are both scared and insecure and batshit crazy. 
Anyway onto the “where we are now” for this useless post:
My mental health is still in the trash where it always has been for the past 16 years. And that’s okay. 
My issue is that with time- grief never goes away. So everytime I think of ren or mentally see his face I want to cry and kind of punch it. I wish I could say I’ve moved on and that I’m no longer hurt or sad or angry but 
Well
Grief is difficult. A part of me still loves ren enough to have him tucked away in a tiny corner of my life, another part of me wants him to disappear off the face of the earth, and even a bigger part of me just wishes that attempt didn’t fail just so I wouldn’t have to be dealing with this. 
So as your TLDR: I dated a shallow guy with a kink of verbal humiliation and attempted to take my life in front of him after I saw how much of a bad person I am and months later, grief is weird and never goes away.",1700276763.0,False,1,0,Unanimousbeetle,None,17xwwu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17xwwu1/rantbssadstuff/
47,The victim in me,"
I’m writing this because I often avoid the pending anxieties that ding at the top of my nose. That’s where I feel it. Thoughts clouding my vision. I can no longer see myself. My stomach saturates with guilt. Panic like protein for my insecurity. Bone on bone. I have been shedding layers. It’s been nearly two years of this. I’m writing this because my brain is in constant fight or flight. I’m left with a very weak will to live. I am in survival mode at all times. There is a victim inside of me. She screams for my help. For my attention. I often ignore her. Tonight I will not only listen to her, hear her, comfort her. But I will let her speak. The person I want to be and the person that I was and the person I am all sit inside of my body. They each have different dreams, personalities, fears, insecurities. I am none of them and all of them. I am nothing and everything. I don’t know who I am. I am lost. And I’ll admit that. The way other people see me, the way they feel about me, the way they treat me and the way they don’t is something I obsess over. I have an urgency to gain the acceptance and love of others. I have a frequency to prove I can gain it. So I can love myself. I set limits on my own self love contingent on the love I receive from others. This is because I have a deeply routed fear of being abandoned. Being forgotten. Being replaced. Watching energy shift. Watching people grow out of me. Fall out of love with me. Out of friendship with me. I would do anything to reverse this fear. To be self sufficient and self loving. I often attract careless people. I often attract intentionally harmful people. I often attract specifically harmful people. I am sensitive to others. I am hurt easily. I attach easily. I detach easily. It is painful. It is exhausting. It is harmful. I have spent the last two years running from hard truths. My life has changed forever. I am incapable of returning to the way I felt and the way I saw the world before these events. I tried to heal on my own. I made a mess. I trusted everyone I knew. It was a mistake. I shared my deepest painful secret with my closest friends. It was a mistake. I confused friendship for therapy and I thought my transparency with my trauma would grant me some kind of rain check on life. Life kept moving. I did not. I lost myself entirely. I could not look myself in the eyes. My relationships with people I loved very deeply changed. My relationship with simple things like food and sleep changed. I could feel myself going crazy. Misdiagnosed. Drugged. Lost. And losing it. I became dependent on things. People. Drugs. Alcohol. Spending money. I thought if I could just stay manic. I could stay sane. I could be happy. The more I would open up, the heavier I would feel. I started to feel lonely. I became complacent. I started praying that God himself would wipe my existence from this earth. I prayed that I could run very away and become a new person. I still pray for this. I had a very hard year. Mental illness is not a small thing. I am the captain of a very large ship and I do not know the first thing about the sea. I’ve never driven a boat. The water is aggressive. I have several diagnoses and several pending. I have not been transparent with many people about my experiences with mental health. I think it’s because I care so deeply to be accepted by others and it is defining me. Taking me from my truths. I have had to remove people from my life. I have had to fully detach myself to grasp at what peace would feel like in my head. I am consumed by the idea and the fear that the people I love the deepest will eventually leave me. That they hate me. That they have never loved me. So I fulfill this and prove my fear correct by detaching. By running. When I see that no one has chased me, it is now not peace I feel from knowing I was right all along. It is my fight or flight. It is overwhelming anxiety. It is insecurity that now my deepest darkest painful secrets are now public record. That whatever hate I feared before is amplified. I often attract people with a specific trait. People who know everyone’s business, tell everyone’s business to everyone, talk horribly about the people that love them. Make others believe they would never do this to them because they are somehow immune. Lack empathy. Create a chaotic and mutually symbiotic environment that is in no way beneficial to either party. Create abusive cycles in which they with hold their love and support. This invents a competitive Olympic codependent gymnastics where I reinforce their ego and lack of empathy by falling to my knees and discarding whatever healthy pride I have preserved in order to service them. I remember being moments away from killing myself but instead responding to a text about a hookup crisis. My pain was never valid. My family member passed away. I was devastated. The day of the funeral I was having an anxiety attack because I needed to be of service to someone. The clock had started. I was afraid if I didn’t reach out and prove my service, they would have no reason to comfort me while i grieved. I was afraid I would altogether lose them. I have been so afraid of losing people that I have gripped on to them. Gone out of my way to check on them. Take care of them. Listen to them. I became a service industry. Still unhealed. Exhausted. People I had made permanent places for in my life had been revealing their true colors to me. I found out one of my friends had developed a deep routed hate for me during this transitional and life altering period in my life. Saying terrible things about me to others and plotting their exit. This person ghosted me. Can I blame them? I am suffering from the residuals of deeply routed sexual traumas. The PTSD infiltrates my brain in many forms. I also suffer from borderline personality disorder. Body dysmorphia. Disordered eating. Major depression. Anxiety. Panic Disorder. ADHD. I fight myself daily to accomplish any goals. Sometimes I’m lucky if I brush my teeth. My exhaustion is defeating. I have dreams. Big dreams. Sometimes I think maybe I should kill myself before I have to live to see them never come true. I compare myself to everyone I see on the internet. I have low self esteem. I have a college degree. I cannot hold a job. I cannot find a job to hold. Everything feels like it was all for nothing. But still I have hope. Despite spending all of my energy on the worry of what others think of me. I have hope. I have friends. I have family. I am not hopeless. Not anymore. But I am lost. And I feel like a victim to my own life. I’m trying to take control of the way I feel and push myself into the wings I’m expecting to grow in. I am being to forceful. Too impatient. I am harming myself. Stunting my growth. Haulting my healing. People want explanations from me. I don’t have one to give. I am in pain. I am suffering from my own mind. I am trapped inside my body. I am trying to find my way out. I am trying to find my peace. Pray for me. Please someone pray for me. Tell me my feelings are valid. Tell me to stop blaming myself for the things I can’t change. Give me a shortcut to healing. Show me a cheat sheet. Hand me the blueprint. This came with no instructions. I’m exhausted. I’m trying to keep my momentum. I’m trying to push myself farther but not harder. The added stress will only make me shut down and turn off. I am in need of kind words and encouragement. I am in desperate need of love.",1604740418.0,False,7,2,sadbutveryhotbutsad,None,jpnslz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/jpnslz/the_victim_in_me/

53,Question to those who are recovering from BPD - how long does it take to 'fix' identity issues?,"Hi everyone!

I am 28 (f) and I have been diagnosed with BPD \~2 years ago (I've been in therapy long before, but it was not helpful until I found good DBT therapist).

For 1 year I had a very intensive personal therapy and DBT trainings, finished it 1 year ago (the demand is high that's why my therapist let me go once she admitted I was stable enough), I am still doing exercises, reflecting a lot, and I feel like I am recovering.

Don't take me wrong - BPD is still part of my life, but life is *in order* now.  

Here's the trick - although I managed to gain distress tolerance skills, improved interpersonal communication, managing emotions etc - disturbed identity is something that I can't 'fix' yet.

I keep questioning where's me and where's the disorder, and it seems like the most difficult part of my recovery. This is one of the reasons why I am hesitant about getting into a new romantic relationship - I am scared that because I sometimes don't know what I want/need, this won't be healthy.

I'm starting to suspect that this is something that I cannot force and it will take years of life without BPD turmoil before I start feeling more 'solid'.

56,"Drugged and raped, told to get over it","I’m basically 23F, diagnosed with BPD for over 2 years now. Basically 3 years ago I was on holidays they last night I went out to a night club and then BOOM no memories. Was reported as a missing person in Spain, my mum was manic looking for me and then my first memory is being found a beach getting covered up and guided into a police car. 

I don’t remember the drive, I remember pulling up outside my resort...waiting at reception, then I remember my mum opening the door and I just come in and collapse on the bed and start crying like I’ve never cried before.

I then try snap myself out off it as my 10 & 11 year old sisters are in the room, I take myself to the bathroom to clean up and I go for a pee. That’s when I notice I’m in pain down there, I call my mum threw and just break down feeling like a shell off a person with no idea what happened, did I consent, was a passed out facedown and someone decided to take advantage. I dread coming across myself on a porn site one day.

I spoke to my closets friends day this happened as I was a mess and just trying to make sense off everything. All I had to do was make it to 6am and I would be on a plane out of the country. I put it too the back off my head, just told myself it’s just another stupid drunken situation I’ve got myself in. 

Now I didn’t think I was affected my this until recently, I have IBS and the past 3 years put me feeling sick and spewing every time I drink down to this, however this has now been ruled out and I was baffled. 

Then one day in the car I just realised omg I think it’s my trauma, I’m too scared to drink cause off what happened. I think off that day more than I’d like to admit to myself. 

I tried to speak with my partner about this, He told me I just need to get over..
he’s never good about talking about feelings, I wish he was but okay...my feelings are justified (I tell myself this and that I didn’t deserve to get raped pretty much most days over and over, cause I don’t really believe it) 
Okay I’ll try talk to my mum, she can be a selfish person at times but she said that was the worst day off her life and she pictured taking me home in a coffin when I was missing. First time i try she just tell me to get over it (I tell myself maybe she doesn’t get how much this effects me). So I try to talk to my BF and Mum and second and try to explain how much it’s effecting me in so many different aspects off my life I’m told to get over it again.

When I was trying to drinking, whether that be 3 cans or 3 sips I feel I’ll and spew. So I stop drinking at parties and decide if I feel up for it I’ll drink...I’ll still spew and have heart palpitations. So now I’ve decided I don’t drink alcohol, when me and BF have friends up for drinks I still get nervous butterflies but it’s okay. I struggle with the fact, that’s I should have been more careful in a strange country, I know no one and I’m at the club alone. So many bad decisions I hate myself (I partially blame undiagnosed, Unmedicated me)

I was going crazy. Just crazy. I don’t even want to talk about it because it’s so shameful.
The breakdown was caused by lots of things, but major thing was school stress, alcohol, etc.

I got hospitalized again. 3rd time.
I was having a good calming 72 hours.
Later on I have realized I am an alcoholic. 

So I quit, I think at least 40% of my sanity comes from not drinking. I tried A.A in person and online plus networking, I personally didn’t like it.

Then my psychiatrist prescribed me Librium, I was on over than reg dose for anxiety -(reg dose that ppl take in google) 
I was being a zombie but I think it was worthy, I’m tired of laying down all day.

Since I was a zombie I decreased the dose, switched to klonopin since quantity is not available for some reasons in my area. 
I was on 1 mg, started SNRI -Pristiq. 
25mg once daily didn’t work.
50mg I felt difference after I started taking it for like more than 3 weeks.

As time goes on, I added weed (vaping and consuming medical weed) for tapering benzo+I like the effect. Makes me distracted when I am upset sometimes, when I need a calming time, morning time before my pharma med kicks in, before I go to bed.

I take only 0.25 of klpin twice daily.



So
-Antidepressant reg dose (everyone is different, Pristiq was my match)

-No alcohol (my emotional side gets crazy)

I am far better than who I was exactly a year ago. I dropped out of school, I got a small job, talking to my parents, I don’t feel so miserable like before. I don’t want to kill myself for things that don’t matter.

I’m just gonna get a certification.

I ended up having a breakdown in a room while trying to speak to emergency mental health services and disassociated until I finally just kind of went numb and went home.

The thing is i joined my med school in 2014 forced by my parents despite their poor financial conditions. And to this date, I havent finished my med school yet part of the reason is the constant financial issues from my parents side for which even now there is no clear cut solution and add to that my mental health issues are getting worse and worse thanks to the fact the I am unable to move on in my life, it's like for the past 10 years time has just stopped for me, my batch mates, they cleared their med school now they even on the verge on finishing with their specialization. 
Through this post I want to ask you guys for help because my life is completely f ucke d up. I am 29 and soon I will be 30 and I honestly don't want to continue like this. For all these years I hoped that my parents will figure shit financially because the mer school I was enrolled has a hefty amount money as fees. 
As of now I am planning move out of my college hostel, because sooner or later they will themselves throw me out due to non-payment of hostel fees which was supposed to be paid in July 2023. And my certificates are with college for which I need about $4100 or £ 4400. Getting the certificates is not my current issue. 
The thing with which I need help the most is to get out my college hostel and find an accommodation outside. I ahve already enrolled in a diploma course for content marketing which costs a total of $64 or £59, out of which I managed to pay $136 or £124. But I still need to pay for the remaining 5 months which is about $99 or £91 . And the due date for 2nd Installment is 6th January 2024.

So in short if I sum the following are my current financial requirements: 

Rent + brokerage+ deposit: $1955 or £1781
need a laptop to find freelance work: $481 or £440
Fee for diploma course: $99 or £91
My bsc anthropology 1st year fee: $74.5 or £68.2
Application fee: $3.6 or £3.3
Backup for utility expense till I mangage to stand on my feet: $289 or £274
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total: $2902.1 or £2657.5

Since this a BPD support group, I am not sure if I am allowed to post it here. But if there is any problem with me posting it here, I will be more than welcome to take it down.

I have attacehed with this post a copy of how much hostel fee I need to pay, the coat of accommodation for the place I chose, my diploma course which is due on 6th January, the application form fee IGNOU, as well the three year feea for my Bsc Online distance learning course. The amounts mentioned in all the copies are in INR,,so in my post above a gave a rough estimate as to how much it will coat me in USD or Euro. 


Here is my PayPal link, if anyone who goes through this post and wishes to help because it matters a lot to me. It's like my only or maybe last chance of making my life worth living after continuously struggling with suicidal ideations, self harm amd with no one to even support not even my parents.

49,I’m surviving the worst part of my life. Recovery IS possible and I’m proof of it.,"Long post ahead. Tl;dr at the bottom.

For some background, I’m 29, just got diagnosed BPD last September. Despite that I struggled my entire life (suicidal thoughts, self harm, toxic relationships, MULTIPLE trips to the ER and I still was never properly diagnosed). I started DBT in October and just finished the program in April. I also started lamictal last year but just got on a dose that worked for me around February.

A little over three weeks ago, my husband got physically violent with me. He had “only” been verbally abusive in the past, which I let happen because I believed he would get better, even though he never even promised he would. 

And I LEFT. I just LEFT. I’ve never really felt the FP thing, but I definitely let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to me in the past. And I know if this happened a year ago…I would have stayed. I would have let him tell me he only hit me because my behavior made him. I would have let him make me believe I was the one who was getting the second chance to not fuck up. 

But after a year of intense therapy and meds (less than a year actually) I had the ability to leave him. And when he tried to control me, I still left. And when it meant I’d have to live alone, I still left. And even when I had a full emotional breakdown on our first wedding anniversary, one week after he hit me, I still left.

Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am for keeping myself safe, something I never have done in the past. This is the hardest and worst thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. But I know I’ll survive, and honestly, I owe that to DBT and all the work I put into it.

Please don’t give up hope. Keep trying, keep putting in the work. It’s worth it and so are you.

He showed me texts between him and his friend (who is a girl). He was laughing at the phone and I felt a pang of jealousy in my chest. Something I could normally suppress much more easily turned into chaos. The next five minutes were a blur. I pulled away from him and paced around the carousel like a fucking baby rejecting all his loving advances. I have no clue what happened to me, I was operating on a motor. It was confusing and scary. I finally settle a bit and he shuts down. Says I made him feel like shit. I immediately go into panic mode trying to win his affections back. I apologized profusely and said I was exhausted and that was bad and tried being sweet but he was just shut down. I feel awful. He doesn’t deserve this.. The last few days were tough too because I cried over little things and it exhausted him. Anyway it’s the next morning and he’s still being distant from me and I’m afraid he’s going to leave me. I’m in so much pain. I want to control myself because I know the best way to ease the situation is to not cry right now and have another insane abandonment reaction. But it’s so hard. 
I know he’s going to want some space from me for a couple days because of this. And he’s probably going to be happier away from me probably rn.  That’s causing me so much pain that i cannot show. Anyway, how do I deal with his distance? And if he in fact does not dump me today or tomorrow, how do I work on this? I’m on meds (lamictal) and I’m in therapy. Please help. This man is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. He’s sweet kind loving incredible, the whole package. I want to be good for him and to him.

51,Bpd Questions?,"Does anyone else feel confused by their actual diagnosis? I was diagnosed with multiple things including bpd and wondering if anyone feels the same about certain bpd topics as I do. 

First I feel unsure of what “bpd” even actually IS. I understand my other diagnoses like, 
depression - sad. 
Pdd - always been sad. 
Ptsd - sad and scared because of past. 
Anxiety- always nervous.
But Bpd - … just bad brain?

Second, does anyone’s family or significant other ever tell them “this is your bpd talking” or things of that nature? How do I know he’s not saying this just to get his way what if I’m actually right and my diagnosis is being used to control me in a sense?

Third, does anyone ever stop taking they’re meds in a type of form of self preservation? I feel like on my meds I just kind of push everything down and do whatever people want and I need to stop taking them to stand up for myself.

Does anyone else feel kind of like this or is my thinking unfounded and not normal? Please tell me if I am being crazy I need unbiased answers",1645764546.0,False,1,1,bluesefs,None,t0v8u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/t0v8u7/bpd_questions/
52,Help Navigating Help,"Howdy! Last year around October, I started counseling and medication again. I was in the tail end of a bad relationship and hadn’t had a job in months. Now, I’m single, live with super supportive friends, and have a job I’m extremely passionate about.

Unfortunately, I can’t really muster any of that passion. Since I began taking antidepressants in October, I have documented a severe decrease in my overall quality of life. This has also been documented on the app by both myself and my care team. I am on my 4th course of antidepressants this episode with only an increase in depression symptoms. I expressed this to my psychiatrist as well as my suggestion that I stop this course of meds, just to see if some of my symptoms decrease. There was some back and forth, and she called me aggressive (which was annoying because I’m just asserting myself, it’s my brain after all and no shit I’m irritable when I haven’t felt a positive emotion to my core in months). But I also understood because I was definitely channeling my anger to help me blow past my fawn response of compliance. Eventually, I explain that I had done some independent research and knew that other types of medications (anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics) could potentially be more useful. After that she backed off and was like, oh well if you need an anticonvulsant then we need to refer you to someone irl. To which I replied, I would rather be on the right course of meds than be on an online platform. In the end, we are trying new anxiety and sleep meds with no antidepressant (against the doc’s recommendation) for two months. If there’s no change, then she’ll recommend an antidepressant again. Ugh, the whole thing was really hard and I was shaking for most of it. I feel like my doc made it harder than it had to be though. Especially since I didn’t want to even begin the 4th course, at the end of the 3rd I said I wanted to stop antidepressants completely and was told to try again. 

Sorry, that was a lot, but I want to know how y’all go about recommending changes in your medications to your doctors and what you do when you meet resistance.

55,3 year update,"hey. i lasted posted in this thread 3 years ago now asking for advice again… 

Since then it’s been a lot of ups and downs. I was actually super in-denial of my diagnosis due to the way it you made things worse for me when seeking help through the nhs lol. So i went private and then ghosted my therapist lol. 

Anyways, I’m here now and only starting to accept my diagnosis. I need to, to ultimately get better. I’m in a relationship but it’s hard bc of my bpd (and absolute fear of men) but i’ve been with him for 3 years, he is super understanding, patient and caring. I often feel as if I am the toxic one - i think I am to a degree. 

Anyway the point of this post: I am asking for advice again. What do I do now. I am ready to fight my way through the system again for proper support. I can’t really afford to go private. So any recommendations on how to navigate the system ? Or tips . I just feel like i’m suppressing everything inside now because of my relationship, friendships and work. it’s making me go more into a dissociative state & hallucinations are coming up more frequently.

I’ve lurked on this sub for a few months now and I’ve been in remission for 1.5 years now. I had a very intense upbringing filled with domestic violence, sexual abuse, and bullying throughout my early childhood years but I was known for being a very sweet girl, top student in class throughout my K-12 years, generally always having a “fawn” response because of my intense fear of letting others down. My worst breakup occurred close to 2.5 years ago and it made me reevaluate everything I knew about love so I took a 1.5 year break from romantic relationships and went to CODA meetings, attended therapy weekly (CBT), and graduated from university and got my first big girl job as a school librarian. I’ve been with my lovely boyfriend for almost a year now (in may!!) and this is the FIRST time in my life where I haven’t blown up a person’s phone with nonsensical paragraphs about delusional bullshit and trauma. Mainly, if I’m having a bad day, I let him know in a very loving manner and request just a bit of time to cool down. I was diagnosed with autism 3ish years ago so it’s been quite a journey.

59,I'm always tired and lazy. My life is miserable and it's all my fault.,"I (21F) grew up in a pretty shitty household. A lot of my younger years I spent just trying to survive. Now that I'm older, I have a lot of issues, both mental and physical. I have chronic muscle tightness and pain EVERYWHERE, stress incontinence, debilitating migraines, and more. Been to the doctor and nothing seems to be wrong. Mentally, I'm pretty sure I have BPD, I have depression (been on meds for 2 years), and definitely on the autism spectrum. Been to therapy and a psychiatrist as well. 
My life feels unbelievably hard. I'm SO tired all the time. To the point where I'm bored, I want to be up and doing things but I'm just so tired. I won't even get up and eat, or make anything, so I'd rather starve all day instead. (Which is my main problem. I just don't eat enough.) I have 2 dogs that I didn't think I'd be raising alone, and recently quit a job that I hated and made my life even worse. 
Only thing I feel is good in my life is my boyfriend. He's so motivated, loves eating well and working out several times a week. He is such an inspiration and such an amazing man AND partner. I am beyond lucky to have him. I feel like I'm letting him down with my habits even if he doesn't look down on me and just wants me to be happy and healthy. He is truly the love of my life and I want to be better.

taking prescription meds already makes me feel uneasy, and ive been reading some scary things about it. i took the 5 mg last night and had a hard time falling asleep, and when i did i abruptly woke up with heavy nausea, to the point where i literally thought i was going to vomit, blurry vision, and tossing and turning. i didnt get much sleep and when i woke in the morning for work the world felt very dreamlike.

I was meant to see him the other day and I slept in alot of the day until 2pm in the afternoon because my medication makes me extremely tired. I never have any enegry. He texts me ""are you coming or am I going to sit here all day waiting for you doing nothing? I thought you would be here already"" I got quite upset. In the end he came to see me after a argument about it because he was worried about me. 

Then he said ""your watching the show catfish?  Now I know why your so insecure, because your always watching these shows about false insecurities""  his brought up that I'm insecure afew times now. I know I am. I make it known. I get jealous and I do think he will find someone else. Someone better. 

And then the same night I felt unloved and I don't know why. So I left the bed he was sleeping in and stayed in anther room sleeping. He woke up and told me he was leaving because he can't sleep and what's the point being at my place when I'm not there when he can sleep alone at his by himself. He did tell me that he was triggered though afterwards. he also suffers BPD and alot of trumua from childhood. 

I don't like how he raises his voice at my dog because she doesn't like him alone with me. She is a guard dog and always comes to check on me near the bed. I get tired of him getting angry at her and raising his voice at her. She does this with everyone btw. She's just trying to keep me safe

This is all new to me btw. This all happened within 1 day. I had not seen this side to him prioir to this. Normally his extremely caring, giving, understanding, and communicates really well. But it's sending me into a trumua state. It's making me scared of him and cry and not want to be near him. I have been in abusive relationships before so I don't know if it's a trumua response or not or if it's him. But I feel scared. I have done many years of threapy and I'm on so many meds all I want to do is sleep all the time because I'm so tired. I can barely get out of bed because I am a zombie at this point with the amount of meds I'm on just to make me act more ""normal"".

I can't lose this person, we've planned a life together and I dont think I'll ever find someone like them again.

Hey everyone I’m after some advice, I’m really struggling at the moment, and the gp has re-referred me back to the community mental health teams and asked my psychiatrist to get me back in with him too. The meds that I currently take are the best ones for me that I’ve ever tried and actually really help to balance me and level out my emotions, so I don’t want to Change them because it took such a long time to get to this point. I had group and one to one art psychotherapy a couple of years ago and after it I felt much more balanced and hopeful, but something in November triggered me and I just can’t get back to the point I was at before then. I haven’t had DBT yet so for those that have tried it how effective was is, is it something I can start trying now, on my own without professional input?

I've had 3 serious relationships in my adult life, all of them with other people who have complex comorbid psychiatric disorders of their own. Partner no 1: Depression/BPD/anxiety. Partner no 2: Mania/anxiety/SUD. Partner no 3: PTSD/DID/Bipolar I/possibly ASPD/SUD.

Each relationship was it's own spectacular disaster, each one more unhealthy & intense than the last. The final one especially has left me feeling broken.

As someone with BPD/OCPD and other psychiatric issues, am I just not meant to have a partner that has problems similar to mine? Is it just too much strain on a relationship, period? Or was the issue with my specific partners not being willing to get the treatment they need? I'd like to think someone who understands could be compatible with me.

Broke up with me two days after my birthday and we came back from holiday and met his grandparents. I still can’t believe it’s truely over. We were in a rough patch where we were irritable with eachother and would have silly arguements over small things but the root issues were that I needed reassurance and he never gave me it and my severe emotional instability was difficult for him to understand and manage in a relationship. 
I see a future with him, and I’m not just saying that for the sake of it. We are both stubborn and he knows exactly how to annoy me but I love everything about him. I miss his hugs and I am so alone and don’t know how I will ever be happy without him. I want to feel his warmth and hear his voice. I am in shock because I thought he loved me.

82,Looking for resources,"I started seeing a psychiatrist, who specializes in TFP, 2 months ago. She diagnosed me with BPD. When I questioned the severity she said I’m “on the healthy side”. She explained that now that the assessment portion is over, the sessions would now be twice a week ($80 a week with my insurance). That was going to be a lot financially, as I dropped to working part time this year to help care for my baby. My husband supported my therapy and we agreed I would proceed with therapy and take a financial hit for one year for my well-being. I started to get a bad feeling about the psychiatrist when she prescribed me a sleeping medication and my insurance charged me $100 for the medication management code that she billed bc the insurance company said two codes were billed so it appears that 2 separate visits were completed when the medication management was discussed during our visit. I emailed her and told her I can’t afford $80 a week plus $100 every time she mentions medication to me so I would have my PCP take over this sleeping medication bc I don’t get charged when he writes me prescriptions. The psychiatrist then proceeds to send in a new prescription for a higher dose, which I didn’t ask for, after I was clear that I didn’t want to discuss medications with her again. This resulted in another $100 charge. She then took a 2 week vacation and we picked back up last night for our first real treatment session. She started the session by saying she needs to charge my credit card for the second medication charge. I let this go because I’m working on not cutting ppl off after a bad feeling. Then she says she has two requirements for me: 1) I need to “start a weight management program like weight watchers”. I gained a significant amount of weight during my pregnancy and can’t get it off. My PCP started me on Ozempic which has already helped me lose 40 lbs. I told the psychiatrist that I’m already taking steps to help with my weight (which was discussed in previously sessions) she replied “ya but you’re really not” and implied she didn’t trust my PCP of doing enough to manage my weight 2) since I couldn’t have her manage my meds due to insurance, she wanted me to have a regular psychiatrist manage my meds (vyvanse for ADHD and have been on for nearly 10 years and trazodone for sleeping which she put me on last month) bc she didn’t trust my PCP to manage them. 
All that was going through my head was this is more money I have to spend for things my PCP is doing for free. When I pushed back she said these two requirements were necessary for us to start therapy. She said it would be irresponsible of her to not have me do weight watchers and said it was the same as if I was an alcoholic and she required me to go to AA. 

She told me to cut my mom off and “have a hotel on speed dial” when I visit her but then later apologized and said she shouldn’t be giving me advice. She also made numerous little digs about my husband. Again, I brushed those comments aside bc I’m working on not being impulsive when it comes to cutting ppl off. But I’m really uncomfortable with her giving me an ultimatum and now  talking poorly of a third person on my life, my PCP. 

I emailed her and said I’m not comfortable with her two requirements and I understand this means we can’t move forward with therapy. I feel like the past two months of assessment and building trust with her was just a waste. I’m not ready to start with another therapist so I’m looking for other resources like books, videos, workbooks, etc that you feel helped you.

84,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

86,Finally realized something about my boredom at age 33 that apparently I knew at 16.,"(Trigger warning-suicide attempt mention)
So, I realized today that I have intense boredom issues. Like, the idea of stability triggers me? I am taking a break from a rough relationship, so we can both heal. I am starting my home business. I have a great child that loves me so much. But I want to...just...not. You know? Like I want to ""fall"" on a knife so I can go to er. Or start a fire in my apartment. Maybe crash my van. 

And I realized while talking with the crises team that it's the same feeling I had when I first attempted to off myself when I was 16. The idea of graduating and getting a job and doing the ""adulting"" thing made me want to throw up. Even now, I literally feel anxious about it. 

I've done threapy, doing some dbt now but honestly from what I've been reading about the emptiness inside and the boredom, for most ot doesn't go away and just goes inside. And I'm already GREAT at masking, till something triggers it and it all comes out. And honestly, why would I wanna live with all this turmoil inside me? If there's no real peace, no real break from this diagnosis, why do people insist we keep fighting? For a chance at peace? When do we decide the chance is up and now just learn to live with it, AS LONG as you don't bother others. I don't know.

 I just had the crisis team over and they just kinda suggested more hobbies and maybe a new job. So I came here. Are there really people that feel like being alive,but internally miserable is better than dead? Is death really that scary to people? I don't believe in the afterlife, I'm very ok with just not existing. That seems nice. At this point I'm not sure if I am gonna off myself now, or after another decade of threapy and meds but I'm certain it's gonna happen.

My boyfriend and I dated for almost three years (anniversary in 2 months). I had one friend that wasn't shared with him. I developed an FP relationship with one of his oldest friends. I let myself obsess and eventually sent inappropriate messages. My boyfriend discovered this and broke up with me. I left our home knowing we were broken up but with hope he'd forgive me and take me back. Yet, I didn't think I could handle being alone and, of course, asked my FP, his friend, to meet me. Long story short, I slept with him. The next day, my boyfriend gave me a second chance. I had to tell him I slept with his friend. We're done.

I can't believe this is real. I don't know how to deal with all this self hatred, guilt, and depression. The life we had and planned together is stripped from both of us. I don't know why I did what what I did, but I still did it and deserve the consequences.

This all occurred over the course of the last two days. I'm now distracting myself by applying to jobs, scheduling therapy appointments, and cleaning. I can't be alone with my thoughts but I shouldn't see anyone right now.

94,I caused the worst fight of our relationship and I don’t know why or what to do now.,"I had a horrible meltdown/BPD episode last night and I treated my also-BPD partner of 3+ years who I live with so horribly for no good reason right as we were trying to go to bed. I pushed him so far past his breaking point that he broke down horribly too and I ruined what had earlier been a really great night out with friends. 

I hate feeling so out of control of myself and especially hate being unable to explain away my poor behavior in any meaningful way. I’m so embarrassed and ashamed of my behavior and I feel like my world is ending. I don’t even have a good excuse for why I pushed it so far. It doesn’t even feel like me doing my actions, but it obviously was. 

I know that I’ve been very overwhelmed lately with financial concerns and I’ve felt the meltdown building in the background. I tried to preempt it by taking the meds that typically manage it but that wasn’t enough. I’ve also tried asking for space/time alone at home to recenter since that usually helps too, but that wasn’t able to happen. I am also on my period which makes my sensitivity and reactivity to much worse. I know these all sound like excuses, but I’m just trying to not feel like an innately horrible person. I understand what causes my overreactions and I don’t want to think it’s all my fault, but I also don’t want to shift blame. I can’t escape the fact that the consequences apply to me alone when I’m the one having the overreaction. I know my actions are my choices and I have to own up to the hurt I cause regardless of the reason behind it.

I’ve apologized profusely since I realized in the middle of last night how fucked up I was being, but obviously that doesn’t change or fix the hurt I caused immediately, which sucks. We’re not at odds necessarily now and he’s accepted my apologies and told me I don’t need to keep apologizing, but it’s still tense and I know I’ve hurt him deeply.

95,so much improvement!!,"So I would say that my bpd is pretty severe. My symptoms were completely debilitating and I could barely function. keeping friendships was almost impossible. I was put on new meds about 4 months ago (lamotrigine and quetiapine) and I have seen so so so much progress that I never thought would happen for me. I feel like it’s been so much easier for me to take a step back and think before I respond which felt almost completely impossible for me a few months ago. my lows, even though they’re very very low, have felt a lot less frequent. I feel like i’m able to be a lot more understanding and empathetic which was a big struggle for me. i’ve tried so many different medications and they’ve always either numbed me out or made things worse, but I finally feel like i’ve found something that works for me. Next month, i’ll be a year clean from self harm which is so exciting. and any urges that I have, while still very strong, are so much less frequent. anyway, I just feel really optimistic and happy that things are finally seeming to feel a bit more manageable :):):):):)",1638049241.0,False,3,2,Ordinary_Gate9196,None,r3noaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/r3noaa/so_much_improvement/

When anyone got angry, it meant yelling and screaming and often violent outbursts from my parents or from myself onto myself.

Yelling made me feel disrespected and unsafe and I don’t want to do that to the people in my life that I care about. How the hell do I stop? What is the first step?

97,There is hope.,"I have no formal diagnosis but I firmly believe that I once had BPD. I used fit the criteria to a T. I'm writing this in hope that I can help others, give others hope and maybe inspire some of you. 

First, background, as it's all relevant. 

I had an unstable childhood, lots of trauma and abuse. I was thrown out at 15 and had to pretty much fend for myself. From the ages of 15 to 27 I lived a hugely chaotic life, moving from place to place and unable to hold down a job, relationship or anything meaningful. 
I was abusive in all my previous relationships, never physical, but emotional. I would lash out at the most minor inconvenience, I was angry and aggressive and I create an environment whereby all those around me felt as though they were walking on eggshells. I had the most poisonous tongue known to man and I'd hit people exactly where I knew it would hurt. I was never satisfied. I always wanted and expected far too much from those around me and when I felt I hadn't gotten what I deserve, I would attack with words and empty threats. I would threaten partners with leaving them. I would tell partners they were meaningless to me, I'd tell them I didn't love them, nor did I want them around. I would cause arguments with people literally every day of my life. I would ruin outings and social events. I used suicide as a threat and as a means of control. I don't believe, during these years, I had the mental capacity, or genuine desire to better my behaviour. Luckily for me I have a fantastic group of friends who have stood by me, regardless of all my faults, and regardless of pain I have caused them. 

Fast forward to my 26th year and I decided I needed to change. For me, there was no big event that led to this, it was a decision I made based on how I felt my life and relationships would turn out if I continued as I was. I wanted to be a better person and rectify my wrongdoings as much as is possible. I began reading self-help books and researched BPD. I was later diagnosed with ADHD, severe depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Eventually, after months of trying medicines, I was put on Venlafaxine. This was both a blessing and a curse. My moods became stable, I had better emotional regulation and I had no desire to hurt those around me, no matter how upset I became. Alas, this came with conditions: My sex drive is constantly low and I have to actively work on this, although able to understand emotion, I feel very little emotion and my passion for life and my previous interests has dissipated. It's a sacrifice I choose to make because I want to be a good person.
Since taking meds I have invested countless hours reading and educating myself on neuropsychology, BPD, trauma, neuroplasticity, anything I felt may help me to better understand my behaviours, and various literature, both academic and otherwise, regarding changing responses and behaviours. 

It's been a long road and it isn't over. I still slip up every now and again but I am so much healthier and better able to handle emotional situations. I am emotionally available, discussing feelings and thoughts with those in my life. I take my meds as I am supposed to. I rarely react with anger. I ask others opinions before I respond, so as to guage whether or not my feelings/reactions are in line with the situation. I NEVER call anyone names in malice. I listen before I jump to conclusions and I try to think with logic and reason at all times. I am now an asset to the people around me. 

I attribute my progress to a few things; education and understanding my conditions, discussing, with everyone in my life, all the negative things I had done and taking ownership of the damage I caused... This was paramount; taking Venlafaxine, for me this is a wonder drug, although please bear in mind that what works for one of us may not work for you; and taking LSD in a therapeutic environment, engineered for self reflection. 

I wanted to change so very much that I actively make it happen. It was my decisions alone that have led me to recovery and I cannot stress enough that recovery is only accessible to those who see the damage they cause, see the hurt and chaos, and then act alone (without need for encouragement from others) to better themselves. 

I still need therapy and I will continue to work on my flaws. I may have to do this for the duration of my life. I still suffer with the invasive thoughts. The evil remarks and hurtful comments still enter my head, but now I can observe these thoughts and I choose to act with compassion and understanding over anger and frustration. There is a better way. 

TL;DR Was an ar*sehole, sought meds and education. Now much better for it. LSD for a mind reset and discussions with everyone in my life led me to take ownership of my behaviours. Not an ar*sehole anymore.",1583850127.0,False,10,13,kitamajita,None,fgek26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fgek26/there_is_hope/

101,Passed the Bar Exam Today,"At the risk of seeming egotistical, I (29M) wanted to post this for anybody really going through it as proof that you can do that thing people say you can’t do because you’re borderline.

I’ve had a lifelong struggle with what I know now to be Borderline Personality Disorder. In highschool, I was bullied so aggressively I had multiple near death experiences and my family’s home was repeatedly vandalized. My dad was repeatedly battling advanced stage cancer and I had to take care of my brother through the end of highschool while struggling with what I know to be CPTSD now. I was (mistakenly) diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety when I was 18 and told I would need to live a low-stress, safe, low pressure lifestyle. I hated this. 

For years, through college I struggled with both being over-medicated while also being inadequately helped. I hungout with dangerous, aggressive people through college because that level of dysfunction felt normal. I graduated college with a double major, but struggled to function well in the workplace. Bad relationships with toxic people was all I knew.

I spent 5 years in a majorly abusive relationship with a toxic narcissist that resulted in multiple hospital trips for stitches and broken glass removal. When that ended, I was a law student and the stress of the breakup led to lots of psychiatric problems, the vast majority of my friends abandoning me, isolation, suicide attempts, and self harm. I had to drop out of law school twice. My CPTSD and providers’ mismanagement of meds was so extreme that I lost the ability to read for almost 18 months. But I graduated.

I wasn’t even able to take the bar exam when I wanted to- my law school made me join a disciplinary program designed for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems because of my mental health problems through law school due to the extreme stigma against mental illness in law. I had to delay taking the bar exam after graduating because my mental illness was regarded as “a danger to the public.” Joining that punitive program was the only way to convince my state licensure board I could be trusted.

Finally, I was diagnosed BPD and started to get better through DBT. DBT saved my life. I gained the skills to put myself back together. Today I have an amazing girlfriend, a nice small house, rescue pitbull, new friends (through my girlfriend) and a couple old friends that stood by me, and now a new career in law as an attorney in a mid size American city as of finding out I passed the bar just this morning. 

Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn’t a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it’s an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don’t deserve it. Do that thing everybody says you can’t do and tell anyone who tries to stop you to eat shit.

I have been on the long and exhausting journey of finding the right medication combo for the side effects of my BPD. I am also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder w/ Agoraphobia, and PTSD. But, I believe my Borderline is the biggest disruption, as it triggers all of my other disorders.

I have huge abandonment issues, causing me to feel like it's next to impossible to let go of people, ideas, irrational thoughts, etc.). My irritability is moderate. My depression is severe, it comes with suicidal ideations. Lastly, my anxiety is on and off, but when it's bad, it is debilitating.

I am currently on Prozac 20mg x1, Hydroxyzine 50mg x3, Clonidine .02mg x3, Trazodone 100mg x1, Zofran 4mg xAs needed, and Adderall 30mg XR x1.

I have tried numerous other medications, but my med management has been a mess since August 2020. I have been put on and taken off so many medications, I am not sure what has made things worse or helped out (even though, I don't feel like I have been stable since March 2020).

104,"Medication (lamptrigine, CBD, THC)","Hey everyone, I (F25) am struggling with medication at the moment and would appreciate some insight from those with personal experience 

DISCLAIMER: I have a fab team of doctors monitoring all my conditions, but I would like some real-life advice. 

TLDR: Does lamotrigine make it *impossible* for you to get out of bed in the morning? Has it increased your libido? Do these side effects eventually wear off? Changing from cannabis to CBD oil, thoughts? 

Bit of a long one here. 

I have chronic pain from Endometriosis as well as BPD and Bipolar 2. 

I was on a cocktail of medication, and I impulsively stopped all of my medication (except 1) in December 2022. I was taking nortiptiline (for pain) for a while until we realized it stimulated manic episodes (bipolar 2), so we switched to pregabalin, but that made me severely depressed, and I experienced some neurological symptoms (inability to speak/form sentences, brain fog etc). This is mainly what led to my impulsive decision to stop all my meds. 

I am now re-introducing my medication, one at a time, so I can pinpoint which side effects come from which medication. So far I have reintroduced tramadol (pain) lamotrigine (BPD + Bipolar 2), celecoxib (pain), and occassional SR tramadol (pain flares). 

Due to my pain, my sex life is pretty much non-existent, and my partner (M30) has been so patient with me through all of this. I recently started lamotrigine again (2 weeks ago) on a 50mg dose. My libido has increased significantly! We are talking every day, when prior to this, it may have been once or twice a month. However, I find it *impossible* to get out of bed in the mornings. 

- has anyone experienced the changes to sleep and libido when starting lamotrigine? Does it get better over time? I want to keep the increased libido, but I'm not sure if it is worth the struggle in the morning. Am I taking the medication too late (10 pm normally)?

I also use cannabis to help with my pain, anxiety, and erratic mood swings. I know that cannabis isn't the best for us with BPD. 

- has anyone switched from using cannabis to CBD oil (minimal THC content)? I recently had a consult at a cannabis clinic and am considering using the CBD oil instead, but I'm not sure if this will give me the same relief from pain and anxiety.

106,Completed DBT almost a year ago and was doing great. Developed postpartum depression and I feel like it's undone all my hard work.,"I'm having feelings and thoughts that I thought I had overcome. I am so overwhelmed with my all of my baby's needs that I feel like I don't have the mental capacity or presence of mind to use any of my skills. I'm having trouble staying mindful of my thoughts and my emotions and it's led to panic attacks and angry outbursts. 

My fiance and I have argued more in the last 2 weeks than we have for the last 2 years. He said I've been emotionally abusive and gaslighting him. He said something along the lines of ""You know what BPD is, you know what you do."" and down to my very core it's never my intention to hurt him, I'm not trying to manipulate him or invalidate him. And it hurts so much that I made him feel that way and that he thinks I'm doing it on purpose. It's all making me question myself and I'm feeling like I did before I even started DBT. How do I recognise if what I'm doing IS emotionally abusive? 

For what it's worth I just started meds for PPD and I am still seeing my therapist once every couple of weeks (next appointment in a few days).

107,I chose to be I choose to be codependent.,"

Ok this is going to be a long story on why I made this choice and how me and my husband of 2 and a half years are making it work. 
I'm multiple diagnosed with ASD, BPD, Bipolar type 1, Schizoaffective Bipolar type, OCD, ODD, ADHD, CPTSD and a lot of other mental health issues as well as some medical ones but those are the main reasons.

Before I met my husband I was extremely unstable constant splitting, at one point I od'd on my blood pressure meds, I have a nasty scar on my thigh from a bad relationship[self inflicted] I was an absolute mess. Let's add onto this I had recently had a therapist that was constantly instilling into my head that I was a burden by saying what are you going to do when your parents die. My parents had also been known to bring me to look at group homes without telling me before hand the first time this happened I had a full meltdown in front of the woman who ran it and she said if I did that in front of the other girls they would beat me up.

After the relationship that resulted in both the scar and the od I finally decided enough was enough and took matters into my own hands because I knew where my life was headed. It was on a dead end path to a group home. So I started looking for someone. Now here's how I found someone that changed my life completely. I chose the bdsm subreddits. I already knew I was a little with a codependent personality so I actively looked for a daddy-dom. Someone who knew how to take a caretaker role and help when I got out of control and acted like a child. That's how I found my husband.  He knew from day one about my illnesses, and also knew quite a bit about psychology so he has been extremely understanding from day one and we hit it right off. Within 2 weeks of connecting online I moved in with him we married 6 months later. Since meeting him I have gone into remission I'm also semi-indepentant in small.. or well for me big ways... for the first time in my life I can truly be left alone in the house for long periods of time. I haven't had a split in 3 years and most of my insecurities have faded and when they do show their ugly little demon heads he immediately squashes them and builds me back up. I've also been able to go off almost all my medications and im now on only one. And weve also been talking about having children of our own. For me personally, it's the best decision I ever could have made.

EDIT: Just be careful. A lot of people online are looking for an abuse victim and know nothing about aftercare. At first we were all about the sex but we quickly moved on and grew as a couple. It became about the future and how we didn't know what we wanted to do but we knew we wanted to do it together. He keeps me sane and I keep him happy. Even now he is telling me to be careful what I say to you all. He is and subsequently our relationship is  unique. I asked him what he would say to you about looking for someone online and he said, ""Don't tell them what you want outside of general things. Tell them you want rough sex but don't tell them you want aftercare. Let them tell you that they want to care for you after. Let them say thing about themselves without knowing that you like it. Then if what they say without knowing matches what you want, be safe and go for it. If you say you like getting ice cream after a doctor visit then they say I always get ice cream after the doctors, he is probably lying.",1703997537.0,False,3,5,Diligent-Sense-5689,None,18uzhr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18uzhr1/i_chose_to_be_i_choose_to_be_codependent/

I’ve been doing good for so long. I was helped by my counselor and psychiatrist to wean off my meds, discharged from counseling a few years ago, and really thought I had my mental health under control and in check for the first time in a long time. 

All it takes is a short lived series of events and I’m already fearing another hospitalization. The impulsive spending, the increasing urge to self harm, isolating myself, extreme mood swings for the first time though including fits of rage, and panic attacks are back and have taken on new symptoms there too. Feelings of emptiness, dissociating, and dysphoria. I’m grasping at anything that will make me feel like it’s worth it to be alive. My drinking is getting out of control again and I’m afraid it’ll spiral into drugs again too. 

My marriage is (more likely than not) ending, and I’ll be left alone again. I feel like a waste and burden to everyone around me, and it really feels like everyone would be better off if I was gone. I’m really struggling to use my coping/DBT skills but I don’t feel connected or able to share these feelings in my relationship, with people loosely associated as friends, and I’m afraid my counselor will want to admit me which right now, I can’t afford as that would result in homelessness too.",1609860305.0,False,12,3,redwolfshoes,None,kr0gzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/kr0gzu/episodestrugglingventing/

Sticks and bones. And the weight gain made me gain good weight; got a butt etc got thick lol. I looked good w the weight gain.

Like a dr appt being rescheduled makes me feel angry, I feel impatient and I can’t go to work or focus at work and I’m afraid I’ll push my boyfriend away again. (I understand ppl need to protect their peace BPD IS DRAINING) so I have to do my part to ensure I’m ensuring a good environment for not only myself but my kid and the ones who support me. My dr recommended lamotrigine and it seems scary certainly when I’m just tryna stabilize my mood fr, and mute my emotions. I have goals to uphold and I quit jobs easily but can’t this time. I realized I called off work twice (I’m still in my 90 days) and didn’t care to lose my job… which is an effect of my unstablized mood, the inability to think about the cause an effects of decisions I make when I’m angry. Who I snap out on, and I’m tryna avoid an episode from happening cause I can feel it. Is this medicine doing too much? I’m not tryna make things worse as I’ve been doing pretty ok minus the 6-9 month depression and the newly developed anger problems. What’s your thoughts??? I know ppl say DBT but I can’t afford that and those resources aren’t that available I also have a BPD work book that helps but I can’t focus AT ALL enough to even read or follow my music/go outside crisis plan.

111,How to support my partner,"My partner recently came out as having BPD. They knew about the diagnosis but kept it a secret for the year we’ve been together.

My immediate boundary was they need to be on their meds and see a therapist on a regular basis. We even saw a therapist together, but they had a bad time because they session wasn’t supporting their abusive behaviour. I want to stay but we can’t stop fighting and I’m at the point where I need to leave because of the hurt and broken trust. I’m trying to save this relationship, but they threaten suicide or get angry and drive away at 4AM. 

This person is in an early stage of their recovery and I’m worried they are not well enough to really understand how hurtful they’ve been to me. I need some distance because they lied, but what is the best way to support someone with BPD? Is there anything I can do, or is it up to them if they want to or are ready to be healthy. What does healthy BPD even look like?

This has all been so sudden and I’m tired and scared and confused. All I want is for my partner to be happy and healthy, but not at the expense of my health.",1568315561.0,False,6,5,BPDrelationship9,None,d3cs6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/d3cs6o/how_to_support_my_partner/
112,I’m over me,"I’m not being my best for myself or my partner.

Since the pandemic, I have become extremely codependent with my bf, increasingly stressed with work, lack of self care, and my mental health is deteriorating. I’m broke and can’t afford meds/therapy or I would definitely be on them by now.

I’m realizing that any time my partner leaves to go hangout with friends I get a flood of heavy ass emotions. For example: I’m not good enough, a burden, self hatred, jealous of whoever he is hanging out with, and most importantly suicidal ideations.  It’s like as soon as he makes plans I immediately feel abandoned. I think this is some sort of unresolved trauma/“daddy issues”. I want to stop reacting and obsessing over everything and just be ok if I am alone for a few hours without taking it personally.

When I’m having these episodes I blow my partner up almost immediately after he leaves and tell him I feel _____(insert unhealthy toxic emotion here). He never goes out and at this point is tired of my shit and I’m not delusional I understand- but in the moment when he is placing a boundary I lose it. It turns into a huge panic attack and it’s Extremely unfair to him. I’m going to lose him if I can’t get a hold of my emotions and insecurities. 

I’m not looking for judgements, but I figured venting here is a better outlet than crying :) I’ve looked into BPD and was wondering if anyone has some info on that. 

Everything always ends up with me saying  a “you don’t love me” thing and not just to my bf to anyone I feel hurt by. I am in control of what I do and say yet I say some really manipulating off the wall shit sometimes.

We're no longer on speaking terms and honestly I think it's for the better even though we were such best friends. The thing is, I want to move on.

I keep having dreams about this and I just want to move on with my life. It really sucks to be honest.

114,im scared ive split one too many times on my girlfriend,"I just wanna start this off by saying I’ve been in therapy for six years and officially diagnosed for a little less than a year but I’ve known of the possibility of having BPD for a lot longer than that, so it’s been very heavily searched and focused on during my sessions. I’ve had a tendency of codependency within all my relationships (I’m a lesbian female and to be honest a lot of very clear signs of codependency and even love bombing within the lesbian community are just seen as normal so it took even longer to comprehend the cycle) and finally took a break from that to heal further after being cheated on and completely devastated. In my last two relationships I deeply guarded all of my symptoms, displayed as little as possible, hid my splitting and crisis from them, did absolutely everything to be perceived as someone loveable, which to me still means someone who isn’t borderline. The thing is, I was “perfect” and it did not magically fix my problems, I was still faced with abandonment and in fact it somehow felt worse. When I met my current girlfriend I was certain nothing would ever come of it, she was way out of my league and perfectly aware of my personality disorder so for sure an opportunity with her would never arise— until I fell in love with her and she felt the same. You have to understand, no one has ever made me feel as comfortable as she has before, doing so much to accommodate my triggers and respect my boundaries and comprehend my love languages, but maybe all that comfort turned me greedy. It seems I am now even more alert and easily hurt by things when it comes to her and although I am sure I am not codependent small interactions seem to flare up so many insecurities that lead to splitting and arguing and then crying and SH and I just think no matter how hard I try or how well I take my meds and attend therapy I will never be someone capable of making her happy and it must be selfish of me to love her like I do and not magically be cured by the power of love and will, I don’t know. I have never felt how I feel about her towards anyone before and I just don’t know how to keep myself from going fight or flight.

115,The sup stack that saved my ship! Read if you have hope(:,"Update:sadly after day 27, something stopped working. I can only guess it's the nac. She still takes everything, but that overwhelming level of anxiety/pit has come back to her and she just now had another self isolating eps. Tbh I don't know if we'll recover from this or not. Idk if it'll stop working for every person but To all who I gave hope, I'm sorry 😞. I thot I found a solution to at least enjoy my time together with her but it seems it was likely short lived. If we get out of this postively somehow long term, I'll update.

This exact stack: bought from vitamin shoppe.

Solgar omega 3 950mg

Vitaminshoppe brand L theanine 100mg

Vitaminshoppe Nac 600mg

has pretty much saved my relationship and now I'm happily married.

For us, it has made her no longer explosive/randomly angry or self isolating anymore. It's legit 99% a normal relationship now . There's only been some small things were we communicated within under an hour each time like a normal understanding convo with one another. Sometimes even in 5 mins we good after small thing. That B4 trying this supplement stack, normaly wouldve made her give up on us and self isolate for days and or she'd get mad about it, if i was able to get her to try to tell me wat she was feeling. We are super happy to say we haven't had a meltdown in 27 days! B4 it was literally everry 2-3 days. We are still meltdown free since Dec 19 (x and we are both super happy to be with each other ❤️💗. !!! ((: She's felt so much happier, she's told me and I've noticed it. it's been easier to talk to one another too. We've committed to a future together and are starting a semi life in the same home soon cx. This stack is a ship saver!! It really balanced out her intense feels to practically nothing!. She does still have small sad type moments here and there from things that remind her of childhood trauma alittle or things that she gets mad at herself internally abit for forgetting. But when they do happen and I notice she's looking down a little, I ask her about it in a supportive way, and she opens up and within about 10 mins and we are past it and up again. That's it(:. it's very occasional too. Like once a week. Very manageable, easy to recover, communicating is easier and is much more possible now.

This is wat she takes and when:

1pm everyday, she takes the stack, 2 of each listed.

10pm she takes her lamotrigine and 1 vitaminne shop brand magnesium glycinate 400mg tablet form

No idea if she still needs her lamo subscription med but didn't want to chance us melting down again. So still on it. Might maybe try it without later in the future, now that the stack and magnesium seems to help alot. For now tho we are super happy together (:. Anyone else that sees this, it takes the edge off very noticably! Try it. 😁. Do you and or your special person a huge favor and start the stack ASAP, you won't regret it. Worth every penny.

Also she's not in DBT. We do our best for each other and love care n support one another. We are incredibly happy with this stack and mag. CX 💞 hoping this will help others who have SOs that want to give up in a loop and or themselves and struggling to find help. Not a cure, but really dam close! Cross posting to help others live a hopefully better life😊.

I will occasionally update the number of days we've made it, if we are still together happily and to let everyone know that this supplement stack is still working for her/us <3.",1704053956.0,False,0,6,Best-Difference-1946,None,18vg691,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18vg691/the_sup_stack_that_saved_my_ship_read_if_you_have/
116,How to cope with splitting on my partner?,"Hi all, I've been in a relationship for about 4 months now. I spent a good deal of the time in the first month/months before we made it official splitting on them because I didn't know how to make my very specific needs known and I was afraid of revealing the full scale of my borderline/bipolar issues because well...I'm sure y'all get it. After letting it all build up, I basically broke down and told them exactly what I needed from them, otherwise my borderline would flare up and make life impossible. They understood, took action, and it was great for a month. There were a couple moments where I had severe borderline symptoms, but we talked it through and it was fine. 

&#x200B;

For the past 2-3 weeks, I have been splitting on my partner again. I remember exactly when it started--we were sitting on the couch, cuddling and watching tv, and i was SO happy and safe, and then suddenly out of nowhere my stomach sank and a voice said ""this isn't right!"" and i felt physically nauseous and dizzy suddenly. then I had a panic attack, and since then I started hating my partner and having a strong desire to suddenly end things with them. I don't know how to make it stop. My partner is even aware that it's happening. I want to go back to feeling happy and safe with my partner. I take meds, I see a therapist, and I've talked to my partner and friends about it. The feelings are very intense, and coupled w my bipolar depression, are giving me panic attacks and making me feel suicidal. Do y'all have any advice or words of comfort or similar experiences? I don't want to break up, but I also can't stand feeling like this anymore.

117,Trying hard to fix my marriage,"I have been married for 15 years now and I now know that I have had BPD the whole time. Only in the past 3 months have I found out that it was truly BPD and I am now engulfing myself in learning all about it. I am trying so hard to fix myself and be a better person. I want to be the person my wife wants to be with and a better father.  I have emotionally destroyed my wife over the past 15 years. She has repeatedly tried so many times over the years to get me to seek help. I did and they said I was bi polar, took meds for that for 2 years,  didn't fix anything.   I was still the same person. Then I finally found out that I have thyroid disease which caused me to be bipolar.   I have finally gotten my physical health corrected with my thyroid etc.   With hormones being so out of whack due to thyroid disease it was so hard to ever find out what the true problem was.  My wife decided that we needed to separate because she is so unhappy and feels broken.  This is not what I want, I have been begging her and begging her to stay with us and please give me a chance and that she would see real change in me. I am seeing a therapist and messaging with my therapist constantly. I am listening to books on BPD. I'm on this pages of reddit and learning that we pretty all have the same symptoms. I am trying to learn coping skills to overcome the abandonment issues and constantly thinking my sweet wife is cheating on me.  I feel so lost right now and so anxious and so stressed out that I just don't know what to do. We live together still and we still sleep in the same bed amd we have our children.

118,Perceived vs real betrayal/abandonment - advice for me and my SO please 🙏 (tweet for reference),"TLDR; with reference to this Tweet that I showed my bf, he asked when I am triggered and experience this, how can he deal it in the best way possible to avoid as much conflict possible? I honestly don't know the answer to this so would appreciate some advice please.

More context: I (29F) showed my boyfriend (33M) of 4 years this Tweet as it applies to me and I try to educate him about my trauma and how it affects me and how my brain operates so he can understand me better. We are trying to work through and improve our relationship which is heavily affected by my BPD and mental health issues. Sometimes he will do or say things that trigger me to feel/think he is betraying or abandoning me and my brain fully convinces me that this is the case (and I never know if it is real or imagined), I guess subconsciously to protect myself from getting hurt which inevitably does the opposite and leads us to break into massive blowout fights, which ruin all of our progress up to that point, even when things have been going super well for a while and then before I know it we're suddenly on the brink of splitting up and he starts questioning if there is any hope for our future at all. All because of my fucking triggers, disassociations, neurosis when my mind perceives the threat of betrayal or abandonment.

He always claims he is not doing what I think he is and I have no way of knowing if he is telling the truth or lying. For me trust doesn't even matter at this point because after experiencing so many REAL betrayals and abandonments from people close to me who I never would have ever expected to do so, my brain is so hypervigilant and on alert to suspect anyone could do that to me, it doesn't matter who they are anymore. Nobody is safe, no one can be trusted. Whenever I let my guard down and allow myself to trust and be vulnerable, people take advantage of it and then stab me in the back. The pain that occurs inside of me is gut wrenching and makes me withdraw and feel suspicious of people even more.

I am nothing like the person I used to be. I used to be a social butterfly and musician, I could not go a week without seeing friends, going to gigs and performing and ocializing, but since I've been so ill and debilitated the past few years as well as other factors, I've become an empty shell of who I used to be, severely isolated and living a hermit lifestyle. I have not seen any friends in 4 months, back in active addiction, anxiety, depression, BPD at its worst. This is my rock bottom.

I have a plethora of personal and family crises going on constantly piling up (the list just never ends, my whole adult life has been in survival mode), causing me so much inner turmoil, pain, grief, distress, depression, anxiety. I have become disabled by my multiple incurable chronic illnesses, my social life has become non existent, I fucking dread waking upon every next day miserably existing and nightmares at night. It's unbearable to be awake and be not awake. There's no escape, no peace, no way out. My illnesses have stolen my life away and everything I ever enjoyed and loved doing. I have lost all purpose in life, my sense of identity, motivation and any hope of ever being happy. I'm constantly overwhelmed, started self harming for the first time in my life, relapsed on drugs a few months ago (landed me up in the ER one night in Dec) and I'm admitting myself into a mental health clinic for 3 weeks on Thursday before I finish my degree online (there is no way I can study like this so it has to be before). 

I am in therapy, medicated (although I need to adjust/change my meds), but we just had our end of year summer holidays and my psychologist was away for a month, my psychiatrist has become absolutely useless and unreliable and has ignored me since mid December and other times last year when I needed his help (actual abandonment). I've been seeing my psychiatrist since 2020 and he has let me down so badly and become impossible to get hold of, I genuinely don't think this man has any interest in helping me anymore and may have to find another one, starting new after 4 years will be so fucking exhausting.",1707169567.0,False,6,0,tabasco_kat,None,1ajskqw,https://i.redd.it/lyqzryvl7ugc1.jpeg

120,New to BPD,"So I guess this is sort of my introduction, as im new and just exploringmy support options. I'm a 28F and married with 3 kids. I know the all the hate I'll get for this, but I haven't been clinically diagnosed yet, atm I'm still learning about bpd and collecting all the evidence to bring to my doctor so I can start the process of being diagnosed. 


Now that that's outta the way, let's start from the beginning. My mental issues, as it pertains to bpd, started manifesting when I was 9 after my parents split up. My parents were both abusive in different ways, mom is a narcissist and dad liked to beat us, but my siblings and I didn't know that our lives were all that bad because we didn't know any better. That was until the divorce... it was still pretty taboo to have divorced parents back then, so the schools put us in group counciling and that's when we started realizing everything. 


The divorce didn't make anything better tho, and as the years went on, everything compounded until I finally had a melt down. At 14 I was caught with razor blades on school campus, but the felt I was more of a threat to others than myself and I was sent to an alternative school for 3mos. When I got bk I basically told the school therapist I was going to keep mutilating myself bc no one cared enough to stop me. That's when I was finally hospitalized and diagnosed with ""severe depression with anxiety"". 3yrs later, that diagnosis changed to ""manic depression with severe anxiety"". I was on every medication you could think of, but nothing helped or lasted very long... my emotions have always been a daily rollercoaster for me and it was difficult to control.


At 19 I got pregnant with my first kid, I took preemptive steps on ppd. But all that did was delay the inevitable, and that was the last time I took any medication for my issues and started self medicating. I was doing pretty good until at 23, I lost what would have been my second kid. I spiraled for months after that, but even after it stopped I was still never as good as I was b4. Then at 25 I got pregnant again, and that's where things started getting really bad again. I didn't try to take meds during that time and the ppd hit me harder than the first time, even still as bad as I was, I still felt like I was handling it all very well... but 9mos later I was pregnant again and tht just turbo charged the spiral.


I knew my issues weren't normal and that I was worse than I had ever been b4 in my life, so I started doing research. Instead of focusing on past diagnosis, I researched all of my symptoms which I'll list off now.

☆ constant daily rollercoaster of emotions
☆various manifestations of paranoia
☆having different ""personalities"" for different people I interact with
☆hopelessness
☆self hate 
☆unstable relationships
☆inability to hold a job for more than 9mos
☆feeling like I'm not in control of my self or actions
☆impulsive habits
☆blackout rages
☆hyper fixation with new relationships 
☆saying things I don't mean
☆feeling lost
☆terrified of abandonment
☆feeling out of place or time
☆disassociating 
☆hearing/seeing things that aren't there
☆seething jealousy 
☆acute distrust, even with people close to me


Really I could go on and on, the point is that I came across bpd and everything just clicked. So I along with all of my research, I started listening to other people's stories and their struggles and it just solidified it all for me. I meet 7 out of 9 criteria points, and so I'm 99% sure that this is what my problems all stem from. Really, the only thing that's really stopping me from going to my doctors with all of this, is my distrust of the medical industry. I don't know how to approach the subject without sounding like I'm crazy or overreacting. I've had past professionals claim nothing is wrong and tht I'm just attention seeking, it's not often I'm ever taken seriously.

123,A ruined life,"Some updates based on the replies follow..


TL;DR After abandoning my BPD diagnosis I coped well, until I once again began thinking about it. Embracing my diagnosis and the medication led to ruin, and now I fear for my sanity and existence.

TRIGGER WARNING- abandonment,  suicidal ideation, stopping all medications 

I'm 53, Male from USA, diagnosed nearly 30 years ago. Early on there were 3 instances of institutionalization and many doctors and medications. I was classified as disabled and received SSA benefits for a few years then stopped that when my wife and I separated. She was tired of the rollercoaster. My very southern Christian family disowned me for years. 

I moved to China to experience a year of teaching there and never returned. 2 months in, I stopped taking all meds. I moved to a Chinese megalopolis and gradually built a company around art and collaboration and that led to a career in corporate training.   I married a woman from central China who became my partner and collaborator in work too.

For 7 years I coped without medication.  But things began to be too much, my emotions were overtaking me, and I sought help - medication- once again.  The psychiatrist gave me Similar stuff to years before. There were tears of joy in my wife's eyes- 'Honey you're not crazy! The doctor says its chemicals!'

She tried to understand. She tried to support me emotionally- but she's a very different person from a culture that deals with emotions differently. It wore her down. She became profoundly unhappy,  exploding at me with really hurtful words and behaviors. I continued to let myself be defined by BPD. She began to withdraw and ignore me- and ignoring me is a huge trigger. 

Our business became successful. I'd had a few run ins with the police in China, scary stuff. Sometimes it was my explosive emotions (I punched and dented the hood of a BMW for blocking the entrance to our home), then it was weed. My wife lived with embarrassment and fear. 

Opportunity appeared in Southeast Asia for us to spread our work. I was motivated and we planned to relocate to another country- I was excited and motivated,  she just followed as she felt a wife should, fearing further issues with embarrassment or police in China. 

She never felt comfortable and I was now the only friend she had. Living and working together took its toll. The doctors here changed my medication to what was available- Depakote. 

In March she'd had enough and announced she would leave me. She saw herself as a victim of my psychological abuse. She needed to discover herself.  She felt I should know better, behave better, make better choices; and stop blaming bpd. COVID stopped everything and she lived with me until August. In that time she still often behaved as my loving wife, even discovering the joy of playing Animal crossing as a couple. She called me honey, laogong, hugged me, told me she loved me. Income plummeted and our savings drained. 

After she left, she returned to our city in China.  She explicitly said to give her up, reminding me shes the victim. But she wanted to be collaborators still and she cared about me, she said. 

Communication has been hard. She would suddenly not answer any messages, and phone calls became hostile 

I've had to borrow money to survive. She's living with friends- others from our organization,  so my relationship with them is affected. 

I'm unable to move on. My confidence is shot, I dwell on suicide daily. I stopped the depakote very gradually because it was making me feel worse, and now I take no meds. I'm managing. 

Last week she called me and got emotional about something and shouted at me for 10 min straight. It fucked my head up so bad that it took me days to get my productivity back up. 

Yesterday she called again. We'd agreed t speak as though we are only separated physically,  geographically, to avoid discussing the real issues with others. Yesterday a mutual friend had said something that apparently she was offended and insulted by, that was about our separation. She stated that now she sees shes much too good for me and that I'm ruining my reputation by saying things about us to others. She won't tell me what was said or who said it but completely buys in that I said it.

I am still trying to survive,  eating instant noodles and getting fatter as I desperately scramble for income. I think about suicide constantly. I believe her when she says shes the victim and I'm the abuser. I don't know what's real anymore. 

I know COVID affected a lot but now I wish I'd never left China. I was happy with her... but knowing that for years she felt psychologically abused and depressed because of me... that's kept me awake most nights for a year now. I question reality, am I the abuser? The monster? Is bpd real? Maybe I'm just a shitty person and trying to rationalize my shittiness. 

I don't know what I expect from posting here but hopefully at least the posting itself will help.

UPDATES. 
°I have obtained a DBT workbook and a recommendation of a reasonably priced online counselor. 
°I'm applying for a TESOL certificate for backup English teaching, and a training company is launching a demo of my Empathic Leadership Communication executive coaching system. I have two solid clients now, I believe if I can add only 4 more clients I'll be comfortable. 
°since the borders here are still closed to outside tourists,  domestic tourism is very inexpensive. For <$175 I have booked 11 nights in an Island bungalow about 6 hours from the city. I am concerned about being alone here in the house during Christmas and NY so I will have a yoga/DBT retreat.  
°I still love her so much. I need to change for myself,  not another. But I want to be with her so much. 
°spoke to someone in our China team who is her roommate now in China. He's of the opinion she's also struggling but not in a place to hear me. I had to hide all photos of her and us, and still keep uncovering memories. 
°while I may have stopped the depakote (and things are ok without it) I still smoke marijuana to cope, and occasionally dip into my stash of prescription Ativan if it's too hard. 
°working on myself comes with many failures and it's hard to be motivated. Intermittent fasting,  shifting to a fish and plant based diet, trying to meditate (how the fk do you meditate when your brain won't stfu), add daily exercise,  track my sleep, daily journaling- and while all that's good it's also too much. 
°I'm really really afraid that if I have another interaction like that with her, I will hurt myself. I spent a half hour staring down from my 4th floor balcony trying to gauge if the impact would be fatal... conclusion: fatal or not such an instance would hurt others so I can't give anyone that burden.
°How do I let go of the love of my life?

Thank you everyone. As an executive coach, I teach 'try it on,' accept all feedback as valid until you have tried it on and learned if it fits or not.

124,Dealing with grief and bpd,"Sorry in advance for the longish post. 

When I was 16, I met this boy and we started dating fairly quickly. I had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety already, but not anything else. Me and this boy had a really crazy relationship over the course of 3 1/2 years that created a lot of trauma for me. We were each other’s first everything, including first love. He cheated on me for 8 months of the first year we were together, then we broke up and were on and off for the remaining 2 1/2 years through highschool and through my first year of college. During this time, we slowly went back and forth, arguing and being awful to each other, then blocking each other, but not spending more than a month before unblocking each other. There were also a lot of problems with our families, with my parents absolutely hating him and “banning” him from being with me and his family hating mine but loving me. 
I developed a horrible relationship with sex during this time, as me and his relationship began to revolve around sex. we would use it to heal everything, and we also would hookup with many other people while remaining possessive of each other. horrible i know, but we would cheat on other partners with each other constantly. We simply could not leave each other alone. when we were mad, i would turn to social media and tell everyone what he was putting me through. then we would just get back together. 
I could go on forever and ever about how awful it was, but the main point is my freshman year of college, it got especially bad. we got back together two days before i moved states away to college, and he was absolutely horrible to me. I was also manic (though i didn’t know at the time bc i hadn’t been diagnosed) and was constantly paranoid he was lying and cheating like he had done to me for years. eventually he just broke up with me and i spiraled. i ended up in the hospital because i realized i was severely depressed and then when i got out he told me he hadn’t felt anything for me in years and that devastated me. skip to thanksgiving and he’s hooking up with me again. then he drops me, and i get mad. i’ve never been good about meds, and i wasn’t taking them again. so i got with his bestfriend. me and his bestfriend start a relationship then months go by and i ignore my first love asking to meet up and talk it out, and then bestfriend screws me over too. so i tell my first love about the whole thing out of spite. 
about 4 months after that, he died at 19 after being hit by a semi truck while he was working on his car on the side of the road. His family allowed me to see the open casket with them before the viewing and the funeral, but i wasn’t allowed at the funeral. It’s been a year and a half now and i’m still struggling really badly with guilt and grief. He was my first death, and i was still in love with him when he died. I hate myself for the fact we were on bad terms when he died. i have received a lot of hate after his death because i had been with his bestfriend which hurt him. his family threatened police involvement when i went to his grave. i can’t stop thinking about every moment my bpd cause any pain for him and led to us not speaking. it’s hard for me to acknowledge how horrible he was to me. it’s hard for me to accept he’s gone. im not sure how to cope and move forward and forgive myself. i miss him. i’m almost 21, and i feel stuck at 16 sometimes. any advice?",1665618060.0,False,7,5,microbananana,None,y2ja7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/y2ja7x/dealing_with_grief_and_bpd/
125,I ruined a relationship with someone I truly loved (sad),"
(Venting. Not looking for advice just needed to vent because I don't have anyone I feel comfortable to talk with about this right now. Thanks) 

I don't normally fall very easily for people unlike most with BPD, that is a symptom I have lacked to understand, as I rarely feel a romantic connection or attraction to anyone. 

But I met a guy about a year ago and we talked while we were both in abusive relationships (as friends) for a year. We were there for eachother when no one else was. We lost contact for 6 months afterwards and he came back because he couldn't stop thinking about me. And neither could I. We both were going through alot at the time so we had drifted apart. But now we were both single. I traveled 12 hours to see him. He was going to see me but I told him I wanted go for a road trip instead. It was instant chemistry. I'd never felt this way in my intire life (I'm 33 he is 30) about anyone before and I did not know it was possible for human feelings such as this to exist. He was the same. Even being in long-term relationships before, felt like nothing compared. We kept crying because I had to go back home eventually. But when I got home, things changed. I changed. I wanted everything and more for him. I wanted to treat him amazing. I wanted to be everything he deserved... But no matter how hard I tried, I knew my bpd was sabotaging it before my very eyes...I tried so so hard... I had been going to threapy for many years prior but I have been told that my case is incredibly resistant to treatment. Even since I young age. I have been on every med under the sun and every different threapy known to man. Even shock treatment. I have also had brain damage which has made my emotions ten times worse and I just try the best I can to achieve some kind of help from this exhausting disorder whenever I can but it's definitely a diffcult journey!! Anyhow, seeing my disorder slowly destroy my relationship Infront of me felt like someone else was taking over my body and deciding to react in all these types of ways I did not want to react in. It was like watching someone else take hold that didn't feel like me, but yet I couldn't control at the time regardless if the tools I used. 

Watching someone you love so so deeply being hurt by you is the most painfuliest thing I've ever gone through...
And the 1 thing I'd never in this world want to happen to them was happening by me! It's now been 4 months and I am blocked on everything and I don't expect a message back ever again. I truly hate myself for this and it seems the more I love someone, the more I must hurt them . I only wanted the very best for him but I couldn't even do that .. I know he wasn't the best ether sometimes but given the circumstances I can understand why. As much as it hurts me, I just hope he finds happiness and someone who can give him everything that I cannot archive or have not achieved in the last 10 years of threapy. I just want him to be happy ... As I write this, I'm crying non stop because I don't think I will ever find someone like that again. But it's not about me or what I want. It's about what they need, and they need someone stable. And after the horrific childhood I have endured for many years, bpd is the least of my concerns for the disoders I have. But I just wanted to have love and be loved and give love sooo much .. sometimes love is not meant for everyone.",1674036312.0,False,16,1,spirit-dancer,None,10f3qii,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/10f3qii/i_ruined_a_relationship_with_someone_i_truly/
126,I cancelled new years eve plans and I'm spending it alone while my gf is still going away,"I always hated new years eve, I always spent it alone because I had no friends or on the few occasions I did I cancelled last minute, idk why. I have been with my gf for 2 years and I have spent the last 2 new years eve with her and her friends, and we were supposed to be spending this one as well toghether. 
As soon as New Year's eve was mentioned, I told her that I was really hoping to not go away and celebrate it in our city, but her friends (which I spent also a lot of one on one time with) said that they were thinking about going to the lake house, which is quite far away to get to by train. I mumbled and truly didn't want to go and I asked my gf if we could even hint at staying in genoa, She said it was already all decided and so I didn't even get to express the fact that it was going to be difficult for me be there. So I just followed along the plans, which ultimately became too much for the same exact reason that I told her in the beginning: I have wayyy too many exams and I am stressed because it implies going away for many days rather than spending just one night. So I told her I couldn't go anymore and we initially left it all there, she truly apologised and asked if she could try to talk her friends into doing it here, but ultimalty I said it was already too late, she should have thought of that way earlier, as we had been talking about new years eve for more than a month. I wasn't too angry at first, I was much rather disappointed that she still wanted to go even though I do understand that it is probably her last New years eve with her friends since they are all graduating med school and going different pathways, still I felt like the main priority for her was to spend it with her friends rather than me when presented with the need to spend it with one or the other. This really upset me as I feel like I have been hurt twice - first of all by her not saying anything to her friends when I mentioned it would have been a problem for me still I passively agreed because as soon as I feel someone shutting me down, I am not going to ask again ( I truly don't think she did it maliciously she never asks her friends for anything even if she needs something and I do believe she didn't want to cause any problems), and by her going even though I have decided I can't anymore and I blame it on her since she didn't say anything, that might not have changed the original plan, but could have least let me be honest about my struggle rather than swiping it down the rug. We have been fighting a lot, I am so mad, I am trying not to insult her anymore since the last year it was a fucking mess as she was studying abroad, and this discussion reminded her so much of all the discussions we had while she was away( she wanted do to something i made her feel guilty for not making me enough of a priority and it ended up being a nightmare for her, since she cut off contact with all her friends to try and salvage our relationship, and even though i regret it so much, this doesnt seem to help me change or act better, the only thing that's changed is that i dont verbally abuse her anymore calling all sort of disgusting names.
I don't know what to do or how to cope these days. I feel as I always do this thing where when we have a sort of big plan which involves going on holiday/moving from our city, I tend to not want to go, as a sort of provocation? To test her to see if she would chouse me? Obviously she always fails because people cannot be tested on these things, still my rational brain and emotional brain seem to be 2 separate entities and there is no mediation that lasts long enough for us to stay peaceful. She is now saying she isn't gonna go if we don't find a way to even discuss this in person because she won't go if going away means starting the new year angry and resentful. I think I try to emotionally manipulate her, and I don't know how to change this or how to even come to terms with the fact that I do this that makes my love feel not authentic, wondering even if, and borderlines in general have the capacity to love another person without wanting to bring that person down to your sadness whenever something happens that doesn't go my way. It makes me feel rotten to core, and yet again, I seem to all relate it to myself.

127,advice,"I've done DBT group + private therapy and am just finishing first year of med school (terrifying and amazing)

&#x200B;

anyway, I've been ""dating"" this 2nd year for the past 9 months, but I have never called him my BF/ I always insist we are just friends. He knows about my BPD and is an angel. so kind and forgiving and takes SUCH good care of me/ gives me space when I need it, etc.

&#x200B;

buttttt I've finally realised he has a problem with alcohol and I'm just not cool with that. I tried to give him an ultimatum, but not. by sort of just saying I'm not ok with your drinking, if this continues, ill need to seriously consider whether or not I can welcome you in my life. well he made 1 appt with a therapist (but he's been seeing a therapist for the past 2 years and nothing has changed, so not sure why this will be any different)

&#x200B;

anyway just yesterday he called me, drunk, and my policy is, that I don't engage with him when he is drunk, so as soon as I noticed he was under the influence I let him know that I would be getting off the phone, and I did. normally thats all, I would see him the next day and well it would just be. but, this time, I blocked him! I try REALLLY hard to not BPD all over him, but I also don't want to be a doormat... you know?

&#x200B;

this is one of the hardest parts of recovery, knowing what is BPD and knowing what is normal and standing up for myself.

&#x200B;

I blocked him because historically when he's drunk he will send me 20 texts, which is distressing, and I have a boundary that I won't reply. but its hard when the texts are so distressing. so I just blocked him so I wouldn't even receive the texts. then this morning I debated unblocking him, but then got locked in indecision so did nothing. he is still blocked. I feel bad, but I don't know what else to do.

128,Trying to recover while in a new relationship,"Hey everybody ! I have recently been on the journey to start recovery right now after going through a really rough and challenging time after starting a new medication that brought out the worst parts of myself and a new relationship that i realized heightens my bpd symptoms (even just having the context of being in a relationship had me triggered). I want to further my growth as much as possible so I want to make sure I work towards my growth instead of against it. So I share this in hopes of getting feedback or really any response! I want to know what other ppl think from an objective POV ! This is a long post so be prepared for that ! 

I am currently tapering off this medication and working through dbt workbooks and in the process of getting started at an outpatient dbt program ! We both have mental illness and they have gotten treatment/ are going to therapy and taking meds however unfortunately things started turning toxic unknowingly and there was a dynamic created where I started burdening my partner and they felt like they always had to be there for me even if they didn’t have the capacity to otherwise in their mind who else would and over time started revolving their whole life around me (even isolating themselves from others just to b around me and try to be there for me in crisis). They took me expressing some of my intrusive thoughts and fear of abandonment to heart and made themselves suffer to make me feel “better” or not to abandon or leave me.

 I would word vomit and over share a lot of things I definitely should’ve kept to myself but that I never knew was making them feel like this. Our communication was off because they thought it would make me feel even worse and I would in turn internalize any feedback or criticism and also sometimes they didn’t even know how they felt never mind to then tell me. We got into a habit of them reassuring me no matter what and a routine of seeing each other all the time. After a major meltdown from me and a long day of work, we got to the point where we both got triggered and had an emotional night which lead me to initiate conversation about the issues that are there. 

As we uncovered more, it was disturbing to see how something that we both thought was going pretty well to see how actually unhealthy our start was.  

We have granted each other space as we definitely need to think, reflect and let ourselves read the situation/our feelings more. Last night, we talked about it and took accountability and shared feelings that were scary to say and admit but were needed to be said. We decided instead of breaking up we both are going to put forth the effort and time and patience to try and care for ourselves more and in turn make it so that we rebuild and unlearn all the misconceptions that we had in our relationship by creating and actively writing down different solutions to our issues and putting in a plan to how to achieve it to give us another go but I wonder if even this is a way of being toxic. 

My worst nightmare of burdening someone else’s mental state bc of me came true and while it was on them for the lack and dishonest sense of communication within themselves and with me I just don’t want to make more toxic decisions and hurt us both in the end :,( 

Any feedback would be appreciated and I guess if anyone relates to this it would be nice to know I’m not alone in this position. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed that I let myself get to the point where I was hindering the growth of my partner and weighing their life down but I’m trying to accept that there’s nothing I can do about the past and just to take accountability and change however if anyone has suggestions on how not to feel so guilty/bad/ashamed please lmk !!",1625235134.0,False,5,4,lotus-pea,None,ocawyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ocawyx/trying_to_recover_while_in_a_new_relationship/
129,(BPD) Does anyone else REALLY intensely struggle internally with being alone having bpd?,"(There is 1 use of the F bomb in here and I do apologize I’m just trying to get the point across.) Hi guys i am a 24 year old woman who was Diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and a few others in 2018 I never use my disorders as a crutch or an excuse but I enlighten the people around me about the disorders to help them better understand ME. I use to be on many medications but about a year ago I stopped all mental health meds because I felt they weren’t working right for me but just the last two years I have found it EXTREMELY hard to almost be by myself without the in person company of my “favorite person”…text drives me crazy because it’s so slow and the texts are usually short and boring and they won’t ever call me because they are shy behind the phone. as toxic as this may sound I will open up in hopes of someone out there finding relatability in this or someone that may give me advice on how to help myself. I have been recommended DBT but just with my insane schedule already and not having a car or license, being a full time stay at home mom at my parents with a 3 month old baby, baby sitting my siblings everyday, and occasionally my niece and nephew, therapy, and helping take care of my grandma. I just haven’t found a way around to it yet. I’m not making any excuses by no means my mom is the one that takes me to all of my therapist and psychiatrist appointments and her schedule is insane with work, taking care of my grandma (her mom) being a mom to 6 kids (myself included) and many other things herself. I would LOVE the help of a DBT therapist but right now I can’t fit that into my already hectic schedule. But when my S/O can’t come see me or wants to stay at home it’s like my mind inadvertently takes it as a threat almost, like punishment. In my mind I know they know how much I love and crave to be with them but there’s a part of me that actually truly understands and respects that they need time to themselves also. The world can’t revolve around ME. but the other part of me when I find out they aren’t going to be with me that night or for a few days shatters me me. Its like this never ending game of tug of war that never ends. It’s like a heavy blow to the chest and gut that leaves me in tears and angry and frantic. Cussing at myself, hyperventilating My heart races and I think all sorts of scenarios. I will admit that I do have trust issues due to past experiences with this person so that at times can intensify that thinking also into who are they texting? What are they really doing? Are they on a phone call with someone else? Do they have someone secretly over and are they ignoring me? I’m not thinking or feeling this way INTENTIONALLY I want you guys to try to understand that as best as you can is all that I ask. I understand if some of you just can’t agree with this or see how I could think or feel this way. That’s okay I accept that and am willing to put myself out here in need of guidance. But it’s the way that I can’t help but end up JUST FEELING. I love this person with every ounce of my heart that I have with every breath that I take. I do NOT want to be like this or continue to be like this. Can anyone give me any pointers? Distractions only help for so long until it just immediately comes on again sometimes more intensified than before. I understand that with BPD it is characterized with abandonment issues. And it’s not even the whole trust issue thing that always makes me feel this way so much as it is the whole hearted pain of them not being beside me and me being alone. In my head it just doesn’t even feel like abandonment issues really it feels more like I just understand what I’m feeling and I want to fix it NOW. To some, including myself. MY way of thinking is and can be considered “selfish” not all people with BPD is like THIS. So please I do encourage you to try be understanding to others with this disorder it’s a fucking nightmare that we never asked for But I also ask please try to understand that it’s not to gain “control” or to “manipulate” this person with the way I feel and act. I am in absolute love with this person and I’ve been with them since 2016 I just can’t control all of my emotions and thought process and hurt when it’s “so much so quickly at one time” the emotions and feelings just flood in when I can’t be with them, and it’s a somber feeling that words could never describe. I’m sorry for the paragraph and for any possible typos. I just wanted to see if someone else experiences it in a way sort of like mine or has any pointers on what I can do this to help control myself during the time being until I can get DBT.

130,Newly Diagnosed and So Confused,"32F here.. So I don't know much about BPD. I was diagnosed a few weeks ago by a new psychiatrist, as I show 7/9 BPD traits. First of all, the disorder seems very nebulous and like it has a fair amount of stigma attached to it. Does anyone have a concise way to explain the jist of it to me? 

Secondly, I would like some opinions on my last relationship, which ended just before I was diagnosed.

I am also diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1 with psychotic episodes...but I've had that diagnosis for years now, so I'm comfy with it. 

Basically, my ex is bipolar (but type 2), has cPTSD, is ADD, is nearly agoraphobic and is possibly Borderline as well. (She feels she may be, and her degree is in psych, but she hasn't been diagnosed yet)

Obviously that is a tough mix of disorders to make a relationship out of, and it was toxic to both of us over 4 years. She feels like I was abusive to her, and seems to now be going down her own rabbit hole of paranoia that is building me up into the evilest monster. Which hurts my heart, because I never meant to hurt her so badly, and I also suffered a ton during those years. 

All the bits and pieces of the toxicity of the relationship are too many and too involved to explain/list here. But the meat of what happened was that I lied to her about being physically attracted to her in the beginning, in order to spare her feelings. (I Hated lying to her, & looks don't really matter to me) She found out, and it Crushed her. She never trusted me again after that. I tried to make it up to her...&she punished me for about a year afterwards. I got suicidal from the awful relationship we were having, and she wasn't there for me through that at all. I turned to my friend who happened to be a high school ex, and he was the only one who was there for me, and his support was a big lifeline. Naturally, bc my partner didn't trust me, she thought I was cheating on her emotionally. She had me cut him out of my life. 

I kept *trying* to be a good partner and take care of her through a big PTSD breakdown that consumed her and meant she couldn't work anymore. I didn't prioritize my mental health AT ALL. Even though I obviously needed a lot of help, too. We had horrible communication and I got very stressed with being sole breadwinner.... in California... which is Butt Expensive! We had stopped having regular sex after she found out about ""The Big Lie"" and that lack of intimacy and love was very hard on me. Whenever we did have sex it was very clumsy and awful... and she never took care of my needs in that department. It was always me doing her... awkwardly....and I could count the number of times on my hand for 2 years...

Fast forward through a lot of heartache and bad communication. We moved across the country so we'd be close to her family... to a place where I knew absolutely no one. She still couldn't work, so I continued to try to support us. My mental health got really bad and I had a psychotic/ bipolar manic breakdown and was forced to be hospitalized. 

Over the next year and a half after that, we had a little more regular sex and I thought things were improving. Although I still had passive suicidal ideation and was very anhedonic and depressed. (So was she) I bought a house for us, with the hopes that getting out of apartment living would help her mental health improve. (I still wasn't deemed crazy enough, because I still could work, so I still couldn't prioritize my mental health...there wasn't enough spare time to take care of both of us)

In the end, we broke up abruptly and without really meaning to, in our new house. We never got officially married, thank God.

We had awful communication the whole way through. Now, after the break up...several awful things have come up that I had no idea she was going through when we were together.  

1. During the few, irregular times we did have sex after The Big Lie, she felt violated Every. Single. Time. Up until the end of our relationship. She didn't communicate that to me ever & so I feel absolutely awful that she was feeling that way and I had no idea. (It was never forced, she just wasn't into it to the extreme and didn't/couldn't communicate that)

2. She feels like I absolutely tore down her sense of self and self worth over the relationship 

3. She was scared of me over most of our relationship

4. Due to some misconstrued requests I made, she felt controlled by me sometimes

I have a history of abuse in my family, + The BPD, so I know I wasn't a perfect partner. There are so many other awful instances of miscommunications and misconstrued intents. I have only touched on the surface of the relationship. 

And now, it seems that I have become an ""evil"" person in her mind. It really hurts because I do have a heart and I'm an empathetic person. This person, who I meant to love & protect & care for & build up... has turned me into a monster in her mind. I know part of all that is the PTSD and bipolar paranoia she deals with...although I hesitate to bring that into this because it sounds like I'm gaslighting. 
The worst part is that I know that a lot of her grief is valid. I'm wondering if I Am a monster.

I literally dropped everything else to be in the relationship, I left my home state, family, and friends to try to make her happy & I really neglected my own mental needs...to the point of having a suicide plan recently... so it feels awful that not only did I fail in this endeavor, she feels like she was abused throughout.

I don't know what to think. I just finally got back with a therapist after several years of only having a psychiatrist. I take 4 psych meds. I don't know if I'm a monster or if her head is/has been skewed or both. 

What I do know is I don't want to feel like the scum of the earth and I don't want to treat another person badly.

I have been on this since February (almost 7 months) and I greatly believe it has helped with my suicidal thoughts as I do not experience these nearly as much as I did and I sometimes think if the benefits are that great but last year I genuinely cried daily, self harmed (haven't in 6 months+) and had attempted (also to do with stressful life situations). I was on 25mg, then 50 for a couple-few months but dropped back to 25mg as I don't think my body could handle it as I always felt sick. I was previously on sertraline which worsened my bpd mood swings but it also made me feel sick everyday so I don't know if medication is just a bit detrimental to me. Anyway, negatively, I would say i had an ED last year, lost a stone on sertraline but I eat normal again and have put it back on and a few pounds more but overall have maintained my weight however, I am a very active person, 20,000-30,000 steps a day + gym & I don't overeat so I genuinely think if I was not so active I would have gained a lot of weight on these pills.

My psychiatrist prescribed me pristiq, I'll go down from 10mg of lexapro to 5 these next few days then quit cold turkey.

Unfortunately, I can’t really muster any of that passion. Since I began taking antidepressants in October, I have documented a severe decrease in my overall quality of life. This has also been documented on the app by both myself and my care team. I am on my 4th course of antidepressants this episode with only an increase in depression symptoms. I expressed this to my psychiatrist as well as my suggestion that I stop this course of meds, just to see if some of my symptoms decrease. There was some back and forth, and she called me aggressive (which was annoying because I’m just asserting myself, it’s my brain after all and no shit I’m irritable when I haven’t felt a positive emotion to my core in months). But I also understood because I was definitely channeling my anger to help me blow past my fawn response of compliance. Eventually, I explain that I had done some independent research and knew that other types of medications (anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics) could potentially be more useful. After that she backed off and was like, oh well if you need an anticonvulsant then we need to refer you to someone irl. To which I replied, I would rather be on the right course of meds than be on an online platform. In the end, we are trying new anxiety and sleep meds with no antidepressant (against the doc’s recommendation) for two months. If there’s no change, then she’ll recommend an antidepressant again. Ugh, the whole thing was really hard and I was shaking for most of it. I feel like my doc made it harder than it had to be though. Especially since I didn’t want to even begin the 4th course, at the end of the 3rd I said I wanted to stop antidepressants completely and was told to try again.

I don't like being on all these meds. I have major depression, and am on antidepressants as well. I also have GAD and social anxiety. Finding a new psychiatrist is impossible in my area, because our mental health care is government funded and extremely limited, even more so during the pandemic.

9,how to work on attachment,"Hi. I (20F) just got broken up with by my ex (22M) last night and have been NC. It's a very long story, but he ended things because of my behavior in the past few months being toxic and harmful. He said he loved me, he didn't want to do it, was ugly crying with me, but it was done anyway. Over the course of our nearly 8 month relationship, major life events happened, I lost sight, and he ended up becoming my Favorite Person unintentionally. 

I have been in bouts of crying, but I have been talking with many people and have a rocky plan for the foreseeable future. First, I have CBT and DBT in the next two days, and then on Wednesday I'm going to the doctor to switch my medication (cymbalta) to something else that will target mood swings. I am going to join a grief support group to manage the grief I felt these past couple months. I've written out the toxic attachments I developed and boundaries that we had at the beginning that fell away. 

I'm going to stay NC until Friday, wherein I'll reevaluate everything, but I don't know how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? I don't have these issues with anyone else in my life, only my romantic partner(s), and until the shit of life hit the fan, I was navigating my attachment very well. 

He is truly the love of my life, and we had so many things planned together. Everything was mapped out, and I was so secure with him. I believe when things went down that I used him too much for emotional reliance and we became a tad codependent. We are both anxious attachment, I think, and I have BPD whereas he does not. I do still love him, though, and I want to firstly work on my own issues for a while, but I do want to be with him again, if he'd try us out again.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? Or just any advice in general? 

edit: broke no contact. found out he and his sister are leaving town for a while, so I left him a voice-mail last night telling him to stay safe and that I miss him. said I love you. texted his sister a similar sentiment. the lack of response really feels like I just tore my own insides out, but I suppose that's the decision that's been made. I dont want to lose him, and I feel I already have

edit 2: talked to my dr. the medication I was on for my arthritis gave me psychosis, and my rheumatologist didn't check my mental history before prescribing them. I stopped those, started taking prozac instead of cymbalta, and started 3 omega-3 fish oils, 1 vitamin b1, and 2 magnesium glycinate. i had a phone call w his sister a few days ago and she said he isn't ready to talk yet but it was fairly amicable. sending a text tmrw for his birthday but haven't reached out. going to the psychiatrist in a few weeks to get mood stabilizers. ive done a lot of journaling, therapy, and talking and distracting. I know I can thrive without him and I don't NEED him to survive, but I do love him and he enhances my life. I want us to work out, but I'm not going to spam or go crazy w the contact. After the bday text, I'm not going to reach out, which is hard, but if it's meant to be he will come back.",1711942056.0,False,5,4,casineb,None,1bstfxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1bstfxm/how_to_work_on_attachment/

I am also dealing with seizures. Even though they are controlled with medication, I still have all the side effects of experiencing a seizure. Which for me include, severe, intense, mood swings that cannot be controlled and I have seizures daily unfortunately. The seizure medication is also a very heavy mood stabilizer and sedates me alot. But sometimes it is not enough on top of my bpd. I am stable in the sense that I can be completely normal and healthy, but my brain is damaged to the point I can easily have these ""breakdowns"". This also includes not being able to look at light during, because it hurts really bad, any touching, any sensation, or noise. My body is a ball of nerves pretty much.

I don't feel much love or lust anymore ether. The person I'm seeing thinks I'm not interested because as much as I want to feel as if I'm into him, (which I am btw and I was most definitely until the medication) I just feel numb.

I am working out regularly, which also has a stabilizing effect.

He tries his best to be supportive but doesnt put up with dramatic behaviour and he made it pretty clear that drama wont work long term, so I had to cut it.
With boyfriends I didnt respect much, splitting was easy along the lines of devaluing. With narcissistic ones who were unpredictable and abusive I could split along those lines.
But now there is not much to split. Even if I split it isnt that bad.

17,I was psyical with my now ex,"I'm going to write this because I feel this is a safe place I won't be judged. Because you can rest assured, if anyone's judged me the most, it's me right now. 


Tonight I was psyical with my below ex partner. I found out he had cheated on me with his ex. I punched his back and sides whilist pushing him out if the car (the car was parked btw, I'm not that evil). All I remember is I just went crazy and exploded with anger. I had 0 intent of doing that. I didn't even know I was. I know that sounds like a excuse but honestly it came out of nowhere and was definitely not controlled. It's like I wasn't even there anymore. It's like I wasn't even real or happening. 


Previous to this he was being suspicious and was being quite hateful and angry towards me. Gaslighting and manipulative. This in turn made my bpd worse. I became angry and manipulative back. My nervous system became overloaded and I could not eat, shower, or function for days. I'd just shake with the intense panic and emotional terminal I was feeling over this time. Before I saw him, I meditated and did breathing exercises because I could not stop shaking knowing it could be the end of the relationship. And then all of a sudden after hearing he cheated I don't know what happened, I completely lost control. I mean that to my core. 


I came home and I am a mess. I'm seeing fading colors, I'm swinging from extreme emotions, I am suicidal, you name it. I have such a intense long past of being cheated on since I was 16 all the way to my 30s now. I'm still being cheated on to this day.

18,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

19,A Word of Hope For Those In Middle Age Still Struggling With Their BDP,"I woke up this morning to a post asking the relatively older members of the community (late 30s to early 40s) if they still struggle with the emotional roller coaster that is BPD. The OP asked if anyone else in that age group was still struggling with wild shifts in mood despite being told that their symptoms are supposed to stabilize in middle age. I’m glad to say that the OP found kindred spirits and I hope that was enough to comfort them with the notion that they are not failing at recovery.
As the day went on, I stumbled upon some interesting information that I think would be more helpful. I am currently listening to the audiobook “How to Be Sad” by Helen Russell (which I think many of us should, it’s a wonderful book, but I digress). She talks about the importance of letting ourselves feel our emotions lest they get pent up and rare their ugly heads later on in life. 
In her research and consulting of numerous professionals for the book, she found that statistics show that humans and monkeys are more likely to display symptoms of depression and emotional distress in their middle age, hence the term “mid life crisis.” Most of the experts she consulted mentioned that as you approach old age, the symptoms begin to lift as the stresses of middle age begin to subside. 
I found it rather helpful so I thought of sharing it with the OP. Thing is, I can’t for the life of me find the post. Im in three BPD related communities so I’ve decided to share this as a post in all of them in hopes it’ll make its way to the right person. 

While I can’t relate to the situation because I’m a little young (25, F), having the notion that there’s a reason this is happening and I’m not failing at my recovery is helpful. I hope that OP and the several kindred spirits in their comment section can also feel the same way with this info. 
Peace and love to all of you. 

TL;DR: If you’re older and struggling with your symptoms even though you were told this would slow down as you get older, you aren’t broken. There’s a scientific evidence that middle aged people are more prone to depression and emotional distress due to the stresses that come with it. Keep doing your best, the science also shows that it slows down once you get closer to old age.",1695334482.0,False,6,5,TheUndrachiever,None,16ot532,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/16ot532/a_word_of_hope_for_those_in_middle_age_still/
20,Lamotrigine for BPD?,"Hey, so I started for the first time medication a little over a year ago (relearn/mirtizipine) and I was noticing at first it worked and made me gain a lot of weight which I didn’t mind cause I’m 5’8 and was 122-139 fluctuating. Sticks and bones. And the weight gain made me gain good weight; got a butt etc got thick lol. I looked good w the weight gain.

But it started giving me suicidal thoughts and my typical 2 week depression that I’d experience here and there put me in a 6-9 month depression that I couldn’t beat. Getting off the meds I felt better for 2 months and still feel better but I’m noticing I’m developing instead of depression, rage and anger problems. Like 0-100 anger problems and I also can’t take minor inconvenience. Like a dr appt being rescheduled makes me feel angry, I feel impatient and I can’t go to work or focus at work and I’m afraid I’ll push my boyfriend away again. (I understand ppl need to protect their peace BPD IS DRAINING) so I have to do my part to ensure I’m ensuring a good environment for not only myself but my kid and the ones who support me. My dr recommended lamotrigine and it seems scary certainly when I’m just tryna stabilize my mood fr, and mute my emotions. I have goals to uphold and I quit jobs easily but can’t this time. I realized I called off work twice (I’m still in my 90 days) and didn’t care to lose my job… which is an effect of my unstablized mood, the inability to think about the cause an effects of decisions I make when I’m angry. Who I snap out on, and I’m tryna avoid an episode from happening cause I can feel it. Is this medicine doing too much?

22,Positive ways to get healthier/fitter?,"I'm wondering if any of you guys have found a balanced, healthy approach to getting fitter.

My mood is heavily linked to how I feel about my body and how comfortable I am physically. I have IBS and body dysmorphia, plus a problem with emotional eating. Ahhhhh.

Recently I've put on some weight and every time I feel the new fat around my upper body (aka every time I sit down) I start to feel panicky. It's really hard to do something about this consistently in a healthy way. My instant reaction is ""I need to starve myself"" ""I need to start an insane diet"" ""I need to work out every day"" ""I hate myself"" ""I'm gonna smoke a cigarette instead of eating"" etc etc. I have tried to replace this with positive thoughts like, I am going to nourish myself with healthy food and keep my body strong, but this isn't giving me enough consistent motivation to lose these extra pounds that are making me so uncomfortable.

I also know losing this weight won't solve everything but I do feel like being uncomfortable in my skin is a huge factor in my emotional stability. I think feeling stronger and healthier and slimmer will help me out.

I would just like to hear from anyone with similar problems who's found a healthy way forward? I'm hoping it's possible, I'd love to hear your experiences.

I miss feeling connected and as hard as I work towards bettering myself, I'm still rather alone.

24,Feeling hopeless,"I just got off the phone with my doctor regarding my diagnosis. I have had around 10 years of therapy (of which three years of CBD) and  several diagnoses (attachment disorder, childhood abuse/neglect, ptsd, adhd, ED,  unspecified personality disorder among other smaller stuff). A lot of these have not been taken seriously or disregarded by other specialists because I was too young, too unstable or the diagnoses were clashing. Which is all valid. but i felt like I am in a calmer and more stable environment so I can get properly diagnosed.

Now they told me that I do seem like I have a high functioning personality disorder that seems to be BPD. BUT. i am too high functioning. they literally told me I seem to have ""beaten"" it already. I am 21 years old, which seems kinda unlikely to me as neither myself nor any of my friends or family think I am mentally healthy enough to go without any diagnosis or treatment and now I am stuck with the diagnosis of reoccurring depression - which in no way explains my extreme mood swings, dissociative episodes and occasional psychotic episodes. Feeling depressed is honestly the least of my worries.

BPD is rooted in both sides of my family and several specialists have told me I do check most of the boxes. I don't know what to do, my FP just left me because I am too difficult and too depressed and dysfunctional for him to handle. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this and I don't know how to get a second opinion (I'm in the UK). In the meantime I am unable to do any uni work and am without a job due to the pandemic and I just spend all day in bed trying to get through the day without making things worse, while my mental health gets worse every day.

My symptoms are fucking up my life so much and I am so done feeling this way and being so dysfunctional all the time and not having any stability regarding the people in my life. I just wanna be normal. I don't wanna drink or get high to not feel anymore, I don't wanna keep isolating myself from the people I care about because I'm scared I'll hurt their feelings or do something that'll end up in them leaving me. I don't wanna be this way I wanna work my way to being somewhat normal, and yet I am ""too high functioning"" to be treated. I feel hopeless and like all this is never gonna go away and I don't know how to keep living this life without any proper help or understanding from my surroundings....

What do I do? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

5,"Medication (lamptrigine, CBD, THC)","Hey everyone, I (F25) am struggling with medication at the moment and would appreciate some insight from those with personal experience 

DISCLAIMER: I have a fab team of doctors monitoring all my conditions, but I would like some real-life advice. 

TLDR: Does lamotrigine make it *impossible* for you to get out of bed in the morning? Has it increased your libido? Do these side effects eventually wear off? Changing from cannabis to CBD oil, thoughts? 

Bit of a long one here. 

I have chronic pain from Endometriosis as well as BPD and Bipolar 2. 

I was on a cocktail of medication, and I impulsively stopped all of my medication (except 1) in December 2022. I was taking nortiptiline (for pain) for a while until we realized it stimulated manic episodes (bipolar 2), so we switched to pregabalin, but that made me severely depressed, and I experienced some neurological symptoms (inability to speak/form sentences, brain fog etc). This is mainly what led to my impulsive decision to stop all my meds. 

I am now re-introducing my medication, one at a time, so I can pinpoint which side effects come from which medication. So far I have reintroduced tramadol (pain) lamotrigine (BPD + Bipolar 2), celecoxib (pain), and occassional SR tramadol (pain flares). 

Due to my pain, my sex life is pretty much non-existent, and my partner (M30) has been so patient with me through all of this. I recently started lamotrigine again (2 weeks ago) on a 50mg dose. My libido has increased significantly! We are talking every day, when prior to this, it may have been once or twice a month. However, I find it *impossible* to get out of bed in the mornings. 

- has anyone experienced the changes to sleep and libido when starting lamotrigine? Does it get better over time? I want to keep the increased libido, but I'm not sure if it is worth the struggle in the morning. Am I taking the medication too late (10 pm normally)?

I also use cannabis to help with my pain, anxiety, and erratic mood swings. I know that cannabis isn't the best for us with BPD. 

- has anyone switched from using cannabis to CBD oil (minimal THC content)? I recently had a consult at a cannabis clinic and am considering using the CBD oil instead, but I'm not sure if this will give me the same relief from pain and anxiety.

Before that, I was on 300 mg lamotrigine, 250 mg venlaflaxine with prolonged release and 100 mg of normal venlaflaxine, 75 mg trazodone and occasionally if things got bad I had 10 mg oxazepam. 

But last friday I got raised trazodone to 150 mg and was told to start taking oxazepam daily. The thing is, I am scared of taking oxazepam daily because it really drains my energy and I am currently at uni. Meaning I wouldn't probably be able to study as well as I do now.

Idk if it'll stop working for every person but To all who I gave hope, I'm sorry 😞. I thot I found a solution to at least enjoy my time together with her but it seems it was likely short lived. If we get out of this postively somehow long term, I'll update.

This exact stack: bought from vitamin shoppe.

Solgar omega 3 950mg

Vitaminshoppe brand L theanine 100mg

Vitaminshoppe Nac 600mg

has pretty much saved my relationship and now I'm happily married.

For us, it has made her no longer explosive/randomly angry or self isolating anymore. It's legit 99% a normal relationship now . There's only been some small things were we communicated within under an hour each time like a normal understanding convo with one another. Sometimes even in 5 mins we good after small thing. That B4 trying this supplement stack, normaly wouldve made her give up on us and self isolate for days and or she'd get mad about it, if i was able to get her to try to tell me wat she was feeling. We are super happy to say we haven't had a meltdown in 27 days! B4 it was literally everry 2-3 days. We are still meltdown free since Dec 19 (x and we are both super happy to be with each other ❤️💗. !!! ((: She's felt so much happier, she's told me and I've noticed it. it's been easier to talk to one another too. We've committed to a future together and are starting a semi life in the same home soon cx. This stack is a ship saver!! It really balanced out her intense feels to practically nothing!. She does still have small sad type moments here and there from things that remind her of childhood trauma alittle or things that she gets mad at herself internally abit for forgetting. But when they do happen and I notice she's looking down a little, I ask her about it in a supportive way, and she opens up and within about 10 mins and we are past it and up again. That's it(:. it's very occasional too. Like once a week. Very manageable, easy to recover, communicating is easier and is much more possible now.

This is wat she takes and when:

1pm everyday, she takes the stack, 2 of each listed.

10pm she takes her lamotrigine and 1 vitaminne shop brand magnesium glycinate 400mg tablet form

No idea if she still needs her lamo subscription med but didn't want to chance us melting down again. So still on it. Might maybe try it without later in the future, now that the stack and magnesium seems to help alot. For now tho we are super happy together (:. Anyone else that sees this, it takes the edge off very noticably! Try it. 😁. Do you and or your special person a huge favor and start the stack ASAP, you won't regret it. Worth every penny.

Also she's not in DBT. We do our best for each other and love care n support one another. We are incredibly happy with this stack and mag.

I am writing because I feel like I have cyclically encountered the same obstacles and instigated the same disputes in my relationship with a stable, patient, loving partner who I am currently long-distance from. I have never physically hurt him in any way, but I recurrently get into the same argument, which he has begun to vocalize more freely is really hurting him. Obviously, both because I love him and don't want him to leave me, I would do anything to stop hurting him. But I need help figuring my way out of this self-contained paradox that is plaguing me. 

In an argument we had today, which started from a facetime call when I began to rant about some interpersonal troubles I was having with friends and then became embarrassed / felt like he didn't understand me and ended the call, he asked me whether I was trying to hurt him on purpose. I said no, I am trying to understand why someone so stable would stay with me(this is a continual issue I face, embedded in the fact that I don't see myself as healed yet and thus convince myself I'm undeserving of secure attachment). He has heard this before, and undoubtedly he will hear it again.

I asked him why he thought I was trying to hurt him, and how I could stop.

We agreed we can both take space, as every phone call with him runs me into emotional overdrive and I'm left alone without any present comfort, but I really want to use this opportunity to explore my cognitive dysfunctions / dissonance so I can at least get a little bit better. I know recovery doesn't happen overnight, but I've been on this healing journey for long enough that regression makes me lose hope in the endgoal altogether.

I am seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow.

I also am no longer to see my last/only therapist, and am really hesitant to look for and begin with a new one as I've had such disheartening experiences in the past.

5,(25f) (26m) I had an insanely immature emotional reaction to something small my bf did and now I’m afraid I’ll lose him.,"(L
Together for a little over a year. 

For context I have BPD and am in therapy and take meds. 

I (25F) hurt my boyfriend (26M) yesterday night with my overly emotional raging reaction to something small. We were at baggage claim after a long delayed flight and it was 3am. He showed me texts between him and his friend (who is a girl). He was laughing at the phone and I felt a pang of jealousy in my chest. Something I could normally suppress much more easily turned into chaos. The next five minutes were a blur. I pulled away from him and paced around the carousel like a fucking baby rejecting all his loving advances. I have no clue what happened to me, I was operating on a motor. It was confusing and scary. I finally settle a bit and he shuts down. Says I made him feel like shit. I immediately go into panic mode trying to win his affections back. I apologized profusely and said I was exhausted and that was bad and tried being sweet but he was just shut down. I feel awful. He doesn’t deserve this.. The last few days were tough too because I cried over little things and it exhausted him. Anyway it’s the next morning and he’s still being distant from me and I’m afraid he’s going to leave me. I’m in so much pain. I want to control myself because I know the best way to ease the situation is to not cry right now and have another insane abandonment reaction. But it’s so hard. 
I know he’s going to want some space from me for a couple days because of this. And he’s probably going to be happier away from me probably rn.  That’s causing me so much pain that i cannot show. Anyway, how do I deal with his distance? And if he in fact does not dump me today or tomorrow, how do I work on this? I’m on meds (lamictal) and I’m in therapy. Please help. This man is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. He’s sweet kind loving incredible, the whole package. I want to be good for him and to him.

7,I’m surviving the worst part of my life. Recovery IS possible and I’m proof of it.,"Long post ahead. Tl;dr at the bottom.

For some background, I’m 29, just got diagnosed BPD last September. Despite that I struggled my entire life (suicidal thoughts, self harm, toxic relationships, MULTIPLE trips to the ER and I still was never properly diagnosed). I started DBT in October and just finished the program in April. I also started lamictal last year but just got on a dose that worked for me around February.

A little over three weeks ago, my husband got physically violent with me. He had “only” been verbally abusive in the past, which I let happen because I believed he would get better, even though he never even promised he would. 

And I LEFT. I just LEFT. I’ve never really felt the FP thing, but I definitely let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to me in the past. And I know if this happened a year ago…I would have stayed. I would have let him tell me he only hit me because my behavior made him. I would have let him make me believe I was the one who was getting the second chance to not fuck up. 

But after a year of intense therapy and meds (less than a year actually) I had the ability to leave him. And when he tried to control me, I still left. And when it meant I’d have to live alone, I still left. And even when I had a full emotional breakdown on our first wedding anniversary, one week after he hit me, I still left.

Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am for keeping myself safe, something I never have done in the past. This is the hardest and worst thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. But I know I’ll survive, and honestly, I owe that to DBT and all the work I put into it.

Please don’t give up hope. Keep trying, keep putting in the work. It’s worth it and so are you.

10,having bpd is the equivalent to having third degree burns all over your body,"long ass vent for myself tbh

""Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement""

Marsha linehan who developed the therapy method DBT said that about people who suffer from borderline.

It quite literally produces the most intense emotional pain of any mental illness, it has a fatality rate of 10% 45 times more than the general population. 

According to Linehan we lose all cognitive functioning during periods of extreme emotional distress which unfortunately for BPD can happen at the drop of a feather. 

Personally for me it used to be a raging burning feeling in my head. Where I couldnt hear the rational part of my brain telling me you love this person, this isn't you, you don't want to do this, it's not a big deal. The voice in the back of my head that shuts that shit down immediately now was practically silenced. I couldnt hear them no matter how much I tried. Or if I actually managed to hear them and gripped onto it to bring myself back; I would just spiral and fall right back into the pit anyways. Because I had never even started the true healing process. And because the person I was with fed the worst parts of my fears and insecurities. My brain was completely consumed with so much of that hurt/fear/insecurity/humilation and it turned to a unceasing completely blinding rage. I would fall back in again and again desperately clawing to get out but succumbing each time to the borderline insanity that involuntarily manifested in my brain. 

My most painful moments of BPD haunt me every day. The absolute loss of control I used to feel over the smallest most stupid things. Scream crying alone in my room again and again, feeling the extreme grief equivalent to all my loved ones being murdered in front of me repeatedly over a simple relationship ending, its literally hell on fucking earth. Right now my dog who I love more than anything (outside of my FP) even more than myself, could be murdered right in front of me and I still know it wouldn't even compare to what I felt in every moment of the nightmare that was my existence at the time. 

I remember thinking in those moments of absolute mania and panic that this was anguish beyond belief, nothing had ever compared or ever could. Not even the extreme torture and abuse from my childhood. And I got brushed off and told it wasn't nearly THAT bad and it just feels that way because I'm still so close to it. No way could the emotional pain ever match the insanity of what my step mum put me through. As if I wasn't the one who had to deal with and then overcome the unceasing years and years of nightmares, flashbacks and constant panic attacks. As if I don't remember how acute that particular pain is. 

Well it's been over a year now and my extreme physical pain experiences will never ever fucking compare to the absolute torture of those moments. I would go through the worst of the worst all again than feel even a moment of that. When I tell people that they really can't believe me. They hear what happened to me in childhood and then what my ex did to me and it's not even comparable to them. How could I even for a second say she hurt me more? 

People without BPD literally cannot even comprehend how painful and intense our emotions can get. How everything is dialled up to a billion and we have NO control over it. I truly believe the vast vast majority of them (even ones who have been seriously hurt) have never felt the amount of agony that BPD people (involuntarily) create in their own heads. I believe that, because I've been through extreme verbal sexual and physical abuse and it was nothing to how my brain blindsided and ambushed me when I got my first FP. I understand why it doesn't make sense to them they will never understand what we have to live with and go through every day just by existing. But for me personally no amount of my sexual trauma or physical torture will ever compare to the pain of just being with a favourite person who showed me my first experiences of ""love"", made me feel joy for the first time in my life and then had to leave me, moved on and no longer cared for me at all anymore. (Actually was actively out for my blood in my situation 😐) Especially when you only live for the people you love in the first place. They are your entire centre of existence. In your head it's absolutely inconceivable you could ever not dedicate every part of yourself to them. What do you do then...

Fortunately for me I healed. Back then, with the person I was with, my body did really feel like an exposed wound at all times. Any little thing could set it off and cause me extreme pain. She couldn't understand how much pain I was in because I was cursed to manifest it as anger. Of course that makes it hard to empathise with especially when you become a victim of abuse as a result. I truly couldn't control it, I didn't realise this at the time but she constantly unintentionally kept me in a state of fear of abandonment and continuously enforced insecurities surrounding my body and who I even am as a person. Every little thing would set me off subconsciously, it would effect my emotions and actions in ways I couldn't control or many times even notice. Because my feelings were constantly being hurt by her, constantly felt devestation bubbling under the surace because no one meant more to me, no one's effect on my emotions even came close. So sometimes it was overt and drastic. I truly could not understand my extreme reaction to something so stupid after. That wasn't me. No part of that was me I know now deep down to my core my need for control completely came from fear. I was 100x more sensitive, everything was so agonising all the time without me even realising. And unfortunately that led me to take it out on them which kept me in a constant state of shame and regret that I had to push down as well.

Throughout my childhood my brain learned that fight, not flight would save me. The only time the torture stopped was when I hurt them back. So when I feel pain or hurt or anything that destabilizes me; especially from the person who had grounded me the most and had once made me feel the safest and most loved when no one else has before. I became theirs. I quite literally belonged to them, I didn't even realise how miserable I was. Once they showed me that side to life I couldn't let go. I relied on them entirely for any sense of safety and comfort or happiness so subconsciously when they took that away from me my brain ""defends"" itself without my fucking permission. It haunts me that the people I loved the most I used to hurt the most. I wish it could have been anyone else than the people I care for so deeply. As much as I wish I internalized that pain...I couldn't, I really really fucking couldnt at the time. So I lashed out, again and again and again uncontrollably until she thankfully left me and I got to find someone I could actually have my skin and a true sense of safety with for the first time in my life. 

Immense healing happened so rapidly. She immediately made me feel secure in my body, and satisfied in general within the first few weeks, which gave me a huge boost of self esteem and motivation to actually practice self care and improve myself. I mean if she could find me beautiful this fucking girl then I gotta try. I had to actually be worthy of her. I will never let myself be unworthy again. I needed to stop being a depressed potato and actually be my best self. Be Bucky in a sense. Also she seemed so attracted to me, so into me and even my body. She saw something I never could I wanted to see myself for the first time through her eyes. See myself as beautiful. 

She gave me hope, actually hope I could be better and change everything. Undo all the excessive damage that was done to my brain. Figure out all the different personalities rattling around in there and learn to listen and focus on the ones that are actually me. Not manifested from the darkest, traumatised, survival mode parts of myself. I realised I had so many layers, so many different thought processes going on at once. Of course it led to instability. I needed to silence them... I started DBT. I grinded in therapy twice a week. I consistently took my Lamictal and started Vyvanse to help with the head buzzing. Worked full time while in school to afford the insurance. Let out my emotions through working with animals and working out. I felt satisfication with myself every day, not even exhausted cause atleast now I was trying. I was accomplishing something. Every day learning new things about myself and taking steps forward. I discovered crazy things about myself in therapy (not necessarily always fun stuff) but it opened my mind so much to hopefully bring out the best version of me. 



One of my most intense triggers was retroactive jealousy. It tormented me constantly in my last relationship it was one of the first big leaps to destroying it and continued to break it down further throughout. Every tiny thing used to set me off and make me feel incredibly insecure. It's hard to describe what it felt like it's been so long since I felt anything even similar and it wasn't quite as overwhelming as the black out split rages. So not as potent a memory for me. But it was a mix of masochism and deep deep insecurity and hatred of myself compared to CIS men, which led to rages and spiralling. I would make her confirm my worst fears again and again maybe just to hurt myself, maybe in desperate attempt to make it okay in my head. It was mental self harm and I didn't realise that. RAJ was completely new to me (in fact I didn't even know every through out what was really going on) and it absolutely blindsided me. After that I didn't even know how to deal with it, I didn't know where to begin. I don't think I even possibly could have with the person I was with. I could never have gotten to a point with them where I believed in myself, or didn't constantly hate myself, and wasnt stuck in perpetual loop of survival mode with.

I thought I experienced RAJ with her because she was my first FP but with my current FP I could prod myself all day and feel absolutely nothing. Not a shred of hurt or insecurity. She healed me so much by just making me feel unconditionally loved for the first time in my life. Physically being with her is incredibly important it's my #1 love language and she has built up my view of my body to heights I would have never imagined. We are so fucking intensely intimate all the time it's crazy (it's the bpd in us) Who else could fucking matter we are each other's universes. I know that I'm her world and no one else, even a CIS man could compare. (Seriously though retroactive jealousy as a transman dating a straight girl is the worst and made me act like a completely different person Jesus Christ) I know I don't have to feel jealous because every fucking day she shows me that. I don't feel completely disconnected and isolated from her. I'm so god damn lucky, she gives me such a sense of peace and fullfillment. I tricked myself into thinking my last relationship was anything close to love or feeling real love...when I don't feel that constant turmoil and instability, when I actually feel like enough, when I'm grounded in who I am and feel safe and secure with who I'm with; it's so so so much easier. Everything felt so out of control when my head was constantly scared and in defence mode with them. Constantly needing to win arguments because admitting I'm wrong takes vulnerability which I could not show to her. So easy to admit I'm wrong to my current partner and to just drop any disagreement because I feel subconsciously safe enough to give up all power to her anytime. Plus my current partner having BPD unlike my ex; she actually can understand the insane amount of pain we can feel over the smallest things. How it compares to nothing else. How out of that pain we can say and do things that aren't any part of us at all. She doesn't just write it off because its so extreme and irrational. We both can have so much empathy and understanding for each other and it's so peaceful. Never taking an us VS them mentality. Feeling like you're always on the same team with your partner. Constantly growing, learning and healing together. We don't argue at all because before it can even escalate we have already focused on listening and validating the other person in their concern and come to a conclusion together that works.

Along those lines she also helped me discover my severe sexual abuse, healed my ""partners family hating me trauma"" that I've experienced throughout the years for many different reasons, affirmed me constantly in every aspect of my body that used to destroy me, rekindled my relationship with my mum an old shame of mine. Basically pushed the kind, strong, grounded side of me to the surface with her unceasing support, and given me a first look at a stable normal happy healthy life. (god damn the way she went all out at Christmas for me, healed something deep to my little kid core) She was my first hope. Hope that we can actually achieve the dream future I've always pictured; become the person I always dreamed of. First real reason to have any ambition or to give a shit in life where my brain before was just in a dead end slump of hopelessness.

BPD is a fucking curse. But with the right support system and enough effort/ dedication it can actually be manageable. Life is so much easier when I can practice emotional regulation and actually grow my emotional skin for the first time. It may have been stripped from me as a kid but I know love, time, dedication and resources can heal me fully one day. I may always be a loaded gun because of what happened to me, and I've always struggled before to keep my finger off the trigger. But not anymore with the right toolset I'm going to destroy that trigger entirely.

0,Help Navigating Help,"Howdy! Last year around October, I started counseling and medication again. I was in the tail end of a bad relationship and hadn’t had a job in months. Now, I’m single, live with super supportive friends, and have a job I’m extremely passionate about.

Unfortunately, I can’t really muster any of that passion. Since I began taking antidepressants in October, I have documented a severe decrease in my overall quality of life. This has also been documented on the app by both myself and my care team. I am on my 4th course of antidepressants this episode with only an increase in depression symptoms. I expressed this to my psychiatrist as well as my suggestion that I stop this course of meds, just to see if some of my symptoms decrease. There was some back and forth, and she called me aggressive (which was annoying because I’m just asserting myself, it’s my brain after all and no shit I’m irritable when I haven’t felt a positive emotion to my core in months). But I also understood because I was definitely channeling my anger to help me blow past my fawn response of compliance. Eventually, I explain that I had done some independent research and knew that other types of medications (anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics) could potentially be more useful. After that she backed off and was like, oh well if you need an anticonvulsant then we need to refer you to someone irl. To which I replied, I would rather be on the right course of meds than be on an online platform. In the end, we are trying new anxiety and sleep meds with no antidepressant (against the doc’s recommendation) for two months. If there’s no change, then she’ll recommend an antidepressant again. Ugh, the whole thing was really hard and I was shaking for most of it. I feel like my doc made it harder than it had to be though. Especially since I didn’t want to even begin the 4th course, at the end of the 3rd I said I wanted to stop antidepressants completely and was told to try again.

I have been on the long and exhausting journey of finding the right medication combo for the side effects of my BPD.

I am currently on Prozac 20mg x1, Hydroxyzine 50mg x3, Clonidine .02mg x3, Trazodone 100mg x1, Zofran 4mg xAs needed, and Adderall 30mg XR x1.

1,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

I got hospitalized again. 3rd time.
I was having a good calming 72 hours.
Later on I have realized I am an alcoholic. 

So I quit, I think at least 40% of my sanity comes from not drinking. I tried A.A in person and online plus networking, I personally didn’t like it.

Then my psychiatrist prescribed me Librium, I was on over than reg dose for anxiety -(reg dose that ppl take in google) 
I was being a zombie but I think it was worthy, I’m tired of laying down all day.

Since I was a zombie I decreased the dose, switched to klonopin since quantity is not available for some reasons in my area. 
I was on 1 mg, started SNRI -Pristiq. 
25mg once daily didn’t work.
50mg I felt difference after I started taking it for like more than 3 weeks.

As time goes on, I added weed (vaping and consuming medical weed) for tapering benzo+I like the effect. Makes me distracted when I am upset sometimes, when I need a calming time, morning time before my pharma med kicks in, before I go to bed.

I take only 0.25 of klpin twice daily.



So
-Antidepressant reg dose (everyone is different, Pristiq was my match)

-No alcohol (my emotional side gets crazy)

-Benzo(I don’t recommend it because of severe physical withdrawal, but it’s working well for my anxiety. Before I would be walking and looking back v often and thinking someone would attack me. I don’t have those thoughts unless someone gets super x2 close to me. 

-Medical mmj. Since I don’t like how potent flower smells it works. 
 I don’t recommend black market for vaping. Since I have been paying for my therapy out of pocket, I have 2sessions a month now. Used to have 3-4 sessions a month. 
Tbh now albeit I use about 3g of vaping mmj within in a month in a med mmj expensive City(half gram would cost me $65-75), I pay less for my mental health(it’s been 12 years, going to therapy, looking for right medication. I couldn’t handle dbt. I hated group sessions.)



I am far better than who I was exactly a year ago. I dropped out of school, I got a small job, talking to my parents, I don’t feel so miserable like before. I don’t want to kill myself for things that don’t matter. 

I feel like I am gifted. 
Even tho I have some struggles daily, ofc life is not a easy thing. My work place is stressful, min wage. But at least I can kill time with studying.
I’m just gonna get a certification.


I had 100,000 thoughts a day. Now I have 5000 thoughts and those are not suicidal.

5,"REALIZED I HAVE BPD....SUPPLEMENTS? 5HTP, GABA?","ill try to make this brief,even though we all know  BPD Struggle is far from...

i think i have been dealing with BPD all my life but i never quite knew it..

in hindsight i can see where BPD played a role in a lot of situations throughout my life..

2 years ago on my birthday i had a huge panic attack i thought i was going to die, i was smoking weed,drinking and i took some pills..i still dont know wtf they were...then my heart started beating..my vision started getting blurry..i was seeing white...it was like i was dieing...i was taken to the ER...i left the ER and was experiencing depersonalization and derealization for the first time ever...my gf left the next day and i was left by myself with this horrible fuckin feeling...

i stayed in that house for months...i couldnt even leave the house..i would go buy food at 2 or 3 in the morning..i was smoking weed even though the weed instantly gave me panic attacks..i was just hoping that it would fix me somehow...i stayed in this horrible state for months..non stop panic attacks..no sleep...barely eating...shut off from the world..having to fake like i was okay when i spoke with my mother...i cant worry her..i couldn't tell her that i wanted to kill myself and that looking in the mirror i did not recognize myself..

 time goes by...cant work...cant function..im just in hell all day 24/7

its been a while and i dont really feel depersonalized anymore but my emotions are out of control...like on a severe level...

for the longest i was so focused on the DP/DR that i never took the time to look at the cause of the anxiety..i was so focused on treating anxiety and dp/dr but this last month my girlfriend broke up with me because i had an instance of ""splitting"" i guess they call it and for the very first time i actually noticed that my way of thinking is waaay screwed up.....i finally see alot of the BPD symptoms...i now know that i don't think like everyone else...im always thinking negative...typical bpd things like the black and white..the favorite person...the splitting..and the shame...guilt...all these things i had been feeling my whole life...but before it was manageable...i was able to function...i didnt ever think about suicide..but after that huge panic attack and dp/dr/depression/ it seems my BPD is just fuckin exploded full force and all those symptoms are flaring all day....im sensitive as hell..on edge

i cant function...the only thing keeping me calm is a benzo..klonapin...that takes the anxiety away but without it...i feel like ill fall back into the pitts of dp/dr...i have been taking it for a while..maybe 2 years?

My  ex gf broke up with me after i had an instance where i ""split"" because she didnt answer my phone call it was scary.......fear of abandonement kicked in and everything else aswell..but thanks to her breaking up with me...i came to the realization that im not just dealing with extreme anxiety...but that i have deeper problems like bpd...

my thoughts are suicidal and negative all the time but now i am aware of the thoughts and i am aware that i am thinking incorrectly..i know can see and observe...where as before i didnt...i just felt the emotions and  rolled with them unknowingly...

ive done my due diligence on several other disorders...bipolar..bipolar 2..schizophrenia..etc but BPD describes me down to a T..it finally makes sense..any thoughts?opinions??questions??

theres more to the story such as im not in the U.S which is where i was raised till the age of 19, i was deported for buying alcohol with a fake id.

i was sent  to a 3rd world country..people dont speak the language and i cant relate,ive been here for 8 years and all that stress was probably building till the mind just couldn't handle it anymore? causing me to dissociate..?

but why the severe BPD?

i am always on the brink of tears..i am agitated and sad...suicidal thoughts are most of my day..i remember my ex gf and i feel guilty because i put her through alot of bad moments in life...from her witnessing me having to go to the ER to a lot of emotional abuse,she is a sweetheart.. truly beautiful..she not once disrespected me ever..so when i think of those times...my anxiety instantly revs up..and i start thinking suicidal thoughts due to the guilt and negative self talk..racing thoughts etc... its like its happening all over again...i feel pathetic because i fucked up bad and put her through hell..

i know i shouldnt feel that way beacause i really dont think im too much at fault,the bpd was fucking my life up for the longest and i had no clue..now i challenge my thoughts,meditate,supplement,trying to do CBT...wish there was DBT here but there is not...im really down and out..i feel alone...im isolated...i think im what is considered a quiet borderline...why? because no one here speaks english..i have no family here in this country.. gf left me..no medical help...i cant even express my thoughts concerns or anything...if only someone here spoke some english..that would be helpful i feel...situation sucks...i've begun to kind of tip my family off to the fact that suicide is something i consider alot...its horrible i don't want to make them sad but this sucks...i cant go on this way...they are in the U.S. and i cant see them..they cant come here and i cant go back to the U.S. im kind of trying to ease the idea of me not being here but at the same time i feel horrible doing so..

I HAVE 2 SISTERS,AND MY MOTHER..I AM THE ONLY MALE..FATHER IS OUT THE PICTURE..

Help anyone?  
sometimes a kind word works wonders for me

SUPPLEMENTS TAKEN..OMEGA 3,POTASSIUM,VITAMIN B COMPLEX,VITAMIN D,MAGNESIUM,VITAMIN A,CENTRUM DAILY VITAMIN FOR MEN,MELATONIN EVERY OTHER MONTH...

THINKING OF TRYING 5HTP AND GABA....THEY JUST CAME IN THE MAIL.

i can elaborate more but im going to try and sleep now...just thought id post something quickly about supplements but it turned into this...

I have been on the long and exhausting journey of finding the right medication combo for the side effects of my BPD. I am also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder w/ Agoraphobia, and PTSD. But, I believe my Borderline is the biggest disruption, as it triggers all of my other disorders.

I have huge abandonment issues, causing me to feel like it's next to impossible to let go of people, ideas, irrational thoughts, etc.). My irritability is moderate. My depression is severe, it comes with suicidal ideations. Lastly, my anxiety is on and off, but when it's bad, it is debilitating.

I am currently on Prozac 20mg x1, Hydroxyzine 50mg x3, Clonidine .02mg x3, Trazodone 100mg x1, Zofran 4mg xAs needed, and Adderall 30mg XR x1.

4,"Medication (lamptrigine, CBD, THC)","Hey everyone, I (F25) am struggling with medication at the moment and would appreciate some insight from those with personal experience 

DISCLAIMER: I have a fab team of doctors monitoring all my conditions, but I would like some real-life advice. 

TLDR: Does lamotrigine make it *impossible* for you to get out of bed in the morning? Has it increased your libido? Do these side effects eventually wear off? Changing from cannabis to CBD oil, thoughts? 

Bit of a long one here. 

I have chronic pain from Endometriosis as well as BPD and Bipolar 2. 

I was on a cocktail of medication, and I impulsively stopped all of my medication (except 1) in December 2022. I was taking nortiptiline (for pain) for a while until we realized it stimulated manic episodes (bipolar 2), so we switched to pregabalin, but that made me severely depressed, and I experienced some neurological symptoms (inability to speak/form sentences, brain fog etc). This is mainly what led to my impulsive decision to stop all my meds. 

I am now re-introducing my medication, one at a time, so I can pinpoint which side effects come from which medication. So far I have reintroduced tramadol (pain) lamotrigine (BPD + Bipolar 2), celecoxib (pain), and occassional SR tramadol (pain flares). 

Due to my pain, my sex life is pretty much non-existent, and my partner (M30) has been so patient with me through all of this. I recently started lamotrigine again (2 weeks ago) on a 50mg dose. My libido has increased significantly! We are talking every day, when prior to this, it may have been once or twice a month. However, I find it *impossible* to get out of bed in the mornings. 

- has anyone experienced the changes to sleep and libido when starting lamotrigine? Does it get better over time? I want to keep the increased libido, but I'm not sure if it is worth the struggle in the morning. Am I taking the medication too late (10 pm normally)?

I also use cannabis to help with my pain, anxiety, and erratic mood swings. I know that cannabis isn't the best for us with BPD. 

- has anyone switched from using cannabis to CBD oil (minimal THC content)? I recently had a consult at a cannabis clinic and am considering using the CBD oil instead, but I'm not sure if this will give me the same relief from pain and anxiety.

But my friends especially the end. Because I am an artist who worked in childcare. It was so personal. I can not emphasize enough you MUST watch up till end for one specific line. The message is so important, this was made with folks with bpd in mind and their loved ones to see this.

7,Social anxiety tips?,"Hi, I have struggled with BPD for most of my life. I have also had interlinked difficulties with intense social anxiety/general anxiety. At points it is extremely difficult to leave my house or talk to anyone at all, other than my partner who I live with. 

Recently my social anxiety has become really bad again, partly because of spending way less time outside (pandemic/lockdown etc), and partly cuz of other factors. 

I can't take the bus anymore without having sudden intense panic attacks. I also have to talk to people on the phone for my work, and have had difficulties with that. Yesterday I had to reschedule a call because I just couldn't overcome my anxiety enough to get on the phone. 

What are your tips for overcoming this anxiety? It makes me feel really awful about myself and it's making my everyday life very difficult.

I don't like therapy at all because of this social anxiety, I always feel so uncomfortable in front of a therapist. I'm already on medication (cymbalta), and I don't think I can take benzos (I'm a drug addict).

Edit: tried to take a long trip outside today, transferred buses, was in public for a while, etc. All went great! Then an aggressive, leery dude mumbled to me about my genitals and followed me swiftly for many blocks.

8,Advice on shame/anxiety when plans go wrong/differently,"hey, I’m diagnosed with BPD with a family history of OCD and autism, so generally as a unit things not going according to plan can be very upsetting and frustrating. I was wondering if anyone has advice on how they worked to overcome this?


Example of what happened tonight leading me to reach out:
Because of my procrastination anxiety I didn’t start my homework until later in the day, that is my fault I’m usually better bout it; It was harder to focus today. I finally start, and only get 15 minutes in to what is planned to be an all nighter to prep for a Chem exam I have to make up. I’m already behind because of other mental health stuff and the prof was gracious enough to give me extensions. So, as I’m beginning chemistry after finishing English; the Wi-Fi goes out. I’ve reset it a few times and nothing; we are also currently having a really bad wind/rainstorm so I believe it’s an outside issue. It’s closed a road near me and has knocked power somewhere else. 


I’m proud with how I handled it tonight mostly,
I got really upset, and cursed quietly to myself out loud instead of raising a massive fuss. I’m not great with tech stuff and I’m also too short to see over the router, so I had to wake my brother up to ask him where the button was & how to flip it. He knows it finals for me so he was understanding, just sleepy. When i realized there was nothing I could do, I started to cry. I let myself cry as much as I could, with my own issues I tend to not cry much at a time, but a little is better than nothing. After that, I did something I usually don’t do in the past out of shame/fear; I emailed my professor. I let him know what was going on, and to let me know what he believes the best course of action should be first today. 
Since, I’ve been trying to take care of myself before bed. I’m bout to shower and I just smoked and took an edible.


 My problem is I’m still dealing with immense anger, shame, stress, anxiety, and fear over not getting to do my plan. I have whatever the “quiet” form of bpd is referred to, I forget the name; but I internalize things rather than externalize mostly. 
So I’m moving and functioning but inside I am heavily beating myself up over something currently out of my control, and for something I’ve already put myself accountable to.
How do you all cope with these feelings? Any advice would be awesome and appreciated. I’m in and out of therapy rn and trying to find a dbt place that takes my insurance.

9,New to BPD,"So I guess this is sort of my introduction, as im new and just exploringmy support options. I'm a 28F and married with 3 kids. I know the all the hate I'll get for this, but I haven't been clinically diagnosed yet, atm I'm still learning about bpd and collecting all the evidence to bring to my doctor so I can start the process of being diagnosed. 


Now that that's outta the way, let's start from the beginning. My mental issues, as it pertains to bpd, started manifesting when I was 9 after my parents split up. My parents were both abusive in different ways, mom is a narcissist and dad liked to beat us, but my siblings and I didn't know that our lives were all that bad because we didn't know any better. That was until the divorce... it was still pretty taboo to have divorced parents back then, so the schools put us in group counciling and that's when we started realizing everything. 


The divorce didn't make anything better tho, and as the years went on, everything compounded until I finally had a melt down. At 14 I was caught with razor blades on school campus, but the felt I was more of a threat to others than myself and I was sent to an alternative school for 3mos. When I got bk I basically told the school therapist I was going to keep mutilating myself bc no one cared enough to stop me. That's when I was finally hospitalized and diagnosed with ""severe depression with anxiety"". 3yrs later, that diagnosis changed to ""manic depression with severe anxiety"". I was on every medication you could think of, but nothing helped or lasted very long... my emotions have always been a daily rollercoaster for me and it was difficult to control.


At 19 I got pregnant with my first kid, I took preemptive steps on ppd. But all that did was delay the inevitable, and that was the last time I took any medication for my issues and started self medicating. I was doing pretty good until at 23, I lost what would have been my second kid. I spiraled for months after that, but even after it stopped I was still never as good as I was b4. Then at 25 I got pregnant again, and that's where things started getting really bad again. I didn't try to take meds during that time and the ppd hit me harder than the first time, even still as bad as I was, I still felt like I was handling it all very well... but 9mos later I was pregnant again and tht just turbo charged the spiral.


I knew my issues weren't normal and that I was worse than I had ever been b4 in my life, so I started doing research. Instead of focusing on past diagnosis, I researched all of my symptoms which I'll list off now.

☆ constant daily rollercoaster of emotions
☆various manifestations of paranoia
☆having different ""personalities"" for different people I interact with
☆hopelessness
☆self hate 
☆unstable relationships
☆inability to hold a job for more than 9mos
☆feeling like I'm not in control of my self or actions
☆impulsive habits
☆blackout rages
☆hyper fixation with new relationships 
☆saying things I don't mean
☆feeling lost
☆terrified of abandonment
☆feeling out of place or time
☆disassociating 
☆hearing/seeing things that aren't there
☆seething jealousy 
☆acute distrust, even with people close to me


Really I could go on and on, the point is that I came across bpd and everything just clicked. So I along with all of my research, I started listening to other people's stories and their struggles and it just solidified it all for me. I meet 7 out of 9 criteria points, and so I'm 99% sure that this is what my problems all stem from. Really, the only thing that's really stopping me from going to my doctors with all of this, is my distrust of the medical industry. I don't know how to approach the subject without sounding like I'm crazy or overreacting. I've had past professionals claim nothing is wrong and tht I'm just attention seeking, it's not often I'm ever taken seriously.

12,need some insight,"TW some ED and SH and S**cide mentions

So basically rn I'm 16. About 3 years ago I started having problems with depression and anxiety due to many factors including a huge move overseas and some serious cyber bullying from people close to me. With lockdown happening not much later everything because worst especially with the isolation and all that. I also did start having social media and pretty quickly got into the ""quirky depression"" side of tiktok but soon removed the app because I realised how stupid it was. 

Then the depression got pretty bad and it got to the point where I would sleep at 5 am everyday after spending hours in my bed doing nothing bit literally just crying. Sorry if I'm skipping things or not explaining properly I'm not very good with explaining. Also later on the suicidal thoughts were very frequent and for a few months they were very hard to get out of my head. 

I also started developing ED symptoms. It started with just running outdoors during lockdown which was allowed. After a while I would run up to 2hours a day. Then I switched to cycling which progressed to 4 hours a day. And finally I started obsessing over calories and the worst it got was 500 cals a day plus hours of cycling. I had a lot of free time as It was the summer holiday during the first lock down. My parents didn't mind me going out and stuff too. Just what was allowed.

After around 2 months of this I travelled for a while to go on holiday and slowly let go of most of the extreme ed behaviours. The depression didn't get better tho. 

Then a few months later I started have problems with severe anxiety. I got anxiety tics, unexplainable panic attacks and even a couple of short attacks that were later labelled as anxiety induced mania attacks. That was likely triggered due to the return of school and exams and all that. Also during that time my dad got diagnosed with cancer. At first they thought it was terminal and he had a few months but the diagnosis changed and thankfully he got treated and became cancer free about 8 months later. That period was pretty hard tho especially due to the caution we had to take as my dad didn't have any immunity and he because quite aggressive due to the effects of chemo and other medication. He still had problems with it but I can't say it's his fault. 

During that time I also struggles with SH and have problems with skin picking and some intrusive thoughts which I think is related to anxiety. 

Anyway lately the depression hasn't been too bad but I still have problems with anxiety and now the worst thing is anger problems. I would be fine but out of no where have a rage episode about stupid things. In the last 2 weeks I had like 3 extreme episodes leading to big family fights and I got to levels of crazy anger. I literally couldn't calm down except for when I started punching myself really hard. That left me with a few bruises. Also I started going to the gym a few weeks ago to help release that anger but idk it didn't help stop those anger episodes. This is really starting to bother me because idk how to stop them and i later I realise how stupid the trigger was and honestly I don't want to be another thing my parents have to add to their list Of worries. 

Anyway sorry this ended up being kind of a vent. But I wanted to ask for tips on how to manage the anger. 
Also I went into a great depth because I wanted to ask if it's worth looking into me possibly having BPD. I've been researching for around 2 years now because I just relate with a lot of the symptoms. I'm not diagnosing myself obv I just want to find the right help. Ik I'm under 18 so it's not easy to diagnose it but is it worth asking to be checked for it ? Also my grandad has it.

13,New to BPD,"Hey loves, 


I was diagnosed with BPD fairly recently. I’ve been dealing with rocky mental health for about 10+ years. I was always told it was just depression and anxiety. I was taking regular medication and while it took the edge off my symptoms they didn’t ever go away. So I went back to my GP to get some more help. I saw a specialist and was immediately diagnosed with BPD (albeit “high functioning- not sure what that means). I’ve been trying to do my own research to better understand this, but I’m not sure where to go. Everywhere seems full of symptoms and how to get help and not how to live with it or manage symptoms. 

Are there any online resources available? Any helpful information you’ve found out? Good coping strategies etc 

I’m on a waitlist to talk to someone but given current global events and all the other people who need mental health services at the moment it’s probably going to be a while before I can see someone regularly and I’d like to start doing/ learning things to better cope in the mean time",1614462441.0,False,3,3,peony27,None,lty49p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/lty49p/new_to_bpd/
14,Fear of abandonment so bad that I would just rather be alone. Anyone have some good coping skills?,"I have one single friend and if it weren't for her family issues and mine occurring at the same time we probably never would have become so close. It's been a nice 3 years of being around a healthy person and observing what is and is not 'normal' behavior. I love my friend but I just can't feel her love or anyone else's and maybe that is the whole problem.

We went on vacation together back in September and ever since I have had this feeling like I'm losing her. These episodes are increasing in severity and I am aware that I am coping by splitting. Until this time she was 'an angel' and now I am looking at the faults and wondering, am I making this up or were they there all along? 

I had an extreme episode a few weeks ago and in a desperate attempt to curb my reaction I finally reached out to her, explained that I feel like I'm losing her and could we get together soon. I don't share much of my disorder, I play normal whenever I can because 1, who wants to hear about it and 2, who really understands anyway

Her reaction was to downplay what I was feeling, which isn't a surprise, she doesn't get it, and that's ok.

On my birthday I was kinda blown off, no big deal just another day. When we finally did get together she was less than attentive to me and our friendship. So I've kinda eased back, but I send her a good morning text telling her I love her, hoping she will understand I need to hear that I am loved too. I got a response but no ""I Love you too""

At this point I feel like she's pulling away from our friendship, but I don't know if that's my insecurity screaming or if it's real. The stress of being aware that this may all be in my head is what makes me want to shut out the whole world so I don't have to deal with this uncertainty.

Anyone have suggestions on how to deal with this kind of insecurity? I am taking an anti anxiety medication now and it is helping, but it's a PRN and I need to be careful of addiction. It would help to know that someone out there can identify with this. I am so afraid of losing her and I feel like I'm going to blow the whole relationship up just to get through this (real or imagined???) feeling of loss.",1637591568.0,False,5,2,AddendumImmediate134,None,qzmpxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/qzmpxv/fear_of_abandonment_so_bad_that_i_would_just/
15,"Trying to heal by yourself, an unavoidable failure?","I, (31F) escape a 10 years relationship of physical and mental abuse. Almost 3 years ago. At 28 years old, that the only thing I knew. He was my first boyfriend ever. It’s exactly how it sound. Getting beating up, manipulate, cheating on, denigrate and ect. All my twenties I was miserable. Severe anxiety and depression. Binge eating which had me come up until 320 pounds. Isolation from friends and family. I really had come to conclusion that this was I meant to live. The worst in all this is, everyone around us always was always telling us we were the dream couple. When the pandemic strike, I was stuck at home and the violence became more and more unbearable. I am not a big drinker but one day, I decide to drank wine to ease my pain a bit. It actually save me because I had the drinker courage. He had beaten me again. I decide to call his mom (who already knew) to ask her to come get him. I was in a panic. I also decide to call my sister and tell her. My drunk logic was, if someone knew, I would be too embarrass to go back into this toxic and manipulative piece of shit of a man. I was right, I never went back. My mom took me back at home and it felt good to be around family. Two of my sisters lived there too. But we were never a emotionally open family. So I never really talked about this. Even if I escape I was fucked up. And I actually loved him (or I thought). Now I was stuck with all this pain by myself. I couldn’t really afford to have private psychologist. At one point, I got a family doctor after 20 years without one. At first I just wanted medication for my ADHD but my diagnostic was too old, he send me for an evaluation with a psychiatrist but by the public system. When they called me to evaluate the case, they asked me other question not in link with my ADHD, and I told them everything about what happened. They put me in a priority list. I saw a psychiatrist very fast, she was not worry about my lack of concentration, but with all the rest. I got diagnosed with BDP and severe PTSD from this relationship. The BDP part was really shocking to me. I never thought about it. Maybe I had preconceived idea about it. But it make a lot of sens. My behaviour and lack of self love since I was a teenager should had been worrying for me parents. Again, I don’t have a family that talk about theses things. I always was in pain alone. And very ashamed of this pain. I am still on a list to see a psychiatrist. I can’t afford one even with my private insurance. My psychiatrist had put me in A LOT of medications. I was a really zombie. And it never helped me. Every time I told her, she didn’t want me to stop or change. I didn’t felt listening by her so at one point I stop seeing her. I stopped all theses medications too. The things was, as soon as I left my ex, my life became amazing. Even with all this pain and fucked up brain. I lost over 100 pounds very fast (not in the healthiest way, I’m sick remember). I was always pretty but of course way more attractive without this weight. in two years, I got 2 promotions and a new super cool dream job. Even without education, got this very well paid job with hard work and experience. I also met my now husband. Which is, freaking amazing men. He had teach me what a real relationship should look like. He his handsome, gentleman, a successful artist, generous and fun. For the first time of my life, I was going out tasting every restaurant in town, seeing every exposition, going to weekend trips and just living the best life. He is also my safe place. I told him everything that happened to me and he is helping me a lot to deal with my pain, anxiety and depression. We moved downtown in a super luxurious tower. I travel a lot. I connect back with all those friends I had isolated from. I really do have everything I ever wished for. People envy my lifestyle. But even with this dream life, every night, I look in the mirror, into this pretty girl, with nice things, with a amazing husband, in her cool appartement and I am in pain. I cry almost every night. I am scare to lose all of this. I am scare my husband will become suddenly like my ex. I think I suck at my job. I am still miserable.

16,"After having this med cocktail+not burdening myself, I am better. I was having a huge mental breakdown a year ago.","Forgive me if I have typo, I’m typing on my phone.

I was going crazy. Just crazy. I don’t even want to talk about it because it’s so shameful.
The breakdown was caused by lots of things, but major thing was school stress, alcohol, etc.

I got hospitalized again. 3rd time.
I was having a good calming 72 hours.
Later on I have realized I am an alcoholic. 

So I quit, I think at least 40% of my sanity comes from not drinking. I tried A.A in person and online plus networking, I personally didn’t like it.

Then my psychiatrist prescribed me Librium, I was on over than reg dose for anxiety -(reg dose that ppl take in google) 
I was being a zombie but I think it was worthy, I’m tired of laying down all day.

Since I was a zombie I decreased the dose, switched to klonopin since quantity is not available for some reasons in my area. 
I was on 1 mg, started SNRI -Pristiq. 
25mg once daily didn’t work.
50mg I felt difference after I started taking it for like more than 3 weeks.

As time goes on, I added weed (vaping and consuming medical weed) for tapering benzo+I like the effect. Makes me distracted when I am upset sometimes, when I need a calming time, morning time before my pharma med kicks in, before I go to bed.

I take only 0.25 of klpin twice daily.



So
-Antidepressant reg dose (everyone is different, Pristiq was my match)

-No alcohol (my emotional side gets crazy)

-Benzo(I don’t recommend it because of severe physical withdrawal, but it’s working well for my anxiety. Before I would be walking and looking back v often and thinking someone would attack me. I don’t have those thoughts unless someone gets super x2 close to me. 

-Medical mmj. Since I don’t like how potent flower smells it works. 
 I don’t recommend black market for vaping. Since I have been paying for my therapy out of pocket, I have 2sessions a month now. Used to have 3-4 sessions a month. 
Tbh now albeit I use about 3g of vaping mmj within in a month in a med mmj expensive City(half gram would cost me $65-75), I pay less for my mental health(it’s been 12 years, going to therapy, looking for right medication. I couldn’t handle dbt. I hated group sessions.)



I am far better than who I was exactly a year ago. I dropped out of school, I got a small job, talking to my parents, I don’t feel so miserable like before. I don’t want to kill myself for things that don’t matter. 

I feel like I am gifted. 
Even tho I have some struggles daily, ofc life is not a easy thing. My work place is stressful, min wage. But at least I can kill time with studying.
I’m just gonna get a certification.


I had 100,000 thoughts a day. Now I have 5000 thoughts and those are not suicidal.

17,Help Navigating Help,"Howdy! Last year around October, I started counseling and medication again. I was in the tail end of a bad relationship and hadn’t had a job in months. Now, I’m single, live with super supportive friends, and have a job I’m extremely passionate about.

Unfortunately, I can’t really muster any of that passion. Since I began taking antidepressants in October, I have documented a severe decrease in my overall quality of life. This has also been documented on the app by both myself and my care team. I am on my 4th course of antidepressants this episode with only an increase in depression symptoms. I expressed this to my psychiatrist as well as my suggestion that I stop this course of meds, just to see if some of my symptoms decrease. There was some back and forth, and she called me aggressive (which was annoying because I’m just asserting myself, it’s my brain after all and no shit I’m irritable when I haven’t felt a positive emotion to my core in months). But I also understood because I was definitely channeling my anger to help me blow past my fawn response of compliance. Eventually, I explain that I had done some independent research and knew that other types of medications (anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics) could potentially be more useful. After that she backed off and was like, oh well if you need an anticonvulsant then we need to refer you to someone irl. To which I replied, I would rather be on the right course of meds than be on an online platform. In the end, we are trying new anxiety and sleep meds with no antidepressant (against the doc’s recommendation) for two months. If there’s no change, then she’ll recommend an antidepressant again. Ugh, the whole thing was really hard and I was shaking for most of it. I feel like my doc made it harder than it had to be though. Especially since I didn’t want to even begin the 4th course, at the end of the 3rd I said I wanted to stop antidepressants completely and was told to try again. 

Sorry, that was a lot, but I want to know how y’all go about recommending changes in your medications to your doctors and what you do when you meet resistance.

18,So I’m building a website...,"

Hey guys, I need some help. Keeping it short and simple, I’m building a blog/resource site for BPD. It’s borderlinehell.com

The website isn’t live yet, but I need ideas. Originally I just wanted to make a blog for myself and the long, fucked up road this has been. I feel like I’m finally on the “good” side of this and I might be able to help people with what I’ve been through. However now that I’ve actually gotten this thing off the ground, there’s SO MUCH MORE I could do with this. 

There really aren’t any resource sites made BY borderline people. All the information out there is clinical and written by the neuro typical or people who are bitching about us. I want to make a resource FOR borderline made BY a borderline. I want to include information on therapies, medications, history, depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicide (and ideation). I want to provide information for teens and veterans and parents. There’s places for the families of BPD to go to, I want to provide a place with everything that affects BPD and the PEOPLE who actually HAVE it. 

So help me, please, with ideas. I’ve gotten a few really good ones from some folks in the chat, but I want to keep asking around. 

-What did you need when you were diagnosed?
-What resources did you wish were available then?
-What resources do you wish are available now?
-What helps you through a split or any swing currently or past?
-What is the hardest part of BPD for you?
-What therapy has helped you the most and why?
-What medication has helped you the most?
-What do you wish neuro typical people knew/understood about BPD?

There’s much I’m sure I’m forgetting to ask, so please fill in any blanks. You don’t have to respond here, I can be reached at:

19,Perceived vs real betrayal/abandonment - advice for me and my SO please 🙏 (tweet for reference),"TLDR; with reference to this Tweet that I showed my bf, he asked when I am triggered and experience this, how can he deal it in the best way possible to avoid as much conflict possible? I honestly don't know the answer to this so would appreciate some advice please.

More context: I (29F) showed my boyfriend (33M) of 4 years this Tweet as it applies to me and I try to educate him about my trauma and how it affects me and how my brain operates so he can understand me better. We are trying to work through and improve our relationship which is heavily affected by my BPD and mental health issues. Sometimes he will do or say things that trigger me to feel/think he is betraying or abandoning me and my brain fully convinces me that this is the case (and I never know if it is real or imagined), I guess subconsciously to protect myself from getting hurt which inevitably does the opposite and leads us to break into massive blowout fights, which ruin all of our progress up to that point, even when things have been going super well for a while and then before I know it we're suddenly on the brink of splitting up and he starts questioning if there is any hope for our future at all. All because of my fucking triggers, disassociations, neurosis when my mind perceives the threat of betrayal or abandonment.

He always claims he is not doing what I think he is and I have no way of knowing if he is telling the truth or lying. For me trust doesn't even matter at this point because after experiencing so many REAL betrayals and abandonments from people close to me who I never would have ever expected to do so, my brain is so hypervigilant and on alert to suspect anyone could do that to me, it doesn't matter who they are anymore. Nobody is safe, no one can be trusted. Whenever I let my guard down and allow myself to trust and be vulnerable, people take advantage of it and then stab me in the back. The pain that occurs inside of me is gut wrenching and makes me withdraw and feel suspicious of people even more.

I am nothing like the person I used to be. I used to be a social butterfly and musician, I could not go a week without seeing friends, going to gigs and performing and ocializing, but since I've been so ill and debilitated the past few years as well as other factors, I've become an empty shell of who I used to be, severely isolated and living a hermit lifestyle. I have not seen any friends in 4 months, back in active addiction, anxiety, depression, BPD at its worst. This is my rock bottom.

I have a plethora of personal and family crises going on constantly piling up (the list just never ends, my whole adult life has been in survival mode), causing me so much inner turmoil, pain, grief, distress, depression, anxiety. I have become disabled by my multiple incurable chronic illnesses, my social life has become non existent, I fucking dread waking upon every next day miserably existing and nightmares at night. It's unbearable to be awake and be not awake. There's no escape, no peace, no way out. My illnesses have stolen my life away and everything I ever enjoyed and loved doing. I have lost all purpose in life, my sense of identity, motivation and any hope of ever being happy. I'm constantly overwhelmed, started self harming for the first time in my life, relapsed on drugs a few months ago (landed me up in the ER one night in Dec) and I'm admitting myself into a mental health clinic for 3 weeks on Thursday before I finish my degree online (there is no way I can study like this so it has to be before). 

I am in therapy, medicated (although I need to adjust/change my meds), but we just had our end of year summer holidays and my psychologist was away for a month, my psychiatrist has become absolutely useless and unreliable and has ignored me since mid December and other times last year when I needed his help (actual abandonment). I've been seeing my psychiatrist since 2020 and he has let me down so badly and become impossible to get hold of, I genuinely don't think this man has any interest in helping me anymore and may have to find another one, starting new after 4 years will be so fucking exhausting.",1707169567.0,False,7,0,tabasco_kat,None,1ajskqw,https://i.redd.it/lyqzryvl7ugc1.jpeg
20,Passed the Bar Exam Today,"At the risk of seeming egotistical, I (29M) wanted to post this for anybody really going through it as proof that you can do that thing people say you can’t do because you’re borderline.

I’ve had a lifelong struggle with what I know now to be Borderline Personality Disorder. In highschool, I was bullied so aggressively I had multiple near death experiences and my family’s home was repeatedly vandalized. My dad was repeatedly battling advanced stage cancer and I had to take care of my brother through the end of highschool while struggling with what I know to be CPTSD now. I was (mistakenly) diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety when I was 18 and told I would need to live a low-stress, safe, low pressure lifestyle. I hated this. 

For years, through college I struggled with both being over-medicated while also being inadequately helped. I hungout with dangerous, aggressive people through college because that level of dysfunction felt normal. I graduated college with a double major, but struggled to function well in the workplace. Bad relationships with toxic people was all I knew.

I spent 5 years in a majorly abusive relationship with a toxic narcissist that resulted in multiple hospital trips for stitches and broken glass removal. When that ended, I was a law student and the stress of the breakup led to lots of psychiatric problems, the vast majority of my friends abandoning me, isolation, suicide attempts, and self harm. I had to drop out of law school twice. My CPTSD and providers’ mismanagement of meds was so extreme that I lost the ability to read for almost 18 months. But I graduated.

I wasn’t even able to take the bar exam when I wanted to- my law school made me join a disciplinary program designed for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems because of my mental health problems through law school due to the extreme stigma against mental illness in law. I had to delay taking the bar exam after graduating because my mental illness was regarded as “a danger to the public.” Joining that punitive program was the only way to convince my state licensure board I could be trusted.

Finally, I was diagnosed BPD and started to get better through DBT. DBT saved my life. I gained the skills to put myself back together. Today I have an amazing girlfriend, a nice small house, rescue pitbull, new friends (through my girlfriend) and a couple old friends that stood by me, and now a new career in law as an attorney in a mid size American city as of finding out I passed the bar just this morning. 

Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn’t a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it’s an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don’t deserve it. Do that thing everybody says you can’t do and tell anyone who tries to stop you to eat shit.

21,can't get a diagnosis!,"So I am usually not one to self-diagnose. I have been under psychiatric care since I was 13 (now 23) and have been diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, social phobia, OCD, anorexia, ADHD, and PTSD and I typically defer to my doctors/therapists. But it's pretty fucking obvious to me that there is something bigger going on here... how would a person have 7 unrelated mental illnesses?! I have been on a cocktail of psychiatric medications since age 13, tried every type of therapy that I could and I still feel like I'm grasping at straws and trying to treat things that are just symptoms of a larger problem.

I have done A LOT of research (I'm talking hours upon hours) and am reasonably confident that I have Quiet BPD. I think the reason that no practitioner has caught onto it is because I internalize everything and I only lash out at myself. I don't really show any external signs of having BPD, however I have 8/9 BPD characteristics in the DSM (for context, diagnosis is appropriate with 5/9 symptoms). 

When I brought this up with my psychiatrist, she said she doesn't really see typical BPD traits in me (which I think is because I have quiet subtype and it's highly internal) and that she is hesitant to diagnose BPD because of the stigma it carries... okay, but I am confident that I meet the diagnosis standards under the DSM and need to be treated for BPD instead of the other seven issues, as the BPD & PTSD are no doubt what is causing everything else. 

I really don't want to self diagnose. But I have brought this up with multiple therapists, psychiatrists, etc. and my ED recovery coach is the only one to see the truth in what I'm saying. I *know* something deeper is going on. I have felt this way my whole life and only when reading about quiet BPD was I able to understand the chronic emptiness that has caused all of the other issues. Yes, I have an ED, yes I am depressed. But they are not the root issues and I feel like I'm not being listened to.

22,Seeking diagnosis,"Hi, 37F, just coming here to vent.
Currently seeing a psychologist and seeking diagnosis for BPD or cPTSD alongside my current social anxiety/phobia...

Fighting a constant hate and exhaustion of living.
Trying to take control.
Trying to stop self medicating with alcohol and food.

My behavior has been getting more extreme to the point where I am embarrassed and ashamed and my marriage of 6 years is a mess.
Alcoholism, self harm, suicide attempts, plain desperation.
Emotionally abusing as well as physical retaliation to my partner.
Wishing I could just be gone, not exist.
Not inflict myself on others.
Feeling outside of myself and my life or feeling it too much.
Dissociation constantly.

I want to come out the other side of this and find ways to cope and deal with my day to day life as well as strengthen rather than lose my marriage.

But at the moment despite seeking help and admitting my problems I find myself constantly in a destructive cycle.

Every time I 'genuinely' take steps in the right direction and want to change, days later I am at the other extreme.
Constant anger, mood swings, idealisation followed by self loathing and seeing the worst in myself and my partner.

Worse than that is the emptiness.
When I should be happy...
Lacking certain things I feel and it hurts.
When those needs are met... nothing.
It is hollow.

I didn't expect my life to be like this at this age.
Hoping to heal, and learn to help myself without hurting myself and those around me.

Hoping a diagnosis gives me solutions to help my current problems and struggles.

I just feel so alone even though I could not ask for a hubby that could possibly be more understanding. I still feel unheard, misunderstood, ashamed, and all stuck in my head of feeling just like a complete failure the more I learn about my mental health. I'm still so new to this, maybe that's why it's all overwhelming me, I just need some random people emotional support and even tips or things I can do to help. How did I feel I was doing all the right things, DBT, writing, meditation, breathing exercises. I just sometimes... I can't even do that when my head is spinning.

25,THERAPY SCAM ALERT!! BWRT (BrainWorking Recursive Therapy) - Terence Watts,"This is a super important post so pls don’t delete mods! I’m trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help aren’t lied to. 

Terence Watts’s “BrainWorking Recursive Therapy” or, “BWRT” is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a “full proof” solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!!

Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, it’s giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes. 

I was so amazed at first, and truly believed I’d finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be true… so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it. 

The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesn’t want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldn’t be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I don’t respond or you don’t see this post anymore… well I guess you know why. 

Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproduct… but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions. 


Here are some links about BWRT to get you started:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ts8qya/does_anyone_have_experience_with_bwrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Watts gets his inspiration from [Benjamin Libet](https://www.bwrtuk.co.uk/bwrt/), whose theory about conscious and unconscious behaviour forms the basis of his theory. He talks about it a lot on his website and in his youtube videos. 


Also, I found some interesting posts about Charles Linden - another “expert” who displays similar behaviours of secrecy, denial and harassment to Terence Watts:

- https://www.clinpsy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2057


(FYI: I still need to do some more research on this myself, so I am not claiming to be an expert on this matter.)

————————————————————————

EDIT: another very interesting link… [the Advertising Standards Agency says he breached the “UK code of non-broadcast advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.”](https://www.ns-healthcare.com/news/terence-watts/)

“The Terence Watts BWRT Institute was found guilty of claiming it could treat and/or diagnose several serious health problems including anxiety, infertility and diabetes without substantiating such claims.

In its findings, the ASA also concluded that an advertisement on the website discouraged people from seeking essential treatment and necessary medical supervision for conditions, including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and thyroid problems.

The Advertising Standards Agency told Terence Watts the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding it should not claim or imply that BWRT can be used to treat conditions without demonstrating sufficient evidence.

The ASA also said the website should not reference conditions for which medical supervision is necessary when addressing those seeking treatment in the future.”

26,"I love my GP (it got long, sorry)","So I've been having a bad BPD style relapse over the last month or so. But now that I'm more of a quiet borderline girl it's a slow spiral into hell.

So I went and saw my GP last week (yay me, waited until crisis point) and she stuck my back on Seroquel for a month just to stop my head racing all the damn time. Seriously, my anxiety was so out of control that my brain was almost turning itself off. I was convinced I was losing my mind because I just became so fucking dumb. Losing words, getting lost, forgetting things the second I heard them.

I voiced the fact that after being off Seroquel for 3 years it felt like I was failing by going back on them. She made me stop and listen. She said that it's no different to someone with asthma who's had it under control for years. Sometimes there will be some trigger that nobody can predict or see coming, so they add in extra help (medication) until it's passed and then go back to their usual routine.

She heard me, validated me and reassured me.

I went back yesterday for a follow up (I'm 100 times better than I was, love Seroquel) and we got to talking about the nature of BPD. I'm her most managed borderline patient so she can often get a different perspective from me. 

I told her my theory that we don't necessarily grow out of the BPD traits and behaviours, that I think we just learn to turn them inwards instead. I know I'd rather take it out on myself than others like I used to. I told her that even with all the therapy my thinking patterns are the same, I just have that filter between thoughts and actions that usually works really well.

I also told her how I've learnt the biggest reason behind BPD behaviours is control. Lack of, needing. I've always been at my worst when my emotions (and therefore my life) were out of control. So I'd do ANYTHING to feel like I had some kind of control. So, manipulation, SH, disordered eating, risky behaviours, impulsive behaviours. All of it, for me, was about control. That obsessive need for control.

She took notes. She's going to talk to her colleagues about it and see if they've had other patients voice the same kind of thing. And I know she's not patronising me.

She heard me. She validated my point of view. She thanked me for adding my insight and changing how she looks at BPD recovery.

Yes she's only a GP, but she specialises in mental health and is always learning about things like BPD because they're so misunderstood.

27,"REALIZED I HAVE BPD....SUPPLEMENTS? 5HTP, GABA?","ill try to make this brief,even though we all know  BPD Struggle is far from...

i think i have been dealing with BPD all my life but i never quite knew it..

in hindsight i can see where BPD played a role in a lot of situations throughout my life..

2 years ago on my birthday i had a huge panic attack i thought i was going to die, i was smoking weed,drinking and i took some pills..i still dont know wtf they were...then my heart started beating..my vision started getting blurry..i was seeing white...it was like i was dieing...i was taken to the ER...i left the ER and was experiencing depersonalization and derealization for the first time ever...my gf left the next day and i was left by myself with this horrible fuckin feeling...

i stayed in that house for months...i couldnt even leave the house..i would go buy food at 2 or 3 in the morning..i was smoking weed even though the weed instantly gave me panic attacks..i was just hoping that it would fix me somehow...i stayed in this horrible state for months..non stop panic attacks..no sleep...barely eating...shut off from the world..having to fake like i was okay when i spoke with my mother...i cant worry her..i couldn't tell her that i wanted to kill myself and that looking in the mirror i did not recognize myself..

 time goes by...cant work...cant function..im just in hell all day 24/7

its been a while and i dont really feel depersonalized anymore but my emotions are out of control...like on a severe level...

for the longest i was so focused on the DP/DR that i never took the time to look at the cause of the anxiety..i was so focused on treating anxiety and dp/dr but this last month my girlfriend broke up with me because i had an instance of ""splitting"" i guess they call it and for the very first time i actually noticed that my way of thinking is waaay screwed up.....i finally see alot of the BPD symptoms...i now know that i don't think like everyone else...im always thinking negative...typical bpd things like the black and white..the favorite person...the splitting..and the shame...guilt...all these things i had been feeling my whole life...but before it was manageable...i was able to function...i didnt ever think about suicide..but after that huge panic attack and dp/dr/depression/ it seems my BPD is just fuckin exploded full force and all those symptoms are flaring all day....im sensitive as hell..on edge

i cant function...the only thing keeping me calm is a benzo..klonapin...that takes the anxiety away but without it...i feel like ill fall back into the pitts of dp/dr...i have been taking it for a while..maybe 2 years?

My  ex gf broke up with me after i had an instance where i ""split"" because she didnt answer my phone call it was scary.......fear of abandonement kicked in and everything else aswell..but thanks to her breaking up with me...i came to the realization that im not just dealing with extreme anxiety...but that i have deeper problems like bpd...

my thoughts are suicidal and negative all the time but now i am aware of the thoughts and i am aware that i am thinking incorrectly..i know can see and observe...where as before i didnt...i just felt the emotions and  rolled with them unknowingly...

ive done my due diligence on several other disorders...bipolar..bipolar 2..schizophrenia..etc but BPD describes me down to a T..it finally makes sense..any thoughts?opinions??questions??

theres more to the story such as im not in the U.S which is where i was raised till the age of 19, i was deported for buying alcohol with a fake id.

i was sent  to a 3rd world country..people dont speak the language and i cant relate,ive been here for 8 years and all that stress was probably building till the mind just couldn't handle it anymore? causing me to dissociate..?

but why the severe BPD?

i am always on the brink of tears..i am agitated and sad...suicidal thoughts are most of my day..i remember my ex gf and i feel guilty because i put her through alot of bad moments in life...from her witnessing me having to go to the ER to a lot of emotional abuse,she is a sweetheart.. truly beautiful..she not once disrespected me ever..so when i think of those times...my anxiety instantly revs up..and i start thinking suicidal thoughts due to the guilt and negative self talk..racing thoughts etc... its like its happening all over again...i feel pathetic because i fucked up bad and put her through hell..

i know i shouldnt feel that way beacause i really dont think im too much at fault,the bpd was fucking my life up for the longest and i had no clue..now i challenge my thoughts,meditate,supplement,trying to do CBT...wish there was DBT here but there is not...im really down and out..i feel alone...im isolated...i think im what is considered a quiet borderline...why? because no one here speaks english..i have no family here in this country.. gf left me..no medical help...i cant even express my thoughts concerns or anything...if only someone here spoke some english..that would be helpful i feel...situation sucks...i've begun to kind of tip my family off to the fact that suicide is something i consider alot...its horrible i don't want to make them sad but this sucks...i cant go on this way...they are in the U.S. and i cant see them..they cant come here and i cant go back to the U.S. im kind of trying to ease the idea of me not being here but at the same time i feel horrible doing so..

I HAVE 2 SISTERS,AND MY MOTHER..I AM THE ONLY MALE..FATHER IS OUT THE PICTURE..

Help anyone?  
sometimes a kind word works wonders for me

SUPPLEMENTS TAKEN..OMEGA 3,POTASSIUM,VITAMIN B COMPLEX,VITAMIN D,MAGNESIUM,VITAMIN A,CENTRUM DAILY VITAMIN FOR MEN,MELATONIN EVERY OTHER MONTH...

THINKING OF TRYING 5HTP AND GABA....THEY JUST CAME IN THE MAIL.

i can elaborate more but im going to try and sleep now...just thought id post something quickly about supplements but it turned into this...

28,First few days...,"It  has been an exhausting 5 years. I escaped my abusers, got married to my soulmate (yikes), started therapy for PTSD, got diagnosed with ADHD, and tried medication this year. There’s one huge problem: I’m on dialysis and Adderall XR is __undializable__ meaning it’s has no way to exit my body. I went full psychotic you guys. So I stopped taking the Adderall and it finally has broken down to its components and filtered out. 

But then I was still getting angry. Just like I used to. I still couldn’t sleep, just like I used to. My inner critic used me as a whipping girl, just like she did when I was mentally hallucinating that she was gonna eat my face off. 

I got a Generalized Personality Disorder diagnosis from a resident marriage therapist about a year ago. 

It’s been a long ass fucking year. I’ve touched on DBT, and fought tooth and nail with my behaviors to “prove” I didn’t have BPD. But I was bent until I was broken and I had to pick up the pieces. And the BPD was still there. 

Y’all, I’ve never got a 9/9 on anything. I finally watched a few videos. My flip-switch, ends-quick rage, my self hate, my suicidal but not really tendencies, it was all in there. Even the parts where I was more prone to stressed-based psychosis. (Previously I had been diagnosed as “depression with psychosis”) 

So over the weekend I’ve been trying to hard. I’ve been messaging my therapist instead of my husband. When I do tell my husband stuff it’s consise and not 15 pages. I isolated myself today while I was mad, and “rode the wave” and was able to figure out almost everything behind that particular shitfit. I also didn’t escalate my anger at something my husband was doing, into anger at him, and I avoided a good bit of verbal abuse. 

But all of this is so tiring. And I’m barely scratching the surface. The conversations my husband and I are having are deep and scary and I haven’t been this honest with anybody about this stuff. I have new fears, and new ways to practice old fears. 

I just wanna be better. I wanna stop abusing my husband. I wanna not feel like shit all the time. I wanna stop fighting because I have a hairline trigger and he accidentally makes it worse somehow. 

The road has been long, and the road will be long ahead. But I am recognizing how sneaky (In a good way) my therapists have been and how I actually have a few DBT skills already, I just have to learn how to apply them. Radical acceptance a few months ago helped us stop fighting about the dishes. Riding the Wave has helped me isolate and quickly manage breakdowns before they affect my husband. 

He just is so afraid of me now. He’s so jumpy. And I am heartbroken. I can’t believe I’ve done this to the man I love. Except this time instead of my inner critic taking hold, I’m using it to be better every time in cognizant enough to S T O P. 

On the one hand, this is such a tall mountain. An Everest perhaps. But I have told him that he is my Foreverest Love, because I would climb Everest for him. Well now I’m being called to task, and I just gotta pick up my ropes and start climbing, no matter how hard it is.

I’m posting this cause I’m anxious I can’t do it. I’m so early in my journey I still have most of my disordered thoughts and behaviors. I’ve been looking for the evidence to calm my anxiety, but even so, my critic pesters me “you’ll never be good enough and he’ll leave” even though he knows I’m afraid of that and had literally guaranteed the opposite.

3,Struggling with some things in regard to DBT treatment.,"Hi guys. Thanks for your time. I'm living in the UK, and have had CBT and counselling. I found that neither of those were helpful. DBT is, but my only option to self administer. I've already noticed that distress is much easier to tolerate, I'm more mindful, etc. It's nice.

However - there are certain things I'm struggling with, and dont know what skills to apply to combat. These are two things.

The first of which is the awareness of futility, and fear of the future. I am painfully aware of the fact that tomorrow, my entire family could die, or I could face brutal abuse, and no amount of therapy skills could help me. Frankly, the world can be a horrible and cruel place, and it makes any amount of self improvement feel almost counterintuitive, and as though as the smart solution is to...Off yourself. I won't, I'm just aware of this thought pattern, and I think it impacts my commitment to the treatment.

The second is my struggle in identifying which of my interpersonal needs are valid, and which may be unfair. For example - my boyfriend and I had a fight last night because I felt as though he never listens to me (I was showing him YouTube videos, and he rolled over and groaned). Objectively very rude - but what degree of response is warranted? Or the time I got upset with him over something I completely made up in my head, and was quite unpleasant about?

I know that having this disorder doesn't make me evil, but it felt like the psychiatrist was calling me that.

They also referred me to a partial program, which I start tomorrow.

I'm really nervous. I'm in a lot of pain. I have rage episodes when I'm alone, and panic attacks, and I drink and cut myself. My mood swings are intense, and I go between being tired, and just hating everyone and wanting to hurt them. I'm also bipolar and am having a depressive episode right now. I know I have to stop these behaviors, but I don't know much about DBT or the coping skills that are part of it, and I'm afraid that it won't help me. I want it to, but part of me is scared to get better. I know I have to talk about the negative ways I think about people and myself, and the violent impulses, but I have so much shame. I'm also autistic and have meltdowns from overstimulation and social situations, and I struggle with communication and talking, so it's hard to gauge what is BPD and needs to be fixed with DBT, and what is autism and would be harder/unethical to try to change. I don't want my therapist to mix up the two and hurt me.

The doctors also want me to go back on lithium. I was on it for 7 years and it really helped me, but the side effects ended up being sooo bad. I think it might be best to go back on it, though, because I feel like my mind has been punishing me since I went off.

“Because treatment with esketamine might be so helpful to patients with treatment-resistant depression (meaning standard treatments had not helped them), the FDA expedited the approval process to make it more quickly available. In one study, 70 percent of patients with treatment-resistant depression who were started on an oral antidepressant and intranasal esketamine improved, compared to just over half in the group that did not receive the medication (called the placebo group).

25,Saying goodbye to CPN,"Hi all. I'm looking for advice and insight...
I've been having treatment for BPD for 4 years now. I've had different treatment forms and with different professionals for each, though I've consistently always alongside this had my designated Community Psychiatric Nurse. She is the first professional I came into contact with from the beginning, was the one to diagnose and treat me for BPD (her speciality area) and the first person I opened up to about everything; my past, my childhood, my raw inner self, my perceived 'worst' parts, with no judgment and an almost 'motherly' type style, something I'd never had or experienced before. Needless to say, this relationship although kept professional, has had a profound impact on me in both my discovery and recovery in dealing with BPD and with general life. As I grew and evolved and got better through combined treatment, our appointments got spaced out more and more and I no longer felt the lifeline type 'need' for her, and certainly don't have her in my mind as a sort of FP at this stage. However, I'm due tommorow to have my required '6 month break' from all treatment. She has informed me that if I need to come back for more treatment after 6 months of being discharged, that it won't be her I get assigned to again, so this is goodbye, not necessarily to treatment but to her. I think that this would be difficult at any stage but I've just come off the back of the hardest few months in a long time, and am only just getting back on my feet with things, so despite I am a lot better at coping and understanding myself than I was when I first started treatment with her, this mandatory break and goodbye, although required, couldn't have come at a worse time. She is the first and only person to have understood me, more than myself, given me insight, support, and non judgemental compassion. The one and only person who gets 'me' and this disorder in a way my family, friends and partner could never, something so priceless with BPD. Although I don't require her support in quite the same way as I once did, I still don't feel ready or confident with the idea of facing life and its struggles, my struggles, without her. I knew this day would need to come at some point, but I don't feel ready, probably magnified with what I've been through lately. I don't know how to face this. It's tommorow, I'm dreading it and what comes after it, how I'll cope with the uncertainty of the future and what it may bring, without the comforting thought of knowing she's there in the background IF I ever really needed her... I liken it to the imagined comfort and confidence a child has knowing they're cycling a bike unsupported for the first time without their parent's hand on them stabilising them, but watching on, waiting to be there if needed and that being the thing that makes the child feel able to keep going and doing it alone.

30,How to help my spouse with BPD?,"TLDR at the bottom :) 


Hi everyone! I (M24) have been with my partner with BPD (enby 24) for 5 years, married for 2. Neither of us knew they had BPD at the start of the relationship; only about 6 months ago dots started to connect for them and they told me they think they meet the criteria for Quiet-type BPD. A diagnosis isn't likely at this stage as we live in the UK and the waiting lists are... intense for NHS mental health treatments.

At the moment I think things are a bit fresh, my partner has said that they've just come to terms with the fact they have BPD and aren't ready to look at formal treatment options yet but we've been working on a few strategies, for example we have an analogy we call ""the mountain"" where there are three basic levels on a 1-100 scale (the hyena pit at 1-10, a stable camp at 45-55, and the peak where the air is thin at 90-100). We try to check in about where on the mountain they are before we have a potentially triggering conversation and I'm trying to be more conscious of how/when I say things. They also have listened to Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents and Recovering from Emotionally Immature Parents, both by Lindsay Gibson, which has helped quite a bit prior to learning about what symptoms have been from BPD. 

My question is: how can I set boundaries or offer support and understanding without unintentionally discouraging improvement/healing or enabling? I've felt a few times that there's a fine line between offering accommodation and allowing unhealthy habits to form, but as someone who doesn't have a lot of experience with BPD/BPD recovery I'm not sure where that line is. If any of you have advice on what things I can do/suggest that would be fair and healthy, I'd be very appreciative! Ask any questions in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them!!

37,TMS therapy for BPD?," Hi!

I am 22m, diagnosed with BPD. I have tried so many things, been constantly diagnosed and rediagnosed. I've seen therapists, homeopathic therapists, psychologists, and completed an intensive outpatient therapy program. I have tried CBT, DBT, talk therapy, EMDR, and group therapy. I recently started with a new therapist with a mental health treatment system. My responses during our intake session tagged me as a potential candidate for TMS.

I haven't seen much about TMS for BPD and was hoping to hear from folks who have BPD and tried TMS. I have three therapists right now (two individual and a group facilitator), and have talked to the group facilitator and the new therapist, and they didn't have a lot of info for me. I'm going to talk to the other therapist, who I've been seeing for years, and hear his thoughts, as well as talk to the TMS therapist, but I would really like first-hand accounts if I can get them.",1703880646.0,False,2,10,worthlessinsum,None,18tw66e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18tw66e/tms_therapy_for_bpd/

41,Is this behaviour actually healthy?,"My 19 year old sister has BPD and gets angry really easily. She gets mad at our family over mistakes we make that we often have little control over. I understand that with BPD you have a lot of emotions so it’s hard to control anger and I don’t hold that against her. But it’s still really exhausting. When she gets angry, she deals with it by locking herself away in her room and not talking to anyone for the rest of the day (and sometimes this can go on for days). She says that it’s healthy because she needs the space to deal with her emotions and if she stays around other people she might scream at us and she doesn’t want to do that. I appreciate that she knows her limits and understand that needing space for yourself is healthy, but I also feel really uncomfortable and anxious at the fact that she spends that much time alone and not communicating with anyone. Getting silent treatment is difficult and scary. I’m completely fine with her needing time for herself, but I wish she didn’t need that much time. Like a few hours is okay, but a whole day or more makes me feel really really anxious especially because she’s angry over mistakes people make, with no one intending to hurt or upset her. Am I overreacting? Should I talk to her about how I feel? She sees a therapist so I could suggest that they talk about my sister’s anger. 

Tl;dr: when my sister with BPD gets angry over people’s mistakes, she locks herself away and/or gives everyone silent treatment for the day (and this can go on for days).

43,Do people with BPD treat the person they love the most the absolute worst out of everybody?,"lI have been in a relationship with this girl for 6 years. She is the love of my life but she has mistreated me in every sense possible since the start. I tried my best to be patient but I am losing my ability to. Everything you can do wrong to your significant other in a relationship she has done to me (cheating, violence, manipulation and everything in between). I forgive her every time because I know she is dealing with BPD. One day she loves me even tho theres “something missing” (even tho that something missing is unhealed trauma. She needs to fill that void for us to have a stronger connection) and then the next day she hates me and wants nothing to do with me. 

The story of her upbringing is the worst Ive ever heard from someone I personally know. Everybody in her life mistreats her. From her family to her “ex” who she still thinks of because he was a narcissist and used her/played her to get what he wanted. I learned the NPD/BPD tie is horrible. Her family allowed horrific things to happen to her that include sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. I am at the point where I’m about to give up.

We have a 4 year old son together so I’m trying to save our family. The hardest part is she treats literally everybody else in her life amazingly. Her friends, her fucked up family, coworkers. Literally everybody gets amazing treatment from her but she constantly mistreats me all the time. I don’t understand. I have been nothing but loving, loyal, forgiving, understanding, compassionate and everything in between. I love her and want her to get better. She is contemplating starting treatment and I have been trying to push her to go. I read somewhere people with BPD treat the person they love the most the absolute worst. Is that true? 

I know she loves me deep down. I know in her core of cores deep within her spirit she loves me and wants to be with me. I’m not delusional. But she keeps pushing me away and pulling me back and mistreating me and I’m tired. I don’t know what else I can do. Please help. I love her with all my heart she is the love of my life.

50,Jobless desperate 24 yr old,"Long story short. 
I have been told by my psychiatrist that I had ""borderline tendency"" but didn't meet the disorder criteria yet. I suffered a lot of trauma and pain in early childhood and young adulthood: abandonment, constantly changing caregivers, abusive NPD father, domestic violence, abortion, emotionally abusive and controlling husband, went through hospitalization because of a stupid overdose, went to casinos, spent money recklessly out of revenge for husband's treatment, guilt, more guilt, more self discovery, more fear, and more desperation. 

I now am the mother of a baby boy and I really don't want my disorder to get in the way of me taking care of him or being his mother. I'm certain I have a lot of love to offer him and I am seeking all the help I can get... But regulating emotions is really difficult for me and my husband uses my mental breakdowns to threaten me that he would take the kid away, and that I'm an unfit and irresponsible mother.

But difficulty regulating emotions has let me to doing things that are not in the best interest of myself.

I hope all of you are having a good day. I'm just checking in to tell you that during our last appointment, my therapist of 3 years told me that she thinks I no longer meet the criteria for BPD and am what she calls ""a therapeutic success"". We went over how I got there over the course of my treatment and how some things will stay–""borderline traits"" that are part of my personality but no longer a handicap to my day-to-day life; and dissociative episodes that are now few and far between but not entirely gone. I know that setbacks are possible and even likely, but it does not scare me nearly as much as it used to! I have grown more confident in my skills and myself as a person despite previous therapists and medical professionals telling me there was no hope for me.

I wanted to share this feel-good news because I know that ""recovering"" from a personality disorder is so often seen as impossible that it really feels like there's no point in trying to get better. But there is!! I will be borderline my whole life but it doesn't have to be pathologic forever. I want to tell you that it does happen, changing is possible and work pays off. There's no way I could have imagined this just a couple years ago. You deserve care and your life is worth living, in and of itself, but also because it can and will get better.

53,I'm terrified my partner is cheating,"I've been diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago. It helped me tremendously, It meant i wasn't crazy and the things I've always felt were legitimate and had an explanation. From there I started treatment with medication and therapy and DBT skills and my life got more balanced. 

So now I've been in a serious relationship for 3 years. We got married and had a baby and I'm currently pregnant. We both work from home and he is a very present father and husband, he is always with us. He is not secretive with his phone and gives me no reason to think he is cheating. 

However my BPD brain thinks something is happening. I downloaded an app yesterday for school (telegram) and saw he had an account and was last seen online last month. I freaked out and accused him of using it for cheating and he got extremely mad I and began to react saying he was making his bed and that this was the beginning of the end. I calmed down a bit and asked him to explain why he had downloaded it but he got defensive and said he doesn't need to justify himself. I began spiring, that hadn't happened to me in a while, this is the first relationship I have that I didn't cheat and we built a family so I feel super vulnerable.

I was crying like crazy and told him he needs to tell me. he said ""NO ! DONT YOU DARE TRY TO PUT THIS ON ME! DONT YOU DARE!"" then followed by ""I'm going to play video games now bye!!"" (He plays video games all the time and ignores me) 


Am I asking to much for him to tell me if his busy or doesn't want to talk? He always become enraged and does this. I'm scared to say anything. He says I'm always arguing but it's only because when I calmly try to communicate he gets extremely enraged and tells me it's my problem. Uses things off topic againist me or as to why . Like tonight he said he shouldn't have to text me to say he doesn't want to talk if I don't want to commit and use him as a ""toy"". Reason I'm not jumping back into a immediate relationship with him after a previous argument is because he needs to work on himself and how he treats me. Until then, I'm single. And I can also date who I please which he hates. But I'm scared of him and his behaviour never changes. He says all his friends say I'm abusive and toxic. Idk. There's alot. His left me in dangerous situations and laughed at me after a concussion.

65,Going through a breakup,"I spent a LOT of time focusing on myself afyer getting out of an abusive relationship a few years back. I spent time alone finding hobbies and working on so many of my own issues as well as coping with what happened during that relationship. I ended up getting clean from self harm and I even went back and graduated high school and started working again. I was so proud of myself and thought I could handle a relationship again finally. 

I may have been wrong.

We moved really slow at first, we took our time with dates and spending the night. We didn't want to force anything and I didn't want to get addicted so fast. Things went really well until around the 3 month mark I had a bad week, I was crying a lot and upset and for the first time, I brought up how when I feel like a mess I want to selfharm. I thought he would be able ro handle it since after a while of dating I told him about BPD and he read up on it and even highlighted and annotated a book about it, just to study and better handle what could happen. But he did not handle the stress well when I break down did come, he tried to leave but ended up wanting to stay, and I felt good about his choice at first since I did not beg or freak out when he brought it up, I tried to just talk about our issues. However trying to leave 3 months in really set something off in me, immediately I sowed seeds of abandonment and left me paranoid. 

As time went on I still had breakdowns over something dumb every few months, but when he'd bring up something to me that upset him or hurt him, I'd always take the steps to start changing, and more often than not I'd stop the bad behavior he pointed out. I was lucky of he pointed it out though, he had a fear of confrontation and as he told me ""I didn't make it easy for him."" I know it should be easier for me to see what I'm doing wrong but sometimes it was hard, I told him he'd need to spell it out for me, and there's times I'd get really defensive and mad when he did. I'd always apologize afyer the fact and tell him I overreacted and that he's in the right to feel that way. I ALWAYS made sure to tell him his feelings were valid and good and I tried my best to take accountability, even of he had to point out my wrongdoings. 

Though I'd have these bad times, I will say I didn't insult him, I never uses shoes like or SH as a threat and I'd take accountability for myself feeling like that, when he was upset with me I'd even be sure to avoid talking about those feelings so he wouldn't associate them with his own emotions towards me. 

But eventually he tried to leave again, showing me no warnings and coming home and breaking the news to me a year into the relationship. I yet again, just sat there and tried to talk about it and we worked though things... only for him to do it again the next day and decide to stay AGAIN. At that point I was horrified. Always scared he's going to go and not knowing when it would happen. He wouldn't talk to me about any issues he had when they came up. He would give me the chance to talk about anything or seek any help cuz he wouldn't even let me know when he felt I was doing something wrong. I shouldn't have been so blind to it and I know that, but I thought I was trying. I tried so hard on the things he wanted fixed. I tried.

He stayed after that though. Flash forward 3 more months, I have the worst week I've had in our relationship, I was very aware of my wrong doings and told him everytime, but it didn't change how I was feeling. We were on a time crunch to get my me drivers license, I have college starting up in 2 weeks, and he's supposed to leave town for the first time for a week. This is all happening at the same time and I was horrified. I even broke down crying during my behind the wheel test and things hadn't been feeling too real for a few weeks, I didn't feel ready for any of it and because of it I felt like a failure. On top of that I felt I needed to be afraid of him leaving, like I NEEDED that fear. I knew he was stressed too because of how I felt and I knew I wasn't handling stuff well. Eventually I broke down, I was sobbing and yelling about how I wanted to die, I told him it's cuz I felt like a failure, because if I couldn't handle getting my license how am I supposed to handle school. This break down soon flipped into me yelling at him that he's going to leave. I KNEW my breakdowns were too much and I felt like he was going to go again for it, it felt inevitable.

The next day happens and all the bad feelings built up, and for the first time in 2 years I relapsed on self harm. When I got home that night i told him, and I told him I stopped because it wasn't worth it to myself to fall back into that behavior. I also told him that I was scared to tell him because I thought he'd leave if I got that weak and hurt myself. I was right, he left. He told me after he saw the mark on my leg he gave up on me. I know it's selfish to expect him to stay after that, but I really wish he did. I didn't want him to fix me, just to be there for me and talk about ways to get over this stress

After everything he came by to talk to me and told me all these things i had no clue he felt during our relationship. Things that I felt, if they were talked about, really could have been worked on and fixed, but he told me ""it's just not worth it"". He didn't want to stick around and work on anything. If he had mentioned couples therapy I would have done it in a heartbeat, if he had just needed space I would have done it in a moment, no guilt involved. 

He mentioned feeling like I didn't want him to see his siblings alone BUT HE NEVER TRIED. HE NEVER BROUGHT IT UP ONCE. I even asked him ""why haven't you seen you siblings in a whileyou should make plans soon."" But he decided that meant nothing. I tell him ""hey you should play the piano or do *insert hobby here* today, and I'll just play a video game"" but he decided I wanted him glued to me at all times. And undeniably there WERE times like that. I wanted him in the same room as me a lot, I wanted to he near him, but he never once told me that wasn't okay. He always entertained it, I didn't know. If he wasn't happy I wish he would have at least told me. Inwish he would have at least given me a chance. 

He also said i shouldn't ever ""subject"" someone to my thoughts of SH. I feel so destroyed. This was supposed to be my first healthy relationship and I did mess up, I did breathe down his neck too much but if he had at least talked to me I feel like i could have tried.

Always through restriction of my food, or sleep, NEVER cutting . Either way my suicidal ideation has gotten insanely worse since I started. I was feeling this urge so I decided to write my feelings down hoping that would process some of this emotion. When I started writing it began as just listing reasons for why my delusions think I should die but slowly the writing turned into apologize to the people I will leave behind, reasoning with them that they will be fine without me, and saying my final goodbyes of what I would want them to know . This writing upset my horribly. I’ve never been this into suicide in all of my 10 years of dealing with Depression and BPD. I’m very scared to be alone with myself . Have any of you experienced this? What do you do when you are thinking about hurting yourself? How do

I know I am the problem, and I want to fix it because I feel so bad and resentful towards how I treat him, I sometimes think it would be better if he just let go of me. But even though he is visibly hurt, he said we can find a solution.
I am just afraid that if I don't do anything now this is just a preview of how our relationship will be always, if it continues.

Some quick context: we were in a long-distance until we moved in together last june, in a completely new country where neither of us know the language.
So I have seeked help, but since I cannot speak the language at an advanced level, there are not enough resources, meaning English-speaking therapists here. And where there are, in a different city and can do video-sessions, they are extremely expensive for me to be able to afford now.

Now, I know DBT is the main treatment for BPD, but since I have no way of going to therapy right now, I was wondering if there is any way to self-teach?

73,What Is the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD?," Mental Disorders (DSM).

There's no biologically based test to definitively diagnose borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, mental health professionals often use screening instruments such as the MSI-BPD to help identify the likelihood of BPD and the need for further evaluation and treatment.

Scoring of the MSI-BPD

Each item is rated as a ""1"" if it is present and a ""0"" if it is absent, and items are totaled for possible scores from 0 to 10. A score of 7 is considered a valid diagnostic cutoff, meaning that a score of 7 or higher indicates that you likely meet the criteria for a BPD diagnosis.2

The first eight items of the MSI-BPD represent the first eight DSM-IV/5 diagnostic criteria for BPD, while the last two items assess the final DSM-IV/5 criterion, i.e., **paranoia/dissociation.**

## Uses for the MSI-BPD

Clinicians use the MSI-BPD to diagnose BPD, sometimes in conjunction with other screening tools. Research suggests the MSI-BPD is helpful in detecting BPD in the general population,3 but more studies are needed.

The MSI-BPD test has been shown to be very effective in detecting possible BPD in people who are seeking or have a history of treatment for mental health problems.

## Psychometric Properties

The MSI-BPD has demonstrated valid, reliable psychometric properties. It has adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. It has also demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for detecting borderline personality disorder when a score of 7 is used as a diagnostic cutoff.

[**Coping With Borderline Personality Disorder**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095SHGB9N) 

## Other Screening Tools

The MSI-BPD is only one of several that clinicians typically use to diagnose BPD. These include the following.  


Structured Clinical Interview

This official clinical interview of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is an update of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) but is very similar.4 Your mental health professional may use this screening tool to help determine your diagnosis by asking you questions directly related to the criteria for BPD that are listed in the DSM-5.

This screening instrument also has an optional self-reporting questionnaire with 108 questions, but not all clinicians who choose the SCID-5-PD use this. 

Causes of Borderline Personality Disorder

PDQ-4

The Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire, 4th Edition (PDQ-4) screening test consists of 99 true-or-false questions that can help screen for various personality disorders, including BPD.5

Zanarini Rating Scale

The Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD), also developed by Dr. Zanarini, is used for patients who have already been diagnosed with BPD to test for changes over time.1

Which Tool Is Best?

A recent study comparing correlations, sensitivity, and specificity among the MSI-BPD, PDQ-4, and SCID-II in adolescents and young adults showed they were equally effective in predicting a BPD diagnosis.6 On the other hand, another study concluded that the PDQ-4 ""should not be used in clinical practice as a screening instrument for PD assessment.""7

## Impact of BPD Screening

BPD is challenging to diagnose and treat because it's so often misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder and other conditions. Further complicating the issue is that BPD often exists with comorbidities, including bipolar disorder, and poses a significant risk of suicide.8 That makes accurate screening tools such as the MSI-BPD particularly important.  


Once BPD is diagnosed, the clinician can develop a treatment plan to address it. This might include such targeted approaches as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), which has been shown to be effective for people with BPD.8  


## Potential Pitfalls of the MSI-BPD

Tests such as the MSI-BPD provide a picture of person's mental status only at a particular point in time. Astute clinicians additionally take into account the person's patterns of behavior over time.9

&#x200B;

BPD is a particularly difficult disorder to diagnose and treat. Research indicates that the MSI-BPD is a valuable tool in this effort, however, and takes very little time to complete. Based on the results, a clinician can then help you address BPD's challenges and learn healthy ways to cope with and regulate your emotional states and responses.",1647850548.0,False,3,1,redditerX75,None,tj6rq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/tj6rq5/what_is_the_mclean_screening_instrument_for_bpd/
74,"FPs are a trauma reenactment response, and I think this isn't talked about enough at all.","Why is it that wherever I go around finding resources and support on how to cope with FPs, it's always either:

- romanticising the FP relationship as ""omg extreme crushy dopamine obsession!""
- expecting the FP to fulfil all your BPD needs/being genuinely toxic as hell towards them (because surprise, what we have is a DISORDER) and then calling them ableist for daring to speak up about it
- like it's a normal thing with BPD (which ventures into anti-recovery territory)?

I find it genuinely disturbing, honestly. 

FPs are at their core a *trauma reenactment response*. They form because subconsciously, that person reminds you of a past caretaker or abuser, whose treatment of you as a child caused you to develop BPD to begin with. 

I theorise it's almost the brain's way of gaining control over past trauma or recreating past scenarios as it's what it subconsciously knows and grew to cope with.

Maybe they are nice to you in a way you wish your past caretakers could have been, or maybe they're dismissive because they're busy and then give you a lot of attention when they do have the time. They're most likely not abusive like your former caretakers, but unfortunately your brain gets hooked. 

That's why we split on them. If they were normal healthy things, we wouldn't freaking split on them. We wouldn't subconsciously *project our trauma onto them.* 

And yes, when this happens, it is very very easily to unintentionally hurt and be very very toxic towards an FP. They don't exist to heal our trauma, and they can't, anyway. At least not permanently nor healthily. Keeping you in that dopamine spiral is NOT it.

I hate how there's so many ""how to create a healthy FP relationship"" posts too. I feel like that term is a contradiction in itself, because an FP relationship is never going to be inherently healthy if the root cause is a trauma reenactment bond. If it's healthy then, well, it's not an FP anymore. 

Long textpost (not sure about flair either) but I'm just disturbed by the lack of research on what causes FPs and the blatant disregard for their roots, aka trauma that should be healed.",1667542978.0,False,100,20,Illustrious_Mine_915,None,ylqrjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ylqrjv/fps_are_a_trauma_reenactment_response_and_i_think/

I don't normally fall very easily for people unlike most with BPD, that is a symptom I have lacked to understand, as I rarely feel a romantic connection or attraction to anyone. 

But I met a guy about a year ago and we talked while we were both in abusive relationships (as friends) for a year. We were there for eachother when no one else was. We lost contact for 6 months afterwards and he came back because he couldn't stop thinking about me. And neither could I. We both were going through alot at the time so we had drifted apart. But now we were both single. I traveled 12 hours to see him. He was going to see me but I told him I wanted go for a road trip instead. It was instant chemistry. I'd never felt this way in my intire life (I'm 33 he is 30) about anyone before and I did not know it was possible for human feelings such as this to exist. He was the same. Even being in long-term relationships before, felt like nothing compared. We kept crying because I had to go back home eventually. But when I got home, things changed. I changed. I wanted everything and more for him. I wanted to treat him amazing. I wanted to be everything he deserved... But no matter how hard I tried, I knew my bpd was sabotaging it before my very eyes...I tried so so hard... I had been going to threapy for many years prior but I have been told that my case is incredibly resistant to treatment. Even since I young age. I have been on every med under the sun and every different threapy known to man. Even shock treatment. I have also had brain damage which has made my emotions ten times worse and I just try the best I can to achieve some kind of help from this exhausting disorder whenever I can but it's definitely a diffcult journey!! Anyhow, seeing my disorder slowly destroy my relationship Infront of me felt like someone else was taking over my body and deciding to react in all these types of ways I did not want to react in. It was like watching someone else take hold that didn't feel like me, but yet I couldn't control at the time regardless if the tools I used. 

Watching someone you love so so deeply being hurt by you is the most painfuliest thing I've ever gone through...
And the 1 thing I'd never in this world want to happen to them was happening by me! It's now been 4 months and I am blocked on everything and I don't expect a message back ever again. I truly hate myself for this and it seems the more I love someone, the more I must hurt them . I only wanted the very best for him but I couldn't even do that .. I know he wasn't the best ether sometimes but given the circumstances I can understand why. As much as it hurts me, I just hope he finds happiness and someone who can give him everything that I cannot archive or have not achieved in the last 10 years of threapy. I just want him to be happy ... As I write this, I'm crying non stop because I don't think I will ever find someone like that again. But it's not about me or what I want. It's about what they need, and they need someone stable. And after the horrific childhood I have endured for many years, bpd is the least of my concerns for the disoders I have.

But after my last hospitalization I told myself I was going to change my life and was no longer gonna let my life be ruled by my BPD. It’s almost exactly a year since I was hospitalized and I don’t recognized the person I used to be. I used to be so skeptical of DBT or any therapy/therapists because I thought I was smarter than them/it. It seriously seemed so dumb to me for so long which is why I never received treatment when I was younger. I can’t attribute all of my recovery to DBT but I did find it more helpful than anything else. Anyway the point of this is that YOU CAN CHANGE NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT SEEMS LIKE YOU CANNOT. I realized I’m too smart to be blaming my mental illnesses and instead dedicated months of my life to researching how to heal myself and change my life. At this point I no longer fit the criteria for BPD diagnosis. There is this indescribable sadness or emptiness that came with recovery though- after realizing how much of my life I missed out of, how much my identity was tied to bpd, how many of my life decisions came out of my inability to regulate my emotions, etc. but there is hope in this emptiness … I can create the person I want to become and u can too",1675293186.0,False,18,2,pinklilies27,None,10r9fw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/10r9fw1/i_think_im_recovered/
79,Remission/Recovery Resources for the Sticky Temperamental Traits of BPD,"Thanks to a year of DBT, my BPD symptoms are in remission, and I've been below the diagnostic criteria threshold for about a year and a half. 

I continue to practice DBT. I consider myself to be really rigorous and recovery-oriented, much like someone in substance abuse recovery might. 

I know that people like us have functional deficits, even in recovery, that are linked to temperamental traits (irritability, mood lability, negativity bias, impulsivity, etc). These deficits are the reason that only half of us go on to achieve normal interpersonal and vocational functioning after our BPD symptoms have gone into remission.

Here's the question: Does anyone have any post-treatment resources for those of us whose BPD symptoms are in remission but who want to maximize our functionality at work and in our relationships? Any resources that deal with temperamental problems as opposed to just behavior/thoughts?

82,Relationships with other people w/ complex comorbid psychiatric disorders?,"(26m) Over the past 10 years of my life I've seen a multitude of therapists & other mental healthcare providers, and I've been diagnosed with Bipolar I/PTSD/BPD/OCPD/anxiety/SUD. 

I've had 3 serious relationships in my adult life, all of them with other people who have complex comorbid psychiatric disorders of their own. Partner no 1: Depression/BPD/anxiety. Partner no 2: Mania/anxiety/SUD. Partner no 3: PTSD/DID/Bipolar I/possibly ASPD/SUD.

Each relationship was it's own spectacular disaster, each one more unhealthy & intense than the last. The final one especially has left me feeling broken.

As someone with BPD/OCPD and other psychiatric issues, am I just not meant to have a partner that has problems similar to mine? Is it just too much strain on a relationship, period? Or was the issue with my specific partners not being willing to get the treatment they need? I'd like to think someone who understands could be compatible with me.

84,We can choose how we want to remember someone.,"I got broken up with yesterday. I had spent the relationship idealizing my ex. I trusted him way more than he deserved and put his needs before my own. I was willing to do anything for him because I loved him.

He had experience with an exwBPD. He frequently brought up how she hurt him so I felt pressured to conceal all of my BPD traits. If I came even close to criticizing him, he accused me of splitting. This further pushed me into idealization.

Yesterday, he told me that he never loved me. It hurt. But I realized that finally acknowledging to myself the bad parts of the relationship and the bad things he did is not pathological. I can even choose to place emphasis on the bad rather than the good to help me move on. I don’t want to make the mistake of going back to him; this is not the first time that he broke up with me.

Maybe some day I can remember him more fondly. Today, I can say that he is a sad little egomaniac who fed on my love and gave me nothing but anxiety.

A friend of mine was just approved for rental subsidy since she is on disability, so she got $600 a month back in to her budget, and the first thing she did was go to the casino. Now, I know that she has every right to do so. She is allowed to have fun with her income. It's just that I'm on disability too, and I really could have used that $600 towards food and clothing for my daughter and I.

That said, I was approved for group therapy paid for by the government, so she has expressed feeling as though it's unfair that she either has to wait for a spot or pay for it herself.

I've tried a relationship and totally respect (and exceptionally proud of) anyone who has a significant other (and have a angry jealousy of) but I don't think a relationship can be possible for me even with treatment. My BPD was most likely born out my bad childhood and love for others was there until a great loss of mine. Since then love has been impossible for me when it comes to anyone even family. This lost left me afraid of any kind of love and I feel better off alone in that regard. I'd rather be lonely if it means I don't get hurt or hurt someone else.

91,THERAPY SCAM ALERT!! BWRT (BrainWorking Recursive Therapy) - Terence Watts,"This is a super important post so pls don’t delete mods! I’m trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help aren’t lied to. 

Terence Watts’s “BrainWorking Recursive Therapy” or, “BWRT” is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a “full proof” solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!!

Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, it’s giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes. 

I was so amazed at first, and truly believed I’d finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be true… so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it. 

The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesn’t want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldn’t be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I don’t respond or you don’t see this post anymore… well I guess you know why. 

Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproduct… but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions. 


Here are some links about BWRT to get you started:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ts8qya/does_anyone_have_experience_with_bwrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Watts gets his inspiration from [Benjamin Libet](https://www.bwrtuk.co.uk/bwrt/), whose theory about conscious and unconscious behaviour forms the basis of his theory. He talks about it a lot on his website and in his youtube videos. 


Also, I found some interesting posts about Charles Linden - another “expert” who displays similar behaviours of secrecy, denial and harassment to Terence Watts:

(FYI: I still need to do some more research on this myself, so I am not claiming to be an expert on this matter.)

EDIT: another very interesting link… [the Advertising Standards Agency says he breached the “UK code of non-broadcast advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.”](https://www.ns-healthcare.com/news/terence-watts/)

“The Terence Watts BWRT Institute was found guilty of claiming it could treat and/or diagnose several serious health problems including anxiety, infertility and diabetes without substantiating such claims.

In its findings, the ASA also concluded that an advertisement on the website discouraged people from seeking essential treatment and necessary medical supervision for conditions, including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and thyroid problems.

The Advertising Standards Agency told Terence Watts the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding it should not claim or imply that BWRT can be used to treat conditions without demonstrating sufficient evidence.

The ASA also said the website should not reference conditions for which medical supervision is necessary when addressing those seeking treatment in the future.”

92,Triggered by being minimized,"I just realized today that my biggest trigger is being minimized/invalidated. When somebody pushes these buttons I get incredibly angry and I sometimes can’t control myself. This can lead to me latching on to a problem/situation with a person and not be able to let go. 

I realized this because I was having to interact with someone at work who kept saying things to me that made me feel minimized. It also felt like he was not acknowledging his mistakes or the work I had done to fix said mistakes. I blew up at him because I felt like he was not listening to me and minimizing what I was saying. For example, I was upset that he was contacting me/expecting me to fix his mistakes on my days off so I told him that that was inappropriate to do. His reaction was “I understand that you don’t like being contacted on your days off” this felt minimizing to me because it made it seem like I was the one asking for special treatment when in reality he was expecting me to do work without compensation. In my mind it doesn’t matter what I think, my coworker having that expectation is inappropriate full stop. 

I got in a little bit of trouble with one of our bosses for doing that and had to have a sit down conversation where I was told that I should have handled it better and used a nicer tone of voice. I tried using a nicer tone of voice and tried to talked to about five other people before I blew up at this guy and nobody was listening or fixing the problems. The manager did reassure me that my anger was reasonable and the complaints I brought forth were fair. 

It’s just embarrassing to be told that your’e too much by people who push you bit and bit past your anger point. I don’t like exploding but I don’t know how else to be heard. 

I guess my questions are:
- Now that I know being minimized/not listened to/invaladated is a trigger, how do I go about managing it while also not being a complete push over? 

- How do I let things go? I feel like a dog in attack mode who is latched onto a bite and can’t unhook my jaw but everyone is just treating this like it’s an easy simple choice.  

- Has anyone else struggled with this?

93,Questions fo Men with BPD,"I see that most people with BPD seem to be women, but I read an article saying that its because of men not seeking treatment, so the institutions can't record them as often. This gave me a relief as I thought me having BPD in the wrong gender made things worse (I know, that sounds stupid). I have never met a male with BPD myself, but I would like to ask these questions to the guys here. 

\- How do you deal with hiding your emotions in public/group settings when you get triggered? Men have stigma to show any extreme emotions after all, so I bet its more difficult than it is for women. 

\- Are you on any medication to treat BPD?

\- How do you deal with being alone for too long? Do you try to talk to absolutely anyone you can reach to avoid the feeling of being invisible? I know I do, it is very common for me to lose touch with reality and feel like Im vanishing from existence if I stay alone for more than a day.

97,"I know my brain is trying to protect me, but I don’t want these feelings anymore","It’s been a long journey. Lots of pit stops and roundabouts and detours and wrecks and repairs and general surreal debauchery along the way. I thought I was starting to get better at it. Until They (ex partner/ex fp) left and never came back. Never offered a gesture at closure. Not even a lazy shrug or flick of a finger…just nothing, forevermore.

I did DBT, CBT, and prolonged exposure for years. Worked my ass off. Poured endless sweat and tears into treatment and recovery until my heart was caked with the saltwater. But my heart also became large and strong during that time. I could feel the weight starting to lift, the demons start to retreat from my head. Then my lover, my best friend of almost 10 years, left me. I still do not understand why. Perhaps that was the problem. Why it happened I do not know, but I do know I shattered. Completely and utterly broke.

In September, it will have been 4 years since I spoke to that person. Not a word between us. Just empty white space where profound love used to be. Those years were spent desperately, clumsily, agonizingly trying to piece my jagged remains back together. To reform myself as a stronger individual and to once again be able to see a person staring back at me when I look in the mirror. A person who, while flawed, is growing and reasonably content and moving forward. 

[I think that might be the hardest part. Looking in the mirror and seeing yourself, but not seeing a person. I haven’t been able to make one out in my reflection for 4 years. Just hollow black circles meet my gaze. Nothingness.]

Try as I might, I cannot seem to even begin to put myself back together. No matter how much treatment I get or support I seek or love I give or receive, my shattered pieces only seem to degrade further. Turning slowly but surely to naught but dust. I have had 2 long term relationships since They left, and both were spectacular disasters. Beautiful, incredible, loving, passionate, toxic, dramatic, exhilarating disasters. As I write this, I am feeling the deep sting of losing another partner/fp, the second of those two disasters. There is nothing I can do to rid myself of this pain—there is only acceptance, which has started to feel incredibly numb and pointless. 

tl;dr—my BPD (along w comorbid trauma/anxiety/substance abuse/mood regulation disorders) symptoms have grown so monstrous. So inhuman, so horribly broken as they well up out of me. That I cannot seem to even start to heal from one lost relationship, let alone begin to think about starting a new, healthy relationship. Or even more importantly, that I cannot seem to find any minuscule way to start the process of healing and finding myself at my core. My emotions are completely out of control, and they consume and burn relationships and people like fire when they rise through me.

98,Feeling hopeless,"I just got off the phone with my doctor regarding my diagnosis. I have had around 10 years of therapy (of which three years of CBD) and  several diagnoses (attachment disorder, childhood abuse/neglect, ptsd, adhd, ED,  unspecified personality disorder among other smaller stuff). A lot of these have not been taken seriously or disregarded by other specialists because I was too young, too unstable or the diagnoses were clashing. Which is all valid. but i felt like I am in a calmer and more stable environment so I can get properly diagnosed.

Now they told me that I do seem like I have a high functioning personality disorder that seems to be BPD. BUT. i am too high functioning. they literally told me I seem to have ""beaten"" it already. I am 21 years old, which seems kinda unlikely to me as neither myself nor any of my friends or family think I am mentally healthy enough to go without any diagnosis or treatment and now I am stuck with the diagnosis of reoccurring depression - which in no way explains my extreme mood swings, dissociative episodes and occasional psychotic episodes. Feeling depressed is honestly the least of my worries.

BPD is rooted in both sides of my family and several specialists have told me I do check most of the boxes. I don't know what to do, my FP just left me because I am too difficult and too depressed and dysfunctional for him to handle. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this and I don't know how to get a second opinion (I'm in the UK). In the meantime I am unable to do any uni work and am without a job due to the pandemic and I just spend all day in bed trying to get through the day without making things worse, while my mental health gets worse every day.

My symptoms are fucking up my life so much and I am so done feeling this way and being so dysfunctional all the time and not having any stability regarding the people in my life. I just wanna be normal. I don't wanna drink or get high to not feel anymore, I don't wanna keep isolating myself from the people I care about because I'm scared I'll hurt their feelings or do something that'll end up in them leaving me. I don't wanna be this way I wanna work my way to being somewhat normal, and yet I am ""too high functioning"" to be treated.

103,Invalidation vs lost Credibility,"I have no credibility in my relationship because of years when my distorted perception went unchecked. Now I'm medicated, doing the right treatment, and it's not perfect but it is a lot better. I find it incredibly hard to accept that I still have no credibility in my relationship, my version of truth is automatically questioned and doubted, he often treats my concern like a jury trial where I have to prove that my reason for being upset is valid. It's very painful and frustrating for the closest person to me to doubt my truth constantly. I see no other solution but ending the relationship to find a partner who doesn't have the same history with me bc my partner seems incapable of seeing me as I really am now, and just sees what he expects to see - which feels like, no matter what I'm upset about, it must be splitting or attachment issues and couldn't possibly be valid. That's the message I get, and I don't know how to have a healthy relationship with someone who believes this. Not to mention it makes me much less likely to catch when I am making assumptions or have an unnecessarily negative read of a situation because I'm distracted by pain and frustration of his Invalidation as a default position. Any advice? Anyone been through this and got their partner to stop assuming every bit of negative feedback is coming from your disorder?",1603664152.0,False,5,8,BPDfreakingout,None,ji2fja,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ji2fja/invalidation_vs_lost_credibility/
104,What do I do when my partner gets triggered?,"Before I start this I just want to say that BOTH of us suffer BPD. However, the difference is, I have done a lot of work and I no longer feel I fit the diagnosis nor react or feel or show any symptoms or BPD much at all anymore. I'm now in my 30s and was diagnosed very young. 

My partner has not had much treatment and is easily triggered and reactive. I do walk on eggshells util we see a psychologist because we are on a waiting list to see a couple and individual therapist. 

Im just having trouble with the emotional stress it's putting on me when he splits. Especially because I suffer seizures and trumua which is triggered by stress. He changes completely it's like night and day. And then he just threatens to leave me atleast twice a week and threatens suicide to make me feel bad instead of just owning upto his actions its always a victim mentality. You can't talk sense into him while his like this. He just gets worse and worse and pushes me away more and more unless I show affection towards him and then he will slowly let down his guard. But in that highly stressful moment I'm not feeling like being affectionate or loving towards him because it's not cool what his doing. He doesn't stop and if I ignore him he sees it as abandonment and gets more upset. But when he calms down his able to finally apologize. To a degree. He never used to be able to do that so it's been a big step for him. When his completely calm he now realizes he needs help and this can't continue. But I need advice on what to do when he gets like that. Being stern or telling him to stop makes it worse. But so does being silent. He is incredibly giving and nice when he is not triggered but when he is it's like a completely different person who says things about me and others he never normally would. He sees the world and everyone in it so drastically different when he is in this space and he even sounds Abit psychotic because sometimes it doesn't even make sense what his ranting on about. We live together and I have come accustom to how his mind works and he has told me he is sick of living like this. But in the meantime I need to find a plan so we can both remain sane when he starts getting triggered. Because he refuses to say his mad or triggered while his triggered and can take offense to it. Whilist I need a way to isolate until his calm. I also wanted to know why he keeps breaking up with me because I never have threatened that before even though I have BPD. I never completely understood it. It's like he wants me to beg him to stay or else he wants to leave. I feel it's unfair. Surely after everything we have been through he wouldn't just want to throw it all away over nothing?",1682778205.0,False,5,9,newbie-445,None,132ucpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/132ucpv/what_do_i_do_when_my_partner_gets_triggered/
105,Therapy session too long? Dissociation / zoning out during session,"Hi all, I've had my diagnosis years, and due to a couple of very scary crises over the past couple of years, I'm now under the local mental health team (UK) and am starting my referral to the PD team. I've started having monthly one-to-ones with a specialist PD person (therapsit? nurse? I'm not sure of their title but they are full-time personality disorder worker). 

My session earlier this week was maybe my third of fourth session with them, and it just seemed soooo loooonggg. We did a catch-up, talked about some extreme emotions that I've been through this week, and then did some worksheets and paperwork. Then we started on relationships, and discussing healthy vs unhealthy. 

The thing is, by the end of the session, I was totally zoned out, I have no idea what we were on about, I had totally checked out. This is common for me when personal interactions have gone on for too long, and I have no idea how I come across to the other person. I feel like there is a lot of me just nodding and mm-hm -ing. 

I know is is kinda normal-ish for me, and probably for people with PD in general. Should I discuss this with my therapist? Should I say I have no idea what happened in the last part of our session? I don't know how to handle this going forward, and how to get the most out of our sessions if I just start checking out during them. 

I would love to hear your approach to this, and ideas on what I could do. I know I'm incredibly fortunatle to be getting this treatment. I had my origional EUPD diagnosis in 2002, and this was reconfirmed last year as 'complex' BPD (same thing, their words, not mine) with a bit of ASPD.",1582879340.0,False,9,22,badgerhoneyy,None,fars15,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fars15/therapy_session_too_long_dissociation_zoning_out/

I was so shaken up when I started..it felt like preemptively mourning parts of myself, if that makes sense. But I stuck with it and 3 months in I'm seeing a tremendous amount of progress.

 I have an hour with a one on one and 2.5 hours of skills group every week in addition to phone coaching during business hours. The appointments with my one on one have shown me so much about how and why I developed the patterns I have. Getting to the root of... everything...is helping me cultivate self compassion which I have never had previously and learning to use skills and consequently reducing destructive behaviours is helping me gain a level of confidence I didn't think possible. It feels like every week I'm having a breakthrough...it's wild. Mind you I'm 38 and have been ""doing the work"" for 4 years now, (I didn't receive the BPD diagnosis until 2 years ago, I just thought all my symptoms were from bipolar disorder, which I also have).

 It's just so wild to me to feel like recovery is actually possible. Not like I expect BPD to ever fully recede but I do believe it's possible to experience long periods of remission. I want to siphon every drop of this 6 month program. I know I'm lucky and not everyone can access treatment and that is enraging because we all deserve it..but yeah...if you can access DBT I can't recommend it enough, if you're ready to do the work.

I get these awful episodes where no one can get me out. It's like a switch flips. It isn't the true me at all. I feel so guilty when I get this way, and my parents remind me how guilty I should feel by saying how completely hurt they are. This is only worsened by insomnia that comes and goes in flares. 

It's kind of the whole I hate you, I love you thing. I don't know how to control it. I can't just snap out of it. My parents then get mad at me and say hurtful things, and it makes me even angrier. Even the sound of someone chewing when I'm pissed makes me go crazy. Of course, I still don't have a BPD diagnosis, because doctors are trying to pass it off as something else, because I'm young. Gosh, that pisses me off. What do I do? My meds aren't working. Nothing at this point is working.

109,BPD/EUPD Support Group! <3,"My name is Daisy Sky (she/her) and I am a Couples & Family Therapist in training! Nice to meet you, fellow BPD brains <3

I will be offering a 12-session support group for those who struggle with borderline personality disorder/emotionally unstable personality disorder this summer! This group is for you if you have trouble regulating your emotions, you struggle in your interpersonal relationships, you find yourself making impulsive and potentially destructive decisions (do they even feel like decisions??), you have an unstable sense of identity, and/or you find yourself frequently ruminating on the past or future. This group is also for you if you have a loved one who is struggling with these symptoms. While the group is centered around the struggles of those with BPD/EUPD, you do not need to identify with this condition to be welcome in the space.

Group will be held on Zoom from 7:00-8:30pm PST on Wednesdays, dates listed below. In group, I will share a new skill each week, and open up space for sharing and discussion. This group is NOT a substitute for therapy, rather a supplemental peer support space. I have been managing EUPD for over a decade, and I have lots of resources and compassion to share with those whose lives have been touched by this painful condition 📷 Influences will be drawn from my own personal therapy, as well as teachings from my MACFT program. I will be drawing from evidence-based treatments for BPD, and this group will have a strong mindfulness component, with recommended weekly journaling/practice assignments. Please share with anyone who you think would benefit; I think it's going to be a beautiful space!

Energy exchange/financial support is negotiable on a sliding scale, with discounts given to those who sign up for the entire series, BIPOC, and trans folx. NOTAFLOF! Drop-ins are also welcome!

111,Relationship dilemma,"BPD, CPTSD, Bipolar 2

Sorry for this long rant, trying to make sense of my broken life and needed to share with others who might be more understanding about what I’m going through, with my mental illness.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I’m afraid I’m too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I’d he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me….. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can’t and won’t get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",1688449467.0,False,1,0,Old-Meet-1322,None,14q68cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14q68cv/relationship_dilemma/
112,I don't know what to do with this realization.,"  If I sit still for more than a little while, my mind starts to fantasize suicide and self harm for all the perceived wrongs I've done. I become filled with hopelessness and desperation. So I clean, I can't sit still. I must distract myself. I work until my back locks up (I have a herniated disc) and then I sit until the spasms stop, then I have to go again or I will start wanting to harm myself. The next day, I will wake up and be angry at myself for being in pain from pushing myself so hard, then I become despondent at my inability to distract myself, so I push through the pain. This lasts about 4 days then I give up, I lose myself in a game or watching videos, falling deeper into self loathing until I melt-down. I spend a day in complete mental crisis, suicidal ideation and self destructive thoughts, affecting those around me, lost in my own head. The next day I am renewed and must do things to keep myself from falling down again. It feels endless.


UPDATE: A lot of what I was experiencing, as it turned out, was caregiver burnout. My husband passed in his sleep on Saturday, 4/24/21 and the weight of worry had become overwhelming. I didn't realize the constant stress I was experiencing just from the worry that he was dying. Now, no more pain for him, no more breathing treatments, no more making him eat. I love him always, but I think he knew it was slowly killing me with him, to watch him in the process of dying for so many years.

113,My friend with bpd seems to hate me,"My friend was recently diagnosed with bpd, she’s also recently divorced. We got super close after her divorce even had something sexual for a time after. She would call and text me all the time, call me venting about life and I’d just listen. This went on for almost a year, we became extremely close spent most weekends together and she would always either ask to hangout, or be down to do something. Recently over the last month things have changed. In June she found out that her ex husband had moved on and found a new girlfriend. She called me crying and wanting to hurt herself. I talked her out of it and went over cuddled her until she fell asleep and then I left. Since then she has started changing, she seems annoyed to be around me, if I ask what’s wrong she flips out, she’s kicked me out of her house twice for trying to hold her while she’s upset. She admitted to me about a month ago that she and her ex husband and her never stopped sleeping together, that they had only been living apart. I asked why she kept it a secret she said she didn’t want to lose me. She then admitted that two weeks after seeing the exs new girlfriend she started talking to a guy she met on a site. They in just a month they are talking all day, have been on 8 dates, FaceTime at least three times a week, and they are going on weekend away trips. She’s rescheduling her kids and other friends to make sure she can squeeze him in, all while complaining she has not time for anything. I told her therapy is something to look into. She got herself set up and started going. I went with her to her first session and after the therapist asked if I was aware that she showed traits of bpd. I asked what it was and the therapist explained. They set her up for an evaluation and the doctor said it bpd was indeed the case. The therapist set up therapy for us together because she doesn’t have much family. The first session was brutal she never liked me, she couldn’t stand me, I wasn’t her type, she finds me disgusting, I’m annoying, I’m a bother, I’m a crybaby, I’m not her thing, I force her to sleep with me(not true at all), I cause nothing but drama. She goes back in the timeline and say she felt a particular way at whatever point but I can tell you the things she says didn’t happen and I actually at that time got something completely different. She does this with her ex husband as well she says she felt certain ways but he says that there was no way, that they actually were really good at the points she says they weren’t. The therapist says she editing the timeline with intrusive thought to try and justify behaviors. She We had , had  sex two weeks prior to the session and she actually asked me for it  and about two weeks before that same thing. When I asked about the guy she’s going away with she gets angry, she gets dismissive and says I’m bothering her. She’s been talked out of quitting therapy twice because if the therapist brings up the guy she gets big mad. When we see eachother I get the complete opposite treatment as long as I don’t bring up the guy. Shes also when given examples of fp or devaluing says she doesn’t see it that everyone is just making it up to make her sound crazy, she’s living life as a normal person would. When you point out that she’s doing thing out of the norm you are the issue. I miss my friend take away the sex and this is my friend someone I care about a lot. She’s an amazing person but I don’t know how to help or support her.

115,It actually does get better,"I was cleaning my kitchen today, and the song Wake Up Alone by Amy Winehouse came on.

This song and the whole album (Back To Black is basically BPD: The Album, seriously, if you haven’t heard it and feel safe to do so, have a listen CW for substance abuse) are associated with one of my lowest times of my life ever.

I started crying immediately as I felt those feelings flood back. The desperation, the loneliness, the overwhelming fear. All the nights crying, staring at my phone, calling them over and over and over in a dissociative haze. The way I only felt like an actual person when I was with someone, actively being focused on, giving myself wholly and completely to them. The numerous attempts to find ANYTHING that would dull the ache inside of me. The pure fear of night, and the crushing blow of waking up alone.

There’s a part in it that used to resonate with me so much:

“Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets”

I used to fear night time and being on my own so much. But here I was, it’s the evening, I’m alone in my kitchen cleaning after a nice meal, happily singing along to music. No fear, no dread, actually a “silent sense of content.”

It’s been about 10 years since that awful time, and things have changed. I got treatment, found a loving stable partner, who I have great communication with, have a pleasant and safe life. I’m not saying I’m cured, or I’m 100% happy all the time, in fact I’m currently in therapy to do trauma processing.

But I don’t feel THAT feeling anymore. The desperation doesn’t hit me like that any longer. I don’t have that crushing pain in my chest that drives me to do ANYTHING I can to get rid of it, no matter the cost. I still feel a version of it on occasion but it doesn’t command me.

I’m no longer living my life running away as fast as I can from that feeling.

10 years ago I could have never ever believed it. I thought I’d be stuck with it for life. I wish I could have told me then it wouldn’t last, there was relief ahead.

So, if you’re in the thick of it right now, please believe me, from someone who’s been tear stained and aching too, one day you’ll just be happily tidying your kitchen, and the feeling you feel right now will be a distant memory.

The situation: I'm in my second week of inpatient ED treatment and I've never felt so emotionally disregulated IN. MY. LIFE.

I have (quiet) BPD, and my emotions are UNBEARABLE lately, especially since I don't have access to my unhealthy coping mechanisms (food restriction, substance abuse and self-harm) OR a one-on-one therapist. I just feel like I'm going to go nuts if I don't figure out skills that actually help. They're not teaching us formal DBT (the handouts are ""inspired by"" Linehan's DBT sheets) and this isn't going to change so I need to find some alternatives. My biggest struggle rn is whether I'm ""sick enough"" or that things were ""serious enough"" to warrant me being here, and I've been looking up narrative therapy because I'm a writer and feel like this could help give me perspective. Does anyone have experience with this? Or can link me to some reliable resources? Are there any other skills other than TIP and accepts?

On top of all this my mum's been sending me nasty texts about how I'm not trying hard enough, that taking PRNs like Ativan and Seroquel are a cop out and that I have skills and that I'm ""choosing"" not to use them.

And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me.

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439573.0,False,1,7,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1ad08qo/hitting_rockbottom/
118,How do you manage to ever get out of a BPD relationship,"Im diagnosed CPTSD but early last year saw the downward spiral of a seven year relationship and I found myself full of excruciating emotions that wouldn’t let up. I’ve lived in a constant state of dysregulation since. I initiated the break up because I wanted to focus on myself and getting more stable but within a month he met someone and quickly started a full-blown intense relationship. I lost my shit and reached out to him and he reciprocated. It’s been a downward spiral ever since. We have a seven year old together and he basically lives 25 percent in my apartment 25 percent with his gf and the rest of the time on campus. The first few months of his relationship we were hooking up and he was telling me he was looking for the right time to end it with her. I realised pretty quickly he was lying to both of us and was fine carrying on these toxic cycles because he somehow had a system to justify it all. I am NOT fine. At first I didn’t even understand what was happening to me. When he is around I’m dysregulated down to every cell. I can’t eat because Im so anxious. I cry and try to tell him how his choices are devastating me and are going to devastate that other woman. I’ve tried so so hard to detach but every time I think I’m making some progress my white knuckling and ignoring him as if he were heroin he catches me in a vulnerable position and I cave and the cycle starts again. I was able to put real distance between us for a couple weeks and felt better and more in control but he came by last night and I just felt so weak and alone and wiped out from battling this new me that I don’t even recognise that I fully caved, had sex with him, told him how I felt AGAIN and then as soon as I fell asleep he went back to the other woman‘s house. All day today I’ve spent trying to convey over text that he is destroying me and begging him to stop. Ofc I got nowhere. I don’t know the person he’s become either because despite ups and downs our relationship was healthy for the six preceding years. I don’t know how I’m going to make it through this when I’m already so weakened and I can’t even manage to go two weeks without doing the same thing. I’m so tempted to just contact the other woman and tell her everything so at least there’s some kind of a cut. But it seems s fucking petty. I feel stupid. I feel ashamed but mostly I feel so fucking weak anxious and exhausted. I am in fear and trembling that I’m always going to feel this way. If all of this is Bpd related and the only treatment is years of dbt just so the same thing can happen the moment you find yourself attached to someone what’s the point. I know my daughter needs me and that’s the only motivation I have left that keeps me barely functional but what if it isn’t enough",1674488660.0,False,1,5,annachronism2020,None,10jfheq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/10jfheq/how_do_you_manage_to_ever_get_out_of_a_bpd/
119,Idealization Comedown? Help???,"As many bpd relationships seem to go, I had an intense and toxic relationship with my ex where I idealised them. Even after the breakup, even after I got over my ex in a romantic light, I still measured my self-worth based on their commentary and expectations.   
However, after much time apart and almost a year of treatment, I saw them recently and realised just how completely...human they are. They're not unattractive but they're not the Adonis I made them out to be. I'm no longer attracted to them. Their behaviours and hobbies don't appeal to me anymore. I genuinely don't see how we could fit whatsoever as oppose to before where I thought they were everything good that could possibly happen to me. My rose coloured glasses have come off completely.  
This marks incredible progress and while proud, I'm also...at a loss?   


After spending so much of my time devaluing myself and measuring my worth by their ideals, I realise that part of my motivation to get better (even though I tried hard not to do so) was to prove my worth. Now that I recognise how unnecessary and flawed that is, I don't know how to direct that lingering energy and time I normally spend now that I'm no longer romanticising them.   


Does anyone have any suggestion as to how to redirect that energy and use it in a more constructive manner?",1556439800.0,False,12,2,Khokoflores,None,bi95h4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/bi95h4/idealization_comedown_help/
120,I have BPD and I’m very concerned I won’t be able to have healthy and happy romantic and non romantic relationships.,"Hi. I have BPD (I think quiet borderline) and have done a course of DBT, which was very helpful. For the first time, I felt I was in a group with people who had similar experiences to mine - they are also some of the most thoughtful, reflective and caring people I’ve met. We have a WhatsApp group so we can text each other and suggest skills when someone is triggered and in a crisis. I have been resisting the label of “BPD” It’s very hard to read the information out there, especially on Reddit. 95% of people say “run” or “they are monsters”. I do have sensitivity to feelings of defectiveness (BPD) so this is majorly triggering that “panic button” but I also haven’t found any real positive stories to encourage me. I had a very emotionally abusive relationship with both parents - I think my mother has untreated BPD and absolutely explodes at anything. My first long term relationship when I was 20 was a toxic disaster. I really did try my best but I was not good at dealing with my emotions - I had pushed them away in order to focus on getting into university, otherwise it would have overwhelmed me in a debilitating way. My second serious relationship, when I was 26, was a lot better - it was very different to the first. I was much more considerate and aware of my emotions - I made sure never to neg him and give lots of validation etc. But I did still manage to make him feel like he was never good enough, because I would still be very down - it wasn’t lashing out exactly, but I would talk about my feelings of defectiveness and feeling of being unloved and I cried so much for no reason - I think saying I felt unloved felt very accusatory to him and like he was not measuring up / failing. He broke up with me, saying I had a “negative worldview when I had so many positive things going on”, but would also approach me after the breakup looking for emotional support, then just detach, which was really distressing and confusing. The last conversation we had he said he couldn’t communicate and didn’t feel heard or understood, but it’s also the way he’s felt his entire life. He also apologised for “emotionally unloading” on me, but that it was because I’m a good person and one person he “could really trust” but that he didn’t love me anymore. I felt absolutely deflated and hopeless after this experience because I had tried very hard to do things the right way, although I still acted in the way I described above. I’m very scared that, even with treatment, the relationship will still be too much for a “normal” person and I’ll end up driving them away. I isolate myself because I’m scared if I get to know people they’ll discover how I am emotionally and leave - that pain would be too great to bear. I would love to hear from positive experiences in BPD relationships that might be encouraging.",1650861859.0,False,21,13,Ill_Entertainment895,None,ubcyu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ubcyu7/i_have_bpd_and_im_very_concerned_i_wont_be_able/

122,Advice on managing emotion and moods.,"Hi I've been recently diagnosed last Friday. Yay........ As you can probably imagine life fucking sucks and everything. Anyway I was told I'm be referred to this group session they have that last 6 months. And since they already one going I gotta wait till the fall.

So I was told to go do some research and what BPD is and way to cope till then. So far I found a bunch of video on what BPD is. And how to deal with someone who bpd. And what are the sign.

But finding video telling me how me as a person living with this condiction ( I don't wanna used the other word) I'm hard pressed to find anything. I swred expasaaly if you a man. It seem the general opinon is stay away he dramatic and lost cause. 

So here I am asking people who I assumed when trought a lot of same shit as me while waiting for treatment. 

I don't what to do. I'm moving out my folk home cause where stressting eacher out and I'm lossing my fucking shit as a result. Probably I never seem to last long in my own apt before getting kick out cause I'm fucking crazy. And get kick out cause I'm lossing my shit.

Honestly I'm expecting thing to get worst before they get better. I'm kinda hope that someone here anyone has any advice on how to at least hold it together. If that make any sence.

123,(Crosspost) This video was extremely helpful,"I haven't intriduced myself, but have been following for a while, I am a 37 year old woman with BPD, diagnosis made a few months ago. Besides being an immediate danger to myself- which I am in intensive treatment for, the biggest issue is between me and my husband of 13 years. He still has a lot of trouble understanding what is going on, he feels like he is walking on eggshells (though I am more of a quiet pwBPD, he just does not want to make any depression worse). He says he feels like he s being asked to change things over night which is hard- I did a decent job hiding my symptoms for years and years. But right now I am not asking him to change anything, I am just asking for a lot of support and reassurance, more than he has ever given me before, because I am pretty much in crisis, the negative self image and abandonment issues are wildly out of control.

I think I was lead to Dr. Daniel Fox's You Tube page by a post here. He talks about so much stuff, it was a little overwhelming at first! I rarely check You Tube for new content, so I also added his account on IG. He posted a new video a few days ago called ""BPD and it's cause."" I've read a lot, so I didn't feel super unclear on that, but I like him, so I gave it a listen.

Please please please watch it. Whether you are a pwBPD or someone close to a pwBPD. Yes there is some discussion of cause, but it is a very clear picture of what BPD looks like and feels like. The first part he is reading from a textbook, which I didn't feel described me 100%, but then he takes it an puts it in simple terms. It is very hopeful and helps explain when a lot of us are not 100% sure how to understand or even explain what happens inside us.

My husband, who has been somewhat resistant to learning about BPD even though I really feel it would help us communicate better even said it was helpful.

Be well friends, one day or one hour at a time. You are not alone and you are not crazy.

124,FP left over a year and a half ago and I can't move on,"I'd like to preface this by saying I am not interested in hearing how pathetic I am that I haven't moved on yet or how unhealthy it is. I am well aware. I am seeking advice on how I can move on and am wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation.

I had a pretty intense relationship with my ex FP. She (I am also a woman) could be very kind and sweet, was there for me, was patient and understanding. Sometimes she'd suddenly turn cold and would give me the silent treatment for a week knowing how much it triggered me. Then she'd go back to saying she loves me so much and I'm such a wonderful and amazing person. At the end of December 2020, I ended up splitting from the stress of the relationship and when I woke up the next morning she had blocked me everywhere without a word.

I haven't been able to move on all this time. I know it was unhealthy but it was also the only relationship in my life where I had felt seen and understood and loved. We has so much in common, liked all the same stuff. We'd talk for hours every day. She encouraged the FP thing, saying she liked that I was attached to her/dependent on her (I realized that was unhealthy too). 

Despite being able to recognize the unhealthy aspects of it, when it was good, it was really good, and I miss that so much. I have comorbid autism so it's extremely difficult for me to find friends who are willing to put up with me. I've been alone most of this time. I've seen a few therapists, and they all have different things to say, some think it's possible she was a narcissist and others think it was a mutually unhealthy relationship... None of them have had any advice on how to move on, other than pointing out that it seems like I'm now in complicated grief and possibly a trauma bond.

It's so scary to go from talking to someone every day to them not even acknowledging your existence. Sometimes I worry I just hallucinated our whole relationship. I'll still admittedly reach out to her every once in a while in hopes that it'll have been long enough I could at least get some closure, but nope... I think the lack of closure is one of the hardest parts of it since she ghosted me.

I feel like an empty shell without her. When we were friends it felt like I finally had a purpose, a reason to get out of bed. I wanted to be there for her in any way I could. I did have romantic feelings for her that were unrequited, but she had known about those a year and a half prior to her leaving. 

Even knowing it was unhealthy, I want her to come back. I feel like my time stopped when she left and it can't move on until she comes back.

(Sorry for rambling, I think it's an autism thing but I struggle a lot with being concise and overexplaining)

TLDR: Can't move on from ex FP. It was a pretty intense relationship and the first time I ever felt loved and understood, though it was pretty unhealthy.

125,need a reality check please: reflection after a breakup :),"hi all! i havent yet been officially diagnosed with BPD as it’s extremely difficult to get an appointment with a psychiatrist and I’ve been completely blind to my issues (repressing them lmao) and my family and friends enabled me for so long I could never take accountability + always making myself be the victim. anyways, i met a guy in the summer..who after the first date told me he was scared to kiss me because I was “too pretty” for him etc. we clicked instantly and spent a lot of time together and got very personal and close very quickly. i was in a pretty level headed mind at the time, i was focusing on myself and wasn’t really looking for anything serious as i just got out of a treatment center 6 months prior (ED). 2 weeks into us talking he told me he has Bipolar, and I told him that I liked him for who he was and if his illness ever became too much..we would reevaluate but I enjoyed my time w/ him. after that conversation he told me he loved me. things were amazing still, and i continued talking with him and he asked me to be his girlfriend maybe a week or two after that. i told him due to an abusive ex I had trouble with insecurities and trust. after we started officially dating I noticed many girls on his Snapchat and made an immature remark to him regarding it and he got mad and I’m sure I continued to do other things that I don’t remember. he then deleted a message in front of me a few weeks later from a girl..on my birthday wishing her a happy birthday. i told him calmly that I don’t get mad at him for talking to women, but when he deletes things it looks suspicious. i found out that night that he was sending her paragraphs about nothing romantic when I had to beg him for a goodmorning text and he was talking horribly about me to his friends, we broke up. 
then to make a long story short, we were good from end of august to october (except I found out he was telling his friends I was crazy, which I probably am) I began to be very insecure and controlling/manipulative..I would get upset if he didn’t text me, and mad at him for liking girls instagram pictures, if he was too nice to women (and for some RIDICULOUS crazy things, like bringing my girl friend lunch so she didn’t feel left out). But my super irrational crazy behavior and clinginess didn’t start until I found out he texted the same girl from the first breakup again (I set the boundary that as long as I hung out with her since they were “friends” and he didn’t hide messages I had no issue, but neither happened) and he threatened to break up with me again, and then turned it around on me that I was being hypocritical (that I had a guy friend of 6 years who also has a girlfriend, and is not my type). Then admittedly I became the problem even though he had changed for the better, and he could not deal with me toxic behavior and left. It was going to be a break until he found out I told my ex-coworker about him having Bipolar after our first breakup and someone else told him I was crazy to my ex when I was 14 and dated for 1 month.
Anyway, I did victimize myself and make him look bad (I think???) to family and friends. But I hate myself for fucking this up, he was amazing to me and I wish I didn’t get so insecure and mad and clingy over some SUPER petty things and I wish i didn’t overshare his personal information to people whenever I felt hurt. But my question is, am I as crazy as I feel and was this all my fault? The girl he was texting called me crazy and blocked me, but he admitted to me that she was into him, I am always questioning my sanity and whether any of this happened or if my brain made it all up to again paint myself as the victim.

I've noticed some sincerely good changes within myself the last few weeks, but my SO says that ""I see no difference between now and a year, two, or three years ago"" and it makes me want to scream until I bleed out of every orifice of my body.   
The compulsive ""HE'S BANGING SOMEONE ELSE"" ceased when I dealt with my OCD. Cleaning, the mass depression I'd get from not finishing everything in a day, trying to keep my idealistic plans of every day in tact (which all caused MEGA blowouts between us, from either of us) are gone. Most recently, I'm trying to not be so heavily bothered by my family and their shit, or his lack of cleanliness (and not in an ocd way, but a ""please wipe the counters if you made a mess/ normal, way), I've been more playful about touchy topics to try to lighten the mood, I've tried keeping calm better than I ever have in the past and I've fucking succeeded but I get little to no acknowledgement from him- especially if he's really upset.   


I self dx bpd a few months ago. I know I have it; it isn't a mystery. I've made almost my entire life about it. I've learned so much. I've talked with others and posted in different subs to get advice, or to even give advice. I've listened to so many different podcasts and read studies. I've read treatment plans from therapists. I've done more about this than I've done about anything else in literal.years. and he rarely ever notices or gives me credit. Even if he does give me credit, it seems like he takes it all back after a while. 

It absolutely kills me. I know that if i wasn't in a relationship, I wouldn't need to work as hard as I am but I am, because I want to be with him. I've only ever exhibited these behaviors with him. I think, almost positively, that the stress I endured when I moved in with him broke me and I finally snapped and it came to the surface. I'm not saying I wouldn't work on myself if I were alone. I'd be way more efficient, feel way less shame, awkwardness, guilt, self- doubting and loathing if I were doing this on my own, honestly. But, instead, I choose to take on BPD with being a sp, in financial ruins alongside him who is also in financial ruins partially because of me, being the person he wants and needs me to be all of the time while I've never been the person I myself need while with him -- y'all, it's a lot.

129,Looking for resources,"I started seeing a psychiatrist, who specializes in TFP, 2 months ago. She diagnosed me with BPD. When I questioned the severity she said I’m “on the healthy side”. She explained that now that the assessment portion is over, the sessions would now be twice a week ($80 a week with my insurance). That was going to be a lot financially, as I dropped to working part time this year to help care for my baby. My husband supported my therapy and we agreed I would proceed with therapy and take a financial hit for one year for my well-being. I started to get a bad feeling about the psychiatrist when she prescribed me a sleeping medication and my insurance charged me $100 for the medication management code that she billed bc the insurance company said two codes were billed so it appears that 2 separate visits were completed when the medication management was discussed during our visit. I emailed her and told her I can’t afford $80 a week plus $100 every time she mentions medication to me so I would have my PCP take over this sleeping medication bc I don’t get charged when he writes me prescriptions. The psychiatrist then proceeds to send in a new prescription for a higher dose, which I didn’t ask for, after I was clear that I didn’t want to discuss medications with her again. This resulted in another $100 charge. She then took a 2 week vacation and we picked back up last night for our first real treatment session. She started the session by saying she needs to charge my credit card for the second medication charge. I let this go because I’m working on not cutting ppl off after a bad feeling. Then she says she has two requirements for me: 1) I need to “start a weight management program like weight watchers”. I gained a significant amount of weight during my pregnancy and can’t get it off. My PCP started me on Ozempic which has already helped me lose 40 lbs. I told the psychiatrist that I’m already taking steps to help with my weight (which was discussed in previously sessions) she replied “ya but you’re really not” and implied she didn’t trust my PCP of doing enough to manage my weight 2) since I couldn’t have her manage my meds due to insurance, she wanted me to have a regular psychiatrist manage my meds (vyvanse for ADHD and have been on for nearly 10 years and trazodone for sleeping which she put me on last month) bc she didn’t trust my PCP to manage them. 
All that was going through my head was this is more money I have to spend for things my PCP is doing for free. When I pushed back she said these two requirements were necessary for us to start therapy. She said it would be irresponsible of her to not have me do weight watchers and said it was the same as if I was an alcoholic and she required me to go to AA. 

She told me to cut my mom off and “have a hotel on speed dial” when I visit her but then later apologized and said she shouldn’t be giving me advice. She also made numerous little digs about my husband. Again, I brushed those comments aside bc I’m working on not being impulsive when it comes to cutting ppl off. But I’m really uncomfortable with her giving me an ultimatum and now  talking poorly of a third person on my life, my PCP. 

I emailed her and said I’m not comfortable with her two requirements and I understand this means we can’t move forward with therapy. I feel like the past two months of assessment and building trust with her was just a waste. I’m not ready to start with another therapist so I’m looking for other resources like books, videos, workbooks, etc that you feel helped you.

130,BPDlovedones…helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I’m talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It’s all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that’s for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don’t really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I’m sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally. I feel like I’m trapped in the mind of a five year old as well trapped in the mind of 1000 year old person. I feel like I’ve lived 1000 lives and sometimes I’m not sure what’s real, what’s a delusion, and what is fact. This is why I love neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. It gives me explanations for why I am experiencing an emotion, why I am reacting to it, and to just remind myself that it’s not that big of a deal. I don’t want to make excuses for people who cannot take accountability of their actions however. I used to do that and thinking about it makes me ashamed. My mother has BPD and is closing in on 50. I have only repaired my relationship with her this year out of pity after cutting her off just as other people did. I understand how she does not see how her actions affect people, and that’s why the mental illness makes relationships difficult. She seems to think that she raised me perfectly fine even though sometimes I didn’t have food and we were homeless at one point and she constantly screamed in my face and hit me. She never hugged me. She never told me she loved me. I never felt like she was my mother. I don’t have a father. I don’t have siblings. I don’t have aunts and uncles. I grew up extremely lonely and the thing I struggle with the most as an adult is abandonment. I think I fear the way I felt as a child. I have had the thought “it will never get better” for as long as I can remember. And now I look around at the life I have created. With the person who I think is the love of my life, my wonderful friends and support systems, my education in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience, my ability to travel to different countries, and ability to have my own things. And yet there’s still a sense of chaos in my life and nothing can ever be stable. Am I doomed to live this way forever? All I want to do is fix this. And I don’t even know what “this” is. I fully support psychoactive compound therapy. From my readings of academic literature, and personal experiences, I think building neuroplasticity through psychoactive treatment is a key component to mental health rehabilitation. You obviously can’t just give people psychedelics and say go crazy—it needs to be monitored, and patients need directed therapy while they are experiencing altered states of consciousness. Becoming extremely emotional, and vulnerable has caused me so much grief, but has allowed me to discover so much about life and help me build extremely close personal relationships with people so I can learn more and give back to the field of neuropsychopharmacology.",1692082128.0,False,14,10,pthevslayer,None,15rku5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15rku5z/bpdlovedoneshelpful_or_harmful_idk_who_cares/
131,What Support Groups Have You Found for BPD?,"It sucks to be alone! It also sucks to not be able to afford group therapy! Share your experiences with free support groups from whatever perspective of recovery.

I've been going to two, with a generally positive experience. My experience so far is that it's lovely to have a support group at all; that's about 80% of the benefit. The details of the remaining 20% vary.

1) Emotions Anonymous is a recovery group modified from traditional 12 Step recovery programs like AA or NA. I've been going about once a week for about a year, now. The only requirement to join is a ""desire to become better emotionally."" It's very diagnosis-agnostic, so there are a diversity of psychological geogrpahy. Most of the people I meet there are bipolar, BPD, or suffering from PTSD, with a couple of DID cases. Meetings are supposed to be safe sharing spaces, meaning no unasked advice or commentary on others sharing. I'd say the major benefit other than a sharing space is the anonymity. The structure of the 12 steps might help some people and might frustrate others. The major con, to me, is the higher power stuff. 

https://emotionsanonymous.org/

2) The Icarus Project is a mutual-aid network and support system for people dealing with Mental Health Challenges that normally get called mental illness. I've attended about three meetings in my lifetime. Groups are organized autonomously and non-heriarchically, and groups provide a variety of functions. It is implicitly anarchist, and as such a lot of the literature it offers links mental health policy to repressive political apparati like the prison system. The major thing I like about Icarus is that it is harm reductive and self determinative regarding diagnosis, medication, and treatment options. The hardest part of making the groups happen is that it's hard to get political activists interested in mental health and it's hard to get emotionally debilitated people interested into politics. 

https://theicarusproject.net/

Oh, and Icarus has tons and tons of really good resources though, including a 1 page handout of crisis advice and space to write an advance directive. I highly recommend that anyone with BPD fill out a 1 page sheet on your needs during a crisis rather than let random medical professionals guess at your needs and preferences.

Anyway I'd really welcome any additions to these resources or other groups that people have worked with.",1579149563.0,False,10,3,PelagiusWasRight,None,epedmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/epedmu/what_support_groups_have_you_found_for_bpd/
132,Trying to recover while in a new relationship,"Hey everybody ! I have recently been on the journey to start recovery right now after going through a really rough and challenging time after starting a new medication that brought out the worst parts of myself and a new relationship that i realized heightens my bpd symptoms (even just having the context of being in a relationship had me triggered). I want to further my growth as much as possible so I want to make sure I work towards my growth instead of against it. So I share this in hopes of getting feedback or really any response! I want to know what other ppl think from an objective POV ! This is a long post so be prepared for that ! 

I am currently tapering off this medication and working through dbt workbooks and in the process of getting started at an outpatient dbt program ! We both have mental illness and they have gotten treatment/ are going to therapy and taking meds however unfortunately things started turning toxic unknowingly and there was a dynamic created where I started burdening my partner and they felt like they always had to be there for me even if they didn’t have the capacity to otherwise in their mind who else would and over time started revolving their whole life around me (even isolating themselves from others just to b around me and try to be there for me in crisis). They took me expressing some of my intrusive thoughts and fear of abandonment to heart and made themselves suffer to make me feel “better” or not to abandon or leave me.

 I would word vomit and over share a lot of things I definitely should’ve kept to myself but that I never knew was making them feel like this. Our communication was off because they thought it would make me feel even worse and I would in turn internalize any feedback or criticism and also sometimes they didn’t even know how they felt never mind to then tell me. We got into a habit of them reassuring me no matter what and a routine of seeing each other all the time. After a major meltdown from me and a long day of work, we got to the point where we both got triggered and had an emotional night which lead me to initiate conversation about the issues that are there. 

As we uncovered more, it was disturbing to see how something that we both thought was going pretty well to see how actually unhealthy our start was.  

We have granted each other space as we definitely need to think, reflect and let ourselves read the situation/our feelings more. Last night, we talked about it and took accountability and shared feelings that were scary to say and admit but were needed to be said. We decided instead of breaking up we both are going to put forth the effort and time and patience to try and care for ourselves more and in turn make it so that we rebuild and unlearn all the misconceptions that we had in our relationship by creating and actively writing down different solutions to our issues and putting in a plan to how to achieve it to give us another go but I wonder if even this is a way of being toxic. 

My worst nightmare of burdening someone else’s mental state bc of me came true and while it was on them for the lack and dishonest sense of communication within themselves and with me I just don’t want to make more toxic decisions and hurt us both in the end :,( 

Any feedback would be appreciated and I guess if anyone relates to this it would be nice to know I’m not alone in this position. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed that I let myself get to the point where I was hindering the growth of my partner and weighing their life down but I’m trying to accept that there’s nothing I can do about the past and just to take accountability and change however if anyone has suggestions on how not to feel so guilty/bad/ashamed please lmk !!",1625235134.0,False,5,4,lotus-pea,None,ocawyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ocawyx/trying_to_recover_while_in_a_new_relationship/
133,I've run my relationship to the ground,"this post might be a bit all over the place so tyia to anyone that reads it. and I will preface by saying this is worded as a venting post, but i am open to advice/criticism because I want to accept accountability here and hopefully fix things but please, please be gentle with wording as I'm super sensitive and don't want to spiral more.

my 6 month relationship just ended a few weeks ago. he ended it. however at the same time he ended things, I was already spiralling and very mentally unstable and suicidal. so he has kept in contact with me and tried to support me as much as he can. he even was willing to give me another chance, but I have been so unstable that I haven't been able to do what I told him I would do- truly we should be waiting a bit until I'm more stable before he gives me another chance (and we both acknowledged this a few nights ago). I learned shortly before I met him that I had BPD, and I thought that I recognized all my symptoms- well I was wrong. our whole relationship he has told me that he was unsure if we would work. and I always thought he meant that he wasn't sure he wanted me. since the very first time he said it, it's never left my head and caused my bpd to spiral even more with the thoughts of not being loved and why am I with him if he doesn't want me? ever since then it's only gotten worse, with me picking out every single behavior he does as proof he doesn't want/respect/love me. the fact that his love language didn't match mine made me feel like he didn't love me, and I'd try to share it with him, but I was sharing it over every little behavior. we were having ""conversations"" or ""tiffs"" weekly. it has been exhausting for both of us. I'm constantly splitting. I love him so much for who he is, but every time he does something that I view as proof he doesn't like me, I split, and I see it as completely black. I feel no love for him because I feel like he doesn't have it for me. I get so upset at him. every single time, I think ""this isn't going to work, we can't be together because if this is how he treats me then how can we be together long term? why should I be with someone that doesn't want me?"". I genuinely thought he was the reason we weren't thriving and I wasn't feeling loved.

the past few weeks, ive been looking more into BPD and resonating with SO much of it. almost every single thing. it explains almost all of my behaviors. I didn't realize what I was doing was splitting, and seeing it as black and white. when he does the tiniest thing, I literally can't feel the whole of the relationship and I focus solely on that one thing. 5 minutes after we fight, I'm totally in love with him again and fine, and then I get upset because he doesn't bounce back the same. well duh, of course he's not going to. he's a normal person that was just yelled at for his normal human actions. he's confused and hurt and probably wondering why I love him one second and hate him the next? I'm wondering the same thing. I always thought we just weren't compatible. but I'm realizing more that I'm the reason we're not doing well. I'm so fucking sensitive. I read last night the quote about how people with BPD are like burn victims, and I was like holy shit that's what it feels like.

I pre-imagine what I think his reactions or actions will be, and when it's not that, I get upset. why am I not able to let him be a fucking human being? why do I need him to act exactly how I expect him to act? and why do I have expectations in the first place? 

I don't want to lose him. he is the first person I've ever truly loved, not someone I've been infatuated with as my FP. I don't feel like I need him to survive, which is another first, I WANT him. I love and value our time together. when I'm not making him feel like a terrible fucking human being, things go so well. I want to stop treating him like this, but it's not intentional. im not intentionally degrading him. it's a deeply rooted feeling that he doesn't love me, and I bring it to his attention when he does things that remind me of it. he's never treated me bad. there is only one specific instance where I can remember him treating me ""poorly"", but in reality he was just so fucking done and defeated and didn't know what to say or do and just wanted to go to sleep. but from that specific night, my mental health and our relationship has just completely declined. he tried to break up with me the next day. we've had so many instances of almost breaking up. I was thinking it was because he didn't want me. but in reality it was because he couldn't handle me always pulling out the worst in him and ragging on him.

is there any hope of saving this? after everything we've been through, he's literally still here. he has stayed this whole time. even after we broke up, were still hanging out and texting every day. he clearly has love for me. he clearly cares. but why can't I see it? why can I only focus on the things he does ""wrong""? last week he brought me flowers and an activity book for us to do together, and then this weekend I got upset with him twice over literally nothing but in the moment it felt like everything. when it happens, the feelings are so intense and I there's nothing I can do to pull myself out of it. 


and on the flip side, I'm the most understanding and caring person to him. he has a lot of his own issues he's deal with himself, and I've supported him through all of it. I tell him frequently how much I care for him and I try to help with his grief and his mental health and try to tell him to give himself grace. how can I say that in one breath and then in the next be mad at him every other day for literally nothing? his mental health has deteriorated from this as well just from me flip flopping on him so frequently and calling him out on everything. 


how do I fix my thought process? any sane person would've blocked me a long time ago. he said last night that he sees I'm trying based on how much research I'm doing and me apologizing and taking the accountability, and I'm looking into therapists that specialize in PTSD or BPD, and other treatments. but I don't want to lose him. even though he deserves to not be in this rollercoaster anymore. he deserves to be loved, and I want to be the one to love him. he's willing to give me a chance, and I so badly don't want to fuck it up again. it's hard to say officially because of everything weve been through, but part of me feels like he could be the one. I have never been able to picture a future with someone before. I've never wanted kids with someone before. I've never wanted a life with someone. until I met him. about 3/4 months into dating, I felt like this might be it. I want him.

134,I need some advice.,"Hello everyone. It is going to be a long one. Also I apologize first for my poor English. 

My fiancé broke up with me 3 days ago after of 4years dating. He kicked me out of his house, so I pack the stuff I can grub and went back home with my mom and cats. He blocked me on everything so I can’t contact him at all. He is texting with my mom for the moving out stuff. 

On the day he broke up with me, I thought he was joking and left the house at 10pm during a big fight. I thought he’d come back as always, he happened to do that a few times, I mean I did few times too.
He never come back, I started to feel anxious. He used to say if he ever break up with me he’d kill himself, so I started to feel so anxious and worried. I went down to the town to look for him in a windy rainy night for an hour at 2am, I’m sure I looked so suspicious. I couldn’t find him, I went back home, spammed his message by texting & call. I was in a panic so I threat him by I’d kill myself, asking if he’s ok. He blocked me on everything at this point. I regret for how I acted. 
But still, I never gets updates if he’s ok. So I decided to call at his work. Called his step mom that I respect too. Which is not a good idea.. I did bunch of times enough that he’s work had to cut the phones line and caused so much problem. I feel so sick of myself that I put him this through. All I wanted to know is if he’s ok.

Days go by, my mom isn’t perfect at English so I was texting him for my mom about moving out, and the situation. (I think he knows that he’s talking to me by how I write down the words)
He mentioned that I was manipulated, abused him, depending on him too much in mentally and financially (that made him on debt), and so on.
Yes, one time I stub my thighs with a knives when he told me he cheated on me with two girls back in the day, I freaked out. But after that, he was royal to me this whole time, as I can see. But this feel of he might cheating on me again feels will not perfectly go away, even though I had the access to his phone anytime(he was nice enough to even tell me that I can log in to his sns), you know. Now I think of it maybe it was the symptoms of BPD since I had this feels of maybe he’s lying still.
Well he pretty much blamed on me on so many things in this relationship, of course there were few things that I went what?!?! But you know, I have my own side point of view so it’s just different I guess.

So I started to search about BPD in online. Back in the day I was on medicine for bipolar, and I found that it’s kind of similar. But the way most of the ppl write the traits of BPD were bit too official, so I couldn’t understand that much. I found this one article that explained really good, that matches everything for what I did. I completely realized, I woke up of this whole my world of why me? I hurt everytime thing.
I was abusing him mentally, physically, enough him to be completely shut off with me to heal himself.
In that moment, my love towards him, I felt that become colorful again. Yes, I’ve been felt dull in this relationship by so much stress at work, situation, etc.

The reason why this relationship were hard was me. I was causing the fight most of the time, when I was blaming him for it. You know, everything changed how I see things. Now I understand it, I started to take counseling for BPD.

In one of the conversation with my “mom” (it’s me texting since my mom isn’t good at English) he said: In my heart, there is a hope that she will get better and we can be happy one day.  I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.  Maybe that's still possible later on down the road. I'm hopeful.

And also, when I ask if he don’t love me anymore, he replies: My feelings are all mixed up, I don't know if I can answer that right now.
(My name) was the only girl I fell in love with so it's really hard.  But I began to resent her as the relationship went on.
My feelings are complicated so I still have love for her, but there is still no way I would be back together with her.

But again, he want me to be gone gone. I’m still confusing. I know he is fighting himself for life because I was such an toxic person.. I understand he’s struggle. I start to understand everything how he feels. You know, I want to be with him still that never change.
Well, he said he will contact/explain to me everything how he feel after I completely move out from his house and feel safe from me (About how he’s done with me)

Now, I’m in this hope that maybe he will give me a chance if he see the progress that I’m trying to get better about myself? But I read that these kind of act is called hovering.. which I don’t wanna believe. I genuinely love him so much. But after reading these thread of broken up with BPD threads scares me that maybe I’m in one of this diseases traits, which I don’t want to believe. 

I think he’s idea of separating is good for us regardless, but I still want to be in the relationship as a new start, not like in a previous one which were toxic.

When he going to discuss with me about this situation that he decided to make a move, I’m thinking maybe I can try give him an offer(?) that maybe he can give me a chance on as a new relationship. Like, I’ll take this counseling and the medicines for PMS(because pms might be triggering the BPD traits more.) also I’m going to get all re-check on my mental health, so I can find a better solution to help my self get better. (I don’t want to ever hurt him again.) and, we can stay live in a different places, and we will meet/talk whenever HE is able to, I won’t bother while I’m getting treatment, completely set the wall. and I will help him financially since I am the one of a reason that he’s on debt, because I can find better job in this town. But again, maybe this traits called hovering and maybe I should not try ever again so he won’t think I’m manipulating/convincing him to stay with me. 

Of course I want to be with him, I really love him a lot. But at the same time, maybe, as these threads saying I’m doing the traits called hovering and trying to get what I want out of him and that’s it, which I doubt but if it is, maybe I really need to leave him for good.

0,Do people with BPD treat the person they love the most the absolute worst out of everybody?,"lI have been in a relationship with this girl for 6 years. She is the love of my life but she has mistreated me in every sense possible since the start. I tried my best to be patient but I am losing my ability to. Everything you can do wrong to your significant other in a relationship she has done to me (cheating, violence, manipulation and everything in between). I forgive her every time because I know she is dealing with BPD. One day she loves me even tho theres “something missing” (even tho that something missing is unhealed trauma. She needs to fill that void for us to have a stronger connection) and then the next day she hates me and wants nothing to do with me. 

The story of her upbringing is the worst Ive ever heard from someone I personally know. Everybody in her life mistreats her. From her family to her “ex” who she still thinks of because he was a narcissist and used her/played her to get what he wanted. I learned the NPD/BPD tie is horrible. Her family allowed horrific things to happen to her that include sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. I am at the point where I’m about to give up.

We have a 4 year old son together so I’m trying to save our family. The hardest part is she treats literally everybody else in her life amazingly. Her friends, her fucked up family, coworkers. Literally everybody gets amazing treatment from her but she constantly mistreats me all the time. I don’t understand. I have been nothing but loving, loyal, forgiving, understanding, compassionate and everything in between. I love her and want her to get better. She is contemplating starting treatment and I have been trying to push her to go. I read somewhere people with BPD treat the person they love the most the absolute worst. Is that true? 

I know she loves me deep down. I know in her core of cores deep within her spirit she loves me and wants to be with me. I’m not delusional. But she keeps pushing me away and pulling me back and mistreating me and I’m tired. I don’t know what else I can do. Please help. I love her with all my heart she is the love of my life. I think she is scared of something real and she only wants to accept the love she thinks she deserves. I want to spend the rest of my life with her but I’m trying to bridge this gap.

1,I get triggered when somebody treats me like I am stupid,"So lately at work, I zone out and miss little things and ask questions which their answers I should know. My coworkers are starting to get sick of it, and they treat me like I am stupid or talk in a condescending manner, using hand gestures instead of telling me what they need to be done. I am very helpful and very friendly until someone gives me attitude or orders me to do something when they aren’t a manager, instead of asking politely. I have corrected them and asked me to talk to me in a polite manner but they get pissed and start shit talking me to other coworkers hence others start treating me like an idiot, using sarcasm, yelling at me or what not. I started to get angry and respond to them even worse than they responded to me. If anyone feels that way, how do I handle this better and stay calm in situations where somebody treats me like I am stupid? I am well-educated, and have great knowledge about a lot of things but not “street smart” per se.

2,Treating the anger with kindness,"I haven’t had a kind life. It has been physically fine, for the most part. I’ve never gone hungry and I’ve always had a roof over my head. But my parents are not kind.

They yelled at me a lot, pair that with the constant apologies and constant “we were in a bad place. We’re sorry.” It created this voice in my head that gets angry, that blames me for everything, that abuses me like they do. The BPD stems from the constant berating I’d get, and the voices that yelled at me stayed.

I live with my boyfriend now, been in a steady relationship with him for about five years. The voices haven’t stopped... but. I know how to make them when they do pop up.

I play pretend with myself. I talk to myself, and I act as the mother I wish I had. I tell myself that it’s okay that I’m experiencing what I’m experiencing. I tell her (me) that I don’t deserve to go through the pain that I go through. It works most of the time. I use this on a daily basis. I use this technique to prolong the reaction time to stuff that triggers me.

Being kind to myself has been the greatest gift that I could give myself. I’m not magically healed from BPD. I’m not cured. But I feel like I’m halfway to being a real human being.

I’m not a neurologist or a psychologist or anything. But I’m a firm believer in the brain’s plasticity. I’m gonna heal. I’m on my way to heal. My life has sucked a lot, and there are days when I feel like it’s too much... but there are more days to come. It’ll get better.

And as I tell this story, I am telling this mostly for myself. I don’t want to diminish anybody else’s experiences or pain. Wherever you are in your journey is yours to know, and you have a right to feel and acknowledge whatever you’re feeling.

I love her. I love the child who should’ve been unconditionally loved and cared for. I will keep taking care of her for as long as I can and able. I’ve still got such a long way to go to recover from BPD, but I have hope. I have hope it’ll get better.

3,I get triggered when somebody treats me like I am stupid,"So lately at work, I zone out and miss little things and ask questions which their answers I should know. My coworkers are starting to get sick of it, and they treat me like I am stupid or talk in a condescending manner, using hand gestures instead of telling me what they need to be done. I am very helpful and very friendly until someone gives me attitude or orders me to do something when they aren’t a manager, instead of asking politely. I have corrected them and asked me to talk to me in a polite manner but they get pissed and start shit talking me to other coworkers hence others start treating me like an idiot, using sarcasm, yelling at me or what not. I started to get angry and respond to them even worse than they responded to me. If anyone feels that way, how do I handle this better and stay calm in situations where somebody treats me like I am stupid? I am well-educated, and have great knowledge about a lot of things but not “street smart” per se.

7,Inner child work and reparenting might have saved me,"Hey guys, I’ve been going to therapy for about a year and a half now and early in my therapist started talking about inner child work. It has honestly been a game changer. I know not everyone has the time, money, support or other means for therapy so I wanted to share a tactic that has really helped me take care of myself when I wanted to do the opposite, or it can just be food for thought. 
A lot of people with BPD are prone to self-harm and self-deprecating habits that stem from our childhood due to childhood experiences, as well as survival tactics and defense mechanisms to protect ourselves from more trauma. My therapist told me to imagine myself as though I was my own child. Would I think think of my own child as worthless, not worthy or food or care? How would I take care of my child if they were sad? Would I treat them the same way I treat myself? Would I treat them the way my parents treated me and my feelings? Would I validate them? Would I rationalize things for them? I know this can be hard, especially for the less nurturing type of person, but we also all want to love and be loved. It is only a small part of the bigger picture, but when it comes to self-love and taking care of myself, it has played a huge role in my process of recovery. You cannot stop other people from abandoning you. That’s a harsh truth. But you do not have to abandon yourself out of feeling worthless or acts of self-loathing. I want to hear your thoughts and how you see it, or what your experience has been with reparenting yourself or even the lack thereof. 

Also, book recommendation: The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk, M.D. It’s a popular book, but for good reason. Bessel encapsulates trauma in a way that is easy to follow yet so profound and has brought a lot of pieces together. There are sensitive subjects in the book that he gently discusses in order to explain the manifestations of trauma. TW for sexual assault, violence, abuse, etc.

11,How To Avoid Splitting,"So basically this is what I've figured out as I go along on my healing journey. 

One of the reasons why we split is not only because it's a learned behavior but because we don't understand social cues. There are a variety of other reasons such as we don't understand what our needs are, we don't know how to manage expectations, what's normal and what's not. We don't know what our triggers are

This is what causes the absolutes. So in order to avoid splitting I would suggest:

1. Figuring out what causes you to split(mine is sleep deprivation, coffee, a trigger, yelling)

2. Learning social cues
3. Learning communication skills
4. Always ask for intent or clarification 
5. Ask lots of questions
6. Learn about your triggers
7. Tell other people how to treat you
8. Becoming boundaried 
9. Learning emotional regulation or self soothing
10. Ask what intent there is when unsure
11. Learn what your body feels like when your body is about to split

17,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ,"Does anyone else consistently feel like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?

Genuinely it’s this horrible phenomena I’ve experienced for almost my entire life. It feels like there are 2 different people inside of me.

I’m Dr. Jekyll in the ways that I’m calm, I can be social, I have dreams, I enjoy having friends, I care about my health, etc.

My issue lies in that I feel like I’m constantly keeping Mr. Hyde at bay. 

Mr. Hyde is not me. I don’t know who he is or where he comes from. Every now and again his horrible urge takes over me. It’s the worst thing ever. The worst part is I FEEL like I’m still in control but somehow the Mr. Hyde part of me takes over without me realizing and “he” wreaks absolute havoc on my life. I’m mean. I’m absolutely vicious. I say rude things to people I love. I treat the people I love with disrespect. I turn into someone who is not fun to be around. I become a person that I do not want to be around. 

The worst part is when I finally calm down and come to my senses I’m left with Mr. Hyde’s mess. I feel like I’m constantly looking back at my actions and doing damage control. 

I don’t want to do damage control anymore. I just want to stay in control.

I’ve finally moved out of my abusive household, i’m studying at university (it’s interfering with this significantly), i’ve been discovering myself, i’m making friends, i’m getting help.

For once i want to take care of myself and i don’t want it to be ruined with an obsession for some guy who does not care for or about me the same way

He cut it off romantically and sexually after I cried about feeling used. The last time I really spoke to him he was treating me pretty poorly, and he’s been ghosting me ever since. It’s very likely that this relationship is as good as dead

I’ve heard of people using rituals to mark the end of a favorite person relationship, and I think that would be really helpful for me right now. Though I’m not sure what to do. Does anyone here have any suggestions or experience for this specifically?

Becomes cold and switched off and completely emotionally unavailable when problems arise in our relationship. His limited on communication and thinks I'm the problem whenever his feelings shift if things are not going well. Outside of that he is really amazing. But I find it hard to give him space when a disagreement or argument happens. This triggers me big time when he will just go silent. I told him to tell me if he needs space but he never does. And he never apologizes. Not once in the relationship. I get I'm extremely hard to date with my bpd and I'm not a very good person ether. But I just feel like I'm not asking for much. When we are together he buys me flowers and $300 dates and spoils me so I really shouldn't complain because he does treat me well. But I feel I can't emotionally put up with it anymore. I don't feel I'm at fault for asking for apologies and better behavior towards me. He asked why I'm still with him if he treats me like he doesn't care. So I told him it's upto him now to choose if he wants to be with me or not. I told him he can apologize and work towards changing his behavior or he can leave. Because he always gaslights saying everything is my fault after a disagreement and never takes accountability. He has changed in quite afew ways but some old habits are still there with how he treats me. It's up to him now if he chooses to grow and stop this behavior or if he will leave. He is still processing it so idk when I'll hear a answer from him but I'll keep this thread update for anyone interested. I just don't know how to deal with everything right now.

I've been diagnosed with BPD for 10 years. I mentioned the ADHD thing to my psychiatrist but never really focused on those symptoms as I've always been more preoccupied with the BPD symptoms.

Now, I know that ADHD could be mistaken for BPD and the other way around, but I definitely have BPD, so let's not get into that.

**I wanna ask those of you who have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD if you're taking** (or were in the past) **any medication for it? How did it work with the medication prescribed for BPD** (yes, I know BPD can't be treated with medication alone, but again - let's not go there)**? Did it make your life easier on the BPD side of things too? And in general, did it make your life easier?**

I'm tired of having to work/study twice as hard as people around me to achieve the same results. Among other things. But this is my main issue atm.

If that makes any difference, I take Effexor (venlafaxine) and trazodone.

34,Botox as treatment for BPD,"I listen to the podcast Stuff You Should Know, and they did a mini episode called [Short Stuff: Botox Brain](https://podcastaddict.com/episode/156780876). They talk about Botox as a treatment for migraines, depression, anxiety, and BPD. I have been receiving Botox for migraines every 3 months for about 8 years. I didn't realize it till just now that I've lapsed and haven't had a treatment in almost a year. The past 8 or so months have been some of the worst mental health wise I've experienced in a decade. I left a message with my doctor so I can get treated again. I didn't think much of it since I wasn't getting a lot of migraines, but maybe the Botox was doing a lot for my BPD.

35,I need to know that blocking him was the right choice.,"I don't usually fully cut people off anymore because I don't think it's productive and its usually a rash decision on my part, but this time I'd been thinking about it for a long, long time, tried multiple attempts to communicate what I was feeling and why, and still the toxic behavior didn't change so I cut him off. He was my fp, (still is, honestly, I cannot get him out of my head and it's so exhausting,) and he has a habit of going hot and cold with me and making me feel crazy for simply wanting to spend time with him. He would go back and forth between flirting and being completely and utterly dismissive, acting like he wanted a relationship with me and then ignoring me for days on end, and I just recently found out he's had a girlfriend for about 4 months and during that time was flirting with me on and off. I felt so betrayed and angry I blocked him with no warning. 

The thing is that now I'm all of a sudden feeling horribly guilty that I cut him off. The anger has worn off and now I want to unblock him and apologize. I'm starting to think maybe it was just my fault that he treated me so poorly, and maybe I was the one treating him poorly after all and that I don't have a right to be upset with him. I feel like since during the periods where he would stop flirting with me I would casually talk to people on dating apps then I have no right to be upset that he got a girlfriend in the time we were talking. I don't know. I feel so ashamed of myself and so conflicted and this has been such a tough couple of weeks. 

He made me feel fucking nuts, man. I feel like that should be enough reason to cut him out of my life but at the same time I feel like it's not and I feel like such a jerk for doing this to him. I just want to know that cutting him off was the best choice for my sanity, I need some kind of reassurance that this wasn't an awful mistake and I'm not an awful person.

40,SMALL SUCCESS/ TRIUMPH: BPD CHARITY HAVE DECIDED TO USE THEIR WEBSITE AS A PLATFORM FOR MY RESEARCH PROJECT RAISING BPD AWARENESS (UNDERGRADUATE),"I wanted to share some amazing news with you all. I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago. I am now in my third year of therapy with two clinical psychologists: I have been through DBT, CBT, CBT-TF, Schema Therapy & mentalisation. It’s been a fight to stay alive so I can become a clinical psychologist to help treat those with personality disorders. I found out last night, after a lengthy internal review process, that a charity advocating for Borderline personality disorder awareness called “Emotions Matter” have decided to use their website as a platform to further spread my dissertation project. They have recently been on Fox 5 News too where they continuously fight for the stigmas we face. So often I’ve felt I’m not really making much of a difference, and whether my fight and passion is going anywhere, but this feels like such a great first step in primarily BPD awareness but also my career aspirations & the differences I want to make. You can find it in the “advocacy” section of their website over the next couple of days🥹🧡

41,Best DBT resources/ workbooks?,"Hello. I am a pwBPD and I have had very bad splitting recently which resulted in lashing out at my boyfriend and feeling impossibly terrible afterwards.
I know I am the problem, and I want to fix it because I feel so bad and resentful towards how I treat him, I sometimes think it would be better if he just let go of me. But even though he is visibly hurt, he said we can find a solution.
I am just afraid that if I don't do anything now this is just a preview of how our relationship will be always, if it continues.

Some quick context: we were in a long-distance until we moved in together last june, in a completely new country where neither of us know the language.
So I have seeked help, but since I cannot speak the language at an advanced level, there are not enough resources, meaning English-speaking therapists here. And where there are, in a different city and can do video-sessions, they are extremely expensive for me to be able to afford now.

Now, I know DBT is the main treatment for BPD, but since I have no way of going to therapy right now, I was wondering if there is any way to self-teach? 
Are there any DBT workbooks that I can order and work on as a start, and if so what would be the best?Or the best to start with?

43,I've run my relationship to the ground,"this post might be a bit all over the place so tyia to anyone that reads it. and I will preface by saying this is worded as a venting post, but i am open to advice/criticism because I want to accept accountability here and hopefully fix things but please, please be gentle with wording as I'm super sensitive and don't want to spiral more.

my 6 month relationship just ended a few weeks ago. he ended it. however at the same time he ended things, I was already spiralling and very mentally unstable and suicidal. so he has kept in contact with me and tried to support me as much as he can. he even was willing to give me another chance, but I have been so unstable that I haven't been able to do what I told him I would do- truly we should be waiting a bit until I'm more stable before he gives me another chance (and we both acknowledged this a few nights ago). I learned shortly before I met him that I had BPD, and I thought that I recognized all my symptoms- well I was wrong. our whole relationship he has told me that he was unsure if we would work. and I always thought he meant that he wasn't sure he wanted me. since the very first time he said it, it's never left my head and caused my bpd to spiral even more with the thoughts of not being loved and why am I with him if he doesn't want me? ever since then it's only gotten worse, with me picking out every single behavior he does as proof he doesn't want/respect/love me. the fact that his love language didn't match mine made me feel like he didn't love me, and I'd try to share it with him, but I was sharing it over every little behavior. we were having ""conversations"" or ""tiffs"" weekly. it has been exhausting for both of us. I'm constantly splitting. I love him so much for who he is, but every time he does something that I view as proof he doesn't like me, I split, and I see it as completely black. I feel no love for him because I feel like he doesn't have it for me. I get so upset at him. every single time, I think ""this isn't going to work, we can't be together because if this is how he treats me then how can we be together long term? why should I be with someone that doesn't want me?"". I genuinely thought he was the reason we weren't thriving and I wasn't feeling loved.

the past few weeks, ive been looking more into BPD and resonating with SO much of it. almost every single thing. it explains almost all of my behaviors. I didn't realize what I was doing was splitting, and seeing it as black and white. when he does the tiniest thing, I literally can't feel the whole of the relationship and I focus solely on that one thing. 5 minutes after we fight, I'm totally in love with him again and fine, and then I get upset because he doesn't bounce back the same. well duh, of course he's not going to. he's a normal person that was just yelled at for his normal human actions. he's confused and hurt and probably wondering why I love him one second and hate him the next? I'm wondering the same thing. I always thought we just weren't compatible. but I'm realizing more that I'm the reason we're not doing well. I'm so fucking sensitive. I read last night the quote about how people with BPD are like burn victims, and I was like holy shit that's what it feels like.

I pre-imagine what I think his reactions or actions will be, and when it's not that, I get upset. why am I not able to let him be a fucking human being? why do I need him to act exactly how I expect him to act? and why do I have expectations in the first place? 

I don't want to lose him. he is the first person I've ever truly loved, not someone I've been infatuated with as my FP. I don't feel like I need him to survive, which is another first, I WANT him. I love and value our time together. when I'm not making him feel like a terrible fucking human being, things go so well. I want to stop treating him like this, but it's not intentional. im not intentionally degrading him. it's a deeply rooted feeling that he doesn't love me, and I bring it to his attention when he does things that remind me of it. he's never treated me bad. there is only one specific instance where I can remember him treating me ""poorly"", but in reality he was just so fucking done and defeated and didn't know what to say or do and just wanted to go to sleep. but from that specific night, my mental health and our relationship has just completely declined. he tried to break up with me the next day. we've had so many instances of almost breaking up. I was thinking it was because he didn't want me. but in reality it was because he couldn't handle me always pulling out the worst in him and ragging on him.

is there any hope of saving this? after everything we've been through, he's literally still here. he has stayed this whole time. even after we broke up, were still hanging out and texting every day. he clearly has love for me. he clearly cares. but why can't I see it? why can I only focus on the things he does ""wrong""? last week he brought me flowers and an activity book for us to do together, and then this weekend I got upset with him twice over literally nothing but in the moment it felt like everything. when it happens, the feelings are so intense and I there's nothing I can do to pull myself out of it. 


and on the flip side, I'm the most understanding and caring person to him. he has a lot of his own issues he's deal with himself, and I've supported him through all of it. I tell him frequently how much I care for him and I try to help with his grief and his mental health and try to tell him to give himself grace. how can I say that in one breath and then in the next be mad at him every other day for literally nothing? his mental health has deteriorated from this as well just from me flip flopping on him so frequently and calling him out on everything. 


how do I fix my thought process? any sane person would've blocked me a long time ago. he said last night that he sees I'm trying based on how much research I'm doing and me apologizing and taking the accountability, and I'm looking into therapists that specialize in PTSD or BPD, and other treatments. but I don't want to lose him. even though he deserves to not be in this rollercoaster anymore. he deserves to be loved, and I want to be the one to love him. he's willing to give me a chance, and I so badly don't want to fuck it up again. it's hard to say officially because of everything weve been through, but part of me feels like he could be the one. I have never been able to picture a future with someone before. I've never wanted kids with someone before. I've never wanted a life with someone. until I met him. about 3/4 months into dating, I felt like this might be it. I want him.

44,Guilt ,"Hi you guys. I just found out one of my partner’s ex best friend dropped him and I can’t help but feel guilty. I even couldn’t sleep last night and am writing this as soon as I woke up. My partner and person A used to be best friends but as soon as we started dating he stopped hanging out with them. I feel I may have done something to cause it. I have never told my bf to not hang out with his friends (including person A) but once I did ask him genuinely if his friends treat him like that (roasting excessively) and really thought about it and said yes but that night specifically they went too far. We were at a party and I could tell his friends “roast” were upsetting and making him uncomfortable so I told him to communicate those feelings with them. He did and his ex best friend immediately said that I was putting words in my partners mouth and since then they weren’t talking much. In a span of a year, I learned that he ignores the friend group’s calls bc according to my partner, they drain him. His ex best friend ended up texting him after a long time saying she never knew he would disappear after getting in a relationship after how much she defended him and how she would never drop him (personally I think she was guilt tripping). My partner again didn’t give a solid reason for his disappearance but wished her the best and moved on. 


But I absolutely cannot stop feeling guilty. A part of me wants to over analyze this situation and say I manipulated him to dropping his friends. But a part of me thinks I just helped him realize how his friends really were. I also feel as if this is a situation where they invalidated his feelings and made it about themselves since person A did not let my partner explain his feelings about the roasting and he just doubled down and apologized. This ex best friend would even sub tweet my partner(while they followed each other) saying “imagine being happy after pushing away great friends all bc of insecure”

45,How to train yourself to not be afraid of being alone or needing someone,"Idk how to do it.

My anxiety is through the roof just thinking about being alone.

I’ve had a hard time surviving by myself. I am a gentle and soft person by nature. I’m not very confrontational. I avoid conflict because it’s stressful.

I have also struggled with holding jobs for a long time and have some work related trauma too.

I’m in an abusive and neglectful situationship with a misogynistic red pill sort of guy who hasn’t been honest from the beginning of our relationship.

He’s very disrespectful and disregards me and stonewalls me all the time. It’s not a relationship where we can have respectful communication because he just wants to be right all the time.

BPD or not, this guy clearly isn’t okay either and has his own dysfunction.

TL;DR I understand that my relationship is shit and I need to get out cuz it’s bad for me, even with BPD but how do I become strong enough to do that?

I’m terrified of being alone. There’s many layers to that fear, the main one being financial.

This economy is hard as hell. I wonder how many others are trapped in bad relationships because of financial reasons.

Like many of you, I also don’t have reliable family members or a supportive community to help me if this relationship goes bust.

I have BPD and CPSTD etc BECAUSE of my parents.

Siblings can’t even help themselves.

I feel TRAPPED. I don’t want to want anyone. I don’t want to NEED anyone.

I just want to make enough money and live an extremely simplistic life and if I DO find a partner I’d like someone with integrity and a desire to be a good partner.

I’m starting to become so disenchanted with relationships.

50,can't get a diagnosis!,"So I am usually not one to self-diagnose. I have been under psychiatric care since I was 13 (now 23) and have been diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, social phobia, OCD, anorexia, ADHD, and PTSD and I typically defer to my doctors/therapists. But it's pretty fucking obvious to me that there is something bigger going on here... how would a person have 7 unrelated mental illnesses?! I have been on a cocktail of psychiatric medications since age 13, tried every type of therapy that I could and I still feel like I'm grasping at straws and trying to treat things that are just symptoms of a larger problem.

I have done A LOT of research (I'm talking hours upon hours) and am reasonably confident that I have Quiet BPD. I think the reason that no practitioner has caught onto it is because I internalize everything and I only lash out at myself. I don't really show any external signs of having BPD, however I have 8/9 BPD characteristics in the DSM (for context, diagnosis is appropriate with 5/9 symptoms). 

When I brought this up with my psychiatrist, she said she doesn't really see typical BPD traits in me (which I think is because I have quiet subtype and it's highly internal) and that she is hesitant to diagnose BPD because of the stigma it carries... okay, but I am confident that I meet the diagnosis standards under the DSM and need to be treated for BPD instead of the other seven issues, as the BPD & PTSD are no doubt what is causing everything else. 

I really don't want to self diagnose. But I have brought this up with multiple therapists, psychiatrists, etc. and my ED recovery coach is the only one to see the truth in what I'm saying. I *know* something deeper is going on. I have felt this way my whole life and only when reading about quiet BPD was I able to understand the chronic emptiness that has caused all of the other issues.

55,THERAPY SCAM ALERT!! BWRT (BrainWorking Recursive Therapy) - Terence Watts,"This is a super important post so pls don’t delete mods! I’m trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help aren’t lied to. 

Terence Watts’s “BrainWorking Recursive Therapy” or, “BWRT” is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a “full proof” solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!!

Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, it’s giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes. 

I was so amazed at first, and truly believed I’d finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be true… so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it. 

The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesn’t want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldn’t be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I don’t respond or you don’t see this post anymore… well I guess you know why. 

Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproduct… but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions. 


Here are some links about BWRT to get you started:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ts8qya/does_anyone_have_experience_with_bwrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Watts gets his inspiration from [Benjamin Libet](https://www.bwrtuk.co.uk/bwrt/), whose theory about conscious and unconscious behaviour forms the basis of his theory. He talks about it a lot on his website and in his youtube videos. 


Also, I found some interesting posts about Charles Linden - another “expert” who displays similar behaviours of secrecy, denial and harassment to Terence Watts:

(FYI: I still need to do some more research on this myself, so I am not claiming to be an expert on this matter.)

EDIT: another very interesting link… [the Advertising Standards Agency says he breached the “UK code of non-broadcast advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.”](https://www.ns-healthcare.com/news/terence-watts/)

“The Terence Watts BWRT Institute was found guilty of claiming it could treat and/or diagnose several serious health problems including anxiety, infertility and diabetes without substantiating such claims.

In its findings, the ASA also concluded that an advertisement on the website discouraged people from seeking essential treatment and necessary medical supervision for conditions, including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and thyroid problems.

The Advertising Standards Agency told Terence Watts the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding it should not claim or imply that BWRT can be used to treat conditions without demonstrating sufficient evidence.

The ASA also said the website should not reference conditions for which medical supervision is necessary when addressing those seeking treatment in the future.”

56,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

Its insane to realize how much progress I’ve made to become who I am today. There are still many bumps on the road but i’m grateful that i can finally be more hopeful and positive abt the future.  I still struggle sometimes but its not as offen anymore and im genuinely thankful.

To those who are struggling, im sending you my prayers and a lot of huggies. Things will get better. Please put yourself first and treat yourself kindly. Better days are coming. Even when it doesnt feel like so, trust the progress. Do things that make you happy even when its deemed as unproductive (like watching anime all day). Its fine to be unproductive sometimes as long as it brings you comfort. Hang in there and trust in yourself, you will get through this.

59,I hate being self-aware,"As the title says, I hate being self-aware. I don’t know exactly when or why it happened, but it’s like I came into consciousness a second time. Realizing that I’d actually been a horrible person to the people that I loved and loved me. 

It’s been 4 1/2 years now, and every moment of it has been misery. The guilt, the shame, the realization that I have this horrible thing that I never even asked for. That I never experience GENUINE happiness. That no one will love me as much as I love them. There will always be an uneven dynamic in my relationships. That people can read up on BPD all they want, but unless they have it, they won’t understand. 

Every single day is a battle. Within myself. I am conscious of how my disorder affects me; my thoughts, my emotions, my reactions, my physical body. I am my own fascinatingly sad science observation. 

I have to decipher and process what I’m feeling and why, all. the. time. 

I am exhausted, I am sad, I am angry, I am empty. It always feels so hopeless and helpless. The work is so hard. It feels like one step forward, 10 steps back. I just wish I wasn’t like this.

The mood swings, the guilt, the shame, the rage, the physical pain, the emotional pain that feels worse than death, the mania, the absolute apathy, the knowledge that I can manipulate anyone to get what I want and be incredibly selfish, knowing that I did that in the past is just horrendous. 

I do feel bad for my partner. We’ve had rough patches in the past where he’d sought out other attention because I guess I was too emotional. He has become everything I wanted and needed in the beginning. We were apart for around 7 months? I don’t know. We came back together, he moved, and he’s not sure of the future.

And I get it! I simply would not want to put up with me and my own self-torture. 

The fact being that relationships make the bpd worse is horrible because I don’t want to be alone, I want to be loved, I want to love someone, I want to feel safe and wanted. 

I’m even having to go low contact with my mom because she’s incredibly narcissistic and it’s exacerbating the already rough situation I’m in. Getting out of the military after 10 years, moving to a place I hate because of them, working a job that takes up all of my time and I hate, leaving all of my friends behind, trying to accept the fact that my entire adult life as I knew it is over, my partner having to leave (he’s also military), and being unsure of us. 

I can’t deal with it all. And the fact that I have to minimize contact with my family because of how they choose to treat me is even harder because I really am *alone* in this. 

I just hate it. I would love to go back to being ignorant and delusional, unaware of any of this. 

And on here, in another subreddit, I see people talking about their pwBPD like we’re all just some sort of selfish, horrible monsters. It honestly makes me never want to attempt to get close to anyone and confide in them about this because there is such contempt held toward us by people everywhere, thanks to the internet.

60,Feeling pretty confused/lost,"Hey everyone!

I’m trying to get some insight for my situation- I feel like romantic relationships ending or big fights really do a number on me in a way that brings my symptoms of BPD to light unlike any other anymore. Here’s some context for my current situation and maybe if you have any insight and or advice/thoughts, you can share? 

I’ve been dating a guy for a year. I think it’s pretty clear that we are just such different people in some ways, especially in the beginning. To add to this, we come from different cultures (I’m from the states and he’s from France). He’s in therapy, and I would be if it were more accessible to me at this time. We both work really hard to empathize with each other and be incredibly open. He’s the best partner I’ve ever had except for a few minor details. In the first few months of our relationship, I saw that he had Tinder on his phone (I wasn’t snooping, it was there on the screen when he was showing me something). I tried to be super calm about it and I broke up with him and left immediately. We stayed in contact for the following months but I was pretty set on being over it (something new for me at the time). Eventually, he won me over again and I was willing to come back because I had seen that he wasn’t messaging anyone and that he really was just swiping for validation as he claimed. It took about 3-4 months to recover from that. Fast forward to this past Valentine’s Day. Everything has been amazing, we’ve been great, I had trusted him. In a very similar way to seeing Tinder, I saw that he had many messages from women in his DM’s. He let me look at them, and the only ones he had messaged were only fans models where he paid for content - no emotional or sexual conversation exchanged. This was something i at first thought I could deal with even though it had been an explicit boundary that had been crossed. I’m generally a pretty open person about these things but things but this issue here had been that he lied to me again. 

I’ve been noticing a lot of “i love you, go away” from myself and my reaction. I’m fine and then I’m enraged - because the situation and my feelings are so nuanced. I don’t want to teach someone that this is how they can treat me even if it is a fairly evident act of self sabotage on his part. I don’t feel his actions have anything to do with me and yet I’m so, so infuriated. I want to leave but I want to stay. I want to be close and I want him to show me he’s really sorry. I know my best course of action is probably to leave and hold my ground but I think other bpd people, regardless of recovery might know how this feels. I don’t want to be emotionally violent and draining and yet this situation makes me feel so triggered.

65,Resurgence of Symptoms,"TL;DR I need advice on how to handle intense feelings regarding my FP in a healthy way, and without telling him he's my FP.

&#x200B;

So before the pandemic I was in ""remission"" for a few years. Over the pandemic so much of my stuff has come back.

The thing that made me realize things have gotten bad is that I have an FP again. This hasn't happened in a decade. The pandemic has really fucked my mental health and I'm struggling. Lost my home, several partners (I'm polyam), experienced unprecedented abuse from family, have no job, am practically disabled by my symptoms. Shit's bad y'all.

Any time I don't spend with my FP makes me feel worse and worse. Inbetween each quality time date we spend together my mood gets worse and worse before the date, then the cycle repeats. I can't stop thinking about him. When I'm too tired or already in a bad mood I can't use coping skills and will end up staying awake and canceling plans on the off chance that he'll want to spend time together.

This is so unhealthy. I know it is. I tried doing what I would have when in ""remission."" I told him one of my symptoms was really bad and that I needed more quality time, more support. It worked for a few days, but he has his own life and responsibilities and I can't have him with me constantly. He's putting effort in. It's not enough for my symptoms to abate and I doubt any amount would be.

I need advice on how to handle this without telling him he's my FP. I personally feel that that's not something I should share because it puts the onus on him rather than on me to treat my symptoms. I'm trying to practice DBT skills and trying to find a therapist, but it's been really, really difficult with couch surfing and unable to work and my functionality disappearing.",1671853614.0,False,5,5,Bubbly_Dragonfruit41,None,zu0x6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/zu0x6t/resurgence_of_symptoms/

This gave me a relief as I thought me having BPD in the wrong gender made things worse (I know, that sounds stupid). I have never met a male with BPD myself, but I would like to ask these questions to the guys here. 

\- How do you deal with hiding your emotions in public/group settings when you get triggered? Men have stigma to show any extreme emotions after all, so I bet its more difficult than it is for women. 

\- Are you on any medication to treat BPD?

\- How do you deal with being alone for too long? Do you try to talk to absolutely anyone you can reach to avoid the feeling of being invisible? I know I do, it is very common for me to lose touch with reality and feel like Im vanishing from existence if I stay alone for more than a day.

68,Is it healthy or is it another FP?,"My friend and I both have quiet BPD, though we are both in therapy and he's on medication while I'm finally getting started into looking for medication. 

Recently I've been finding myself wanting to romantically take him on dates, hold hands etc, do all the things a romantic couple would do but my only fear is that, because my mental health hasn't been the best recently (Due to a really toxic situation I had to escape from with an ex friend), I'm worried that it's just another FP attachment forming. 

I want more than anything to treat him well, and give him the healthiest love that ik he deserves, especially because he's been mistreated in the past, but I'm so scared that this is only going to become another unhealthy attachment and with HIM having bpd, i'm worried that i'm going to make it worse. 

So far all our things have been reciprocated (Wanting to hang out more, our plans for cosplaying with one another, being able to rely on one another and check in with one another emotionally) so I've just been really careful and allowing myself to slowly take in all the good he's brought into my life, rather than taking more and more and more because I'm worried he'll leave, and leaving him with nothing.

69,What's your opinion on my realization? ,"I'm posting this to a few bpd communities to try to reach more people with different perspectives. If you're active in other communities and have seen this post recently I apologize!

I'm a good person. I know that. I love people with my whole heart. But my behaviors (or at least motivation behind behaviors) have not always shown that, even if they were disguised as ""good"". Something that has helped me A LOT lately is thinking ""am I doing this act to help someone, or to make myself look good."" The statement varies slightly according to the situation of course, but honestly it has helped stop many attention seeking behaviors. This has helped me modify and adjust how I react to situations. 

For example, I daydream every night before bed about me or characters from a show being either a victim or a hero. One or the other (thanks black and white thinking). Basically I write fanfiction in my head. It usually contains dark subjects like SA, abuse, death, etc. When I first started giving myself time to daydream before bed I noticed a decrease in attention seeking behaviors in real life, however as the years went on I started to convince myself that those things I was purposely dreaming of were ok to do irl if given the possibility. Anyway what caused this revelation is that my favorite resident at a SNF I work for is in the hospital with an unclear fate. In my daydream time about a week ago I imagined different scenarios and played through them. Doing this led to me really thinking about why I do things. One of the scenarios I had to run through of course was ""what happens if the resident passes."" So I imagined myself at her funeral and her family member asked if anyone else wanted to speak. So I did. But as I was dreaming about what I would say ""...when you see someone everyday for two and a half years you get to love them. She watched me grow up and gave me some of the best advice one could ask for..."" I realized I was thinking about the family feeling sorry for me. I saw her daughter looking at me thinking ""oh that poor person loved my mom so much, they must be hurting a lot."" This made me snap open my eyes and look at the ceiling. I realized i was imagining my favorite resident's funeral (i usually try to picture future scenarios in my daydreaming time to prepare because it soothes anxiety, i don't plan to stop fully but at least be more conscious of my actions to those scenarios in my dreams) and picturing her FAMILY, feeling sorry for ME. 

Ever since I had that dream about a week ago it has completely changed my perspective of how I go about things and I hope I keep this in mind. Humans are inherently selfish. Every action we do have some form of self satisfaction to it. Even something as simple as tying your shoe laces so you don’t fall, is motivated by a level of selfishness. That is normal. However, I want to make sure I do things for the right reasons even if the outcome of the deed wouldn't change. If I volunteer l to help someone with a task is it because there are other people in the room watching me and I want to look good? Is it because I want this person to like me and think I'm a good person? Or, is it because humans deserve help and kindness and if I have the (mental, physical, financial) capacity to do so I WANT to help someone just to make their lives easier. 

Like I stated earlier, it is very human to have to think of yourself in others shoes to be empathetic in most situations, I mean that's what the golden rule is (for example, I don't want to see people in pain because I know what pain feels like, therefore I do my best to prevent and reduce pain in others)! But in my experience people with bpd tend to have a little extra motivation: how we are perceived to others as ""good"" to prevent abandonment, or for validation/attention seeking that we feel we deserve and honestly sometimes NEED. As basic as it sounds I'm trying to be more aware of my motivation behind my actions. Who new it would take 7 years of CBT and 1 year of DBT to get to this point. I feel kind of silly honestly.

 I am a self aware person, however that often made my attention seeking behaviors worse. This made my behaviors worse because I would rationalize them as ""well I'm communicating to people what my needs are, therefore if they don't react appropriately they are at fault. If I'm genuinely suicidal and I let my friends know then they should shower me with love and concern. Even if I've been genuinely suicidal over many 'little' things that they now think it's a boy who cried wolf situation. I've identified my feelings (which really are real, just because they seem dramatic doesn't mean im not feeling them, so me it's so intense and real, to them it's purely for attention) and communicated so I must be doing things right."" Now I realize that crying to my coworkers while they are trying to work is not acceptable because they are acquaintances and we are at work. Another thing that has caused me to have trouble identifying what is or isn't okay is understanding that just because I would drop everything to comfort a random coworker/acquaintance at work does not mean everyone else is comfortable, has the emotional capacity, feels safe, or feels motivated, to do the same. In my mind everyone takes the golden rule (treat others the way you want to be treated) so literally. It's why I'm seen as clingy and can't often tell the difference between romantic, platonic, acquaintance relationships. Because I dont care if we met a week ago if I like you and you seem to like my you're my friend in my mind and I got your back. 

So yeah I just wanted to share/rant lol. Do you guys, gals, and nonbinary pals have any recommendations for how to deal with needing to be listened to or almost ""coddled"" sometimes?

70,I love you and now you’re blocked!,"Finally told the guy that I love him and it wasn’t  Fair how  he was treating me. He was in and out of my life for 6 years so far. He tells me to move on and than he’s back. We talk for 2 weeks and boom gone again throughout the 6 years. There hasn’t been one year we haven’t spoken . Today after him telling me he wants to move on again, I let him have the facts. Had my BDP taken over at points throughout  the past 6 years ;100 percent yes! Has my behaviour been dramatic towards him and not kinda at points;100 percent yes. Has his behaviour been 100 percent amazing towards me of course not. But if he didn’t have feelings towards me he wouldn’t keep replying at points. 

Anywho this was our conversation tonight. And after that message I blocked him. 
 

Person: hey (my name), I think I’m going to move on. Thanks though. 

Me: hey, we have been trying to move on for 6 years. Let’s be honest we can’t.maybe we should go with the flow? 

Me: I love you and unfortunately you coming back in and out of my life is not fair. You are always going to have the upper hand, as I want you in my life. If you want to be friends, fine. If you want to move on, move on but don’t talk to me. I’m going to reach out because I’m in love with you and want you. People do silly things when they are in love and I’m in love with you. I want to be in your life, want a relationship with you etc but I know you don’t want it and I have to respect it.

I believe he loves me without him having to say it because the stuff he has done for me and the way his always there for me even at my worst says more then any relationship has in my past. But I think it's aniexity. His fearful to say it as it's a big step for him.

72,Fear of engulfment,"In addition to fearing abandonment, I am also frightened by the idea of engulfment. This is a trait of BPD but it doesn't seem to be discussed as often or as widely known.
 Being abandoned is incredibly painful but feeling engulfed or suffocated is unbearable and painful in its own way.  This really into play when I feel like someone is getting too dependent on me or needy. I will try to push them away because I see myself becoming enmeshed with them and them swallowing me whole. I feel drenched by the emotions of others a lot because my emotional development is stunted as hell and I don't really know how to love ""normally."" Even as a child, there were many people who treated me with what was probably genuine love and interest and I just... wasn't here for that. 

The fear of abandonment is never not lurking though and funnily enough, I think it drives this in a way. I always feel that people don't love me for anything more than what I can do for them and how I can grant their wishes, because why would they? My character and value as a person alone is not enough. What if I begin to get used to them and love them too much, and they dissappear? This is definitely exaggerated by my comorbid PTSD too among other things. Why are you showing me so much love and dependency, there's no way you don't have an agenda of some sort with that attitude. No trust. No faith. 

I've damaged several relationships due to this. A good portion of them involving others with BPD, coincidentally. You can probably guess how that went down.

73,"I am sick, evil, and twisted, and I am so fucking done with myself. (TW!)","Jealousy, resentment, bitterness, anger, hatred. I am possessed by all of it and it is slowly driving me to insanity. I can slowly feel my self-destructive tendencies creep up again, the kind that leads to suicide attempts.

My main issue here is PARANOIA. I can't distinguish between reality and fantasy anymore. I have one, whom I am texting regularly. We haven't chatted since the day before New Year's Eve. I feel manipulated and used, and if I bring it up, the person will completely deny it, and I won't be able to be right, because my thought process is so distorted. So, the question is: Is it true? I mean, the person is regularly active, seems alright, yet hasn't texted me. It feels like I am trapped in a huge manipulation game in the palm of the person's hand. What I am suspecting is, that person enjoys controlling me like Pavlovian's dog, completely takes advantage of the fact that I have BPD, and ghosts me for pure enjoyment. If I don't text first, they are not going to, that's what I am feeling is going through this person's head. I want people to treat me better.

Maybe I am insane and crazy, but I feel so fucking resentful, angry and vengeful (excuse my language). I want to take revenge by ghosting the person back, but I can't because they are controlling my mind 24/7. But I am not going to.

78,What Is the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD?," Mental Disorders (DSM).

There's no biologically based test to definitively diagnose borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, mental health professionals often use screening instruments such as the MSI-BPD to help identify the likelihood of BPD and the need for further evaluation and treatment.

Scoring of the MSI-BPD

Each item is rated as a ""1"" if it is present and a ""0"" if it is absent, and items are totaled for possible scores from 0 to 10. A score of 7 is considered a valid diagnostic cutoff, meaning that a score of 7 or higher indicates that you likely meet the criteria for a BPD diagnosis.2

The first eight items of the MSI-BPD represent the first eight DSM-IV/5 diagnostic criteria for BPD, while the last two items assess the final DSM-IV/5 criterion, i.e., **paranoia/dissociation.**

## Uses for the MSI-BPD

Clinicians use the MSI-BPD to diagnose BPD, sometimes in conjunction with other screening tools. Research suggests the MSI-BPD is helpful in detecting BPD in the general population,3 but more studies are needed.

The MSI-BPD test has been shown to be very effective in detecting possible BPD in people who are seeking or have a history of treatment for mental health problems.

## Psychometric Properties

The MSI-BPD has demonstrated valid, reliable psychometric properties. It has adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. It has also demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for detecting borderline personality disorder when a score of 7 is used as a diagnostic cutoff.

[**Coping With Borderline Personality Disorder**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095SHGB9N) 

## Other Screening Tools

The MSI-BPD is only one of several that clinicians typically use to diagnose BPD. These include the following.  


Structured Clinical Interview

This official clinical interview of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is an update of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) but is very similar.4 Your mental health professional may use this screening tool to help determine your diagnosis by asking you questions directly related to the criteria for BPD that are listed in the DSM-5.

This screening instrument also has an optional self-reporting questionnaire with 108 questions, but not all clinicians who choose the SCID-5-PD use this. 

Causes of Borderline Personality Disorder

PDQ-4

The Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire, 4th Edition (PDQ-4) screening test consists of 99 true-or-false questions that can help screen for various personality disorders, including BPD.5

Zanarini Rating Scale

The Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD), also developed by Dr. Zanarini, is used for patients who have already been diagnosed with BPD to test for changes over time.1

Which Tool Is Best?

A recent study comparing correlations, sensitivity, and specificity among the MSI-BPD, PDQ-4, and SCID-II in adolescents and young adults showed they were equally effective in predicting a BPD diagnosis.6 On the other hand, another study concluded that the PDQ-4 ""should not be used in clinical practice as a screening instrument for PD assessment.""7

## Impact of BPD Screening

BPD is challenging to diagnose and treat because it's so often misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder and other conditions. Further complicating the issue is that BPD often exists with comorbidities, including bipolar disorder, and poses a significant risk of suicide.8 That makes accurate screening tools such as the MSI-BPD particularly important.  


Once BPD is diagnosed, the clinician can develop a treatment plan to address it. This might include such targeted approaches as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), which has been shown to be effective for people with BPD.8  


## Potential Pitfalls of the MSI-BPD

Tests such as the MSI-BPD provide a picture of person's mental status only at a particular point in time. Astute clinicians additionally take into account the person's patterns of behavior over time.9

&#x200B;

BPD is a particularly difficult disorder to diagnose and treat. Research indicates that the MSI-BPD is a valuable tool in this effort, however, and takes very little time to complete. Based on the results, a clinician can then help you address BPD's challenges and learn healthy ways to cope with and regulate your emotional states and responses.",1647850548.0,False,3,1,redditerX75,None,tj6rq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/tj6rq5/what_is_the_mclean_screening_instrument_for_bpd/

“You don’t deserve to beat yourself up like this. You deserve better.”

“Katy (not my real name) keeps thinking about Riley (not their real name) even though Riley treated her like trash.”

Felt like I was looking in the mirror. Regarding the mans first relationship in the book, he talked about how he loved this girl (kind of) but treated her terribly. Lied, stole, manipulated and abused her. However, people with BPD have their “FP”, their love, the only person they can ever imagine being with. Basically love bomb them, clingy, co-dependent, ect. So why was this man so mean? 

I looked back at my first relationship, and second person I had slept with. I was 20, and I was awful to her. Lied, stole, manipulated, toxic jealousy, just overall mean. Why would I do this to the first girl that ever liked me? Growing up neglected and never wanted and one beautiful girl wants me and I was terrible. That was 4 years of hell for the both of us but mainly her. For context, We found out we were having a kid 3 months into our relationship, she’ll be 7 soon. I now spend lots of time with my daughter and kiss the ground my baby mama walks on cause of the immense amount of guilt that i still feel years later. When she left I felt like I was losing everything, but in reality I was just losing control and I hated it.

86,Trigger warning •Abuse • Baby loss • trauma ,"I’m sorry for the long post but I’m genuinely so lost and looking for some advice. Just a little back ground of myself before I go into depth of the current problems. So I got pregnant at 15 had my kid at 16. Then got pregnant again at 17 only during the 2nd pregnancy it wasn’t like the first at all. My ex partner (both kids dad) assaulted me ways nobody should ever be treated which ended up in me giving birth to a stillborn baby at 17 weeks pregnant cause by his actions. This was in April 2016. I’ve still not healed. I’m not sure if I ever will at this point. The build up to April every year eats away at me like there’s no tomorrow. 

Which brings me to today. My First born is now 9 and like most 9 year olds they start answering back ect ect but when they are being really cheeky ext I see my ex partners face in there’s and it fkin terrifies me. I need to keep reminding myself that my kid didn’t play a part in the trauma that he has caused me but it’s so hard to not see his evil eyes like the day I lost my son. I managed to get her to school today not crying (proud of myself lol) then got home I was having a bad day due to other small inconveniences that had happened. I couldn’t find my earphones in my room i instantly went into panic because i already knew that the only way to calm down was to get my earphones and go a walk. Because I couldn’t find my earphones I then misplaced my phone which lead to more panic. All I wanted to do was escape listen to music and get fresh air. I then instantly felt trapped in my bedroom like I couldn’t find anything everything was going wrong (my bedroom is very small you need to walk like a crab to get round the room) I have no fucking idea what happened but I felt like it was April 2016 all over again stuck in my ex partners kitchen begging him to stop hurting me and I literally felt so paralysed I didn’t know what to do to escape it. (This has NEVER happened before) I grabbed my hair pulling it which released the pressure to my head. I then found other earphones and I finally managed to escape the bedroom. I’ve never felt to scared and trapped in my full life.

But i know i do. I feel it under the surface, just waiting to come out in a new relationship.

88,Need advice for healthy connection cutting,"I've come a LONG way with my BPD.   I've had a healthy relationship with a group of people for two years and ongoing now!  And now you're wondering what the titles for.

&#x200B;

Before I went to therapy, I found a group of people who helped support me after I had a falling out with an abusive friendgroup.  

They were incredibly healing for me, for a time.  I have done nothing to hurt them, and the majority of conflicts were things we talked over.

&#x200B;

I say majority, for a reason.  Because they...started to become cold at one point, started to revoke a lot of comfort they offered me, and stopped wanting to tell me about themselves.  I've recently discovered they've destroyed some things we've made together when I wasn't looking, to. 

And i've found out they treated one of my current healthy friends like absolute shit, and talking to them, i've discovered these people aren't nearly as healthy as they claim to be. 

&#x200B;

I do not think they're healthy for me, and the best option would just...be to cut them out. 

&#x200B;

But I have my pains.

They've changed my life, they bought me birthday presents, they've helped me more times than I can count, and there's still a lot of things I love, and like about them.  And cutting is so....painful.  I'm crying even thinking about it. 

The easiest thing for me to do is to ghost them, but the guilt of it would haunt me forever.   I think the best way to do this would be to thank them for everything, apologize I couldn't make everything up back, but tell them, ultimately...

It's just not healthy for me anymore.  And I want to focus on my health and recovery, I want to tell them to focus on theirs to (one of the them suffers from extreme anxiety with abandonment issues). 

&#x200B;

It's painful, I don't even know how to BEGIN processing how to...recover from that, all over again, or even begin to work up my courage.

I feel like I'm holding him back even more and only wasting his time. He also has a lot of PTSD from the way I have treated him. I love him so much, but I do feel like I've been a monster to him.

I go weeks not talking to anyone to the point where being outside actually feels weird… I can’t get outta bed anymore.. my friends ghosted me practically and at this point it’s been months not having friends when I used to be with them everyday in the summer so it’s like I’m tryna heal my issues but at the same time are these really issues? Or are everybody treating me bad. My sister id talk to on the phone for hours hasn’t called in weeks and ignores my calls..

91,Triggered by being minimized,"I just realized today that my biggest trigger is being minimized/invalidated. When somebody pushes these buttons I get incredibly angry and I sometimes can’t control myself. This can lead to me latching on to a problem/situation with a person and not be able to let go. 

I realized this because I was having to interact with someone at work who kept saying things to me that made me feel minimized. It also felt like he was not acknowledging his mistakes or the work I had done to fix said mistakes. I blew up at him because I felt like he was not listening to me and minimizing what I was saying. For example, I was upset that he was contacting me/expecting me to fix his mistakes on my days off so I told him that that was inappropriate to do. His reaction was “I understand that you don’t like being contacted on your days off” this felt minimizing to me because it made it seem like I was the one asking for special treatment when in reality he was expecting me to do work without compensation. In my mind it doesn’t matter what I think, my coworker having that expectation is inappropriate full stop. 

I got in a little bit of trouble with one of our bosses for doing that and had to have a sit down conversation where I was told that I should have handled it better and used a nicer tone of voice. I tried using a nicer tone of voice and tried to talked to about five other people before I blew up at this guy and nobody was listening or fixing the problems. The manager did reassure me that my anger was reasonable and the complaints I brought forth were fair. 

It’s just embarrassing to be told that your’e too much by people who push you bit and bit past your anger point. I don’t like exploding but I don’t know how else to be heard. 

I guess my questions are:
- Now that I know being minimized/not listened to/invaladated is a trigger, how do I go about managing it while also not being a complete push over? 

- How do I let things go? I feel like a dog in attack mode who is latched onto a bite and can’t unhook my jaw but everyone is just treating this like it’s an easy simple choice.  

- Has anyone else struggled with this? I know that my family spent a lot of time invalidating me and they still continue to do it so I think I might get triggered worse in the future.",1702677852.0,False,2,0,310a101,None,18jbkt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18jbkt0/triggered_by_being_minimized/
92,This is me trying to turn things around,"Recently I saw a psychologist and sadly, after passing multiple written tests, she told me that she couldn't work with me because she is not trained to treat BPD patients. 

A couple of years ago, I had received the diagnosis but I didn't really believe it because I felt it had been a hasty diagnosis because of my suicide attempts. No one explained to me what it meant to be BPD so I turned to internet. And oh boy, does internet have a lot of nasty things to say about BPD. I felt like I had been given a diagnosis basically saying that I was a monster. So, obviously, I rejected it because in life, I like to think of myself as a decent person. 

So, yeah, when the psychologist said that I do have BPD, dor the first time it stuck. It stuck because I felt that she had done thourough evaluation. So, now I accept that this is a part of who I am. I've been wanting turn things around. Get healthy, sleep better, become a more balanced me so that I can finally stop being a victim of my emotions. I've been reading books about BPD, about people who have learned to cope with it. And it is really inspiring. I've learned that being BPD is not just bad. There are many perks! We are very empathic, we can live emotions to the fullest, we can be moved by beautiful things such as music and art. We are beautiful people too, but we just need to take extra care of our mental and physical health. 

For the first time in a long time, I'm not trying to change my core.. for the first time, I'm trying to embrace who I am and I'm trying to be the best version of me that I can be.

93,Saying goodbye to CPN,"Hi all. I'm looking for advice and insight...
I've been having treatment for BPD for 4 years now. I've had different treatment forms and with different professionals for each, though I've consistently always alongside this had my designated Community Psychiatric Nurse. She is the first professional I came into contact with from the beginning, was the one to diagnose and treat me for BPD (her speciality area) and the first person I opened up to about everything; my past, my childhood, my raw inner self, my perceived 'worst' parts, with no judgment and an almost 'motherly' type style, something I'd never had or experienced before. Needless to say, this relationship although kept professional, has had a profound impact on me in both my discovery and recovery in dealing with BPD and with general life. As I grew and evolved and got better through combined treatment, our appointments got spaced out more and more and I no longer felt the lifeline type 'need' for her, and certainly don't have her in my mind as a sort of FP at this stage. However, I'm due tommorow to have my required '6 month break' from all treatment. She has informed me that if I need to come back for more treatment after 6 months of being discharged, that it won't be her I get assigned to again, so this is goodbye, not necessarily to treatment but to her. I think that this would be difficult at any stage but I've just come off the back of the hardest few months in a long time, and am only just getting back on my feet with things, so despite I am a lot better at coping and understanding myself than I was when I first started treatment with her, this mandatory break and goodbye, although required, couldn't have come at a worse time. She is the first and only person to have understood me, more than myself, given me insight, support, and non judgemental compassion. The one and only person who gets 'me' and this disorder in a way my family, friends and partner could never, something so priceless with BPD. Although I don't require her support in quite the same way as I once did, I still don't feel ready or confident with the idea of facing life and its struggles, my struggles, without her. I knew this day would need to come at some point, but I don't feel ready, probably magnified with what I've been through lately. I don't know how to face this. It's tommorow, I'm dreading it and what comes after it, how I'll cope with the uncertainty of the future and what it may bring, without the comforting thought of knowing she's there in the background IF I ever really needed her... I liken it to the imagined comfort and confidence a child has knowing they're cycling a bike unsupported for the first time without their parent's hand on them stabilising them, but watching on, waiting to be there if needed and that being the thing that makes the child feel able to keep going and doing it alone. Any words of support and advice regarding this and how to face it would be much appreciated 🤍",1676565457.0,False,4,12,Deceptively_Honest_,None,113utf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/113utf8/saying_goodbye_to_cpn/
94,"blew up a relationship and now I don't know what to do. also, very sad","Context:

Moved from Chicago to Albuquerque with my partner in September in a very fast and dramatic nature. We broke up Oct/Nov, and have continued to live together as chosen family. I worked and supported us when we first got here, and then I was unemployed from the end of November until a week ago, and the roles reversed. 

In December, I was in the psych hospital and while I was in there got a very angry text outlying some of my behavior that hurt them with the boundaries to ""not ask them for shit"" and that they were no longer the default for anything. Rides, weed, money, etc. Things that have been shared. It really hurt and was triggering. 

I've been trying, what is my current best, to maintain the boundaries, but still find myself asking for things and for help. Never really had anyone be so strict about boundaries before, and I share a lot of things with them, whenever they ask. The biggest thing is that they have had had access to is my laptop, which they have unlimited access to because they use it for work. My laptop is also the only way we are able to watch tv or movies. 

They are moving to a different city in another state at the end of March, and it's brought up a lot, on top of the whirlwind of our relationship and breakup that I haven't even remotely processed. And I have no idea what I am doing. Whether I'm staying in this city or moving on somewhere else, and if I stay in the same house or move out to another place. 

On Friday I lost one of my new jobs after 2 days of training, while I was in the middle of working my other job, and this week/weekend has been the anniversary of some very traumatic experiences and losses. I have been at the bottom of the well and in so much pain for a very, very long time and all of that turned into a lot of anger. That anger hasn't been excised in any sort of way. 

I had let them know what had happened and asked them if they could share some weed because I had worked a 15 hour day and everything was closed so I was unable to procure it myself. They have a car, and I don't. Not having a car in this city is incredibly unreliable and unsustainable, btw. The next morning before work they said they wanted to talk about boundaries when I got home. 

On the way to work, I decided to go full destruction and sent them a very nasty text saying things like how I jump when they say how high because I owe them, they didn't ask me about anything relating to losing my job, but fuck me, right? cancelling our Valentine's plans, telling them to not use my laptop anymore, and that we can stop pretending like we're going to talk or see each other once they move away. 

It went as well as we know it did. Told me that was all baseless and fucked up. They called me some names, fragile princess and fucking foul for getting in the way of their ability to work and make money. Saying if I wanna be done, we're done and that there's nothing for us to talk about unless it's about the house. I was immediately regretful and apologetic and took accountability for how I've treated them, that I hope they find someone who treats them better and can show up for them in a way that I haven't been able to, and in a way they deserve. Said that they could continue to use the laptop. They never responded to any of that. We did text today about the lease.

We haven't had any interaction as I've been at work and I'm not trying to impose myself. When I came home last night, I cleaned the kitchen, did dishes took out trash, and straighted up the living room. The vibe was a lot better than I thought it would be when I got home,  which was a surprise. 

Today I've started to cry off and on at work. I'm weirdly calm. Maybe because I'm accepting of my bed, and because I know I have to repair through action, which is getting back into program and all of the therapy and additional work. 

I'm sharing all this, because I really need to hear or know about others experiences that are similar to this. I really don't know what to do. I'm incredibly sad. All they wanted was for the rest of out time living together to be joyous, and I ruined everything. Don't even know if I should try and do any repair. I feel like it would be kinder to let them go.

95,I caused the worst fight of our relationship and I don’t know why or what to do now.,"I had a horrible meltdown/BPD episode last night and I treated my also-BPD partner of 3+ years who I live with so horribly for no good reason right as we were trying to go to bed. I pushed him so far past his breaking point that he broke down horribly too and I ruined what had earlier been a really great night out with friends. 

I hate feeling so out of control of myself and especially hate being unable to explain away my poor behavior in any meaningful way. I’m so embarrassed and ashamed of my behavior and I feel like my world is ending. I don’t even have a good excuse for why I pushed it so far. It doesn’t even feel like me doing my actions, but it obviously was. 

I know that I’ve been very overwhelmed lately with financial concerns and I’ve felt the meltdown building in the background. I tried to preempt it by taking the meds that typically manage it but that wasn’t enough. I’ve also tried asking for space/time alone at home to recenter since that usually helps too, but that wasn’t able to happen. I am also on my period which makes my sensitivity and reactivity to much worse. I know these all sound like excuses, but I’m just trying to not feel like an innately horrible person. I understand what causes my overreactions and I don’t want to think it’s all my fault, but I also don’t want to shift blame. I can’t escape the fact that the consequences apply to me alone when I’m the one having the overreaction. I know my actions are my choices and I have to own up to the hurt I cause regardless of the reason behind it.

I’ve apologized profusely since I realized in the middle of last night how fucked up I was being, but obviously that doesn’t change or fix the hurt I caused immediately, which sucks. We’re not at odds necessarily now and he’s accepted my apologies and told me I don’t need to keep apologizing, but it’s still tense and I know I’ve hurt him deeply. We are trying to make things work and get through this fight, but I feel like I’ve just ruined everything and like it’ll never get better. I know that’s just a feeling and that I’ll be okay in the long run, but it’s a really hard day today. I do have my therapy this week and I’m going to talk to my therapist about all of this, I just needed to tell someone so that I’m not holding it all in until Wednesday.

96,I think I developed OCD,"It’s the best label I can give it, but paired with my PTSD and also fear of my BPD being out of control, I have been policing my own thoughts, actions and emotions very hard and I think that the paranoia of lashing out or possibly being unreasonable in a situation has lead or is leading me towards OCD.

I tend to analyze disagreements in hindsight and weigh out everything and want to fact check before I try to decide whether I was in the wrong or not.

It hinders me from reacting appropriately when someone is actually being an asshole to me and it also makes me freeze up because I’m stuck in a mind loop of analyzing myself.

I journal obsessively (almost daily and sometimes twice a day).

I suppress my emotions out of fear that I will overreact and say/do something bad.

It’s bad. Sometimes I feel like I’m having an episode of psychosis because I’m hardly ever here in the present.

A thought I’ve been having recently is anger and resentment towards people who don’t check their own behaviors.

I’ve been so hyper vigilant about my own behaviors that I spot shitty things others do without consideration or care about how it affects the people are them.

This really applies to a few of the personal people in my life, namely my romantic partner and my parents.

I know it’s good to not be codependent and worry too much what others think about you, but then some people legitimately don’t think about or care how their actions and decisions are going to hurt someone.

Or they understand what it means and choose to do it anyways which hurts even more.

I know we can only control ourselves and we have to choose to not stick around when others treat us badly. Sometimes we need to choose our battles and fight.

But I’m getting real fed up with folks who have so much to say about others behaviors when they themselves take no time to observe their own.

Just the ramblings of a borderline in recovery. I guess I’m still codependent because I’m worrying too much about how I affect others. Oi vey.",1636877476.0,False,2,9,SoftBoiledPotatoChip,None,qtl9ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/qtl9ck/i_think_i_developed_ocd/
97,I don't feel much lust/love due to meds,"I've tried different meds over the span of ten years and I finally found a antidepressant and mood stabilizer that works great for my anger. But unfortunately I can't pick and choose what emotions medications choose to suppress and all have just surpressed everything at once. Meaning the intense anger and depression is gone but so is my hyper dorky intense self that other people miss too. And I can't feel much in the way of emotions in general. It's pretty mild. I don't feel much love or lust anymore ether. The person I'm seeing thinks I'm not interested because as much as I want to feel as if I'm into him, (which I am btw and I was most definitely until the medication) I just feel numb. I feel unphased about alot of things. And it's really nice to have a break from constantly worrying and stressing over intense emotions, but I miss having those parts of my life were I felt intense in other ways. I feel like part of who I am has been taken from me. 

In saying this, I've tried every medication on the market under the list that I can afford for bpd. None as good as this one for my anger. And my anger really really needed to be under control before someone got hurt. Threapy does not work for me no matter the type. My brain was beyond a high level of reactive that could be treated with just threapy.

98,Support for my boyfriend,"Let me disclose, when I Google BPD symptoms I see so much bad things about people with BPD and it kinda makes me feel bad. Naturally suffering from servere childhood, adolescent, & early adulthood abandonment, physical, verbal, and sexual abuse and domestic violence, abandonment, homelessness, and even bullying both in school and from parents I have developed ptsd badly. I’m a new diagnosee here, so I’m getting an understanding to what it is, thats going on and I can’t really understand myself without seeing constant bashing about us because I have never honestly INTENTIONALLY hurt anyone nor played victim I just always fought through to be a good person. TO THE POINT HERE: 

Today, my boyfriend had a new excuse to why he comes home late, & he said it was because I’ve become extremely draining. (He’s not romantic, doesn’t take me out, nothing sweet so?) I see this so much in threads and on Google of people seeing “we” are dangerous because we’re draining. It’s been my biggest fear…. To be what I Google. Backstory, I’m having a hard time accepting this because it’s always a new excuse why he comes home late, this is a new one… and it breaks my heart. Because at this point he just doesn’t like me ? Just be honest. I’ve been experiencing a lot, business fails, his infidelity, his verbal abuse (calling me trans as if that’s supposed to be hurtful?) fat, telling me I’m not like the girls he cheats with, etc so dealing with that brings up a lot of trauma. I stay because he financially takes care of me which I never had, but more than lately it’s been making anxious to be something in life so I don’t ever have to need someone to take their abuse. My QUESTION: what can I do to not be draining?? I genuinely ask because yes I’ve been broke DOWN, to pieces. And I’m acknowledging that yeah maybe my BPD and how I react to his abuse makes me sad… and who wants to be around someone who’s sad? I wanna be better, and not for him but for myself.

99,Today I Found Out How Much I've Lost,"I lost my FP today. Actually I lost her a long time ago. I'm about to unload.

We were together for 15 years. I love her more than anything, but I have BPD. We had some amazing times, build on a foundation of what I thought was an unbreakable love. I had the greatest times of my life with her. We shared experiences that were so unique and special. And when that wasn't happening, I treated her like I hated her. 

All of my rage, sadness, fears, everything. All of it came out directed at her. All of my BPD that I didn't know what to do with, always landed on her. I was never violent, but I was emotionally unstable. Very unstable. As a result of that we had terrible communication as a couple, and couldn't talk to each other when things were really going wrong. 

Physically I left a little over two years ago. Emotionally I didn't move an inch. Lockdown brought us back together for company, and we've spent the last 18 months living through an idealised version of our relationship, minus the romantic element. 

I tried to move on, thinking it was the right thing to do, and have been in another relationship for the last year. I wasn't ready for that. But I have to rush everything. And even though I'm happy in this new relationship, and can't stand the thought of it ending, I somehow always felt that my long term partner and I would end up back together.

She was more than my partner, she's my FP. Everything only matters if she knows about it. It only means anything if I can share it with her.

So what's the problem? Today reality hit me like a brick. She told me that she's now looking for a new relationship. Now I know what you're thinking. I started a new relationship a year ago, what right do I have to be upset about that? Well, you're right. I need to be clear that I'm not angry at her, and I'm not saying she's doing anything wrong. She's a single person who is entitled to do whatever she wants. Apart from the loss of her as a partner, I'm losing the person that I thought would always be there for me in some way. Everything an FP means. A new man in her life isn't going to want her ex to be hanging around as much as I do. She isn't going to want that either, and neither should I really.

At the end of the day, I don't suppose the details are all that important. What's tearing me apart is that I didn't want any of this. All of it has been driven by BPD. The way I treated her, the way I behaved in general when I was with her, the break down of our relationship, the break up, rushing into a new relationship before I was ready. All of it was BPD. I'm so angry and broken. No way would I have made any of the decisions I've made if I could think and feel properly. BPD stole my life from me. It stole my home, and the woman that I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. It took everything that mattered, and it got me to destroy it all a piece at a time.

Again, I stress that I know my ex (still hurts to call her that) has done nothing wrong, and that she hasn't done anything with the goal of hurting me. She's just living her life. I'm just in a lot of pain right now and have nobody to talk to.",1641186865.0,False,10,1,wibble2988,None,rutsi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/rutsi6/today_i_found_out_how_much_ive_lost/
100,My partner splits very easily and becomes enraged," We both suffer a condition called borderline personality disorder.  However, the difference between me and him is I have had years of threapy  and balanced medication. I now talk very calmly and my emotions are very level. I never yell, cuss, or insult. I'm very calm. Sometimes to calm for my own good. But when he splits...he splits very quickly. Its rage when triggered. He will yell and blame me for things that are not my fault when he ""splits"". But otherwise he is a great partner.. Today we had a argument. I let him have a hour or two space and then came to talk to him.. he started disrespecting me and getting very mad again and treating me badly. He said he was being triggered by me and needed more time. I should have just walked away, but i didn't. I stayed and calmly tried to explain myself while he was yelling over me and blaming me. He then got up and pushed the door closed while I was behind and still talking to him while it was half open. He did it so fast and hard on me that it bumped my head and now I have a lump on it. I told him off for it. But since he was already triggered, he just lost it completely and said it is my fault and then slammed the front door and said it was over. I haven't seen him since. He said not to contact him. I told him not to come back until he goes to the mental health ward in the hospital and talk things through with them. I told him I don't feel comfortable with him coming back until then. He  replied a few hours later saying his at the hospital.  He just started seeing a therapist too, to help him with his anger. But I also understand that he has poor impulse control of his emotions and I should have walked away when he told me to. Though this doesn't excuse his behavior. None of it does. I just don't know what to do. His had a really bad childhood and his last relationship was really abusive too, so he often gets triggered. But he wants to change. And knows it's a problem when he is clear headed and not feeling mad or fustrated.  He is also withdrawaling off weed which his been smoking for years and years. I don't know who's at wrong here or if it's both of us to some degree. I should have walked away when he said he needed the space. And he shouldn't have done it regardless. It's not black and white. Sometimes relationships are much more complex and shades of grey then most are quick to assume. Do you think this is something we can overcome with continued threapy and hard work ? So far we have been together over a year and we are very determined. We have gone through everything together.

101,How do I work on this???,"I have BPD and have been in 5 committed relationships. This is not to sound self absorbed, but I’m simply stating the facts of what they’ve told me and having a really hard time understanding what is “normal” and how to break this pattern. 4 out of 5 of my boyfriends have been absolutely head over heels for me. I tend to attract (and I guess be attracted to) guys who have never been in love or who haven’t been for a very very long time, “until they met me”. Now I’m also aware that BPD is known to be associated with very intense relationships, especially at the beginning, where it feels like they have found their soulmate. I can’t help but think these feelings they have are somehow a result of my BPD and actually kind of sinister in nature. My relationships have often had quite a lot of issues, both from my end and theirs. At some point it’s like a light goes off for me in the relationship, and I cannot no matter how hard I try turn it back on. I want to love them how I did at the beginning and I still care about them so much as people, but it’s almost like the actual emotion feels inaccessible to me. This can cause rifts because they can obviously see a change in my demeanour and I feel sort of dead inside staying in the relationship. I don’t treat them badly, but I definitely am not capable of the closeness I desperately wanted and needed at the beginning, which they loved. I don’t know how to fix and communicate this because you can’t just say “yeah I’m not feeling this but I want to stay together”… I have historically ended the relationship at some point and felt like I’d really hurt someone, yet again. I feel like they don’t leave me because they fell so hard it’s like the love from the beginning carries forward, and since I am never awful or mean to them (more distant/less responsive and touchy), it’s easy for them to give the relationship the benefit of the doubt. 

I believe I am reaching the light off stage in my new relationship, 6 months in. What do I do? I want to make it work with him and try and stop this distanced, simultaneously numb and overstimulated feeling where they seem uninteresting to me when they ARENT.

102,Breakthrough about self respect.,"[26M] I just broke off an intense and highly codependent relationship with a partner/fp a few days ago. We were addicts together, both to narcotics and to each other. He cheated on me and lied to me constantly. Amongst the unbearable pain of his absence in my life, amongst the cravings and depression of early sobriety, I'm starting to find a little bit of clarity. 

I've struggled with self respect all my life; I have PTSD, a couple comorbid personality disorders (BPD & OCPD), and Bipolar I that all drove me to have an unstable, negative self-image. I've been treating myself like I only deserve mistreatment, neglect, and codependency in my relationships. 

So how is someone like me supposed to learn to show myself some real respect?

I think it's all about that concept of integrating the split selves. In order to make decisions that show ourselves respect, we first have to learn to listen to our TRUE moral compass--the one that takes into account the thoughts & feelings off ALL our split selves. The selfish self. The needy self. The righteous self. The pious self. The addict self. The familial self. All of them have something to contribute to the moral compass that we should really be allowing to drive our decisions. Once we can do that, suddenly we can find ourselves with the feeling that we are worth MORE as individuals.

Take a leap of faith on yourself today and listen to all of yourself. Make that hard decision. Defy that unhappy, negative, codependent voice in your head and tell yourself you deserve better.

104,How do you know if you’re unhappy or it’s BPD?,"Sorry, this is long...

I’m married to my favorite person and I love him more than anything. We’ve been together for roughly 6 years. He truly is an amazing person and he treats me so well. My family loves him and we’re best friends. 

Until recently, I was very happy. We have some differences in sex drive which do bother me but I work through it because I care for him and sex isn’t everything. I know couples go through honeymoon phases and love changes as we grow. 

Recently, without really expecting it, I started receiving attention from someone at work that my younger self would be jealous of (meaning I never in a million years would think this person would be attracted to me or like me in any way). I found that I had feelings for him after talking with him and getting to know him through our normal work interactions. After realizing this, I pulled away and we’ve kept it strictly platonic (it was platonic before but no flirting now). 

I feel awful and I know it’s wrong and please know that I’ve done my best to control myself and the choices I make. I’ve done this before in the past and I’ve tried my best to grow and be a better person, push past things and stop destroying my life. 

But it really makes me wonder...if I could’ve fallen for someone so easily, after swearing I loved my husband more than anything, am I really happy? Or is this the BPD messing with me and making me want to fall back on old patterns?

105,Is weed a medicine for my emptiness or a crutch?,"When I realized I had BPD, it came as a relief to be able to give a name to the subtle wrong feeling I've always lived with: emptiness. Not quite depression, not quite anger. An absence of contentment and in it's place uncomfortable uncertainty. Waking up and my first thought of the day being ""did I do something wrong yesterday?"" 

I don't always feel this way. Sometimes, when things are going really well or I receive praise or have sex or good luck I feel all the good feelings. I enjoy these times but I no longer trust the feelings. They are a great natural high, probably the best high, and like all highs they don't last.

But I can bring the good feelings back anytime I want, with weed. Take me at my emptiest: give me some bad news on a day when I am already full of emptiness and I'll be a despondent mess, unable to smile, seeking isolation, crying and wanting to be asleep. I smoke some weed and voila, I'm back baby, all grins, improvised songs, making bids for the attention of my loved ones, giving back rubs, eventually falling into deep untroubled sleep in my bed, relaxed, comfortable as I've ever been.

""Why are you such a pothead"" I've been asked many times over the years and I've never known how to answer. Dunno, I like to get high I guess? ""Can you even go a day without your weed?"" ""Why do you have to be high all the time?"" These assholes questions throw shade, imply a weakness, a lack of self control, a tendency for escapism. I'm not weak, and I have decent self control. But yes, I do like to escape the goddamn emptiness because I want to live rather than cry.

The assholes have a point though. Weed has side effects that make it unsuitable for use all the time. If I use it during the day I become less productive and too inwardly focused, less interested in other people, happy but dumb. 

I have a busy life, a family and a job, volunteer work, home renos to do, appointments to get to, and I can't be dumb during the day when all my responsibilities need tending to. So years ago I settled on the routine of waiting until the evening to indulge. Although I may have felt emptiness during the busy day, I could always look forward to collapsing into comfort for an hour or two before a delicious sleep. 

It's not a perfect system because I still need to endure the emptiness throughout the day. And there are still side effects from the weed, like hazy memory, and difficulty waking up at 5:30am when I like to go to the gym.

And I also wonder if my regular weed use contributes to the emotional disregulation I feel as a person with BPD. Weed has been part of my life for so long, I can't clearly remember what I'm like without it.

So there are more than enough reasons to quit weed, at least for awhile. And I have tried to do this, many many times, and yet I keep coming back to it. 

The last time I took a break from weed was a few years back. The break was about three months long. I was proud of myself for being able to put it down and I even started to wonder why I used to do it every day. I felt a sense of freedom from having to go through the same rituals every day. 

The evenings were hard. I found myself craving some kind of special treat and ended up drinking alcohol more often. I found the best way to cope with evening emptiness was to throw myself into creative projects. As long as my hands were busy I was usually distracted from the emptiness until bedtime. I had to keep moving. I was more productive. I had a harder time sitting still.

Maybe one day some a pharmaceutical company will make a drug that contains the parts of weed that combat emptiness, without the side effects. 

I would love to hear from others with BPD. Has weed been helpful and does it have side effects?",1680373379.0,False,11,14,bpdlearnerburner,None,128ubhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/128ubhw/is_weed_a_medicine_for_my_emptiness_or_a_crutch/
106,I don’t know what to do anymore,"I think I’m ruining my life in the process of getting better. I started going to therapy again and this time I hope I last longer than just a couple months. Overall, it feels like I’m getting somewhere, but it seems like the more I try to break these habits the stronger they get and that’s where I slip up.
At the moment I am at home from a day at work that barely started this morning. My partner lied about having a doctors appointment so he could get us out of there seeing that I couldn’t stop crying in silent. People at work liked me at some point in the beginning, but now it feels like they avoid me or at the very least are constantly wondering what happened to me. I used to talk to most people and mingle and I’ve always craved connection with others, but I lack many social skills or rather the anxiety is so big that just ends up making me extremely socially awkward and scared. I’ve also always felt at a disadvantage being from a different cultural background. I promised I was going to get through the day and I applied the mindlful breathing exercises I’ve learnt at therapy and on my own, but they didn’t work. I kept going back in the room and crying just for being there, for hearing people laugh and connect with each other while I felt like I killed the vibe just by being there. 
I am also ruining my relationship with my partner, and have began to consider breaking up with him because I don’t want to drag him down with me. He’s fully supportive and wants to be there for me but it’s like the more he tries to love me the more I reject him. Lately I can’t even let him touch me, specially while he’s trying to support me in a crisis and it pains me to treat him this way and to see that he comes back to me. I see myself in him and I see the times I wasted love and energy for people that didn’t deserve it.
I’m trying, I really am trying and there’s not a day I wish to just be normal and act and feel like every normal person does. But I’m getting tired, I am just tired of living through this almost every day, every time I go to work.

107,Invalidation vs lost Credibility,"I have no credibility in my relationship because of years when my distorted perception went unchecked. Now I'm medicated, doing the right treatment, and it's not perfect but it is a lot better. I find it incredibly hard to accept that I still have no credibility in my relationship, my version of truth is automatically questioned and doubted, he often treats my concern like a jury trial where I have to prove that my reason for being upset is valid. It's very painful and frustrating for the closest person to me to doubt my truth constantly. I see no other solution but ending the relationship to find a partner who doesn't have the same history with me bc my partner seems incapable of seeing me as I really am now, and just sees what he expects to see - which feels like, no matter what I'm upset about, it must be splitting or attachment issues and couldn't possibly be valid. That's the message I get, and I don't know how to have a healthy relationship with someone who believes this. Not to mention it makes me much less likely to catch when I am making assumptions or have an unnecessarily negative read of a situation because I'm distracted by pain and frustration of his Invalidation as a default position.

108,Just need to get my thoughts out,"In terms of recovery, I’m not sure where I am. I feel like the more I try and help myself, the more insightful I become in regards to my personality, the less it feels like recovery is the right word to use. 

I feel like I’m discovering more than recovering. I’m discovering ideas of how I became to be me, to think and act the way I do. I’m discovering that there are parts of me that I don’t like and feel like I can’t control. That discovery is making me feel incredibly vulnerable. 

I have a tendency to be vindictive when I feel unfairly treated, or betrayed. I have done so many things I am ashamed of, and even now I want to give an explanation before each admission. The reasoning behind why I did each of those things to the people I did them to. “Well they did this to me first, and so I did that…”

I don’t feel like I should act that way, I don’t like that trait. I don’t want to get revenge because I genuinely feel like shit afterwards. Yet I do it, over and over again. Why!?! I want to be the bigger person, I strive to be the bigger person each and every time and I never am. 

In counselling I’ve talked about this very feeling, I feel if I don’t get revenge it’s as though I’m accepting the betrayal wasn’t that at all. I feel like I’m saying that behaviour is ok and warranted. I get angry inside and I hold that anger in and then I’m the only one hurting. At least if I get what ever revenge it is I feel is required, for a small moment I feel great. Then I feel shit.

109,I fell for anther narcissist/sociopath,"TW: abuse, relationships, animal abuse etc..


I feel like I've only ever been with these types. I'm 30 and somehow they show no signs and even trick my therapists up until things become quite serious and then their mask falls off and I'm already in to deep. 


I'm terrified to speak up for myself and I'm vulnerable due to abuse throughout my life. So I know they pray on that. I'm very people pleasing and soft spoken. But I used to be the opposite. I kind of lost myself in the abuse. I'd have therapy for PTSD and abuse after each relationship but still end up caught in anther one 3-4 years later. I'm now 30 and infertile and having ongoing seizures due to immense stress from abuse of all different kinds. 

This last one said he had BPD and ADHD. But it feels like my ex's. It doesn't seem like BPD. Or atleast how I experience BPD. He hits his dogs because there's blood all over their beds and wall. There's holes in his walls too. The dog only has to move in it's cage and he yells. He constantly gaslights, manipulates, blames, yells, and courses seziues knowing my triggers and what will make them worse. I'm honestly scared of him. He twists everything I say and I can't win with him. He can say all amazing things and then turn around and undo all of what he meant and hopes I die. He decided to take my healthcare insurance off over a disagreement we had when I've been having seizures for days constantly now. He says I get nothing now. He said he won't help walk me to my GP appointment so I don't pass out and hit my head, because that's ""using"" him to ask for that. Even though my family lives in a different state and I have no one to help right now. He said I need to be patient and people don't change overnight. He said it's his ADHD and BPD but most my trumua making me think his treating me badly but he really isn't he claims. His not allowed to see his son from a different relationship ether until he gets help aswell and his ex said he is a sociopath. But he has been officially only diagnosed with BPD and ADHD.  I left today. Finally. After he was talking about me not letting him have girls on hinge as his ""friends"" even though we both agreed to no going on hinge to find ""friends"".

110,I think my partner assaulted me?,"He has BPD and he often gets triggered and leaves the relationship. This can be really stressful for me. He is in threapy and sometimes he can be good for a week or two, but then flys off the handles again. It's a working progress. But I do walk on eggshells. I also suffer BPD but mine is a lot milder. I can't say I ever really get upset or lash out. I no longer have a fear of abandonment ether much anymore. But seeing how bad his BPD is, really is a lot to take on. 

Recently I've started having seizures too. Often get worse with stress sometimes or can be brought on by that. He gets triggered sometimes by them and gets angry. He will say his leaving and storm off. Last night though I had a huge seizure. I was so exhausted. Told previously not to touch me sexually after I've had seizures because I cannot consent and we both always nude when we sleep in the same bed. This morning I told him twice that wasn't feeling good after the seizures the night before but he kept grabbing my butt and giving me sexual tension. He told me later on that he was just ""joking being sexual"" then he also said that he thought I'd said something else in regards to consent. I didn't believe him. He knows the rules. So I let it go and instead spoke to him after work tonight about it. He became angry very quickly. Said his trying the best he can but that his ""always worrying how he touches me"" tells me I'm not listening to him for all the good things his done. Said his tired of my shit. Then said ""i just won't touch you at all ever then"" and ""now your going to accuse me of not touching you enough because you think I'm unattracted to you!!"" 

Honestly that's when I hung up on him. He then said ""bye don't ever contact me again I'm done with your crap"" via text. When his triggered he just says the most crazy stuff. He will twist things to blame me and do anything to hurt me. But then when he calms down he apologizes and treats me right again. And it's so confusing. Like when he came back during my seizure and calmed down, he wrapped me up in blankets and made me food and made sure to watch me all night making sure I was okay. But when he is triggered, he is not like himself at all and nothing gets through to him. People have said he must have NPD but I'm pretty sure he is BPD.

I loved him so much that I blinded myself to all of the red flags he waved in my face. I romanticized him and who I wanted him to be that I ignored the years of financial abuse. I made excuses for why he never wanted to be close to me, why we had a dead bedroom only a year into dating, why he isolated me from all of my family. I kept telling myself that it wasn't abusive because I couldn't see the malice. I left 41 days ago.

(Venting. Not looking for advice just needed to vent because I don't have anyone I feel comfortable to talk with about this right now. Thanks) 

I don't normally fall very easily for people unlike most with BPD, that is a symptom I have lacked to understand, as I rarely feel a romantic connection or attraction to anyone. 

But I met a guy about a year ago and we talked while we were both in abusive relationships (as friends) for a year. We were there for eachother when no one else was. We lost contact for 6 months afterwards and he came back because he couldn't stop thinking about me. And neither could I. We both were going through alot at the time so we had drifted apart. But now we were both single. I traveled 12 hours to see him. He was going to see me but I told him I wanted go for a road trip instead. It was instant chemistry. I'd never felt this way in my intire life (I'm 33 he is 30) about anyone before and I did not know it was possible for human feelings such as this to exist. He was the same. Even being in long-term relationships before, felt like nothing compared. We kept crying because I had to go back home eventually. But when I got home, things changed. I changed. I wanted everything and more for him. I wanted to treat him amazing. I wanted to be everything he deserved... But no matter how hard I tried, I knew my bpd was sabotaging it before my very eyes...I tried so so hard... I had been going to threapy for many years prior but I have been told that my case is incredibly resistant to treatment. Even since I young age. I have been on every med under the sun and every different threapy known to man. Even shock treatment. I have also had brain damage which has made my emotions ten times worse and I just try the best I can to achieve some kind of help from this exhausting disorder whenever I can but it's definitely a diffcult journey!! Anyhow, seeing my disorder slowly destroy my relationship Infront of me felt like someone else was taking over my body and deciding to react in all these types of ways I did not want to react in. It was like watching someone else take hold that didn't feel like me, but yet I couldn't control at the time regardless if the tools I used. 

Watching someone you love so so deeply being hurt by you is the most painfuliest thing I've ever gone through...
And the 1 thing I'd never in this world want to happen to them was happening by me! It's now been 4 months and I am blocked on everything and I don't expect a message back ever again. I truly hate myself for this and it seems the more I love someone, the more I must hurt them . I only wanted the very best for him but I couldn't even do that .. I know he wasn't the best ether sometimes but given the circumstances I can understand why. As much as it hurts me, I just hope he finds happiness and someone who can give him everything that I cannot archive or have not achieved in the last 10 years of threapy. I just want him to be happy ... As I write this, I'm crying non stop because I don't think I will ever find someone like that again. But it's not about me or what I want. It's about what they need, and they need someone stable. And after the horrific childhood I have endured for many years, bpd is the least of my concerns for the disoders I have.

He used to chase me but he never does anymore. Because his used the silent treatment on me so many times, I'm now paranoid when he doesn't answer for long periods of time. I tend to end up in a panic attack begging him to answer. 

He will get so mad at me for blowing up his phone. I've told him maybe 4 times now whilst crying that if he needs space or doesn't want to talk then he needs to just say so. But not saying anything makes me go into a panic attack. 


I was crying like crazy and told him he needs to tell me. he said ""NO ! DONT YOU DARE TRY TO PUT THIS ON ME! DONT YOU DARE!"" then followed by ""I'm going to play video games now bye!!"" (He plays video games all the time and ignores me) 


Am I asking to much for him to tell me if his busy or doesn't want to talk? He always become enraged and does this. I'm scared to say anything. He says I'm always arguing but it's only because when I calmly try to communicate he gets extremely enraged and tells me it's my problem. Uses things off topic againist me or as to why . Like tonight he said he shouldn't have to text me to say he doesn't want to talk if I don't want to commit and use him as a ""toy"". Reason I'm not jumping back into a immediate relationship with him after a previous argument is because he needs to work on himself and how he treats me. Until then, I'm single. And I can also date who I please which he hates. But I'm scared of him and his behaviour never changes. He says all his friends say I'm abusive and toxic. Idk. There's alot.

114,I realized I have (not so) covert anger issues,"I get really really really angry over the dumbest shit. Example: when phone calls get choppy and I have to keep repeating myself I get irrationally angry to the point where it has physical consequences on me. 

People don’t believe me when I say I’m an angry person tho. I get tons of reassurance. But like, I HATE confrontation so if I’m mad at you I’ll dip for a bit or mask it. Things that are slightly irritating in the grand scheme of things send me into a rage without fail. My dbt skills help immensely but it’s still a struggle 

Honestly, I think it’s cause of my mom. She’s a TEXTBOOK narcissist, and used to pick me apart for HOURS. Hourrrrrrs. (Not an exaggeration)  her goal was to “break” me essentially. She’d made me so mad I’d feel my head pulsing, but the thing is any sign of anger only ENCOURAGED HER. The only way to get thru it was to learn how to not show a HINT of emotion. You had to say “okay mom” but with the exact right tone or she’d accuse me of trying to shut her up. (NO DUH YOUR VOICE IS DYING OUT AND YOURE STILL GOING?!!)

It was honestly torture. Now I get mad and I’m like *peace* and either physically leave or if I can’t dissociate out the wazoo. You’d never know I was mad by looking at me. Although I have been known to angrily storm out of situations when I’m comfortable enough with the person. 

Understanding this about myself, made me re-examine how my poorly managed anger was affecting my loved ones. I only showed anger towards people I felt safe with, which had the unintended consequence of them being punished for my anger. I thought for the longest time that it was good that I don’t show anger, I was proud of the fact that “if you know I’m mad I’m REALLY mad and you should run” 

Recognizing that this was destroying my relationships and hurting me and my loved ones unnecessarily, made things so much better, and I’m improving every day and mending relationships.

I feel like I could litterally lose my legs and she would carry me. 

She knows about my Bpd and has even taken the time and effort to try and help me. Im a new person when I'm with her.

Now things are starting to change. I've had 3 jobs already and none of them have lasted.. mainly because I get anxiety. Or some days I can't get out of bed. Some days I can't mentally do anything.

It was ok at first. And now it's a constant struggle because she's paying all the bills. I feel like a horrible person. I don't want to be like this.

116,BPD and relationships/dissociating,"I don't know if anyone has ever experienced a such high level of dissociation after your breakup. I dated a guy through our my freshman year, I guess I could call him my real first love, my first boyfriend. Things were really good in the beginning, like really fucking good. The more time I spent with him though the more I started to pick and the smallest things. I would feel guilty/sad and jealous just from him not being able to call. Whenever that would happen I had this little voice telling me that he's going to abandon me. That he really didn't care about me. He would only be gone for a few hours, sometimes days for vacation but that was from his family. His parents started to notice we were fighting like a lot on the phone. I would tell him I wanted to break up with him and never see him again. It sounded evil but I felt comfortable in seeing feel how I felt, while he was begging for me not to do it and not end things. This went on for our whole relationship of me being pity and not regulating my emotions. What really didn't help was his parents telling me I was manipulative (they weren't wrong. But my head was in the gutters) everytime we fought id self harm and take pictures on my snap account just for him to login and see it. I felt so fucking horrible all the time. I genuinely hated it. I hated how I treated him, I hated that he had to beg for me back. As he did this practically out whole relationship for 10 months. I always just wanted to be with him and when I couldn't I felt so horrible. It was love but not the good kind. It was obsessive love, I don't even think you can consider the word love in it. I would skip weeks of school and just sleep the whole day. I was depressed and failing academically. My parents werent too proud either. My mom would tell my that I'm ruining this boy and hurting him. I agreed. Somewhere in July I attempted suicide. I was placed into inpatient where I remained for a month or so. I felt so nauseous the whole entire time (I think this is when my dissociating really hit) I would dissociate all the time and just stare off into space while life was happening all around me. Eventually I got out but and he waited for me but things still continued and we eventually broke up.

It kinda felt like I lost the other half of me. We fought a lot but we had really good times. Ever since ive found comfort in being alone and I really don't think I need anyone. I've been doing dbt therapy which has helped so much and I'm so grateful I can get therapy near me that really helps. I tend to dissociate so much more then I did when I was with him. I don't really talk to that many people now, I have a few good friends but I keep more to myself. I'd like to believe it has nothing to do with our breakup and I'm just maturing but I can't really say. I've finally learned self love but dissociating is still really hard for me to control.

117,Could use some advice/resources on long term relationships and the journey to changing toxic behavior,"Hi everyone I'm new to this subreddit and new to admitting that maybe my psychologist was right and I do have BPD. After ditching her years ago and living life in denial and just feeling bitter about my traumas I am finally coming to terms with the fact that I am responsible for getting better and working on my mental health even if I'm not the one who caused it. 

Now I am in a loving relationship with the man of my dreams, he really is so stable and loving. We have been dating for two years. We have the same life/career goals and he's aware of my past traumas and is the most gentle and patient person I've ever met. He is someone I see myself spending the rest of my life with.

But the thing is we have been having these constant issues that stem from my bad behavior, and he has made me aware that he cannot keep going on in this relationship if it stays the way it has. Even though he's everything I could imagine in a partner and we have such amazing moments together, I am always snapping and arguing over little things. I'm constantly questioning whether or not he hates me and he said he cannot keep dating me if he has to reassure me that he won't break up with me every night before we go to bed. I am aware of these things I do and I know it stems from just how good the relationship is, it seems too good to be true and too good for me to deserve it. It stems from my traumas, my childhood neglect and abuse, as well as a previous long term verbally/physically/sexually etc. abusive relationship. He deserves to be treated with respect and he wants a tranquil relationship, I want to be the one to give that to him. I'm owning up to my toxic behavior and I want to fix it.

I was wondering if anyone has had these problems before and have some advice/resources as to how to go about setting proper behavioral boundaries for myself in the mean time while I go about finding a therapist and working with a professional on all of this. 

It will take several months for my insurance to be established before I can even start looking for a therapist and then years of working with professionals to get even close to being better but I don't want to lose such a good thing in the mean time and I know I'm worthy of living a good life and having a healthy relationship. I just could use some advice on creating a more healthy environment for us to be able to share our love, or resources that have helped you, books websites anything since I am so lost and overwhelmed at the very beginning of this tremendous journey.

118,About to embark on a 32 week DBT/Therapy program - spaces available in the group DBT sessions,"I am about to bite the bullet and begin a course of therapy and DBT training.  It’s going to send me into debt, but I’ve been in debt before and never for anything this valuable.

After searching online, I have found a licensed professional counselor and psychologist who is trained and experienced in working with pwBPD and in facilitating DBT Skills training sessions.

This therapist has a solid track record and (like Linehan) does not suggest medication – and very importantly to me, does not suggest facing or exploring traumas during this program.  This appeals to me.

I am in Asia, so I have been looking all over.  This counselor is based in the UK – and recommends a 32 week program – two sessions a week. One session each week will be group DBT Skills training, and the other will be 1 on 1 sessions exploring and applying the DBT training.

Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 2 (8 weeks) 	emotion regulation
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 3 (8 weeks)	interpersonal effectiveness
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 4 (8 weeks)	distress tolerance
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness

What is really tough for me is the cost – the session cost is 95GBP per session.  However, they would pro-rata this rate for the group DBT sessions – 95 divided by the number of participants.  That appeals to me because I learn very well in a group, and the pwBPD support group I take part in has been very valuable to me.

They are currently reaching out to colleagues to learn if there are others being treated who would like to be part of DBT Skills training and therapy.  So I want to share that opportunity here.

I recognize it is expensive.  I am fortunate enough that a close friend has seen how I suffered in the past 18 months and is lending me the money – it will take me quite a while to pay it back but its so much more important than anything I ever went into debt for.   It is also a solid commitment – they require we sign a contract  to commit to the program.

While it might not be for everyone here, I thought it might be worthwhile to present it to see who in this subreddit is interested.  I am eager to get started, to finally take a step I have never done and commit to 8 months of difficult weekly work.  It would certainly make it easier if the group sessions had 3-5 people, and not only me or me and one other.

IF you are interested, feel you can manage the cost (with a group session reduction as indicated), and want to know more; PM me.  I am happy to share the therapists profile and answer what I can, and connect you with them if you want to know more – they offer a free consultation session to help you decide if its right for you.

Thanks everyone, and please pardon if this is a weird thing to post… I am mainly trying to get started on healing myself.",1621955276.0,False,22,6,IraJohnson,None,nkry8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/nkry8m/about_to_embark_on_a_32_week_dbttherapy_program/
119,I am trying to get over my first and only fp,"This is LONG. 

We fell in love in hs in sophomore year. We saw the world in each other for so long. 

Neither of us knew we were attracted to the same gender and it was scary but i had her and she made me feel brave. She (L) struggled with internalized homophobia more than I did and throughout our relationship hurt me many times
—— not wanting to tell our friends and finally agreeing bc it was kind of crazy and painful that they didnt know after months of being together and we are all part of the same close knit group(no history of homophobia from any of these friends). She became colder and less physical around friends family and in public for a long time. She didnt tell her parents until confronted about it and forced to. I will never get over that bc it made me aware that her love for me couldnt trump her fear. We left for college and we did long distance (we made it till last semester of her senior year- I failed out due to mental health crises and eventually was diagnosed). She didnt tell anyone she was dating someone bc she was scared. She just said she wasnt interested in dating. I found out a few months in and eventually she came out to them. ——-

Theres more and I made many mistakes as well. I was full blown BPD for a couple years with no help and then shitty help and then finally diagnosed and started on a real path to recovery. Made many mistakes and said and did horrible things even after the diagnosis as it goes. So neither of us were good to each other but both of us got much healthier and happier. i needed to say what I said about her to give you an idea of why im in so much pain now. 

I broke up with her last February (2021). She had been staying with me over winter break and i was convinced towards the last couple months that we werent right for each other. At least not at that time. We always said that in the future we could try again. We’d stay in each others lives forever and if it was meant to be we’d find our way back to each other. 

We were in contact till july. She found out i had sex with someone I had dated while we were on a break (L2) and then went to visit her a few days later ( i was road tripping). I was romantic with her and kissed her and it felt like we were coupley again. I felt like bc we were broken up i didnt need to tell her anything about my sex life which is true and valid but i still feel a little guilty bc i know she wouldnt have seen me if i told her which is most of why i didnt. I think intention matters when we hurt others. 

We went no contact. she was hurt. I shacked up with L2 and she moved down here to be with me and to escape an abusive, no-winning situation. I started writing letter to L and not sending them just venting. I eventually broke up with L2 who is still living with me and we are making it work but it is hard. I couldnt send her home to an abusive situation and she has nowhere else to go and i decided to let her stay for my own reasons as well. 

I decided to wait until February to reach out to L again. It would be a full year from when we broke up. So I did and when we got into heavier conversations I learned that she had no intention of ever getting back together with me which is fine i didnt want to be pining after her for years either and it wouldnt be fair to future partners. The hurt is when she said that she doesnt see me as a potential life partner anymore. She validated that the hardest part is losing your best friend and also that we would always be special to each other. Writing those letters made me take many steps back in letting her go. We moved to talking every few months instead of every few weeks bc it was painful for both of us so I havent spoken to her since mid February. 

It was hard doing no contact before but now things are really definitely over probably forever and its more painful than it ever has been. Ive truly lost my fp and it being my first and only doesnt help at all. Theres no assurance that I will ever get over her bc I havent tried with an fp before. I am actively fighting my longing for her. Im doing everything right. Still it hurts. I know that she wants to be with a man next bc shes always been interested in them and she was with me for the better part of 6 years. She slept with men and i slept with people on breaks but shes never dated a man. I see her proudly taking him home and her family happily accepting him and being relieved hes a cis man. I see them treating him the way I should have been treated. I was endlessly kind to her family and they liked me a lot as a person but made jokes to her about being in a homosexual relationship, refused to acknowledge it and never talked about it etc. he wont even have to try to get them to take their relationship seriously. I see her being relieved as well and never looking back. Ive always felt sick with imaging her with a man- to add to the complexity of that I am nonbinary but wish I was born in a male body (huge feelings of inadequacy and wondering if she always longed for a man). There was a time a year into our relationship where she admitted she had wished i was a man (cis) for some of our relationship. I only realized I was nonbinary 4ish years into our relationship. I changed my name and the cherry on top is that she would not and did not tell her parents my preferred name or pronouns (i was happy with just the name at least) up until and through our breakup. I dont even know if they know now.  

I miss her endlessly, my biggest problem is I fear i will never fully get over her. I also fear she will pity me bc I will likely be less successful than her and she may see that I have feelings for her if I cant heal and it will only make her more distant and pity me more. 

I need people to hear my story and understand me and validate how I feel.

120,Feeling hopeless,"I just got off the phone with my doctor regarding my diagnosis. I have had around 10 years of therapy (of which three years of CBD) and  several diagnoses (attachment disorder, childhood abuse/neglect, ptsd, adhd, ED,  unspecified personality disorder among other smaller stuff). A lot of these have not been taken seriously or disregarded by other specialists because I was too young, too unstable or the diagnoses were clashing. Which is all valid. but i felt like I am in a calmer and more stable environment so I can get properly diagnosed.

Now they told me that I do seem like I have a high functioning personality disorder that seems to be BPD. BUT. i am too high functioning. they literally told me I seem to have ""beaten"" it already. I am 21 years old, which seems kinda unlikely to me as neither myself nor any of my friends or family think I am mentally healthy enough to go without any diagnosis or treatment and now I am stuck with the diagnosis of reoccurring depression - which in no way explains my extreme mood swings, dissociative episodes and occasional psychotic episodes. Feeling depressed is honestly the least of my worries.

BPD is rooted in both sides of my family and several specialists have told me I do check most of the boxes. I don't know what to do, my FP just left me because I am too difficult and too depressed and dysfunctional for him to handle. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this and I don't know how to get a second opinion (I'm in the UK). In the meantime I am unable to do any uni work and am without a job due to the pandemic and I just spend all day in bed trying to get through the day without making things worse, while my mental health gets worse every day.

My symptoms are fucking up my life so much and I am so done feeling this way and being so dysfunctional all the time and not having any stability regarding the people in my life. I just wanna be normal. I don't wanna drink or get high to not feel anymore, I don't wanna keep isolating myself from the people I care about because I'm scared I'll hurt their feelings or do something that'll end up in them leaving me. I don't wanna be this way I wanna work my way to being somewhat normal, and yet I am ""too high functioning"" to be treated. I feel hopeless and like all this is never gonna go away and I don't know how to keep living this life without any proper help or understanding from my surroundings....

What do I do? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

EDIT: I have also been told that they refuse to diagnose me with BPD because then health services will reject treatment. Is this true?",1609853138.0,False,4,4,pieceofurheart,None,kqyf1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/kqyf1z/feeling_hopeless/
121,need some insight,"TW some ED and SH and S**cide mentions

So basically rn I'm 16. About 3 years ago I started having problems with depression and anxiety due to many factors including a huge move overseas and some serious cyber bullying from people close to me. With lockdown happening not much later everything because worst especially with the isolation and all that. I also did start having social media and pretty quickly got into the ""quirky depression"" side of tiktok but soon removed the app because I realised how stupid it was. 

Then the depression got pretty bad and it got to the point where I would sleep at 5 am everyday after spending hours in my bed doing nothing bit literally just crying. Sorry if I'm skipping things or not explaining properly I'm not very good with explaining. Also later on the suicidal thoughts were very frequent and for a few months they were very hard to get out of my head. 

I also started developing ED symptoms. It started with just running outdoors during lockdown which was allowed. After a while I would run up to 2hours a day. Then I switched to cycling which progressed to 4 hours a day. And finally I started obsessing over calories and the worst it got was 500 cals a day plus hours of cycling. I had a lot of free time as It was the summer holiday during the first lock down. My parents didn't mind me going out and stuff too. Just what was allowed.

After around 2 months of this I travelled for a while to go on holiday and slowly let go of most of the extreme ed behaviours. The depression didn't get better tho. 

Then a few months later I started have problems with severe anxiety. I got anxiety tics, unexplainable panic attacks and even a couple of short attacks that were later labelled as anxiety induced mania attacks. That was likely triggered due to the return of school and exams and all that. Also during that time my dad got diagnosed with cancer. At first they thought it was terminal and he had a few months but the diagnosis changed and thankfully he got treated and became cancer free about 8 months later. That period was pretty hard tho especially due to the caution we had to take as my dad didn't have any immunity and he because quite aggressive due to the effects of chemo and other medication. He still had problems with it but I can't say it's his fault. 

During that time I also struggles with SH and have problems with skin picking and some intrusive thoughts which I think is related to anxiety. 

Anyway lately the depression hasn't been too bad but I still have problems with anxiety and now the worst thing is anger problems. I would be fine but out of no where have a rage episode about stupid things. In the last 2 weeks I had like 3 extreme episodes leading to big family fights and I got to levels of crazy anger. I literally couldn't calm down except for when I started punching myself really hard. That left me with a few bruises. Also I started going to the gym a few weeks ago to help release that anger but idk it didn't help stop those anger episodes. This is really starting to bother me because idk how to stop them and i later I realise how stupid the trigger was and honestly I don't want to be another thing my parents have to add to their list Of worries. 

Anyway sorry this ended up being kind of a vent. But I wanted to ask for tips on how to manage the anger. 
Also I went into a great depth because I wanted to ask if it's worth looking into me possibly having BPD. I've been researching for around 2 years now because I just relate with a lot of the symptoms. I'm not diagnosing myself obv I just want to find the right help. Ik I'm under 18 so it's not easy to diagnose it but is it worth asking to be checked for it ? Also my grandad has it.

122,turning 25 really made me realize how narcissistic my parents are,"a little background for context: My whole life was spent in survival mode as I was systematically denied opportunities to grow into a healthy, happy, functional person. As the youngest in my family, for the longest time, I was told I was sick and to blame for my family's dysfunction. time after time my parents have proven to want me off their payroll and never showed genuine compassion, empathy, or support in any other way except financially. They would say cruel, horrible, hurtful things to bring me down but say they want the best for me and pull a woe-is-me card saying they have done everything they can to help. I softened and repeated to them that all I ever wanted was a cheerleader but instead, they'd continuously drag and slander me telling me I'd never get far in life and the world is a cruel place. the truth is they are the cruelest thing I have encountered in my lifetime. No matter what I did, even after 15+ years of therapy  I found my identity, improved myself, learned how to not react like them, communicated in a healthy manner, and am very confident and can defend myself properly.  it was never enough to change how they treated me. At 17 they sent me to a residential therapy center and I was in a position in which I couldn't decline or avoid it, which actually ended up saving me and changing my life forever. They were supposed to be a part of the journey but even experts couldn't convince them of their wrongdoings and who I really was, not who they interpreted me to be. They refused to listen to my therapists and tried to convince them of things they simply knew weren't true. (I lived there and interacted with them on a daily basis for a year). Eventually, it got to the point where my parents were constantly contacting my therapists, writing a literal \*book\* worth of an email, trying to tell them what to tell me or what I was doing. They wouldn't respect a professional's boundaries, how were they ever going to respect mine? hindsight is 20/20 as they spent my tuition to go to my dream college and pursue my dream job on this place. Grand total of $120,000+, to not listen to anything that was truly causing conflict. This problem persisted with all different therapists for years, looking back, they basically had me hop to different therapists throughout the years when thought they were wrong and couldn't sway them. When I was a kid I distinctly remember an incident where a therapist had restated something my mother had said to me recently, and i asked her if my mom told you to say that to which she replied, you're a smart cookie. They were convinced i would never take off and told me id never succeed yet resented me for being the reason I couldnt.

&#x200B;

Now, 25 (F), I live on my own and I have my dream job and found my dream apartment. I admit I had a late takeoff but everyone is on their own timeline, progress not perfection. They had helped me along the way financially but were consistent in their past behavior. I'm currently in the process of a move and things that shouldn't be arguments become arguments because they think I'm arguing when I'm cool as a cucumber. I did everything myself and orchestrated the move. I made plans and shared them and how we needed to get things done. they'd constantly interrogate me as if I hadn't recited the plan 10 times in a way that made me feel that they think I'm truly incapable. yet, they pushed me off when I reached out to get things done and would get so mad when id point it out respectfully and they'd blow me off while going off on me repeating the same horrible things. I know they are helping me financially but expressing my frustrations led to me being told I'm never going to have a relationship or friends and this is why people hate me and leave. to which I replied, like who? then they claim I gaslight them as they continue to try to tell me I'm this horrible person who lives to make them miserable. They go back and forth constantly from wanting to help to being punishing mean-spirited people and I'm just tired. I want to enjoy my life and I see now that even achieving what they thought I'd never do but claimed they wanted for me still isn't enough to earn their respect. I've done so much mourning over them never being the parents i needed through the years and now I just think my only option is to surrender to that. Its just really sad. I have so much anger and resentment from it, especially when I was the one told in my childhood that they had to walk on eggshells. But now I see, it was me that had to tip-toe and hold my breath. I don't want to be angry anymore, but god, do they fill me with rage. 

I don't know what I'm really looking for...  I want to preserve my identity and my recovery without their words living in my head. So maybe connection, advice, or a community. I just want to be happy and feel proud, my life has never been better and I feel like they have sucked the joy right out of my achievements. every. single. time.",1693340841.0,False,7,2,KirbyInTheClouds,None,164tdo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/164tdo4/turning_25_really_made_me_realize_how/
123,"Missing my Ex-FP's Mom...My ""ex-mom,"" I guess","Please help. I'm so sad and I don't know how to improve my situation. I don't know what to do...

A few months ago, my best friend of 7 years told me via text that she no longer wants to speak to me. I said fine, I'm here when you want, and left it like that. She never gave me a reason why she left. And I don't think it was my bpd, since for the past year I had been keeping my episodes of sadness a secret (she lives a bit far away so it's easy to). I did this because she requested it, saying my sadness was too much, and so I agreed to keep it private. We used to talk every day for 7 years via text. I would see her every few weeks, though it used to be more. I loved her so deeply it scared me.... Now she is gone completely, having chosen to ""break up"" with  me via text and without reason, despite knowing I have a legitimately crippling fear of abandonment.

This is not the issue. I don't think I want her friendship anymore, even if she did return. I deserve better than this, after the countless years of absolute love and devotion I've shown her. 

The problem is her mom, Ella (fake name). For the last 7 years, Ella has been like a mom to me. I called her mom. She treated me like her daughter. I come from a mentally abusive family with a mother who tried to disown me, and is a severe narcissist. So when Ella opened her arms to me, it meant the world. When I first moved to the country I live in now, I was so poor I could not afford housing or food on the table. I moved alone, without family. Ella gave me everything, including, I'm ashamed to admit, money. I took it because without it, I would have been unable to survive. I am now still poor but doing better for myself, and I have offered countless times to repay Ella, to which she said no, I'm her daughter.  Ella showered me with gifts and motherly love like I've never felt before.

Ella went out of her way to remake memories for me, so that I could help heal from some of the worst moments in my life. As such, about 4 years ago, she and my best friend finally invited me to their family holiday dinner. I cried harder than ever that night...the love I felt from her entire extended family, as they opened me into their home and family with open arms, calling me Ella's adopted daughter, saying they heard of my past and my current struggles and that I was family now...I had never felt more loved in my life. That night was one of the best moments of my life, and one of the only times I've ever felt truly happy. Every year since then, I returned for the extended family holiday dinner. I was greeted for 4 years with love from literally everyone in their close family.

I would do anything to have Ella back in my life. I love this woman with all my heart. She was...is...my mother. I've never felt so loved and accepted. I don't care about my ex-fp right now. I just want Ella back. But she lives a few towns away, and without her daughter's consent, I don't think I will ever see her again.

Its the first holiday season without my fp. I have heard nothing from her, which is fine. But I have also heard nothing from her mom. Ella and I usually message once a month. Now she knows her daughter isn't talking to me, and hasn't messaged me since telling me she would ask her daughter what happened (which I begged her not to...I told her not to get involved.) I broke down at 2am this morning and just sent her the following:

Merry Christmas! I hope that you and your family have a wonderful day and night and that the new year will also be super. I'm sorry that I messaged so late. I just miss you so much. I wish you a good night and love you forever  🎄⭐😔.

She hasn't seen the message.

What do I do? What can I do? How can I stop the extreme pain I'm feeling, and the feeling that I'm disposable and worthy of abandonment? How can I feel less like I deserve to die? I did everything I could to be the best I could be. To keep my illness reasonable for others to deal with, and to literally shower my ex-pf and her mother with love and devotion and signs that I appreciate them. But nothing was enough. I'm not enough. I just want to disappear.

Please help if you can. Thank you for reading all of this.

124,potential bpd in my partner,"I originally posted this to BPDlovedones but I don’t have enough Karma and I’m desperate for some advice.


Potential BPD in my partner?

I’d like to start by saying this is my first post. I have been with my girlfriend for about a year and a half. The first year or so was mostly smooth sailing. I noticed with other people she could be kind of confrontational but never thought much of it. 

Well, lately, I’ve been struggling to feel like a human. We went to my parents house (we live out of state) this week, and tried to be as safe as we could at first. She wound up getting a tattoo from her ex boyfriend that we’ve both agreed she should not communicate with countless times (he was abusive for multiple, very valid serious reasons that I’d rather not divulge). She’s changed his name in her phone, and tried to hide communications with him in the past, but I thought I finally got to the bottom of it before the tattoo incident. This really upset me, not because I expected her to be cheating, but rather because it was a violation of trust. We had a rather large argument, and I could tell she was sorry and understood the gravity of the situation. Then, she started going out and seeing groups of maskless people, drinking, doing coke, partying. I’m not faultless in the situation, I’m probably overly paranoid about respecting and protecting my parents. On Halloween, I went to pick her up after she said she doesn’t want to do anything or see anybody. She said we should get some food and I though that sounded good. When I asked if we could get it to go, it turned into how I never think about her and how I am only thinking about my parents. I probably could have and should have made more of a plan - but hey, the fuckin world is shut down and I thought it would be nice to watch a movie with my parents. That was very strange to her, and upset her quite a bit. She called me weird for thinking that would be a normal thing to do. It’s gotten down to the point to where everything is my fault. Her phone dying, my fault. My doctor rescheduling my appointment, my fault. Being stuck in traffic, my fault. I will tell her plans days in advance, and when the day comes she will explode and tell me how I’m not clear - when I know I was as clear as I could have been. It feels like she either isn’t listening or doesn’t care. Is there any way I can quell this seemingly perpetual anger? For the past few months it feels like the resentment has been building. She says I “make her crazy”, but I’m always trying to do the right thing, and have only the best intentions. She and I both make mistakes but I can move past hers and love her and forgive her, and she holds onto mine like her life depends on it. I don’t know what to do. 

I had a past girlfriend who was extremely abusive and diagnosed BPD. She chased me with a knife when I tried to confront her cocaine problem, she cheated on me, lots of things. It worries me that I’m seeing parallels in their communication patterns. My current girlfriend can switch on the drop of a hat from loving me, to hating everything I am. At this point she knows me and I know her. I love her flaws because they are part of her. She treats my flaws like the worst thing in the world and that every move I make is wrong. I’m sorry this is so drawn out. I’m just trying to make this work. Aside from these issues, she is a beautiful, caring person when she isn’t having an episode. I don’t know how to address this either, because she’s been coming to the conclusion that her mom probably has BPD too, and I don’t want to corner her or make her feel any finger being pointed when I try to confront this. Her anger is going to have a huge impact on her life and I want to help her onto the path to a happy life, if possible.

125,really struggling lol (rant ig),"i have always had issues connecting with people, when i do though its so intense and i get attached so deeply. i guess its just a fp thing but i recently went through a breakup and its really fucking with me. i met him a few years ago when i was very lonely and struggling and i fell in love with him because he made me feel so safe and helped me work through my issues. i became so dependent on him. i have a really ugly side to myself and i have really bad splitting issues and i really hate to admit it but i emotionally abused him. its scary because i feel like im two different people and i can see when i start changing and i can recognize when i start to feel triggered but idrk how to explain it its like i cant control it. anyways, i have two views on the relationship and i keep going back and fourth between them and its slowly driving me insane,

first, i feel like most of the relationship was made up in my head. by that i mean he wasnt the person i thought he really was and i fell in love with this boy that wasnt even real anymore. to back that up there were two times where cheating was brought to my attention and there was proof but i listened to his reasoning and tried to ignore it. closer to our breakup he would tell me that he would always be there for me and would help me to the best of his ability because he loved me and didnt want me to go through anything alone, but when i would go to him he would aways end up falling asleep to me crying begging for his comfort (we were long distince and this was over facetime) thats what i hated most about him, he would always say things that were so perfect and good but there was never any actions behind them. i was sexually assaulted before we met and it was actually how my virginity was taken, and when we first had sex i told him i was a virgin because i just wanted to forget ab the sa and later i decided to tell him because i realized i wasnt fully healed from it and he got so upset, calling me a liar and whore and shit. these things i realized i never forgave him for and that turned into anger and during situations where i started to become triggered it would all build up and then i would snap and things would get ugly and my awful side would come out. i would say really awful things to him but it isnt all my fault right ?  all of my reactions where bad yes but they were reactions to being treated awfully yk? 

second, i know i am definitely hard to deal with, my anxiety, overthinking, and constant changes in moods get so intense sometimes and i completely understand how that can get to be too much for someone with their own issues. he struggled with his own things and i tried to be there for him but my mental health was getting so bad i started to neglect him and only care for myself and my needs. i would get so frustrated with him and ignore him and block him because i would become so done with him. i know i hurt him so bad. the things i said to him were awful. i heard this saying a little bit ago “the abused become the abuser” and that really made me think damn that really hits. i became the monster that i feared most. have i really became this awful human that hurt someone who only wanted to love me. did i completely kill a kind soul?

i know im not over him and i also know i would never go back to him but this shit is destroying me. its all i can think about and i know i need to heal from it but i dont know how to because of my conflicting opinions on it. he was the only person in my life and i got so used to it so now when i hang with new people i feel uncomfortable because all i can think about is how its not him. its making me so lonely which also isnt good because i need human interactions. i need a fp.",1628156483.0,False,4,0,swaggylittynoodle,None,oye5o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/oye5o9/really_struggling_lol_rant_ig/
126,Newly Diagnosed and So Confused,"32F here.. So I don't know much about BPD. I was diagnosed a few weeks ago by a new psychiatrist, as I show 7/9 BPD traits. First of all, the disorder seems very nebulous and like it has a fair amount of stigma attached to it. Does anyone have a concise way to explain the jist of it to me? 

Secondly, I would like some opinions on my last relationship, which ended just before I was diagnosed.

I am also diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1 with psychotic episodes...but I've had that diagnosis for years now, so I'm comfy with it. 

Basically, my ex is bipolar (but type 2), has cPTSD, is ADD, is nearly agoraphobic and is possibly Borderline as well. (She feels she may be, and her degree is in psych, but she hasn't been diagnosed yet)

Obviously that is a tough mix of disorders to make a relationship out of, and it was toxic to both of us over 4 years. She feels like I was abusive to her, and seems to now be going down her own rabbit hole of paranoia that is building me up into the evilest monster. Which hurts my heart, because I never meant to hurt her so badly, and I also suffered a ton during those years. 

All the bits and pieces of the toxicity of the relationship are too many and too involved to explain/list here. But the meat of what happened was that I lied to her about being physically attracted to her in the beginning, in order to spare her feelings. (I Hated lying to her, & looks don't really matter to me) She found out, and it Crushed her. She never trusted me again after that. I tried to make it up to her...&she punished me for about a year afterwards. I got suicidal from the awful relationship we were having, and she wasn't there for me through that at all. I turned to my friend who happened to be a high school ex, and he was the only one who was there for me, and his support was a big lifeline. Naturally, bc my partner didn't trust me, she thought I was cheating on her emotionally. She had me cut him out of my life. 

I kept *trying* to be a good partner and take care of her through a big PTSD breakdown that consumed her and meant she couldn't work anymore. I didn't prioritize my mental health AT ALL. Even though I obviously needed a lot of help, too. We had horrible communication and I got very stressed with being sole breadwinner.... in California... which is Butt Expensive! We had stopped having regular sex after she found out about ""The Big Lie"" and that lack of intimacy and love was very hard on me. Whenever we did have sex it was very clumsy and awful... and she never took care of my needs in that department. It was always me doing her... awkwardly....and I could count the number of times on my hand for 2 years...

Fast forward through a lot of heartache and bad communication. We moved across the country so we'd be close to her family... to a place where I knew absolutely no one. She still couldn't work, so I continued to try to support us. My mental health got really bad and I had a psychotic/ bipolar manic breakdown and was forced to be hospitalized. 

Over the next year and a half after that, we had a little more regular sex and I thought things were improving. Although I still had passive suicidal ideation and was very anhedonic and depressed. (So was she) I bought a house for us, with the hopes that getting out of apartment living would help her mental health improve. (I still wasn't deemed crazy enough, because I still could work, so I still couldn't prioritize my mental health...there wasn't enough spare time to take care of both of us)

In the end, we broke up abruptly and without really meaning to, in our new house. We never got officially married, thank God.

We had awful communication the whole way through. Now, after the break up...several awful things have come up that I had no idea she was going through when we were together.  

1. During the few, irregular times we did have sex after The Big Lie, she felt violated Every. Single. Time. Up until the end of our relationship. She didn't communicate that to me ever & so I feel absolutely awful that she was feeling that way and I had no idea. (It was never forced, she just wasn't into it to the extreme and didn't/couldn't communicate that)

2. She feels like I absolutely tore down her sense of self and self worth over the relationship 

3. She was scared of me over most of our relationship

4. Due to some misconstrued requests I made, she felt controlled by me sometimes

I have a history of abuse in my family, + The BPD, so I know I wasn't a perfect partner. There are so many other awful instances of miscommunications and misconstrued intents. I have only touched on the surface of the relationship. 

And now, it seems that I have become an ""evil"" person in her mind. It really hurts because I do have a heart and I'm an empathetic person. This person, who I meant to love & protect & care for & build up... has turned me into a monster in her mind. I know part of all that is the PTSD and bipolar paranoia she deals with...although I hesitate to bring that into this because it sounds like I'm gaslighting. 
The worst part is that I know that a lot of her grief is valid. I'm wondering if I Am a monster.

I literally dropped everything else to be in the relationship, I left my home state, family, and friends to try to make her happy & I really neglected my own mental needs...to the point of having a suicide plan recently... so it feels awful that not only did I fail in this endeavor, she feels like she was abused throughout.

I don't know what to think. I just finally got back with a therapist after several years of only having a psychiatrist. I take 4 psych meds. I don't know if I'm a monster or if her head is/has been skewed or both. 

What I do know is I don't want to feel like the scum of the earth and I don't want to treat another person badly.
Right now I'm so confused and I don't know what really happened! It's somewhere in a grey area, but now she's only seeing black and white. I just feel awful and I had to get all that off my chest. 

Does anyone have any clarity?

127,"Another month, another clash with my stepdaughter","I have an 18 year old stepdaughter who is exactly how I was at 18 before my BPD got diagnosed. She hits every criteria for BPD and that makes it so hard to live with her. The only difference is she doesn't have the empathy or compassion I've come to expect in people with BPD.


I'm usually able to just shut up and ignore her crap. But today I just couldn't. I have a major chemical sensitivity to perfumes and aerosols. It's been that way my entire life and she's known about it for the whole 8 years I've been with my partner. She doesn't give a fuck. I once again reminded her about it. She flipped out. Again.


Apparently me asking her to not wear so much of it is abusive. She also tells her friends and boyfriend (I feel so sad for him, he's vulnerable and she takes advantage of that) that I verbally abuse her every day. Most days I don't speak to her or look at her because it will trigger her into a rage. And she's too gutless to take it out on me, she takes it out in her mother in the most horrible way. Last time she told my partner that she deserved the sexual and physical abuse she got from her ex.


Today I got told I'm faking my chronic illness. I lie constantly. I'm jealous she's so smart and beautiful. Apparently I've spent 8 years trying to get my partner to send her away (wtf?) because I'm so jealous. Then she started sending my partner abusive text messages because she's blocked on my phone and she knows her mother is an easy target who rarely fights back. 


She can go from rage to happy in a split second. She's had so many life long friends dump her and tell her she's toxic since finishing school last year. She's made and lost so many friends this year and of course none of it is her fault. It is usually because they get sick of her push/pull, taking advantage, playing them off against each other and expecting them to drive her everywhere without paying for fuel (how can a friend expect a friend to pay for fuel?!?)


She has no responsibilities. No consequences. Nothing. She refuses to help around the house because she's an adult and doesn't have to. She refuses to clean up her own shit because she knows my partner will do it. She is the reason I nearly walked out this year.


I know I'm not perfect. I know I'm reactive. But I'm trying. I just don't know how much more I can take. She's the only person who can drive me to rage. Thankfully it's a rare thing now, but I'm prone to a physical rage and sometimes I do want to hurt her. I haven't and I most likely never will but God do I want to.

The way she treats her parents is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. But they allow it. Her father is constantly copping her shit then comes to us and says ""I don't know why she's like this"" as he lets her abuse him then still does everything for her any time she asks.


For so many years people have told me she will grow out of it. She's growing into it. I hate to diagnose, but if it's not BPD it's definitely a cluster B disorder. She wants to be a fucking psychologist. Her own psychologist is known in the mental health community to be more harmful than helpful. She's currently being investigated due to some client allegations. She encourages my stepdaughter to play the victim. To use it almost proudly. Tells her that her behaviours are perfectly ok because she's had trauma. Fuck I hate the word trauma now. ""I can't do that, I'm depressed because of my trauma"" every single person on this planet has experienced trauma. This ""psych"" has encouraged her to make a formal complaint against one of her teachers for being abusive to her in class. The poor woman asked her to stop talking. But it made her feel victimised and triggered her PTSD. This doctor has told her she has PTSD and OCD. Nobody can work out how she's come to that conclusion.

128,(TW: Suicidal thoughts),"You can't talk about suicide. You just can't. 

I don't want to live. I've been dealing with the emotional pain (and literal physical pain and discomfort because of the emotional pain) for the better part of a year. My wife left me after 10 years together. She now is back in our old city, has been dating for months and is allegedly 'serious' about someone. 

I can't fall asleep because of the memories of all my awful monstrous behavior. When I do sleep, I wake up and am somehow shocked to discover I'm alone. This is every morning for the last 8 months. 

I've moved three times to try to reboot myself. But it's the same pain every day and it occupies my mind most of the day. I don't know how anyone cries this much. 

2 good friends who know of my diagnosis try to be encouraging. They push me saying things are better, don't think about it, focus on other things. Fellow pwBPD who I respect are understanding and (like my friends) tell me I'm not alone. All these people live in other countries. 

I am alone. I live alone in a small town in a country not my own where I don't speak the language. When these well meaning folks say helpful things; they will shortly put down their phone and live their own lives. 

I don't have and can't afford insurance. Because I'm American, insurance is more expensive for me than any other nationality; and therapists and psychiatrists who are from the English speaking world are exorbitantly expensive.  I no longer take medication because I had to make the choice between rent/food and the hit-or-miss prescription-happy behavior of the medical school psychiatrists I could once afford. 

I want to end my life. I'm told things will get better but they haven't for over 8 months and I see no relief ahead. I'm over 50, I had a great life for several years with her, so I've gotten more than many people do. Now my life is just crying, having the same sad conversations with the same 5 people who must be sick and tired of my same song over and over. 

I want to end my life and this pain.  I'm not allowed to talk about this and neither are you. Forums like this require trigger warnings, reddit has ONE subreddit called 'suicidewatch' which basically represents the entire fucking world's programmed reaction to anyone voicing any thoughts of suicide- stop listening, get that person safe at all costs. Great intentions; but for a person like me it means people share hotlines or videos or articles then go back to their day and forget it all. 

There's only one reason I don't just end my life- the mess that leaves behind. Someone (likely someones who have no idea of my actual situation) would have to deal with my body, the cleanup, Communication with authorities and those few who care about me- and the trauma they would endure. 

But every day it gets harder and harder. Reading books like REASONS TO STAY ALIVE or the hokey elementary condescension of DBT workbooks turn me off and make it worse.  

There's a growing open minded conversation regarding self euthanasia and 'right to die,' but these are centered around people with cancer, terminal physiological illnesses, chronic pain, etc. But hey not me, not pwBPD, we can chin up and buck up and think of other things because our pain is not only less valid- to many it's not even real!! 

I don't know what I want from this post. All I know is I'm focusing a lot of energy on researching painless, inexpensive, and low impact suicide methods. I even looked into ways that would leave no mess, no body- for all intents and purposes I'd just have 'disappeared.' 

And we all know the truth- a few people would be hurt by my disappearance but not many and not for long, because they're loved by people who are physically present. They'll move on and I'll be just a memory. I don't really matter that much. 

My ex is not a good person, I've come to learn; or has drastically changed. Yet I still make sure enough of my income is routed to a bank in her city under her name so she can be ok. I love her still and I know I'd she wanted to be together again I'd crumble and submit to anything she asked. Even though that's a fantasy I know it wouldn't work out. 

But if I died- lets say in a true accident- there's loads of benefits for her and others. She'd inherit our small company and my reputation, I'd become a mascot for our company and organization, she would get the support and sympathy of a widow and be truly free of me so she can be with her new someone freely, and my close friends wouldn't have to bear my daily sadness-by-text. 

I'm so tired. The idea of this as my future is not something I can face anymore. I see no brightness ahead- the only thing I see for sure is another 6-8 months of this life and I do not see any light at the end of that tunnel. 

I once had a life I thought I was dissatisfied with. But now I see it was ambition and drive for more that blinded me to the happiness i had before me. 

I have moments when I think ok, I feel a bit stable- but so far these periods of time are never longer than a few hours. 

Today I won't try to take my life. But it's harder every day and suicide is tempting. 

I hope society can normalize talking about death, suicide, and mental/emotional challenges without judgment (and knee jerk reactions of medication, institutionalization etc ARE judgmental).  Maybe if there was a way to openly discuss these feelings without fear of being treated like that, and without fear of the conversation hurting others who suffer, then maybe people like me could find some answer. 

I think that answer is normalizing suicide. A structure that provides non judgmental realistic exploration of the potential reasons to die or not die; allowing the suicidal person the opportunity to make a truly informed choice. 

I know I'm posting this in reddit. I know there are no safe subreddits. I'm preparing myself for the trolls... or maybe I'm hoping their cruelty will motivate me to stop being a fucking coward and just end it. 

I wish I didn't feel this way and instead could offer genuine support to others suffering here. Instead I'm just taking up too much space- look at how much I've written now already, demanding attention. I'm disgusted with myself. 

I guess that's my rant. If you read this far thank you, and I'm sorry if it was hurtful or unpleasant in any way.",1615514627.0,False,27,11,IraJohnson,None,m36wo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/m36wo2/tw_suicidal_thoughts/
129,I fear I'm doomed to never be the father I was meant to be.,"How can I actually believe I'll be an amazing dad someday like I want and visualise so desperately. I always wanted to be the fun adventurous goofy golden retriever like dad. My partner wants me to throw in a mix of my rancher man, assertive, calm grounded and sometimes stern side which I also totally see as my dynamic. I see this so clearly and I want it so bad with her I think I could strive to be a perfect dad without leaving my character or struggling at all. 

Before I met my partner and healed significantly my fear was my splitting and rage. I couldn't control it I would always fear I was a loaded gun and would not be able to regulate my emotions and accidentally release it on my kids. I'm not ready quite yet of course I need some more years of consistency. But at this point I'm fully confident I will be able to heal enough to never EVER repeat my cycle of abuse. But now I fear something different and in a way much much worse. 

My partner recently asked me something along the lines of what would be my reaction if I got news my mum died. She's constantly on the brink of death and spiralling so that wasn't too odd a question especially since I was dodging another call. To my discomfort and disappointment I realised I wouldn't shed a tear over it. I told her that after giving it some proper thought, and I can exactly imagine the scenario I can literally put myself there. Imagine the text coming in from my sister. Hearing she took it too far. Considering details like she's in Australia and the news would come delayed. And I know I wouldn't feel that level of devestation. Sadness for sure, heavy sadness. She's been alone for so long. Yearning for her lost children, dead brother, and drinking herself into oblivion. And that's a depressing thought I would feel a lot of guilt. But in a fucked way I was over all more sad about all the stories she was yet to tell me that I was curious about. Backstory on her, my father, them together, my childhood, my ancestors etc. Less about the actual loss of her as a mother or even a person in my life. 

Then Maddie asked about my dad. My dad recently has had a major shift of character and has come through for the first time in my life as a shadow of 20% of an actual father. Once again I thought I would feel particularly sad because of his character arc and the level of genuine love and care he's shown for me recently. And it would hurt a lot. Especially sting because of that but... Ultimately my biggest fear and thought would be losing what little financial security he offered. And the major opportunity in the future of taking over his company after getting my MBA and working under him for some years like we've set up. 

Maddie is never like this at all, but she rolled her eyes at me annoyed and said I sounded like an edgy teenager and I wasn't considering this clearly. She didn't believe me. But I'm not in the slightest worked up about them and I'm pretty damn good at picturing these things completely realistically. 

There's a reason though. I mean I'm not a complete monster. The problem is she wouldn't even feel like a mother dying to me. Someone who I love and care for sure. I would be deeply sad, but I wouldnt feel the anguish of losing a mother. I never even got a mother figure. My mum was an alcoholic who for the short period of time I lived with her I had to mother, provide and clean up after myself. My father isn't much better he left me to an actual psychopath of a step mum for my entire childhood while he was away on his business trips, well aware of a significant portion of what she was doing to me. And when he was home he was explosively abusive. (It wasn't torture but it fucked me up mentally with my own emotional regulation) They will never be able to be my parents in my head I could never internalise that even if I wanted to. They never became that figure in my life or even showed me what that could look like from the start.

I realised the absolute lack of desire or understanding of a parental figure a while ago when my sister was sobbing to me as a teenager telling me all she wanted was a mother figure. And I remember comforting her but thinking in my head that was downright stupid. Absolutely no empathy for that feeling myself, I had no desire or longing for a mother figure or father for that matter. My sister has much much better memory than me of early on in our lives. She was also in general treated much better so it makes sense that pain and longing was established for her.


The thing is I don't think my partner Maddie can extend me that empathy for my detachment because despite her parents horrible neglect and abuse of her, even surpassing mine (and mine is bat shit insane levels) especially her father jesus fucking christ. She still loves his ass. She still insists on seeing him, keeping an (admittedly very distant and ghosty) relationship with him. She still has forgiven and sees her mother truly as her mother, and a good one at that. The bar is in hell. I think her mother deserves to be forgiven for being a heroin abusing drug dealing addict because of her situation and trauma sure. But jesus christ her dad, he did absolutely unthinkable things to her. And he didn't even have the trauma to back it up. Even if according to her he stopped abusing meth and calmed the fuck down recently... 

Though hardly even really fucking true since she's worried about me repeatedly meeting him because he may get abusive or aggressive with her and of course I would defend her. And apparently her dad may try to start a fight with my ass if I set boundaries with him. (Just from the scenario of me warning him assertively and calmly that I'll take her back home and he won't see her for a while if he doesn't quit it and stabilise) He's 6'4 and over 30 but he's literally an emotionally stunted baby. Also if he hurt her I wouldn't be worried about fucking losing at all but the fact she has to worry about that says enough. This is turning into a completely off topic side vent my point is she is an incredibly forgiving person even for her bpd jealous bf of a dad. Her mum had a turn around so fair enough ig. And even though she had to parent her baby brother for her mother from a very young age, I think she was able to establish and connect with her at some point earlier on. It helps she has an incredibly good memory of her early childhood especially considering her trauma level. Maybe it's all rooted in that. I'd have to give it more thought why she is like this and what I lack. Other than her insane amount of emotional intelligence maturity and empathy of course. Maybe not so much with her attachment to her parents lol.

And she seems like despite all her shit she's made to be an amazing mother. She's so mature and calm and prepared and affectionate and intelligent and understanding ugh the list goes on. She's fucking set. I mean she's swamped on the kid side of tiktok and is far far down the path of studying psychology surrounding childhood development and parenting. She's very confident and has already set out very clearly how our kids will be properly supported and parented by us. I mean theres rules lol and I can't argue them she knows what she's talking about. We must undo our generational trauma and set them up for complete success. 

But I'm still nervous. So nervous. Especially after giving thought to and realising that revelation about my true feelings towards my parents and why. How can I be the dream dad I envision for myself when I never even had a glimpse of the real thing my entire life. There's no foundation not even subconscious. Never had any idea of what a parental figure even really was. She can help lead me a little and I have the passion and dedication to do this right but god I feel like in a deeper way to my core and maybe even developed character over time I'm just fucked in this regard. 

But I keep imagining myself in those golden retriever, goofy, adventurous, assertive rancher dad scenarios and I do truly think that's just me and I could nail it naturally (assuming I'm fully healthy which I wouldn't dare have children unless that was done for years first) 

Doesn't matter. Fucked inherently or not I'll try my absolute hardest and bring all the love, support and healthiness to my children that I was never given. 

I'm so awkward around kids too I get scared of them that doesn't help things. I gotta go practice with them a lot before.

Fostering puppies didn't do enough unfortunately to set me up here either. Maybe in regards to dealing with constant wet diarrhoea...",1681031130.0,False,6,3,traumatisedtransman,None,12ge26l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/12ge26l/i_fear_im_doomed_to_never_be_the_father_i_was/
130,The victim in me,"
I’m writing this because I often avoid the pending anxieties that ding at the top of my nose. That’s where I feel it. Thoughts clouding my vision. I can no longer see myself. My stomach saturates with guilt. Panic like protein for my insecurity. Bone on bone. I have been shedding layers. It’s been nearly two years of this. I’m writing this because my brain is in constant fight or flight. I’m left with a very weak will to live. I am in survival mode at all times. There is a victim inside of me. She screams for my help. For my attention. I often ignore her. Tonight I will not only listen to her, hear her, comfort her. But I will let her speak. The person I want to be and the person that I was and the person I am all sit inside of my body. They each have different dreams, personalities, fears, insecurities. I am none of them and all of them. I am nothing and everything. I don’t know who I am. I am lost. And I’ll admit that. The way other people see me, the way they feel about me, the way they treat me and the way they don’t is something I obsess over. I have an urgency to gain the acceptance and love of others. I have a frequency to prove I can gain it. So I can love myself. I set limits on my own self love contingent on the love I receive from others. This is because I have a deeply routed fear of being abandoned. Being forgotten. Being replaced. Watching energy shift. Watching people grow out of me. Fall out of love with me. Out of friendship with me. I would do anything to reverse this fear. To be self sufficient and self loving. I often attract careless people. I often attract intentionally harmful people. I often attract specifically harmful people. I am sensitive to others. I am hurt easily. I attach easily. I detach easily. It is painful. It is exhausting. It is harmful. I have spent the last two years running from hard truths. My life has changed forever. I am incapable of returning to the way I felt and the way I saw the world before these events. I tried to heal on my own. I made a mess. I trusted everyone I knew. It was a mistake. I shared my deepest painful secret with my closest friends. It was a mistake. I confused friendship for therapy and I thought my transparency with my trauma would grant me some kind of rain check on life. Life kept moving. I did not. I lost myself entirely. I could not look myself in the eyes. My relationships with people I loved very deeply changed. My relationship with simple things like food and sleep changed. I could feel myself going crazy. Misdiagnosed. Drugged. Lost. And losing it. I became dependent on things. People. Drugs. Alcohol. Spending money. I thought if I could just stay manic. I could stay sane. I could be happy. The more I would open up, the heavier I would feel. I started to feel lonely. I became complacent. I started praying that God himself would wipe my existence from this earth. I prayed that I could run very away and become a new person. I still pray for this. I had a very hard year. Mental illness is not a small thing. I am the captain of a very large ship and I do not know the first thing about the sea. I’ve never driven a boat. The water is aggressive. I have several diagnoses and several pending. I have not been transparent with many people about my experiences with mental health. I think it’s because I care so deeply to be accepted by others and it is defining me. Taking me from my truths. I have had to remove people from my life. I have had to fully detach myself to grasp at what peace would feel like in my head. I am consumed by the idea and the fear that the people I love the deepest will eventually leave me. That they hate me. That they have never loved me. So I fulfill this and prove my fear correct by detaching. By running. When I see that no one has chased me, it is now not peace I feel from knowing I was right all along. It is my fight or flight. It is overwhelming anxiety. It is insecurity that now my deepest darkest painful secrets are now public record. That whatever hate I feared before is amplified. I often attract people with a specific trait. People who know everyone’s business, tell everyone’s business to everyone, talk horribly about the people that love them. Make others believe they would never do this to them because they are somehow immune. Lack empathy. Create a chaotic and mutually symbiotic environment that is in no way beneficial to either party. Create abusive cycles in which they with hold their love and support. This invents a competitive Olympic codependent gymnastics where I reinforce their ego and lack of empathy by falling to my knees and discarding whatever healthy pride I have preserved in order to service them. I remember being moments away from killing myself but instead responding to a text about a hookup crisis. My pain was never valid. My family member passed away. I was devastated. The day of the funeral I was having an anxiety attack because I needed to be of service to someone. The clock had started. I was afraid if I didn’t reach out and prove my service, they would have no reason to comfort me while i grieved. I was afraid I would altogether lose them. I have been so afraid of losing people that I have gripped on to them. Gone out of my way to check on them. Take care of them. Listen to them. I became a service industry. Still unhealed. Exhausted. People I had made permanent places for in my life had been revealing their true colors to me. I found out one of my friends had developed a deep routed hate for me during this transitional and life altering period in my life. Saying terrible things about me to others and plotting their exit. This person ghosted me. Can I blame them? I am suffering from the residuals of deeply routed sexual traumas. The PTSD infiltrates my brain in many forms. I also suffer from borderline personality disorder. Body dysmorphia. Disordered eating. Major depression. Anxiety. Panic Disorder. ADHD. I fight myself daily to accomplish any goals. Sometimes I’m lucky if I brush my teeth. My exhaustion is defeating. I have dreams. Big dreams. Sometimes I think maybe I should kill myself before I have to live to see them never come true. I compare myself to everyone I see on the internet. I have low self esteem. I have a college degree. I cannot hold a job. I cannot find a job to hold. Everything feels like it was all for nothing. But still I have hope. Despite spending all of my energy on the worry of what others think of me. I have hope. I have friends. I have family. I am not hopeless. Not anymore. But I am lost. And I feel like a victim to my own life. I’m trying to take control of the way I feel and push myself into the wings I’m expecting to grow in. I am being to forceful. Too impatient. I am harming myself. Stunting my growth. Haulting my healing. People want explanations from me. I don’t have one to give. I am in pain. I am suffering from my own mind. I am trapped inside my body. I am trying to find my way out. I am trying to find my peace. Pray for me. Please someone pray for me. Tell me my feelings are valid. Tell me to stop blaming myself for the things I can’t change. Give me a shortcut to healing. Show me a cheat sheet. Hand me the blueprint. This came with no instructions. I’m exhausted. I’m trying to keep my momentum. I’m trying to push myself farther but not harder. The added stress will only make me shut down and turn off. I am in need of kind words and encouragement. I am in desperate need of love.",1604740418.0,False,7,2,sadbutveryhotbutsad,None,jpnslz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/jpnslz/the_victim_in_me/
131,"REALIZED I HAVE BPD....SUPPLEMENTS? 5HTP, GABA?","ill try to make this brief,even though we all know  BPD Struggle is far from...

i think i have been dealing with BPD all my life but i never quite knew it..

in hindsight i can see where BPD played a role in a lot of situations throughout my life..

2 years ago on my birthday i had a huge panic attack i thought i was going to die, i was smoking weed,drinking and i took some pills..i still dont know wtf they were...then my heart started beating..my vision started getting blurry..i was seeing white...it was like i was dieing...i was taken to the ER...i left the ER and was experiencing depersonalization and derealization for the first time ever...my gf left the next day and i was left by myself with this horrible fuckin feeling...

i stayed in that house for months...i couldnt even leave the house..i would go buy food at 2 or 3 in the morning..i was smoking weed even though the weed instantly gave me panic attacks..i was just hoping that it would fix me somehow...i stayed in this horrible state for months..non stop panic attacks..no sleep...barely eating...shut off from the world..having to fake like i was okay when i spoke with my mother...i cant worry her..i couldn't tell her that i wanted to kill myself and that looking in the mirror i did not recognize myself..

 time goes by...cant work...cant function..im just in hell all day 24/7

its been a while and i dont really feel depersonalized anymore but my emotions are out of control...like on a severe level...

for the longest i was so focused on the DP/DR that i never took the time to look at the cause of the anxiety..i was so focused on treating anxiety and dp/dr but this last month my girlfriend broke up with me because i had an instance of ""splitting"" i guess they call it and for the very first time i actually noticed that my way of thinking is waaay screwed up.....i finally see alot of the BPD symptoms...i now know that i don't think like everyone else...im always thinking negative...typical bpd things like the black and white..the favorite person...the splitting..and the shame...guilt...all these things i had been feeling my whole life...but before it was manageable...i was able to function...i didnt ever think about suicide..but after that huge panic attack and dp/dr/depression/ it seems my BPD is just fuckin exploded full force and all those symptoms are flaring all day....im sensitive as hell..on edge

i cant function...the only thing keeping me calm is a benzo..klonapin...that takes the anxiety away but without it...i feel like ill fall back into the pitts of dp/dr...i have been taking it for a while..maybe 2 years?

My  ex gf broke up with me after i had an instance where i ""split"" because she didnt answer my phone call it was scary.......fear of abandonement kicked in and everything else aswell..but thanks to her breaking up with me...i came to the realization that im not just dealing with extreme anxiety...but that i have deeper problems like bpd...

my thoughts are suicidal and negative all the time but now i am aware of the thoughts and i am aware that i am thinking incorrectly..i know can see and observe...where as before i didnt...i just felt the emotions and  rolled with them unknowingly...

ive done my due diligence on several other disorders...bipolar..bipolar 2..schizophrenia..etc but BPD describes me down to a T..it finally makes sense..any thoughts?opinions??questions??

theres more to the story such as im not in the U.S which is where i was raised till the age of 19, i was deported for buying alcohol with a fake id.

i was sent  to a 3rd world country..people dont speak the language and i cant relate,ive been here for 8 years and all that stress was probably building till the mind just couldn't handle it anymore? causing me to dissociate..?

but why the severe BPD?

i am always on the brink of tears..i am agitated and sad...suicidal thoughts are most of my day..i remember my ex gf and i feel guilty because i put her through alot of bad moments in life...from her witnessing me having to go to the ER to a lot of emotional abuse,she is a sweetheart.. truly beautiful..she not once disrespected me ever..so when i think of those times...my anxiety instantly revs up..and i start thinking suicidal thoughts due to the guilt and negative self talk..racing thoughts etc... its like its happening all over again...i feel pathetic because i fucked up bad and put her through hell..

i know i shouldnt feel that way beacause i really dont think im too much at fault,the bpd was fucking my life up for the longest and i had no clue..now i challenge my thoughts,meditate,supplement,trying to do CBT...wish there was DBT here but there is not...im really down and out..i feel alone...im isolated...i think im what is considered a quiet borderline...why? because no one here speaks english..i have no family here in this country.. gf left me..no medical help...i cant even express my thoughts concerns or anything...if only someone here spoke some english..that would be helpful i feel...situation sucks...i've begun to kind of tip my family off to the fact that suicide is something i consider alot...its horrible i don't want to make them sad but this sucks...i cant go on this way...they are in the U.S. and i cant see them..they cant come here and i cant go back to the U.S. im kind of trying to ease the idea of me not being here but at the same time i feel horrible doing so..

I HAVE 2 SISTERS,AND MY MOTHER..I AM THE ONLY MALE..FATHER IS OUT THE PICTURE..

Help anyone?  
sometimes a kind word works wonders for me

SUPPLEMENTS TAKEN..OMEGA 3,POTASSIUM,VITAMIN B COMPLEX,VITAMIN D,MAGNESIUM,VITAMIN A,CENTRUM DAILY VITAMIN FOR MEN,MELATONIN EVERY OTHER MONTH...

THINKING OF TRYING 5HTP AND GABA....THEY JUST CAME IN THE MAIL.

i can elaborate more but im going to try and sleep now...just thought id post something quickly about supplements but it turned into this...  


i find comfort in youtube channels such as BIGNOKNOW,DR DANIEL FOX,NOAH ELKRIEF AND DIVING DEEP INFINITE WATERS,RALPH SMART..

132,Reflections After 1 Year of DBT,"  Hey there Reddit, so I wanted to do this for myself, but I know that I found these sorts of posts helpful when I was just starting my recovery journey. I post this here in the hopes that it helps one person, because having been through this shit, I know how difficult it is, and how much better things CAN get, with a combination of luck, effort, and the right therapist. None of that shit is easy to find, and I feel extremely fortunate to no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for BPD. It was the hardest thing I’ve done in my life to point – harder than college, harder than working 80 hours per week in a job I hated, harder than the nights I laid in bed crying with emotional pain. There’s a dialectic between “it’s worth the effort” and “the effort takes a LOT out of you” that I want to strike right up top here, because I know this shit doesn’t go quite so smoothly for everyone. Just know that I’m wishing all of you luck, better days, and skillful means <3

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So today marks the one year anniversary of my first visit with \[my therapist\]. I don’t honestly know if that truly “counts” as a year in DBT, since there were a few sessions we had before I formally committed, but I’m finished with group and scaling back to one-on-ones every other week, and hopefully once a month by the end of the year. So it does feel like an important date to both mark and celebrate, and a good opportunity to reflect in a bigger-picture way than I tend to do. 

It’s honestly a bit difficult to remember my mindset back then. Not to say I don’t remember the struggles and the pain of searching for the right therapist, but in a very real way I feel like a fundamentally different person now compared to when I started. So it’s both tricky and a bit painful to recall that time, because I was truly adrift. I’d quit my job with no notice after a full-on breakdown, had flown out to see my family and barely survived the trip. I knew my older brother, who I was staying with, had a gun in his house, and I remember needing to tell him NOT to let me know where it was, or how to access it. There have been some low points since then, but that trip stands out as the last truly difficult thing I went through before getting started with DBT, so I do think that’s noteworthy. 

I do remember having quite a bit of shame that I even “needed” DBT, or any sort of therapy, to start with. I was raised to believe that your problems are self-created, and I felt like if I had caused myself all of this emotional distress, there MUST be some way I could fix it by myself. I tried that for a few months, and it was a spectacular failure. I tried reaching out to non-DBT therapists, tried BetterHelp (should be called BetterNotHopeForHelp), tried just looking up resources online – I was aware of DBT, and that it was considered quite effective at treating what I was dealing with, but I was also aware it was a major commitment, and part of me still held out hope that I could salvage the burning building that was my internal reality without having to accept that there wasn’t much worth saving, and that the right move was to let it burn down to the foundations and start rebuilding. I’ve always been a bit jealous of those who got ID’d at a younger age, I think that process would have been less intimidating in my 20s, but the idea of essentially starting my life over at 34 just seemed too daunting. 

There was also a lot of shame at the beginning that I didn’t know any of the shit that DBT was teaching me – in a lot of ways, it felt like needing to take remedial classes in being human. It wouldn’t be until I was around six months in that I read through the DBT workbook cover to cover, and came across Marsha’s quote that “’Aren’t these skills your mother was supposed to teach you?’ I always say yes, but for many people their mother just did not or was not able to get around to it.” That was a big perspective shift for me - I don’t know why I expected myself to know things I was never taught, but that alone went a long way for me.

While the past year has been extremely difficult, it’s also not an exaggeration to say it’s the best year I’ve ever had as an adult. I managed to find a fairly validating environment in college, which I think went a long way to heading off the worst of my symptoms (though there are a few breakdowns that I glossed over at the time that stand out with the clarity of hindsight), but honestly I don’t know that I was ever happy after college. 12 full fucking years of misery before I could swallow my pride to reach out for help – I wish I’d done it sooner, but I also don’t know if I would have been ready for it then. Everyone has their own path, and maybe mine needed to go through a long and undeniable valley of torment to get me there. Maybe it didn’t, but no amount of regret can change the past, and I do think knowing just how deep that well went helped me stay committed during the tough times, of which there were many.

I also can’t help but reflect on how incredibly lucky I’ve been throughout this process.  When I first reached out to \[my therapist\], she wasn’t taking on new patients, but I guess I sounded desperate enough on the phone that she squeezed me in. Given how well a fit we ended up being, I can’t help but wonder if I would have gotten to where I am with another therapist. I don’t know how I would have felt about being “rejected” by the first DBT therapist I had the courage to reach out. Despite how badly I was struggling, I was very much in the “I’m sure I’m actually faking all of this shit” vortex that many of us on the quieter end of the spectrum struggle with. I might have taken that as evidence that, actually, I wasn’t even struggling that bad, that so many people had it worse than I did, that I didn’t deserve help, and that I was a true piece of shit for thinking that I did, even for a moment. I’d like to think I would have found my way to DBT sooner or later, but knowing how I was at the time, I’m very unsure and it’s scary to think what my life would look like now if I didn’t. I also can’t overstate how much having a great match with my therapist helped – I didn’t trust her right off the bat, but by a few months in I trusted her pretty much unconditionally. I don’t know that I’ve EVER trusted another person as much as I trust her, and I don’t know that this whole thing would have stuck without that trust. 

So I’ve talked about this idea of “changing” quite a bit in these journals, and it is that, but it’s maybe closer to reclaiming (or just plain claiming) an authentic self. My self-hatred went so deep. I knew all of the worst parts of myself, and I fucking detested them, was disgusted by them, couldn’t even stand to look at myself in the mirror or reflect on what I was feeling because it was so much easier to just deny and numb with an insane workload to keep me occupied during the day, and enough weed to drown out my own internal monologue at night. I’m still not sure that I love myself – that self-loathing was such a prominent feature of my existence for so long that it’s fair to say that only a year of work, even if it was incredibly hard work, wasn’t enough to completely undo that. But, I accept myself, and I think I even like myself. I wouldn’t have thought either of those things were possible at the start of the process (at least not the self that I actually ended up embracing – I was more interested in becoming a different person than I accepting the person I was). And, to be fair, despite my optimism about DBT, I didn’t have a whole lot of confidence in what was actually possible at the start of the program. When \[my therapist\] asked for long-term goals, I REALLY struggled to come up with them, because I thought that what I wanted wasn’t possible, at least not for me.

And I guess that leads me to the now, and my worries about what comes next. I’ve been a bit depressed since I got my results that I no longer meet the diagnostic criteria – I knew it was coming, but I think a part of me was holding out hope that there was some secret trick that would be revealed to me once I got to that point. And maybe I’m discounting the extent to which that did happen, but not in the “fit it on a bumper sticker” sort of simplicity I wanted. DBT has provided me with a path, the tools to stay on it, and the tools to come back to it when I wander off it (and I expect I will continue to wander off it. I tend to think success is measured more by your ability to come back rather than your ability to never stray). I suppose it’s a bit more muddled than that – there wasn’t a day when I suddenly woke up and knew the way, no more than there was a day when I woke up and realized I was no longer a child but an adult. That liminal space between the two is more massive than I think I anticipated, and only now towards the end of the process am I able to look back over my life and really appreciate and feel just how far I’ve come.

Among the many things that DBT has brought into my life, I think one of the most lasting will be end up an appreciation of Buddhist philosophies. I don’t think I realized just how baked in those practices are until after reaching Marsha’s autobiography and seeking them out myself. But, this passage still makes me happy-cry every time I read it. The author uses the word “awakening”, but I think you can just as easily substitute “recovery” or “building a life worth living” or whatever else you want. It really gets that the “two steps forward, one step back” nature of the process, and what I anticipate the next steps will look like for me. 

“But no sooner is (awakening) glimpsed than it is gone. Cessation of craving is like a momentary gap in the clouds. The sun shines brilliantly for a few moments, only to be covered over again. We find ourselves back in the humbling fog of anguish, craving, habit, restlessness, distraction. But with a difference: now we know where this track goes…

Henceforth, the resolve to cultivate this path becomes unwavering yet entirely natural. It is simply what we do…Awakening is no longer seen as something to attain in the distant future, for it is not a thing but a process – and this process is the path itself. But neither does this render us in any way perfect or infallible. We are quite capable of subverting this process to the interests of our far-from-extinct desires, ambitions, hatreds, jealousies, and fears. We have not been elevated to the lofty heights of awakening; awakening has been knocked off its pedestal into the turmoil and ambiguity of everyday life.”

0,Seoquel/quetiapine side effects & any alternatives,"Hello, anyone on quetiapine experience any of these side effects as I am not sure whether it is to do with who I am or if the pills have a contribution. I have been on this since February (almost 7 months) and I greatly believe it has helped with my suicidal thoughts as I do not experience these nearly as much as I did and I sometimes think if the benefits are that great but last year I genuinely cried daily, self harmed (haven't in 6 months+) and had attempted (also to do with stressful life situations). I was on 25mg, then 50 for a couple-few months but dropped back to 25mg as I don't think my body could handle it as I always felt sick. I was previously on sertraline which worsened my bpd mood swings but it also made me feel sick everyday so I don't know if medication is just a bit detrimental to me. Anyway, negatively, I would say i had an ED last year, lost a stone on sertraline but I eat normal again and have put it back on and a few pounds more but overall have maintained my weight however, I am a very active person, 20,000-30,000 steps a day + gym & I don't overeat so I genuinely think if I was not so active I would have gained a lot of weight on these pills. The main problem other than sickness I have recently is forgetfulness. Granted I have always been forgetful but one week recently I left my bag in a bar recently in another city, left my phone in a shop the next day & then left my glasses in an uber that weekend. I googled it and it said that seroquel can dampen your brain memory and I just feel myself being constantly worried I am going to forget something & believing I am stupid when I do. Additionally, my energy levels are always low which I fathom and I take hours to force myself to do something.

5,Is weed a medicine for my emptiness or a crutch?,"When I realized I had BPD, it came as a relief to be able to give a name to the subtle wrong feeling I've always lived with: emptiness. Not quite depression, not quite anger. An absence of contentment and in it's place uncomfortable uncertainty. Waking up and my first thought of the day being ""did I do something wrong yesterday?"" 

I don't always feel this way. Sometimes, when things are going really well or I receive praise or have sex or good luck I feel all the good feelings. I enjoy these times but I no longer trust the feelings. They are a great natural high, probably the best high, and like all highs they don't last.

But I can bring the good feelings back anytime I want, with weed. Take me at my emptiest: give me some bad news on a day when I am already full of emptiness and I'll be a despondent mess, unable to smile, seeking isolation, crying and wanting to be asleep. I smoke some weed and voila, I'm back baby, all grins, improvised songs, making bids for the attention of my loved ones, giving back rubs, eventually falling into deep untroubled sleep in my bed, relaxed, comfortable as I've ever been.

""Why are you such a pothead"" I've been asked many times over the years and I've never known how to answer. Dunno, I like to get high I guess? ""Can you even go a day without your weed?"" ""Why do you have to be high all the time?"" These assholes questions throw shade, imply a weakness, a lack of self control, a tendency for escapism. I'm not weak, and I have decent self control. But yes, I do like to escape the goddamn emptiness because I want to live rather than cry.

The assholes have a point though. Weed has side effects that make it unsuitable for use all the time. If I use it during the day I become less productive and too inwardly focused, less interested in other people, happy but dumb. 

I have a busy life, a family and a job, volunteer work, home renos to do, appointments to get to, and I can't be dumb during the day when all my responsibilities need tending to. So years ago I settled on the routine of waiting until the evening to indulge. Although I may have felt emptiness during the busy day, I could always look forward to collapsing into comfort for an hour or two before a delicious sleep. 

It's not a perfect system because I still need to endure the emptiness throughout the day. And there are still side effects from the weed, like hazy memory, and difficulty waking up at 5:30am when I like to go to the gym.

And I also wonder if my regular weed use contributes to the emotional disregulation I feel as a person with BPD. Weed has been part of my life for so long, I can't clearly remember what I'm like without it.

So there are more than enough reasons to quit weed, at least for awhile. And I have tried to do this, many many times, and yet I keep coming back to it. 

The last time I took a break from weed was a few years back. The break was about three months long. I was proud of myself for being able to put it down and I even started to wonder why I used to do it every day. I felt a sense of freedom from having to go through the same rituals every day. 

The evenings were hard. I found myself craving some kind of special treat and ended up drinking alcohol more often. I found the best way to cope with evening emptiness was to throw myself into creative projects. As long as my hands were busy I was usually distracted from the emptiness until bedtime. I had to keep moving. I was more productive. I had a harder time sitting still.

Maybe one day some a pharmaceutical company will make a drug that contains the parts of weed that combat emptiness, without the side effects. 

I would love to hear from others with BPD. Has weed been helpful and does it have side effects?",1680373379.0,False,11,14,bpdlearnerburner,None,128ubhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/128ubhw/is_weed_a_medicine_for_my_emptiness_or_a_crutch/

I have ADHD and BPD, and ive been in treatment for a year (schema group and individual therapy). Its been real hard and slow work, but it has been very beneficial. 

However since ive been put on the appropriate ADHD meds (dexamphetamine) that actually work for me and dont make me feel horrible, ive been making progress wayyy faster than before. I can think clearer, i dont dissasociate as badly so i can actually work through emotions better. Im more present in the group, and its easier to connect.

Overall its a whole new world for me. I had never experienced actually being calm in my head, without also feeling numb (used to be on ritalin, which had very negative side effects in my case). And it feels like i can finally profit from all the hard work id been doing in therapy.

10,"Medication (lamptrigine, CBD, THC)","Hey everyone, I (F25) am struggling with medication at the moment and would appreciate some insight from those with personal experience 

DISCLAIMER: I have a fab team of doctors monitoring all my conditions, but I would like some real-life advice. 

TLDR: Does lamotrigine make it *impossible* for you to get out of bed in the morning? Has it increased your libido? Do these side effects eventually wear off? Changing from cannabis to CBD oil, thoughts? 

Bit of a long one here. 

I have chronic pain from Endometriosis as well as BPD and Bipolar 2. 

I was on a cocktail of medication, and I impulsively stopped all of my medication (except 1) in December 2022. I was taking nortiptiline (for pain) for a while until we realized it stimulated manic episodes (bipolar 2), so we switched to pregabalin, but that made me severely depressed, and I experienced some neurological symptoms (inability to speak/form sentences, brain fog etc). This is mainly what led to my impulsive decision to stop all my meds. 

I am now re-introducing my medication, one at a time, so I can pinpoint which side effects come from which medication. So far I have reintroduced tramadol (pain) lamotrigine (BPD + Bipolar 2), celecoxib (pain), and occassional SR tramadol (pain flares). 

Due to my pain, my sex life is pretty much non-existent, and my partner (M30) has been so patient with me through all of this. I recently started lamotrigine again (2 weeks ago) on a 50mg dose. My libido has increased significantly! We are talking every day, when prior to this, it may have been once or twice a month. However, I find it *impossible* to get out of bed in the mornings. 

- has anyone experienced the changes to sleep and libido when starting lamotrigine? Does it get better over time? I want to keep the increased libido, but I'm not sure if it is worth the struggle in the morning. Am I taking the medication too late (10 pm normally)?

I also use cannabis to help with my pain, anxiety, and erratic mood swings. I know that cannabis isn't the best for us with BPD. 

- has anyone switched from using cannabis to CBD oil (minimal THC content)? I recently had a consult at a cannabis clinic and am considering using the CBD oil instead, but I'm not sure if this will give me the same relief from pain and anxiety.

16,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

17,What works best for you?,"Hi all!

I have been on the long and exhausting journey of finding the right medication combo for the side effects of my BPD. I am also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder w/ Agoraphobia, and PTSD. But, I believe my Borderline is the biggest disruption, as it triggers all of my other disorders.

I have huge abandonment issues, causing me to feel like it's next to impossible to let go of people, ideas, irrational thoughts, etc.). My irritability is moderate. My depression is severe, it comes with suicidal ideations. Lastly, my anxiety is on and off, but when it's bad, it is debilitating.

I am currently on Prozac 20mg x1, Hydroxyzine 50mg x3, Clonidine .02mg x3, Trazodone 100mg x1, Zofran 4mg xAs needed, and Adderall 30mg XR x1.

I have tried numerous other medications, but my med management has been a mess since August 2020. I have been put on and taken off so many medications, I am not sure what has made things worse or helped out (even though, I don't feel like I have been stable since March 2020).

19,I don't feel much lust/love due to meds,"I've tried different meds over the span of ten years and I finally found a antidepressant and mood stabilizer that works great for my anger. But unfortunately I can't pick and choose what emotions medications choose to suppress and all have just surpressed everything at once. Meaning the intense anger and depression is gone but so is my hyper dorky intense self that other people miss too. And I can't feel much in the way of emotions in general. It's pretty mild. I don't feel much love or lust anymore ether. The person I'm seeing thinks I'm not interested because as much as I want to feel as if I'm into him, (which I am btw and I was most definitely until the medication) I just feel numb. I feel unphased about alot of things. And it's really nice to have a break from constantly worrying and stressing over intense emotions, but I miss having those parts of my life were I felt intense in other ways. I feel like part of who I am has been taken from me. 

In saying this, I've tried every medication on the market under the list that I can afford for bpd. None as good as this one for my anger. And my anger really really needed to be under control before someone got hurt. Threapy does not work for me no matter the type.

I also scored super high on antisocial and narcissistic traits, and I'm not sure how to feel about that, even though I know it's true. I know that having this disorder doesn't make me evil, but it felt like the psychiatrist was calling me that. The hospital people put me on Latuda (I'm on 3 other things too, and one doesn't work so I'm tapering off) and told me that I have to get a DBT therapist instead of the psychodynamic one I've been seeing for 6 years and love very much. They also referred me to a partial program, which I start tomorrow.

I'm really nervous. I'm in a lot of pain. I have rage episodes when I'm alone, and panic attacks, and I drink and cut myself. My mood swings are intense, and I go between being tired, and just hating everyone and wanting to hurt them. I'm also bipolar and am having a depressive episode right now. I know I have to stop these behaviors, but I don't know much about DBT or the coping skills that are part of it, and I'm afraid that it won't help me. I want it to, but part of me is scared to get better. I know I have to talk about the negative ways I think about people and myself, and the violent impulses, but I have so much shame. I'm also autistic and have meltdowns from overstimulation and social situations, and I struggle with communication and talking, so it's hard to gauge what is BPD and needs to be fixed with DBT, and what is autism and would be harder/unethical to try to change. I don't want my therapist to mix up the two and hurt me.

The doctors also want me to go back on lithium. I was on it for 7 years and it really helped me, but the side effects ended up being sooo bad. I think it might be best to go back on it, though, because I feel like my mind has been punishing me since I went off.

24,need some insight,"TW some ED and SH and S**cide mentions

So basically rn I'm 16. About 3 years ago I started having problems with depression and anxiety due to many factors including a huge move overseas and some serious cyber bullying from people close to me. With lockdown happening not much later everything because worst especially with the isolation and all that. I also did start having social media and pretty quickly got into the ""quirky depression"" side of tiktok but soon removed the app because I realised how stupid it was. 

Then the depression got pretty bad and it got to the point where I would sleep at 5 am everyday after spending hours in my bed doing nothing bit literally just crying. Sorry if I'm skipping things or not explaining properly I'm not very good with explaining. Also later on the suicidal thoughts were very frequent and for a few months they were very hard to get out of my head. 

I also started developing ED symptoms. It started with just running outdoors during lockdown which was allowed. After a while I would run up to 2hours a day. Then I switched to cycling which progressed to 4 hours a day. And finally I started obsessing over calories and the worst it got was 500 cals a day plus hours of cycling. I had a lot of free time as It was the summer holiday during the first lock down. My parents didn't mind me going out and stuff too. Just what was allowed.

After around 2 months of this I travelled for a while to go on holiday and slowly let go of most of the extreme ed behaviours. The depression didn't get better tho. 

Then a few months later I started have problems with severe anxiety. I got anxiety tics, unexplainable panic attacks and even a couple of short attacks that were later labelled as anxiety induced mania attacks. That was likely triggered due to the return of school and exams and all that. Also during that time my dad got diagnosed with cancer. At first they thought it was terminal and he had a few months but the diagnosis changed and thankfully he got treated and became cancer free about 8 months later. That period was pretty hard tho especially due to the caution we had to take as my dad didn't have any immunity and he because quite aggressive due to the effects of chemo and other medication. He still had problems with it but I can't say it's his fault. 

During that time I also struggles with SH and have problems with skin picking and some intrusive thoughts which I think is related to anxiety. 

Anyway lately the depression hasn't been too bad but I still have problems with anxiety and now the worst thing is anger problems. I would be fine but out of no where have a rage episode about stupid things. In the last 2 weeks I had like 3 extreme episodes leading to big family fights and I got to levels of crazy anger. I literally couldn't calm down except for when I started punching myself really hard. That left me with a few bruises. Also I started going to the gym a few weeks ago to help release that anger but idk it didn't help stop those anger episodes. This is really starting to bother me because idk how to stop them and i later I realise how stupid the trigger was and honestly I don't want to be another thing my parents have to add to their list Of worries. 

Anyway sorry this ended up being kind of a vent. But I wanted to ask for tips on how to manage the anger. 
Also I went into a great depth because I wanted to ask if it's worth looking into me possibly having BPD. I've been researching for around 2 years now because I just relate with a lot of the symptoms. I'm not diagnosing myself obv I just want to find the right help. Ik I'm under 18 so it's not easy to diagnose it but is it worth asking to be checked for it ? Also my grandad has it.

25,Should I be concerned?,"
I'd like to preface this post by stating that I have toxic behaviors in the relationship, such as invading space, being overly critical, heavy splitting, not listening to his side well, as well as my own yelling and general outbursts. I am in therapy partly to work on these behaviors.  
  
My bf does have some behaviors of his own that bother me, however I'm not sure if some of these are normal and I'm just splitting when I freak out about them. I've communicated about most of these and I've noticed some of it get better, however he's also told me he feels like I take everything as a personal attack and like I don't trust him. Sometimes when conflict has been very heated and I point out something that bothered me, he corrects it but explains he feels like he needs to keep a 'checklist"" of bad words/things to say. The behaviors that have been bothering me are:  
  
\-Swearing during conflict, but I've even corrected him when it isn't directed at me  
  
\-Yelling, he's also explained much of the time he does not mean to yell directly at me, but I have noticed it improve over time.  
  
\-Sometimes when we disagree he says what I said was ""stupid"", I've tried asking him to change it to say that what I'm saying doesn't make sense or something more neutral. I have noticed this get better as well, but he does get frustrated about it at times and doesn't always know how else to describe something  
  
\-Saying what I said was ""useless"", but this is often when I've repeated the same questions over and over or don't add anything to the conversation. He has gotten better about it but also does get frustrated about needing to stop.  
  
\-Saying that I'm being stupid/am stupid, however this has only been when I've highly bothered him and wouldn't give him space during the argument. He's only said this when I've split very hard and have had a giant episode where I won't let him calm down, so he likely does this because he doesn't feel like he has a choice. He does want to work on it, but I understand I provoke it and don't give him much of a chance to act differently.  
  
\-A few times he's hit things, such as the couch or his desk, but this is also often when I won't give him space when he's asked. He has thrown his phone once or twice when I was splitting very hard on him as well, but I've also done this to my phone much more. He's never thrown anything in my direction or near me, and I don't feel like he's trying to intimidate me.  
  
He does know these behaviors bother me, and when things are calm and we try to problem solve again after escalation he usually apologizes and wants to be better. However, sometimes he will say that I took some of it personally, such as swearing. Another thing that concerns me is that during arguments when I ask him not to call me stupid, he'll say ""I didn't call you stupid, I said you were being stupid."", I've read from some people that these things are forms of gaslighting, but I also know I provoke some of it after crossing his boundaries, and that BPD can often make us overreact so I am looking for input.  
  
Many of these things didn't start until I split on him more, however the yelling, swearing, and some moments of him saying I'm taking stuff personally did, as well as saying what I say in arguments at times is ""useless"".  
  
I've been bringing up couples therapy, now that our lives are less busy he said he'll try going. Going is very out of his comfort zone, as he's had trauma around therapists and doesn't think couples therapy is effective, but he said he'll try once a month then see if he's okay going more often. He's also told me if he can't figure out his behaviors on his own he'll try to see a therapist himself. For the couples therapist, he has said he doesn't want to do much of the work of looking for one, but it was my idea so I'm not sure if this is fair.  
  
We were trying to call each other out on these behaviors during conflict and then taking a break before re-engaging, but I've often failed at following through as I've explained. I am in no way trying to excuse my toxic actions. I'm just asking if his behavior seems like a valid reaction to my splitting and how I act, or if I should be concerned and he seems toxic as well.",1683955962.0,False,2,3,thelittlestone568,None,13g8f5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/13g8f5z/should_i_be_concerned/
26,"After having this med cocktail+not burdening myself, I am better. I was having a huge mental breakdown a year ago.","Forgive me if I have typo, I’m typing on my phone.

I was going crazy. Just crazy. I don’t even want to talk about it because it’s so shameful.
The breakdown was caused by lots of things, but major thing was school stress, alcohol, etc.

I got hospitalized again. 3rd time.
I was having a good calming 72 hours.
Later on I have realized I am an alcoholic. 

So I quit, I think at least 40% of my sanity comes from not drinking. I tried A.A in person and online plus networking, I personally didn’t like it.

Then my psychiatrist prescribed me Librium, I was on over than reg dose for anxiety -(reg dose that ppl take in google) 
I was being a zombie but I think it was worthy, I’m tired of laying down all day.

Since I was a zombie I decreased the dose, switched to klonopin since quantity is not available for some reasons in my area. 
I was on 1 mg, started SNRI -Pristiq. 
25mg once daily didn’t work.
50mg I felt difference after I started taking it for like more than 3 weeks.

As time goes on, I added weed (vaping and consuming medical weed) for tapering benzo+I like the effect. Makes me distracted when I am upset sometimes, when I need a calming time, morning time before my pharma med kicks in, before I go to bed.

I take only 0.25 of klpin twice daily.



So
-Antidepressant reg dose (everyone is different, Pristiq was my match)

-No alcohol (my emotional side gets crazy)

-Benzo(I don’t recommend it because of severe physical withdrawal, but it’s working well for my anxiety. Before I would be walking and looking back v often and thinking someone would attack me. I don’t have those thoughts unless someone gets super x2 close to me. 

-Medical mmj. Since I don’t like how potent flower smells it works. 
 I don’t recommend black market for vaping. Since I have been paying for my therapy out of pocket, I have 2sessions a month now. Used to have 3-4 sessions a month. 
Tbh now albeit I use about 3g of vaping mmj within in a month in a med mmj expensive City(half gram would cost me $65-75), I pay less for my mental health(it’s been 12 years, going to therapy, looking for right medication. I couldn’t handle dbt. I hated group sessions.)



I am far better than who I was exactly a year ago. I dropped out of school, I got a small job, talking to my parents, I don’t feel so miserable like before. I don’t want to kill myself for things that don’t matter. 

I feel like I am gifted. 
Even tho I have some struggles daily, ofc life is not a easy thing. My work place is stressful, min wage. But at least I can kill time with studying.
I’m just gonna get a certification.


I had 100,000 thoughts a day. Now I have 5000 thoughts and those are not suicidal.

27,having bpd is the equivalent to having third degree burns all over your body,"long ass vent for myself tbh

""Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement""

Marsha linehan who developed the therapy method DBT said that about people who suffer from borderline.

It quite literally produces the most intense emotional pain of any mental illness, it has a fatality rate of 10% 45 times more than the general population. 

According to Linehan we lose all cognitive functioning during periods of extreme emotional distress which unfortunately for BPD can happen at the drop of a feather. 

Personally for me it used to be a raging burning feeling in my head. Where I couldnt hear the rational part of my brain telling me you love this person, this isn't you, you don't want to do this, it's not a big deal. The voice in the back of my head that shuts that shit down immediately now was practically silenced. I couldnt hear them no matter how much I tried. Or if I actually managed to hear them and gripped onto it to bring myself back; I would just spiral and fall right back into the pit anyways. Because I had never even started the true healing process. And because the person I was with fed the worst parts of my fears and insecurities. My brain was completely consumed with so much of that hurt/fear/insecurity/humilation and it turned to a unceasing completely blinding rage. I would fall back in again and again desperately clawing to get out but succumbing each time to the borderline insanity that involuntarily manifested in my brain. 

My most painful moments of BPD haunt me every day. The absolute loss of control I used to feel over the smallest most stupid things. Scream crying alone in my room again and again, feeling the extreme grief equivalent to all my loved ones being murdered in front of me repeatedly over a simple relationship ending, its literally hell on fucking earth. Right now my dog who I love more than anything (outside of my FP) even more than myself, could be murdered right in front of me and I still know it wouldn't even compare to what I felt in every moment of the nightmare that was my existence at the time. 

I remember thinking in those moments of absolute mania and panic that this was anguish beyond belief, nothing had ever compared or ever could. Not even the extreme torture and abuse from my childhood. And I got brushed off and told it wasn't nearly THAT bad and it just feels that way because I'm still so close to it. No way could the emotional pain ever match the insanity of what my step mum put me through. As if I wasn't the one who had to deal with and then overcome the unceasing years and years of nightmares, flashbacks and constant panic attacks. As if I don't remember how acute that particular pain is. 

Well it's been over a year now and my extreme physical pain experiences will never ever fucking compare to the absolute torture of those moments. I would go through the worst of the worst all again than feel even a moment of that. When I tell people that they really can't believe me. They hear what happened to me in childhood and then what my ex did to me and it's not even comparable to them. How could I even for a second say she hurt me more? 

People without BPD literally cannot even comprehend how painful and intense our emotions can get. How everything is dialled up to a billion and we have NO control over it. I truly believe the vast vast majority of them (even ones who have been seriously hurt) have never felt the amount of agony that BPD people (involuntarily) create in their own heads. I believe that, because I've been through extreme verbal sexual and physical abuse and it was nothing to how my brain blindsided and ambushed me when I got my first FP. I understand why it doesn't make sense to them they will never understand what we have to live with and go through every day just by existing. But for me personally no amount of my sexual trauma or physical torture will ever compare to the pain of just being with a favourite person who showed me my first experiences of ""love"", made me feel joy for the first time in my life and then had to leave me, moved on and no longer cared for me at all anymore. (Actually was actively out for my blood in my situation 😐) Especially when you only live for the people you love in the first place. They are your entire centre of existence. In your head it's absolutely inconceivable you could ever not dedicate every part of yourself to them. What do you do then...

Fortunately for me I healed. Back then, with the person I was with, my body did really feel like an exposed wound at all times. Any little thing could set it off and cause me extreme pain. She couldn't understand how much pain I was in because I was cursed to manifest it as anger. Of course that makes it hard to empathise with especially when you become a victim of abuse as a result. I truly couldn't control it, I didn't realise this at the time but she constantly unintentionally kept me in a state of fear of abandonment and continuously enforced insecurities surrounding my body and who I even am as a person. Every little thing would set me off subconsciously, it would effect my emotions and actions in ways I couldn't control or many times even notice. Because my feelings were constantly being hurt by her, constantly felt devestation bubbling under the surace because no one meant more to me, no one's effect on my emotions even came close. So sometimes it was overt and drastic. I truly could not understand my extreme reaction to something so stupid after. That wasn't me. No part of that was me I know now deep down to my core my need for control completely came from fear. I was 100x more sensitive, everything was so agonising all the time without me even realising. And unfortunately that led me to take it out on them which kept me in a constant state of shame and regret that I had to push down as well.

Throughout my childhood my brain learned that fight, not flight would save me. The only time the torture stopped was when I hurt them back. So when I feel pain or hurt or anything that destabilizes me; especially from the person who had grounded me the most and had once made me feel the safest and most loved when no one else has before. I became theirs. I quite literally belonged to them, I didn't even realise how miserable I was. Once they showed me that side to life I couldn't let go. I relied on them entirely for any sense of safety and comfort or happiness so subconsciously when they took that away from me my brain ""defends"" itself without my fucking permission. It haunts me that the people I loved the most I used to hurt the most. I wish it could have been anyone else than the people I care for so deeply. As much as I wish I internalized that pain...I couldn't, I really really fucking couldnt at the time. So I lashed out, again and again and again uncontrollably until she thankfully left me and I got to find someone I could actually have my skin and a true sense of safety with for the first time in my life. 

Immense healing happened so rapidly. She immediately made me feel secure in my body, and satisfied in general within the first few weeks, which gave me a huge boost of self esteem and motivation to actually practice self care and improve myself. I mean if she could find me beautiful this fucking girl then I gotta try. I had to actually be worthy of her. I will never let myself be unworthy again. I needed to stop being a depressed potato and actually be my best self. Be Bucky in a sense. Also she seemed so attracted to me, so into me and even my body. She saw something I never could I wanted to see myself for the first time through her eyes. See myself as beautiful. 

She gave me hope, actually hope I could be better and change everything. Undo all the excessive damage that was done to my brain. Figure out all the different personalities rattling around in there and learn to listen and focus on the ones that are actually me. Not manifested from the darkest, traumatised, survival mode parts of myself. I realised I had so many layers, so many different thought processes going on at once. Of course it led to instability. I needed to silence them... I started DBT. I grinded in therapy twice a week. I consistently took my Lamictal and started Vyvanse to help with the head buzzing. Worked full time while in school to afford the insurance. Let out my emotions through working with animals and working out. I felt satisfication with myself every day, not even exhausted cause atleast now I was trying. I was accomplishing something. Every day learning new things about myself and taking steps forward. I discovered crazy things about myself in therapy (not necessarily always fun stuff) but it opened my mind so much to hopefully bring out the best version of me. 



One of my most intense triggers was retroactive jealousy. It tormented me constantly in my last relationship it was one of the first big leaps to destroying it and continued to break it down further throughout. Every tiny thing used to set me off and make me feel incredibly insecure. It's hard to describe what it felt like it's been so long since I felt anything even similar and it wasn't quite as overwhelming as the black out split rages. So not as potent a memory for me. But it was a mix of masochism and deep deep insecurity and hatred of myself compared to CIS men, which led to rages and spiralling. I would make her confirm my worst fears again and again maybe just to hurt myself, maybe in desperate attempt to make it okay in my head. It was mental self harm and I didn't realise that. RAJ was completely new to me (in fact I didn't even know every through out what was really going on) and it absolutely blindsided me. After that I didn't even know how to deal with it, I didn't know where to begin. I don't think I even possibly could have with the person I was with. I could never have gotten to a point with them where I believed in myself, or didn't constantly hate myself, and wasnt stuck in perpetual loop of survival mode with.

I thought I experienced RAJ with her because she was my first FP but with my current FP I could prod myself all day and feel absolutely nothing. Not a shred of hurt or insecurity. She healed me so much by just making me feel unconditionally loved for the first time in my life. Physically being with her is incredibly important it's my #1 love language and she has built up my view of my body to heights I would have never imagined. We are so fucking intensely intimate all the time it's crazy (it's the bpd in us) Who else could fucking matter we are each other's universes. I know that I'm her world and no one else, even a CIS man could compare. (Seriously though retroactive jealousy as a transman dating a straight girl is the worst and made me act like a completely different person Jesus Christ) I know I don't have to feel jealous because every fucking day she shows me that. I don't feel completely disconnected and isolated from her. I'm so god damn lucky, she gives me such a sense of peace and fullfillment. I tricked myself into thinking my last relationship was anything close to love or feeling real love...when I don't feel that constant turmoil and instability, when I actually feel like enough, when I'm grounded in who I am and feel safe and secure with who I'm with; it's so so so much easier. Everything felt so out of control when my head was constantly scared and in defence mode with them. Constantly needing to win arguments because admitting I'm wrong takes vulnerability which I could not show to her. So easy to admit I'm wrong to my current partner and to just drop any disagreement because I feel subconsciously safe enough to give up all power to her anytime. Plus my current partner having BPD unlike my ex; she actually can understand the insane amount of pain we can feel over the smallest things. How it compares to nothing else. How out of that pain we can say and do things that aren't any part of us at all. She doesn't just write it off because its so extreme and irrational. We both can have so much empathy and understanding for each other and it's so peaceful. Never taking an us VS them mentality. Feeling like you're always on the same team with your partner. Constantly growing, learning and healing together. We don't argue at all because before it can even escalate we have already focused on listening and validating the other person in their concern and come to a conclusion together that works.

Along those lines she also helped me discover my severe sexual abuse, healed my ""partners family hating me trauma"" that I've experienced throughout the years for many different reasons, affirmed me constantly in every aspect of my body that used to destroy me, rekindled my relationship with my mum an old shame of mine. Basically pushed the kind, strong, grounded side of me to the surface with her unceasing support, and given me a first look at a stable normal happy healthy life. (god damn the way she went all out at Christmas for me, healed something deep to my little kid core) She was my first hope. Hope that we can actually achieve the dream future I've always pictured; become the person I always dreamed of. First real reason to have any ambition or to give a shit in life where my brain before was just in a dead end slump of hopelessness.

BPD is a fucking curse. But with the right support system and enough effort/ dedication it can actually be manageable. Life is so much easier when I can practice emotional regulation and actually grow my emotional skin for the first time. It may have been stripped from me as a kid but I know love, time, dedication and resources can heal me fully one day. I may always be a loaded gun because of what happened to me, and I've always struggled before to keep my finger off the trigger. But not anymore with the right toolset I'm going to destroy that trigger entirely.

3,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

5,"Medication (lamptrigine, CBD, THC)","Hey everyone, I (F25) am struggling with medication at the moment and would appreciate some insight from those with personal experience 

DISCLAIMER: I have a fab team of doctors monitoring all my conditions, but I would like some real-life advice. 

TLDR: Does lamotrigine make it *impossible* for you to get out of bed in the morning? Has it increased your libido? Do these side effects eventually wear off? Changing from cannabis to CBD oil, thoughts? 

Bit of a long one here. 

I have chronic pain from Endometriosis as well as BPD and Bipolar 2. 

I was on a cocktail of medication, and I impulsively stopped all of my medication (except 1) in December 2022. I was taking nortiptiline (for pain) for a while until we realized it stimulated manic episodes (bipolar 2), so we switched to pregabalin, but that made me severely depressed, and I experienced some neurological symptoms (inability to speak/form sentences, brain fog etc). This is mainly what led to my impulsive decision to stop all my meds. 

I am now re-introducing my medication, one at a time, so I can pinpoint which side effects come from which medication. So far I have reintroduced tramadol (pain) lamotrigine (BPD + Bipolar 2), celecoxib (pain), and occassional SR tramadol (pain flares). 

Due to my pain, my sex life is pretty much non-existent, and my partner (M30) has been so patient with me through all of this. I recently started lamotrigine again (2 weeks ago) on a 50mg dose. My libido has increased significantly! We are talking every day, when prior to this, it may have been once or twice a month. However, I find it *impossible* to get out of bed in the mornings. 

- has anyone experienced the changes to sleep and libido when starting lamotrigine? Does it get better over time? I want to keep the increased libido, but I'm not sure if it is worth the struggle in the morning. Am I taking the medication too late (10 pm normally)?

I also use cannabis to help with my pain, anxiety, and erratic mood swings. I know that cannabis isn't the best for us with BPD. 

- has anyone switched from using cannabis to CBD oil (minimal THC content)? I recently had a consult at a cannabis clinic and am considering using the CBD oil instead, but I'm not sure if this will give me the same relief from pain and anxiety.

16,BPD & ADHD,"Hi guys :)

I (27f) was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 9. My parents didn't really believe in therapy so they kinda forgot about it, never did anything with it, and haven't told me about this diagnosis until a few years back. I've been diagnosed with BPD for 10 years. I mentioned the ADHD thing to my psychiatrist but never really focused on those symptoms as I've always been more preoccupied with the BPD symptoms.

Now, I know that ADHD could be mistaken for BPD and the other way around, but I definitely have BPD, so let's not get into that.

**I wanna ask those of you who have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD if you're taking** (or were in the past) **any medication for it? How did it work with the medication prescribed for BPD** (yes, I know BPD can't be treated with medication alone, but again - let's not go there)**? Did it make your life easier on the BPD side of things too? And in general, did it make your life easier?**

I'm tired of having to work/study twice as hard as people around me to achieve the same results. Among other things. But this is my main issue atm.

If that makes any difference, I take Effexor (venlafaxine) and trazodone.

26,Looking for resources,"I started seeing a psychiatrist, who specializes in TFP, 2 months ago. She diagnosed me with BPD. When I questioned the severity she said I’m “on the healthy side”. She explained that now that the assessment portion is over, the sessions would now be twice a week ($80 a week with my insurance). That was going to be a lot financially, as I dropped to working part time this year to help care for my baby. My husband supported my therapy and we agreed I would proceed with therapy and take a financial hit for one year for my well-being. I started to get a bad feeling about the psychiatrist when she prescribed me a sleeping medication and my insurance charged me $100 for the medication management code that she billed bc the insurance company said two codes were billed so it appears that 2 separate visits were completed when the medication management was discussed during our visit. I emailed her and told her I can’t afford $80 a week plus $100 every time she mentions medication to me so I would have my PCP take over this sleeping medication bc I don’t get charged when he writes me prescriptions. The psychiatrist then proceeds to send in a new prescription for a higher dose, which I didn’t ask for, after I was clear that I didn’t want to discuss medications with her again. This resulted in another $100 charge. She then took a 2 week vacation and we picked back up last night for our first real treatment session. She started the session by saying she needs to charge my credit card for the second medication charge. I let this go because I’m working on not cutting ppl off after a bad feeling. Then she says she has two requirements for me: 1) I need to “start a weight management program like weight watchers”. I gained a significant amount of weight during my pregnancy and can’t get it off. My PCP started me on Ozempic which has already helped me lose 40 lbs. I told the psychiatrist that I’m already taking steps to help with my weight (which was discussed in previously sessions) she replied “ya but you’re really not” and implied she didn’t trust my PCP of doing enough to manage my weight 2) since I couldn’t have her manage my meds due to insurance, she wanted me to have a regular psychiatrist manage my meds (vyvanse for ADHD and have been on for nearly 10 years and trazodone for sleeping which she put me on last month) bc she didn’t trust my PCP to manage them. 
All that was going through my head was this is more money I have to spend for things my PCP is doing for free. When I pushed back she said these two requirements were necessary for us to start therapy. She said it would be irresponsible of her to not have me do weight watchers and said it was the same as if I was an alcoholic and she required me to go to AA. 

She told me to cut my mom off and “have a hotel on speed dial” when I visit her but then later apologized and said she shouldn’t be giving me advice. She also made numerous little digs about my husband. Again, I brushed those comments aside bc I’m working on not being impulsive when it comes to cutting ppl off. But I’m really uncomfortable with her giving me an ultimatum and now  talking poorly of a third person on my life, my PCP. 

I emailed her and said I’m not comfortable with her two requirements and I understand this means we can’t move forward with therapy. I feel like the past two months of assessment and building trust with her was just a waste. I’m not ready to start with another therapist so I’m looking for other resources like books, videos, workbooks, etc that you feel helped you.

We have 2 Kids together and over the years what we thought was “normal” marital issues turned out to be some deep rooted issues I had from my childhood. We both struggle with depression and for a while I was reluctant to engage in therapy and medication but once I realized how serious my condition was and accepted what I had, I started medication about 4 months ago. I still have triggers and coping struggles I’m having to work through but I feel like weekly therapy and medication have helped me come a long way. Unfortunately, over the last month I’ve had a ton of issues that have compounded and resulted in a couple episodes between me and my partner. Financial struggles combined with issues at work including a recent mass layoff (I survived) and then struggles with my side business put me in a place of extreme stress and I did not do a good job at coping with this stress and let small things at home cause me to lash out emotionally. I feel like my ability to regulate my emotions has improved a lot and then when I do have moments of poor coping I am much quicker to respond and accept what I’ve done wrong and talk through how I could be better in the future. This has all come to a head though to where now my Partner has said they now feel hopeless and do not know if they want to keep going while I continue working on this. My therapist says this may be a common response and I’m trying to hard to stay positive and focused and not spiraling. They don’t feel like the progress is enough and I’m not sure what to do. They seem willing to continue going to counseling and cohabitating, so I think the best thing is to be patient and keep doing the work.

In one study, 70 percent of patients with treatment-resistant depression who were started on an oral antidepressant and intranasal esketamine improved, compared to just over half in the group that did not receive the medication (called the placebo group).

But unfortunately I can't pick and choose what emotions medications choose to suppress and all have just surpressed everything at once. Meaning the intense anger and depression is gone but so is my hyper dorky intense self that other people miss too. And I can't feel much in the way of emotions in general. It's pretty mild. I don't feel much love or lust anymore ether.

35,how to work on attachment,"Hi. I (20F) just got broken up with by my ex (22M) last night and have been NC. It's a very long story, but he ended things because of my behavior in the past few months being toxic and harmful. He said he loved me, he didn't want to do it, was ugly crying with me, but it was done anyway. Over the course of our nearly 8 month relationship, major life events happened, I lost sight, and he ended up becoming my Favorite Person unintentionally. 

I have been in bouts of crying, but I have been talking with many people and have a rocky plan for the foreseeable future. First, I have CBT and DBT in the next two days, and then on Wednesday I'm going to the doctor to switch my medication (cymbalta) to something else that will target mood swings. I am going to join a grief support group to manage the grief I felt these past couple months. I've written out the toxic attachments I developed and boundaries that we had at the beginning that fell away. 

I'm going to stay NC until Friday, wherein I'll reevaluate everything, but I don't know how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? I don't have these issues with anyone else in my life, only my romantic partner(s), and until the shit of life hit the fan, I was navigating my attachment very well. 

He is truly the love of my life, and we had so many things planned together. Everything was mapped out, and I was so secure with him. I believe when things went down that I used him too much for emotional reliance and we became a tad codependent. We are both anxious attachment, I think, and I have BPD whereas he does not. I do still love him, though, and I want to firstly work on my own issues for a while, but I do want to be with him again, if he'd try us out again.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? Or just any advice in general? 

edit: broke no contact. found out he and his sister are leaving town for a while, so I left him a voice-mail last night telling him to stay safe and that I miss him. said I love you. texted his sister a similar sentiment. the lack of response really feels like I just tore my own insides out, but I suppose that's the decision that's been made. I dont want to lose him, and I feel I already have

edit 2: talked to my dr. the medication I was on for my arthritis gave me psychosis, and my rheumatologist didn't check my mental history before prescribing them. I stopped those, started taking prozac instead of cymbalta, and started 3 omega-3 fish oils, 1 vitamin b1, and 2 magnesium glycinate. i had a phone call w his sister a few days ago and she said he isn't ready to talk yet but it was fairly amicable. sending a text tmrw for his birthday but haven't reached out. going to the psychiatrist in a few weeks to get mood stabilizers. ive done a lot of journaling, therapy, and talking and distracting. I know I can thrive without him and I don't NEED him to survive, but I do love him and he enhances my life. I want us to work out, but I'm not going to spam or go crazy w the contact.

Bit of back story, I 30m have been with my BF 50m for almost 2 years and I love him with everything I have. But the last few days I have been struggling with my bpd. It is just little things and I’m taking my medication but my brain is not playing ball. 

This morning I was woken up by his Grindr going off and whilst I trust him implicitly and know he just has Grindr to have a look around I can’t help but feel like I’m not enough because that is the way my ex made me feel. 

He tells me all the times he loves me and is always there for me when I have my episodes but I can’t get rid of this feeling and I’m meant to be going to his parents for new year tomorrow. 

Any advice,

37,Overwhelmed,"I’ve been diagnosed with BPD for two years but was told that CPTSD and BPD look similar so try trauma treatment first. I’ve been in EMDR ever since then and while it’s worked for some things, I still find myself completely destroying relationships in ways that feel so out of my control. Im very new to accepting my diagnosis and ready to look toward BPD focused treatment including any medication that might help.

Should I start by explaining to my EMDR therapist my interest in refocusing my care/finding a BPD focused therapist? I feel really overwhelmed on how to seek help.

39,My fiance hung up on me while I was suicidal..,"It was a horrible day for me. But my finance lives overseas and I am constantly working even though I haven't long had a stroke myself to try and get enough money to go over and marry him so we can finish our visa process once and for all. And since he lost his job, most of the responsibility has been on me. So I am working all night full time work right now whilst planning everything and dealing with immigration etc. Then I come home and my mother calls me yelling and invalidating me instead of just listening to how I'm feeling about things and thinking I'm always attacking her. Afterwards I burst into tears and I feel like unaliving myself because everything is just to much. The day before I was up with seizures due to stress (I have epilepsy which is managed, but the stress was so bad, the medication was not helping much). I tried to talk to my partner and he told me to calm down and that he had to go to church and seemed very dismissive and distant. In which he has been lately. I then broke down and said I felt like I was going to unalive myself and I needed to talk to him right now because I didn't feel safe on what I may do in my headspace. He told me ""what would my family think of you acting like this ?! I can't tell them you are like this! Calm down!!"" Then told me to stop crying multiple times and getting angry. When I told him to stop blaming me, he just told me he wasn't. Even though he was. He kept saying ""why are you doing this?!?"" ""Stop this now"" ""stop crying!!!"". I ended up crying harder and he hung up on me. Afterwards he ignored all my calls all day and night and I was a mess! He knows how much that would completely break me... I know I'm not easy to deal with... I know I'm a emotional rollercoaster... happy one day and crying the next... but I really do try... therapy for 12 yrs now and on medication. My seizures also make my moods intense and so does my brain damage. It's difficult. I understand that I'm a shitty person. I say things because I feel I am not being loved sometimes and I get it. It's a lot. But I don't think I am the only one to blame here. Finally he messaged. He told me his phone was flat. That was a huge lie. And if he needed space he could have told me. But instead he read my messages and saw the amount of pain I was in and ignored it. He then told me it's my fault for now saying all these things  (me repeating what he did to me) and not doing as I was told when he said to calm down and stop crying. He believes it is my fault. Multiple times when I have cried in the past he has not acted like this. Infact he has never acted like this before, well alittle, but never to this extent. but lately he has been. And I am now considering leaving him. For good. I don't think I can forgive him. I can't even look at him the same anymore. And he feels no remorse whatsoever.

43,Struggling with nightmares from the past.,"Throwaway account here.
So first a bit about us. You can skip to the question if you want.

My wife with BPD and i are together since 2008. We were at the tim 16 and 19 and did go through alm rough times together.
She got diagnosed at first with depression during our relationship and at the age of 18 with BPD and ADD. We did go to different therapist over the years. Some more usefull than others. She had for around one year a really creative one, who brought some ideas for her sleeping problems, but dropped out of the profession due pregnancy. She has now a therapist specialized on DBT. And she did some hughe improvements.


Question;

Now that she made hughe improvements in the last half of this year, but still struggles a lot with nightmares, where she falls back in her childhood, mixed with her current life.
We're now hoping to find something, that might her help with this. It really bothers her, since she feels like every progress she made, isn't there. In addition, she's not well rested.
Anyone had similar problems? If so, what helped you?

She uses SSRI's for her depression and Tritico for falling asleep, but otherwise she hasn't really any medication.",1696922377.0,False,2,2,No_Tiger9163,None,174f4je,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/174f4je/struggling_with_nightmares_from_the_past/
44,Is it healthy or is it another FP?,"My friend and I both have quiet BPD, though we are both in therapy and he's on medication while I'm finally getting started into looking for medication. 

Recently I've been finding myself wanting to romantically take him on dates, hold hands etc, do all the things a romantic couple would do but my only fear is that, because my mental health hasn't been the best recently (Due to a really toxic situation I had to escape from with an ex friend), I'm worried that it's just another FP attachment forming. 

I want more than anything to treat him well, and give him the healthiest love that ik he deserves, especially because he's been mistreated in the past, but I'm so scared that this is only going to become another unhealthy attachment and with HIM having bpd, i'm worried that i'm going to make it worse. 

So far all our things have been reciprocated (Wanting to hang out more, our plans for cosplaying with one another, being able to rely on one another and check in with one another emotionally) so I've just been really careful and allowing myself to slowly take in all the good he's brought into my life, rather than taking more and more and more because I'm worried he'll leave, and leaving him with nothing.

45,im very toxic in my relationship,"We were great at first. But I think I gave him PTSD.. 

Constantly saying his going to leave me or that his cheating on me when he wasn't. Always taking up alot of his time etc. 
Being basically a bitch due to my own insecurities and trumua. 


I was also very loving but when I found out he still kept photos of his ex on his phone and had them on facebook I went crazy. I demanded he give me his phone in which he became mad because I accused him and he refused to give me his phone. Then I found out he still had a dating app downloaded because he told me he uses it to look at our old messages of when we first met. He then deleted it like I said and sent me screenshots of the deleted app. Because I continued to accouse him of cheating which in turn triggered him alot and he sent me articles saying his in a controlling relationship and refuses to give his phone over or show me because it's his right. Then sent me more articles saying why it's controlling behavior. I went over to his place to try and sort things out and he still would not let me see his phone so I smacked him twice. 

His now extremely defensive when he talks to me and he said he is to scared to meet with me to talk because of the assualt. He has been gaslighting and manipulative and super angry since all this. And I feel it's a response to trumua because I've obviously put him through alot. He is not the person I originally met at the moment. And that's completely understandable what he is probably going through right now. I have alot of sympathy for him after taking time to cool off. None of my behavior was ever okay. I should also be able to trust people without snooping and I should not be assulting anyone. I feel ashamed and I am going to be starting on a new medication because threapy is just not enough anymore for me. My trumua is beyond that now. I want to save this relationship I really do. I have doubled my threapy sessions and soon I'll be on new medication.

46,I'm terrified my partner is cheating,"I've been diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago. It helped me tremendously, It meant i wasn't crazy and the things I've always felt were legitimate and had an explanation. From there I started treatment with medication and therapy and DBT skills and my life got more balanced. 

So now I've been in a serious relationship for 3 years. We got married and had a baby and I'm currently pregnant. We both work from home and he is a very present father and husband, he is always with us. He is not secretive with his phone and gives me no reason to think he is cheating. 

However my BPD brain thinks something is happening. I downloaded an app yesterday for school (telegram) and saw he had an account and was last seen online last month. I freaked out and accused him of using it for cheating and he got extremely mad I and began to react saying he was making his bed and that this was the beginning of the end. I calmed down a bit and asked him to explain why he had downloaded it but he got defensive and said he doesn't need to justify himself. I began spiring, that hadn't happened to me in a while, this is the first relationship I have that I didn't cheat and we built a family so I feel super vulnerable. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this but maybe someone has some insight or tips on how to handle this, my first instinct was always to ""cheat back"" once I've felt threatened.",1696423146.0,False,2,7,SilverGirl-,None,16zm5er,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/16zm5er/im_terrified_my_partner_is_cheating/
47,Ex pwBPD Reflection,"My ex pwBPD [43f] told me,

>I love you but I’m not in love with you. Because the person you met before was not me. Because in the moment I was completely out of it and the person you met was a crazy f****** b**** who was 20 something. Like I can remember everything we were saying. People switch (split?), I switched (split?) myself. When I don’t want to feel pain or whatever I run away and I start doing stupid shit. And that’s the reason I’m hiding and it’s coming out this other person. The therapist said it happened because of everything you went through in your life. 
My therapist told me, “Do you know that what are you doing right is not correct, it’s not you? That you’re just toxic right now and damaging that person.” And I think it’s the best, it’s much better because when she starts working on when I was abused, and it’s going to be very soon, believe me I don’t wanna go through that pain. I don’t want to be with nobody. I don’t wanna have a boyfriend that’s the problem you don’t understand. I don’t want a boyfriend. I don’t want a man touch me. I don’t want anything. I don’t want to future with a man. want to be alone. 
Because when I met you, I was escaping from my ex-boyfriend. and I was just escaping. that’s the reason you met the person. it wasn’t me because I was lost. I’m still lost but in the moment I was completely out of control without the correct medication. 

Some questions I have,

1. Is this common for a BPD episode or a manic episode?

2. Do borderlines ever want to reconcile with their healthy/supportive ex partners after going through medication, intensive DBT and CBT? Even if this is a matter of years into recovery? We are friends now, and my ex borderline is extremely sorry and feeling beyond guilty for hurting me. She cares about me **immensely** and is still extremely sweet to me. She does not want a relationship but does not want one in general. The mention of wanting to be with nobody, not wanting a husband, and a future alone sounds like borderline black-and-white thinking. 

Also she mentioned in the past while we were still together and her BPD was triggered,

>I am not able to have a relationship with you or nobody else because It **never** going to work 
out because of my condition.

It sounds like very dichotomous thinking that you’d
see with BPD.

This woman felt **destroyed** when she knew she hurt me and broke down crying to tell me she was sorry for pushing me away, that she just wants the best for me.

52,New to BPD,"So I guess this is sort of my introduction, as im new and just exploringmy support options. I'm a 28F and married with 3 kids. I know the all the hate I'll get for this, but I haven't been clinically diagnosed yet, atm I'm still learning about bpd and collecting all the evidence to bring to my doctor so I can start the process of being diagnosed. 


Now that that's outta the way, let's start from the beginning. My mental issues, as it pertains to bpd, started manifesting when I was 9 after my parents split up. My parents were both abusive in different ways, mom is a narcissist and dad liked to beat us, but my siblings and I didn't know that our lives were all that bad because we didn't know any better. That was until the divorce... it was still pretty taboo to have divorced parents back then, so the schools put us in group counciling and that's when we started realizing everything. 


The divorce didn't make anything better tho, and as the years went on, everything compounded until I finally had a melt down. At 14 I was caught with razor blades on school campus, but the felt I was more of a threat to others than myself and I was sent to an alternative school for 3mos. When I got bk I basically told the school therapist I was going to keep mutilating myself bc no one cared enough to stop me. That's when I was finally hospitalized and diagnosed with ""severe depression with anxiety"". 3yrs later, that diagnosis changed to ""manic depression with severe anxiety"". I was on every medication you could think of, but nothing helped or lasted very long... my emotions have always been a daily rollercoaster for me and it was difficult to control.


At 19 I got pregnant with my first kid, I took preemptive steps on ppd. But all that did was delay the inevitable, and that was the last time I took any medication for my issues and started self medicating. I was doing pretty good until at 23, I lost what would have been my second kid. I spiraled for months after that, but even after it stopped I was still never as good as I was b4. Then at 25 I got pregnant again, and that's where things started getting really bad again. I didn't try to take meds during that time and the ppd hit me harder than the first time, even still as bad as I was, I still felt like I was handling it all very well... but 9mos later I was pregnant again and tht just turbo charged the spiral.


I knew my issues weren't normal and that I was worse than I had ever been b4 in my life, so I started doing research. Instead of focusing on past diagnosis, I researched all of my symptoms which I'll list off now.

☆ constant daily rollercoaster of emotions
☆various manifestations of paranoia
☆having different ""personalities"" for different people I interact with
☆hopelessness
☆self hate 
☆unstable relationships
☆inability to hold a job for more than 9mos
☆feeling like I'm not in control of my self or actions
☆impulsive habits
☆blackout rages
☆hyper fixation with new relationships 
☆saying things I don't mean
☆feeling lost
☆terrified of abandonment
☆feeling out of place or time
☆disassociating 
☆hearing/seeing things that aren't there
☆seething jealousy 
☆acute distrust, even with people close to me


Really I could go on and on, the point is that I came across bpd and everything just clicked. So I along with all of my research, I started listening to other people's stories and their struggles and it just solidified it all for me. I meet 7 out of 9 criteria points, and so I'm 99% sure that this is what my problems all stem from. Really, the only thing that's really stopping me from going to my doctors with all of this, is my distrust of the medical industry. I don't know how to approach the subject without sounding like I'm crazy or overreacting. I've had past professionals claim nothing is wrong and tht I'm just attention seeking, it's not often I'm ever taken seriously.

Recently I didn't get medication at our clinic and became depressed and sensitive. Because he has been my pillar, he has seen me in all kinds of vulnerabilities. So he knows how my mind works. I've recently been suspecting that he is gslighting me (that's if I am even understanding gaslighting well). Because I didn't get meds, I yelled at him once and told him I wish I was aborted and hope he kills me. I was wrong and later apologized to him. He has been hurt since and I believe he has withdrew all efforts of being supportive of my mental health. It hurt like hell for the first few weeks, then I got a grasp but now I feel like he is purposely trying to mess with my head. I am highly empathic so I feel anxious at the oldest changes of mood he does. I feel like I sound crazy, I think I need to tell my doctor about this, but any advice would help <3",1660853067.0,False,11,8,IceBubbles123,None,wrtalr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/wrtalr/something_odd_is_going_on_at_home/
59,Best kind of threapy for relationship abuse recovery??,"Was recently heavily abused by my ex who also has BPD. Both psyically and mentally. It was pretty bad. He is now facing jail upto 3 years including the cases from his previous ex. 

I'm now a shell of my old self. Today I was looking through all my old posts on Instagram and I cried. Because I mentally had forgotten who I was and how confident and happy I was back then. I didn't even realize at the time how much I had found myself back then. How free I was.. how courageous and inspiring and truly just nothing but my unapologetic self not letting anything hold me back. Fast forward 8 months and I'm a mess. I don't recognize that person anymore. I have been in abusive relationships all my life. This isn't my first rodeo. I have a very long history of childhood abuse over years. And then seeing my mother be abused too on a constant. I have had therapy most of my life and I am on medication. But I have no voice. I let people walk all over me. I find my worth and then I slowly have it manipulated again by the wrong people. Anyhow, sorry for getting drastically side tracked.. my apologies. Just wondering what the best threapy is for me to try after escaping DV ? I've done a bunch. Including some threapy the court suggested and cbt and dbt etc. Heard something about sky or ski therapy? I'm not sure. I've done different therapy's over the years but I'm open to re trying some. I have a very bad short and long term memory so I wouldn't mind doing them again.

60,Cutting people off after healing,"Last year my partner and I broke up for many, many reasons, most of which stemmed from my untreated (at the time) BPD and his avoidant behavior and overall hyper independent nature. A classic combo. Our breakup broke me in many ways, but 2023 ended up being the best year of my life because I started going therapy every week, taking medication, learning how to be alone, and forming positive relationships in my life. I still struggle deeply with my BPD, but I've gotten better at identifying my emotions as they arise. This does not mean I have completely changed my behaviors or emotions themselves.

About a month ago, my ex and I reconnected. For some reasons, a relationship isn't feasible for us however the love and friendship is still there. He is still a solitary person and has his own mental health struggles that he hasn't really addressed. He hinted at us being in an ""open relationship,"" since when we are together now, we are loving and affectionate and to him I am the first person he wants to see. But because of our time constraints we both know that we can't fully devote ourselves to each other.

Very quickly into our reconnection, I've noticed that many of my old thought patterns, triggers, and behaviors have arisen. It honestly scares me; I've been really good this year when dating other people to mitigate toxic patterns and I've overall worked really hard to be different. At this point I don't know if it's just him who causes me this pain (because of our history, our love, and his avoidant tendencies) or if I am simply not healed. It is probably both. But he wants us to remain in each other's lives and honestly I do too. But there is a chasm of distance between us and it breaks me. And feeling shitty all the time has taken such a toll on me, because after our falling out last year I vowed to never feel this way again.

I feel sad at the idea of cutting him out completely but I honestly don't know how to feel okay with him in my life or if it is even worth it. I feel so conflicted and I wish I didn't feel anything.

Can anyone relate? Is this just a good opportunity to battle my triggers head on, or is it healthier to just let go?",1702519424.0,False,5,1,Andomasquemal,None,18hxon4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18hxon4/cutting_people_off_after_healing/
61,TW sh - need help and advice,"
Hi! I’ve been struggling with bpd for 3/4 years now and I have made a lot of progress. I’m on medication, a dbt program and last time i attempted was in june. Ive been feeling quite proud of my accomplishments.
A couple of days ago I went to see my therapist and we were talking about sh. Last time I did it was about a month ago, it was quite dramatic, needed stitches and I got very scared because I had never gone so deep. Since then I mad the decision to go off alcohol (which makes me super impulsive) and I am just so mad at sh that I swore to myself never doing it again. And I feel like this time I am really ditching the mentality. 
I told my therapist I am very ashamed of the big scar i have and wondering how I should deal with it. I showed it to her and she said it wasn’t that bad, that she had seen bigger and worse.
And I am aware I shouldn’t care for that remark she made, but ever since then I cant stop thinking about it. And picture myself doing it. Even though I was so determined to ditch this shitty habit forever, now it doesn’t leave my head and I think about it non stop. How I should just fill my arm with scars.

62,The sup stack that saved my ship! Read if you have hope(:,"Update:sadly after day 27, something stopped working. I can only guess it's the nac. She still takes everything, but that overwhelming level of anxiety/pit has come back to her and she just now had another self isolating eps. Tbh I don't know if we'll recover from this or not. Idk if it'll stop working for every person but To all who I gave hope, I'm sorry 😞. I thot I found a solution to at least enjoy my time together with her but it seems it was likely short lived. If we get out of this postively somehow long term, I'll update.

This exact stack: bought from vitamin shoppe.

Solgar omega 3 950mg

Vitaminshoppe brand L theanine 100mg

Vitaminshoppe Nac 600mg

has pretty much saved my relationship and now I'm happily married.

For us, it has made her no longer explosive/randomly angry or self isolating anymore. It's legit 99% a normal relationship now . There's only been some small things were we communicated within under an hour each time like a normal understanding convo with one another. Sometimes even in 5 mins we good after small thing. That B4 trying this supplement stack, normaly wouldve made her give up on us and self isolate for days and or she'd get mad about it, if i was able to get her to try to tell me wat she was feeling. We are super happy to say we haven't had a meltdown in 27 days! B4 it was literally everry 2-3 days. We are still meltdown free since Dec 19 (x and we are both super happy to be with each other ❤️💗. !!! ((: She's felt so much happier, she's told me and I've noticed it. it's been easier to talk to one another too. We've committed to a future together and are starting a semi life in the same home soon cx. This stack is a ship saver!! It really balanced out her intense feels to practically nothing!. She does still have small sad type moments here and there from things that remind her of childhood trauma alittle or things that she gets mad at herself internally abit for forgetting. But when they do happen and I notice she's looking down a little, I ask her about it in a supportive way, and she opens up and within about 10 mins and we are past it and up again. That's it(:. it's very occasional too. Like once a week. Very manageable, easy to recover, communicating is easier and is much more possible now.

This is wat she takes and when:

1pm everyday, she takes the stack, 2 of each listed.

10pm she takes her lamotrigine and 1 vitaminne shop brand magnesium glycinate 400mg tablet form

No idea if she still needs her lamo subscription med but didn't want to chance us melting down again. So still on it. Might maybe try it without later in the future, now that the stack and magnesium seems to help alot. For now tho we are super happy together (:. Anyone else that sees this, it takes the edge off very noticably! Try it. 😁. Do you and or your special person a huge favor and start the stack ASAP, you won't regret it. Worth every penny.

Also she's not in DBT. We do our best for each other and love care n support one another. We are incredibly happy with this stack and mag. CX 💞 hoping this will help others who have SOs that want to give up in a loop and or themselves and struggling to find help. Not a cure, but really dam close! Cross posting to help others live a hopefully better life😊.

63,Seoquel/quetiapine side effects & any alternatives,"Hello, anyone on quetiapine experience any of these side effects as I am not sure whether it is to do with who I am or if the pills have a contribution. I have been on this since February (almost 7 months) and I greatly believe it has helped with my suicidal thoughts as I do not experience these nearly as much as I did and I sometimes think if the benefits are that great but last year I genuinely cried daily, self harmed (haven't in 6 months+) and had attempted (also to do with stressful life situations). I was on 25mg, then 50 for a couple-few months but dropped back to 25mg as I don't think my body could handle it as I always felt sick. I was previously on sertraline which worsened my bpd mood swings but it also made me feel sick everyday so I don't know if medication is just a bit detrimental to me. Anyway, negatively, I would say i had an ED last year, lost a stone on sertraline but I eat normal again and have put it back on and a few pounds more but overall have maintained my weight however, I am a very active person, 20,000-30,000 steps a day + gym & I don't overeat so I genuinely think if I was not so active I would have gained a lot of weight on these pills. The main problem other than sickness I have recently is forgetfulness. Granted I have always been forgetful but one week recently I left my bag in a bar recently in another city, left my phone in a shop the next day & then left my glasses in an uber that weekend. I googled it and it said that seroquel can dampen your brain memory and I just feel myself being constantly worried I am going to forget something & believing I am stupid when I do.

64,Scared for diagnosis,"Hi all, I’m new here.

I have ADHD and BPD, and ive been in treatment for a year (schema group and individual therapy). Its been real hard and slow work, but it has been very beneficial. 

However since ive been put on the appropriate ADHD meds (dexamphetamine) that actually work for me and dont make me feel horrible, ive been making progress wayyy faster than before. I can think clearer, i dont dissasociate as badly so i can actually work through emotions better. Im more present in the group, and its easier to connect.

Overall its a whole new world for me. I had never experienced actually being calm in my head, without also feeling numb (used to be on ritalin, which had very negative side effects in my case). And it feels like i can finally profit from all the hard work id been doing in therapy.

66,A ruined life,"Some updates based on the replies follow..


TL;DR After abandoning my BPD diagnosis I coped well, until I once again began thinking about it. Embracing my diagnosis and the medication led to ruin, and now I fear for my sanity and existence.

TRIGGER WARNING- abandonment,  suicidal ideation, stopping all medications 

I'm 53, Male from USA, diagnosed nearly 30 years ago. Early on there were 3 instances of institutionalization and many doctors and medications. I was classified as disabled and received SSA benefits for a few years then stopped that when my wife and I separated. She was tired of the rollercoaster. My very southern Christian family disowned me for years. 

I moved to China to experience a year of teaching there and never returned. 2 months in, I stopped taking all meds. I moved to a Chinese megalopolis and gradually built a company around art and collaboration and that led to a career in corporate training.   I married a woman from central China who became my partner and collaborator in work too.

For 7 years I coped without medication.  But things began to be too much, my emotions were overtaking me, and I sought help - medication- once again.  The psychiatrist gave me Similar stuff to years before. There were tears of joy in my wife's eyes- 'Honey you're not crazy! The doctor says its chemicals!'

She tried to understand. She tried to support me emotionally- but she's a very different person from a culture that deals with emotions differently. It wore her down. She became profoundly unhappy,  exploding at me with really hurtful words and behaviors. I continued to let myself be defined by BPD. She began to withdraw and ignore me- and ignoring me is a huge trigger. 

Our business became successful. I'd had a few run ins with the police in China, scary stuff. Sometimes it was my explosive emotions (I punched and dented the hood of a BMW for blocking the entrance to our home), then it was weed. My wife lived with embarrassment and fear. 

Opportunity appeared in Southeast Asia for us to spread our work. I was motivated and we planned to relocate to another country- I was excited and motivated,  she just followed as she felt a wife should, fearing further issues with embarrassment or police in China. 

She never felt comfortable and I was now the only friend she had. Living and working together took its toll. The doctors here changed my medication to what was available- Depakote. 

In March she'd had enough and announced she would leave me. She saw herself as a victim of my psychological abuse. She needed to discover herself.  She felt I should know better, behave better, make better choices; and stop blaming bpd. COVID stopped everything and she lived with me until August. In that time she still often behaved as my loving wife, even discovering the joy of playing Animal crossing as a couple. She called me honey, laogong, hugged me, told me she loved me. Income plummeted and our savings drained. 

After she left, she returned to our city in China.  She explicitly said to give her up, reminding me shes the victim. But she wanted to be collaborators still and she cared about me, she said. 

Communication has been hard. She would suddenly not answer any messages, and phone calls became hostile 

I've had to borrow money to survive. She's living with friends- others from our organization,  so my relationship with them is affected. 

I'm unable to move on. My confidence is shot, I dwell on suicide daily. I stopped the depakote very gradually because it was making me feel worse, and now I take no meds. I'm managing. 

Last week she called me and got emotional about something and shouted at me for 10 min straight. It fucked my head up so bad that it took me days to get my productivity back up. 

Yesterday she called again. We'd agreed t speak as though we are only separated physically,  geographically, to avoid discussing the real issues with others. Yesterday a mutual friend had said something that apparently she was offended and insulted by, that was about our separation. She stated that now she sees shes much too good for me and that I'm ruining my reputation by saying things about us to others. She won't tell me what was said or who said it but completely buys in that I said it.

I am still trying to survive,  eating instant noodles and getting fatter as I desperately scramble for income. I think about suicide constantly. I believe her when she says shes the victim and I'm the abuser. I don't know what's real anymore. 

I know COVID affected a lot but now I wish I'd never left China. I was happy with her... but knowing that for years she felt psychologically abused and depressed because of me... that's kept me awake most nights for a year now. I question reality, am I the abuser? The monster? Is bpd real? Maybe I'm just a shitty person and trying to rationalize my shittiness. 

I don't know what I expect from posting here but hopefully at least the posting itself will help.

UPDATES. 
°I have obtained a DBT workbook and a recommendation of a reasonably priced online counselor. 
°I'm applying for a TESOL certificate for backup English teaching, and a training company is launching a demo of my Empathic Leadership Communication executive coaching system. I have two solid clients now, I believe if I can add only 4 more clients I'll be comfortable. 
°since the borders here are still closed to outside tourists,  domestic tourism is very inexpensive. For <$175 I have booked 11 nights in an Island bungalow about 6 hours from the city. I am concerned about being alone here in the house during Christmas and NY so I will have a yoga/DBT retreat.  
°I still love her so much. I need to change for myself,  not another. But I want to be with her so much. 
°spoke to someone in our China team who is her roommate now in China. He's of the opinion she's also struggling but not in a place to hear me. I had to hide all photos of her and us, and still keep uncovering memories. 
°while I may have stopped the depakote (and things are ok without it) I still smoke marijuana to cope, and occasionally dip into my stash of prescription Ativan if it's too hard. 
°working on myself comes with many failures and it's hard to be motivated. Intermittent fasting,  shifting to a fish and plant based diet, trying to meditate (how the fk do you meditate when your brain won't stfu), add daily exercise,  track my sleep, daily journaling- and while all that's good it's also too much. 
°I'm really really afraid that if I have another interaction like that with her, I will hurt myself. I spent a half hour staring down from my 4th floor balcony trying to gauge if the impact would be fatal... conclusion: fatal or not such an instance would hurt others so I can't give anyone that burden.
°How do I let go of the love of my life?

67,"Lonely, clingy, emotionally promiscuous, hopeless case","TW: domestic violence

Not sure why I am writing this. I am 21. And I am losing hope. My borderline patterns started at 12. And they keep getting worse and more complicated with time. Never been in proper therapy. I was not compliant. Never found a good therapist. Was just heavily medicated with antipsychotics. But my patterns? Worse and worse with time. Dad died at 18. No financial stability and abuse at home of all kinds. Writing this post outside of my family house where my brother broke my nose. 

Just following with a convenient psychiatrist for the time. But no real change. Just staying afloat. CBT doesn’t work.

I am lonely. I do not fit in. People mostly bullied me for being autistic. In teen years and adulthood, I was sometimes repulsive. I lost my elementary school friends. I traveled and didn’t contact them for a decade. I don’t make real friends . I just act like a clown and mask. Or trauma dump.

Was stuck in a toxic FP situation for 3 years. Took my emotions and energy and complicated things. Much older person (3 times my age) and was pretty much groomed at 18. Finally left him . I was clingy desperate for a toxic person.

But I am always emotionally promiscuous anyway. Any guy shows the slightest bit of attention, I run into his arms regardless of red flags.

Epileptic and chronically ill. Health not stable.

Senior in uni and trying to push through to graduate.

69,How do I fall in love with life again?,"TLDR: How do I approach recovery? Life doesn't excite me anymore. How do I fall in love with living again?

I am finally taking the jump to go all in on recovery. But I am not sure where to start. I have a therapist, I have DBT and BPD workbooks that I am working through. I have been a lot better at taking my medication, and I am being more honest with myself and those around me. But apart from that, I am not sure what else to do. 

Nothing is exciting anymore. I don't look forward to anything. When I wake up in the morning, unless I have some form of external commitment (appointment, meeting with friends, etc.), I have no problem staying in bed all day. 

I want to enjoy living. I want to get excited about being alive for another day. I want to be motivated to be better. I want to fall in love with living again. I know how precious life is, and I am so grateful for waking up each day and being able to live another day. But unless I am in a manic episode (bipolar 2 as well as BPD), I have 0 motivation to do anything, even the things I used to love. 

The advice I have so far is:

- plan things that I look forward to (I.e. date nights, holidays/vacations, etc). The problem here is that I am fresh out of uni (biomedical science) and have just started a new job, so i am broke and can't afford to make exciting plans. 

- romanticise my life - how do I actually do this in practice? 

- the Seinfeld method - possibly to track exercise? I'm thinking of a 10-minute walk each day?

- routine - starting small with one habit (I.e. morning or night routine) and adding onto it as I master each habit.

71,I chose to be I choose to be codependent.,"

Ok this is going to be a long story on why I made this choice and how me and my husband of 2 and a half years are making it work. 
I'm multiple diagnosed with ASD, BPD, Bipolar type 1, Schizoaffective Bipolar type, OCD, ODD, ADHD, CPTSD and a lot of other mental health issues as well as some medical ones but those are the main reasons.

Before I met my husband I was extremely unstable constant splitting, at one point I od'd on my blood pressure meds, I have a nasty scar on my thigh from a bad relationship[self inflicted] I was an absolute mess. Let's add onto this I had recently had a therapist that was constantly instilling into my head that I was a burden by saying what are you going to do when your parents die. My parents had also been known to bring me to look at group homes without telling me before hand the first time this happened I had a full meltdown in front of the woman who ran it and she said if I did that in front of the other girls they would beat me up.

After the relationship that resulted in both the scar and the od I finally decided enough was enough and took matters into my own hands because I knew where my life was headed. It was on a dead end path to a group home. So I started looking for someone. Now here's how I found someone that changed my life completely. I chose the bdsm subreddits. I already knew I was a little with a codependent personality so I actively looked for a daddy-dom. Someone who knew how to take a caretaker role and help when I got out of control and acted like a child. That's how I found my husband.  He knew from day one about my illnesses, and also knew quite a bit about psychology so he has been extremely understanding from day one and we hit it right off. Within 2 weeks of connecting online I moved in with him we married 6 months later. Since meeting him I have gone into remission I'm also semi-indepentant in small.. or well for me big ways... for the first time in my life I can truly be left alone in the house for long periods of time. I haven't had a split in 3 years and most of my insecurities have faded and when they do show their ugly little demon heads he immediately squashes them and builds me back up. I've also been able to go off almost all my medications and im now on only one. And weve also been talking about having children of our own. For me personally, it's the best decision I ever could have made.

EDIT: Just be careful. A lot of people online are looking for an abuse victim and know nothing about aftercare. At first we were all about the sex but we quickly moved on and grew as a couple. It became about the future and how we didn't know what we wanted to do but we knew we wanted to do it together. He keeps me sane and I keep him happy.

72,Help Navigating Help,"Howdy! Last year around October, I started counseling and medication again. I was in the tail end of a bad relationship and hadn’t had a job in months. Now, I’m single, live with super supportive friends, and have a job I’m extremely passionate about.

Unfortunately, I can’t really muster any of that passion. Since I began taking antidepressants in October, I have documented a severe decrease in my overall quality of life. This has also been documented on the app by both myself and my care team. I am on my 4th course of antidepressants this episode with only an increase in depression symptoms. I expressed this to my psychiatrist as well as my suggestion that I stop this course of meds, just to see if some of my symptoms decrease. There was some back and forth, and she called me aggressive (which was annoying because I’m just asserting myself, it’s my brain after all and no shit I’m irritable when I haven’t felt a positive emotion to my core in months). But I also understood because I was definitely channeling my anger to help me blow past my fawn response of compliance. Eventually, I explain that I had done some independent research and knew that other types of medications (anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics) could potentially be more useful. After that she backed off and was like, oh well if you need an anticonvulsant then we need to refer you to someone irl. To which I replied, I would rather be on the right course of meds than be on an online platform. In the end, we are trying new anxiety and sleep meds with no antidepressant (against the doc’s recommendation) for two months. If there’s no change, then she’ll recommend an antidepressant again. Ugh, the whole thing was really hard and I was shaking for most of it. I feel like my doc made it harder than it had to be though. Especially since I didn’t want to even begin the 4th course, at the end of the 3rd I said I wanted to stop antidepressants completely and was told to try again. 

Sorry, that was a lot, but I want to know how y’all go about recommending changes in your medications to your doctors and what you do when you meet resistance. Also, do psychiatrists generally have like no bedside manner?",1623988152.0,False,8,7,3dumbbitchesinacoat,None,o2fvxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/o2fvxx/help_navigating_help/
73,Questions fo Men with BPD,"I see that most people with BPD seem to be women, but I read an article saying that its because of men not seeking treatment, so the institutions can't record them as often. This gave me a relief as I thought me having BPD in the wrong gender made things worse (I know, that sounds stupid). I have never met a male with BPD myself, but I would like to ask these questions to the guys here. 

\- How do you deal with hiding your emotions in public/group settings when you get triggered? Men have stigma to show any extreme emotions after all, so I bet its more difficult than it is for women. 

\- Are you on any medication to treat BPD?

\- How do you deal with being alone for too long? Do you try to talk to absolutely anyone you can reach to avoid the feeling of being invisible? I know I do, it is very common for me to lose touch with reality and feel like Im vanishing from existence if I stay alone for more than a day.

74,uhhh... do you have any suggestions for individual-ing? TIA,"Hey all, thanks for reading/commenting. 

Going through therapy + DBT + medication* (+ constant self-analysis) and while it's all very helpful and interesting, I'm struggling with identity.** Totally acknowledge that bpd has a hand in feeling this way, along with imposter syndrome, but since realizing that the largest driving force in my life has been gaining attention and affection (belonging), I'm struggling to find who I am and what I like. 

Have you struggled with this? Have you found activities or skills/tools that you feel helped? I would really appreciate any suggestions, thanks. 


* To be fair, I also have bipolar and a couple other adjoining diagnoses.

** I became responsible for my parents needs - mom's emotions and dad's schedule - from age 4 on. While I was very well cared for and definitely loved, my parents didn't have the skills or the attention available to support my individual growth. I spent most of my life with the understanding that it was my responsibility to tend to the emotions and needs of people I cared about and vice versa. If my needs and emotions were going unmet then it was at the hands of my loved ones, but all because I wasn't doing my part well enough.

75,Dating app advice,"I recently came across a guy on a dating app whom I went on a couple dates with in 2015. (I'm very good with remembering faces!) At that time in my life, I was incredibly dysregulated and undiagnosed/untreated, and was using sex and substances as coping/connection.

Out of curiosity, I looked back at our texts. Apparently, we sexted A LOT and, also apparently, had sex once or twice. (I have very poor recall of this time.) We ended things after he stopped responding and I got prickly and confronted him. He apologized and told me I was ""amazing and beautiful,"" and that I deserve honesty. He said he gotten sick, and during that time he realized that he wants a relationship, which at the time I said I did not want. I got mad and texted something snide, and he did not respond. I totally get it. Again, dysregulation. 

Now in 2023, I am looking for a relationship. I'm medicated, in therapy, and actively working on getting my life together.  I remember liking him, and would be interested in seeing him again. 

Part of my BPD means that I get SO excited about someone, and then do Too Much. 

My question is, would it be weird if I texted him again, after 8 years, to say that I saw him on the app and would be down to reconnect if he is? Is that Too Much?

I'm very calm. Sometimes to calm for my own good. But when he splits...he splits very quickly. Its rage when triggered. He will yell and blame me for things that are not my fault when he ""splits"". But otherwise he is a great partner.. Today we had a argument. I let him have a hour or two space and then came to talk to him.. he started disrespecting me and getting very mad again and treating me badly. He said he was being triggered by me and needed more time. I should have just walked away, but i didn't. I stayed and calmly tried to explain myself while he was yelling over me and blaming me. He then got up and pushed the door closed while I was behind and still talking to him while it was half open. He did it so fast and hard on me that it bumped my head and now I have a lump on it. I told him off for it. But since he was already triggered, he just lost it completely and said it is my fault and then slammed the front door and said it was over. I haven't seen him since. He said not to contact him. I told him not to come back until he goes to the mental health ward in the hospital and talk things through with them. I told him I don't feel comfortable with him coming back until then. He  replied a few hours later saying his at the hospital.  He just started seeing a therapist too, to help him with his anger. But I also understand that he has poor impulse control of his emotions and I should have walked away when he told me to. Though this doesn't excuse his behavior. None of it does. I just don't know what to do. His had a really bad childhood and his last relationship was really abusive too, so he often gets triggered. But he wants to change. And knows it's a problem when he is clear headed and not feeling mad or fustrated.  He is also withdrawaling off weed which his been smoking for years and years. I don't know who's at wrong here or if it's both of us to some degree. I should have walked away when he said he needed the space. And he shouldn't have done it regardless. It's not black and white. Sometimes relationships are much more complex and shades of grey then most are quick to assume. Do you think this is something we can overcome with continued threapy and hard work ?

83,New to BPD,"Hey loves, 


I was diagnosed with BPD fairly recently. I’ve been dealing with rocky mental health for about 10+ years. I was always told it was just depression and anxiety. I was taking regular medication and while it took the edge off my symptoms they didn’t ever go away. So I went back to my GP to get some more help. I saw a specialist and was immediately diagnosed with BPD (albeit “high functioning- not sure what that means). I’ve been trying to do my own research to better understand this, but I’m not sure where to go. Everywhere seems full of symptoms and how to get help and not how to live with it or manage symptoms. 

Are there any online resources available? Any helpful information you’ve found out? Good coping strategies etc

I feel like I’m finally on the “good” side of this and I might be able to help people with what I’ve been through. However now that I’ve actually gotten this thing off the ground, there’s SO MUCH MORE I could do with this. 

There really aren’t any resource sites made BY borderline people. All the information out there is clinical and written by the neuro typical or people who are bitching about us. I want to make a resource FOR borderline made BY a borderline. I want to include information on therapies, medications, history, depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicide (and ideation). I want to provide information for teens and veterans and parents. There’s places for the families of BPD to go to, I want to provide a place with everything that affects BPD and the PEOPLE who actually HAVE it. 

So help me, please, with ideas. I’ve gotten a few really good ones from some folks in the chat, but I want to keep asking around. 

-What did you need when you were diagnosed?
-What resources did you wish were available then?
-What resources do you wish are available now?
-What helps you through a split or any swing currently or past?
-What is the hardest part of BPD for you?
-What therapy has helped you the most and why?
-What medication has helped you the most?
-What do you wish neuro typical people knew/understood about BPD?

So I have not been medically diagnosed with BPD but I have GAD, OCD, autism, and depression and all of which have made things very hard. 

Recently I’ve been struggling with some very complex emotions and mental struggle including obsessive thoughts about my therapist. How every it feels slightly different to ocd. I get these thoughts where I over analyze and find a problem with the things she does (wears, behaviors, etc.) it has caused me to feel like a horrible person. And no matter how much cognitive reframing I do it won’t stop. My brain won’t listen to any logic or rationale. I end up checking her Facebook and pretty much every other thing online of her multiple times a day. I feel as if I NEED to know more about her. Sometimes I just have this feeling like somethings off and I relate it to her. And over all it makes me feel like a creep and a horrible person. Especially since she is basically the sweetest person I know, and has helped me so much, and always been there for me

I though originally this may have been more tied to my OCD, but after doing some research I think I may need to ask my psychiatrist about bpd.

He was my first boyfriend ever. It’s exactly how it sound. Getting beating up, manipulate, cheating on, denigrate and ect. All my twenties I was miserable. Severe anxiety and depression. Binge eating which had me come up until 320 pounds. Isolation from friends and family. I really had come to conclusion that this was I meant to live. The worst in all this is, everyone around us always was always telling us we were the dream couple. When the pandemic strike, I was stuck at home and the violence became more and more unbearable. I am not a big drinker but one day, I decide to drank wine to ease my pain a bit. It actually save me because I had the drinker courage. He had beaten me again. I decide to call his mom (who already knew) to ask her to come get him. I was in a panic. I also decide to call my sister and tell her. My drunk logic was, if someone knew, I would be too embarrass to go back into this toxic and manipulative piece of shit of a man. I was right, I never went back. My mom took me back at home and it felt good to be around family. Two of my sisters lived there too. But we were never a emotionally open family. So I never really talked about this. Even if I escape I was fucked up. And I actually loved him (or I thought). Now I was stuck with all this pain by myself. I couldn’t really afford to have private psychologist. At one point, I got a family doctor after 20 years without one. At first I just wanted medication for my ADHD but my diagnostic was too old, he send me for an evaluation with a psychiatrist but by the public system. When they called me to evaluate the case, they asked me other question not in link with my ADHD, and I told them everything about what happened. They put me in a priority list. I saw a psychiatrist very fast, she was not worry about my lack of concentration, but with all the rest. I got diagnosed with BDP and severe PTSD from this relationship. The BDP part was really shocking to me. I never thought about it. Maybe I had preconceived idea about it. But it make a lot of sens. My behaviour and lack of self love since I was a teenager should had been worrying for me parents. Again, I don’t have a family that talk about theses things. I always was in pain alone. And very ashamed of this pain. I am still on a list to see a psychiatrist. I can’t afford one even with my private insurance. My psychiatrist had put me in A LOT of medications. I was a really zombie. And it never helped me. Every time I told her, she didn’t want me to stop or change. I didn’t felt listening by her so at one point I stop seeing her. I stopped all theses medications too. The things was, as soon as I left my ex, my life became amazing. Even with all this pain and fucked up brain. I lost over 100 pounds very fast (not in the healthiest way, I’m sick remember). I was always pretty but of course way more attractive without this weight. in two years, I got 2 promotions and a new super cool dream job. Even without education, got this very well paid job with hard work and experience. I also met my now husband. Which is, freaking amazing men. He had teach me what a real relationship should look like. He his handsome, gentleman, a successful artist, generous and fun. For the first time of my life, I was going out tasting every restaurant in town, seeing every exposition, going to weekend trips and just living the best life. He is also my safe place. I told him everything that happened to me and he is helping me a lot to deal with my pain, anxiety and depression. We moved downtown in a super luxurious tower. I travel a lot. I connect back with all those friends I had isolated from. I really do have everything I ever wished for. People envy my lifestyle. But even with this dream life, every night, I look in the mirror, into this pretty girl, with nice things, with a amazing husband, in her cool appartement and I am in pain. I cry almost every night. I am scare to lose all of this. I am scare my husband will become suddenly like my ex. I think I suck at my job. I am still miserable.

92,I'm feeling lost with my bpd,"Hey there first time posting. So I haven't been diagnosed yet but my therapist agrees that I fit the criteria and my partner agrees too. I'm 20F and he is 24M. I found out about Bpd around six months ago and delved in because it fit me. I also have OCD, PTSD and ADHD. I've been on and off medications and use DBT to help. 
Currently we have been together for about 2 years. We have started to have really big issues now and it's mainly because of my episodes. I'm super reactive and in tuned to his needs and body language. It's gotting so intense for me that I can't even focus on what he's actually saying. This has lead to multiple intense episodes. The other issues I have is with spending or communicating clearly. 
I'm at a loss of how to cope and have the support I need from my partner. Due to my episodes they are traumatized because I've been abusive. I hate it. This makes me hate myself so much and resent myself for it all. I almost dont want to put in the effort to be better because I don't feel like I deserve it. Im a person who thinks shiitt people just stay shitty. This is so scary for me because I want to be with him but I think he deserves better. I just need help and I don't know what to do.

94,Trying to recover while in a new relationship,"Hey everybody ! I have recently been on the journey to start recovery right now after going through a really rough and challenging time after starting a new medication that brought out the worst parts of myself and a new relationship that i realized heightens my bpd symptoms (even just having the context of being in a relationship had me triggered). I want to further my growth as much as possible so I want to make sure I work towards my growth instead of against it. So I share this in hopes of getting feedback or really any response! I want to know what other ppl think from an objective POV ! This is a long post so be prepared for that ! 

I am currently tapering off this medication and working through dbt workbooks and in the process of getting started at an outpatient dbt program ! We both have mental illness and they have gotten treatment/ are going to therapy and taking meds however unfortunately things started turning toxic unknowingly and there was a dynamic created where I started burdening my partner and they felt like they always had to be there for me even if they didn’t have the capacity to otherwise in their mind who else would and over time started revolving their whole life around me (even isolating themselves from others just to b around me and try to be there for me in crisis). They took me expressing some of my intrusive thoughts and fear of abandonment to heart and made themselves suffer to make me feel “better” or not to abandon or leave me.

 I would word vomit and over share a lot of things I definitely should’ve kept to myself but that I never knew was making them feel like this. Our communication was off because they thought it would make me feel even worse and I would in turn internalize any feedback or criticism and also sometimes they didn’t even know how they felt never mind to then tell me. We got into a habit of them reassuring me no matter what and a routine of seeing each other all the time. After a major meltdown from me and a long day of work, we got to the point where we both got triggered and had an emotional night which lead me to initiate conversation about the issues that are there. 

As we uncovered more, it was disturbing to see how something that we both thought was going pretty well to see how actually unhealthy our start was.  

We have granted each other space as we definitely need to think, reflect and let ourselves read the situation/our feelings more. Last night, we talked about it and took accountability and shared feelings that were scary to say and admit but were needed to be said. We decided instead of breaking up we both are going to put forth the effort and time and patience to try and care for ourselves more and in turn make it so that we rebuild and unlearn all the misconceptions that we had in our relationship by creating and actively writing down different solutions to our issues and putting in a plan to how to achieve it to give us another go but I wonder if even this is a way of being toxic. 

My worst nightmare of burdening someone else’s mental state bc of me came true and while it was on them for the lack and dishonest sense of communication within themselves and with me I just don’t want to make more toxic decisions and hurt us both in the end :,( 

Any feedback would be appreciated and I guess if anyone relates to this it would be nice to know I’m not alone in this position. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed that I let myself get to the point where I was hindering the growth of my partner and weighing their life down but I’m trying to accept that there’s nothing I can do about the past and just to take accountability and change however if anyone has suggestions on how not to feel so guilty/bad/ashamed please lmk !!",1625235134.0,False,4,4,lotus-pea,None,ocawyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ocawyx/trying_to_recover_while_in_a_new_relationship/

96,"After having this med cocktail+not burdening myself, I am better. I was having a huge mental breakdown a year ago.","Forgive me if I have typo, I’m typing on my phone.

I was going crazy. Just crazy. I don’t even want to talk about it because it’s so shameful.
The breakdown was caused by lots of things, but major thing was school stress, alcohol, etc.

I got hospitalized again. 3rd time.
I was having a good calming 72 hours.
Later on I have realized I am an alcoholic. 

So I quit, I think at least 40% of my sanity comes from not drinking. I tried A.A in person and online plus networking, I personally didn’t like it.

Then my psychiatrist prescribed me Librium, I was on over than reg dose for anxiety -(reg dose that ppl take in google) 
I was being a zombie but I think it was worthy, I’m tired of laying down all day.

Since I was a zombie I decreased the dose, switched to klonopin since quantity is not available for some reasons in my area. 
I was on 1 mg, started SNRI -Pristiq. 
25mg once daily didn’t work.
50mg I felt difference after I started taking it for like more than 3 weeks.

As time goes on, I added weed (vaping and consuming medical weed) for tapering benzo+I like the effect. Makes me distracted when I am upset sometimes, when I need a calming time, morning time before my pharma med kicks in, before I go to bed.

I take only 0.25 of klpin twice daily.



So
-Antidepressant reg dose (everyone is different, Pristiq was my match)

-No alcohol (my emotional side gets crazy)

-Benzo(I don’t recommend it because of severe physical withdrawal, but it’s working well for my anxiety. Before I would be walking and looking back v often and thinking someone would attack me. I don’t have those thoughts unless someone gets super x2 close to me. 

-Medical mmj. Since I don’t like how potent flower smells it works. 
 I don’t recommend black market for vaping. Since I have been paying for my therapy out of pocket, I have 2sessions a month now. Used to have 3-4 sessions a month. 
Tbh now albeit I use about 3g of vaping mmj within in a month in a med mmj expensive City(half gram would cost me $65-75), I pay less for my mental health(it’s been 12 years, going to therapy, looking for right medication. I couldn’t handle dbt. I hated group sessions.)



I am far better than who I was exactly a year ago. I dropped out of school, I got a small job, talking to my parents, I don’t feel so miserable like before. I don’t want to kill myself for things that don’t matter. 

I feel like I am gifted. 
Even tho I have some struggles daily, ofc life is not a easy thing. My work place is stressful, min wage. But at least I can kill time with studying.
I’m just gonna get a certification.


I had 100,000 thoughts a day. Now I have 5000 thoughts and those are not suicidal.

97,Advice on shame/anxiety when plans go wrong/differently,"hey, I’m diagnosed with BPD with a family history of OCD and autism, so generally as a unit things not going according to plan can be very upsetting and frustrating. I was wondering if anyone has advice on how they worked to overcome this?


Example of what happened tonight leading me to reach out:
Because of my procrastination anxiety I didn’t start my homework until later in the day, that is my fault I’m usually better bout it; It was harder to focus today. I finally start, and only get 15 minutes in to what is planned to be an all nighter to prep for a Chem exam I have to make up. I’m already behind because of other mental health stuff and the prof was gracious enough to give me extensions. So, as I’m beginning chemistry after finishing English; the Wi-Fi goes out. I’ve reset it a few times and nothing; we are also currently having a really bad wind/rainstorm so I believe it’s an outside issue. It’s closed a road near me and has knocked power somewhere else. 


I’m proud with how I handled it tonight mostly,
I got really upset, and cursed quietly to myself out loud instead of raising a massive fuss. I’m not great with tech stuff and I’m also too short to see over the router, so I had to wake my brother up to ask him where the button was & how to flip it. He knows it finals for me so he was understanding, just sleepy. When i realized there was nothing I could do, I started to cry. I let myself cry as much as I could, with my own issues I tend to not cry much at a time, but a little is better than nothing. After that, I did something I usually don’t do in the past out of shame/fear; I emailed my professor. I let him know what was going on, and to let me know what he believes the best course of action should be first today. 
Since, I’ve been trying to take care of myself before bed. I’m bout to shower and I just smoked and took an edible.


 My problem is I’m still dealing with immense anger, shame, stress, anxiety, and fear over not getting to do my plan. I have whatever the “quiet” form of bpd is referred to, I forget the name; but I internalize things rather than externalize mostly. 
So I’m moving and functioning but inside I am heavily beating myself up over something currently out of my control, and for something I’ve already put myself accountable to.
How do you all cope with these feelings? Any advice would be awesome and appreciated. I’m in and out of therapy rn and trying to find a dbt place that takes my insurance.

98,Is it valid that I worry about my ex seeing other people?,"**TLDR; my ex left the door open for us to get back together while we both heal, but I can't cope with the possibility that he will meet other women and hook up with them. Is it valid for this to be a dealbreaker if we got back together, or would someone with a healthier attachment style be understanding of our status (broken up) and not hold it against him?**

I was in a relationship for 1.5 years, and we very recently broke up. This was mainly because of my uncontrolled BPD (which I am just now seeking intensive professional help for + medication) and his own struggles. I caused a lot of pain for the both of us.

Today I reached out, and he told me that he didn't want things between us to be permanently over, but that he sincerely needs time and space. However, I've been going crazy the rest of the day because what happens if we ever got back together? Last time this year we broke up and within a week he had hooked up with someone else. When we got back together he admitted he felt bad for doing so, but he never told me upfront that it happened --- I had to find out on my own and it caused me to be very suspicious of him and it hurt me for a long time.

The ""healthy"" part of my brain is telling me that we are exes. He has every right to meet women and make connections and hook up with people. I know I do too. But the ""unhealthy"" part of me knows that I would feel abandoned the second he did that, and I'm trying so hard to restrain myself from checking his IG followers to see if he's followed any new women recently. I did this last year and it ruined me. I would constantly shit on him and grill him on new followers when we got back together because it hurt me so bad. It's ripping me apart at the seams because I know that if we got back together and if I found out he hooked up with other people, I wouldn't be ok.

Are my feelings valid? Should I just totally let him go to save myself the trouble? Or is it healthier to accept his possible actions as perfectly valid if we got back together?

Here is the kicker though, I asked for help three months ago from my psychiatrist and psychotherapist as I knew I was headed in a downward trajectory. The Psychotherapist said I couldn’t keep using them when things got tough (I hadn’t spoken with psychotherapy in over a year and in that time I had used mentalization to help me cope with the bad periods). My psychiatrist in his infinite wisdom turned round and said I really need to learn to deal with these things on my own and discharged me!?

113,THERAPY SCAM ALERT!! BWRT (BrainWorking Recursive Therapy) - Terence Watts,"This is a super important post so pls don’t delete mods! I’m trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help aren’t lied to. 

Terence Watts’s “BrainWorking Recursive Therapy” or, “BWRT” is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a “full proof” solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!!

Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, it’s giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes. 

I was so amazed at first, and truly believed I’d finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be true… so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it. 

The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesn’t want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldn’t be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I don’t respond or you don’t see this post anymore… well I guess you know why. 

Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproduct… but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions. 


Here are some links about BWRT to get you started:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ts8qya/does_anyone_have_experience_with_bwrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Watts gets his inspiration from [Benjamin Libet](https://www.bwrtuk.co.uk/bwrt/), whose theory about conscious and unconscious behaviour forms the basis of his theory. He talks about it a lot on his website and in his youtube videos. 


Also, I found some interesting posts about Charles Linden - another “expert” who displays similar behaviours of secrecy, denial and harassment to Terence Watts:

(FYI: I still need to do some more research on this myself, so I am not claiming to be an expert on this matter.)

EDIT: another very interesting link… [the Advertising Standards Agency says he breached the “UK code of non-broadcast advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.”](https://www.ns-healthcare.com/news/terence-watts/)

“The Terence Watts BWRT Institute was found guilty of claiming it could treat and/or diagnose several serious health problems including anxiety, infertility and diabetes without substantiating such claims.

In its findings, the ASA also concluded that an advertisement on the website discouraged people from seeking essential treatment and necessary medical supervision for conditions, including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and thyroid problems.

The Advertising Standards Agency told Terence Watts the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding it should not claim or imply that BWRT can be used to treat conditions without demonstrating sufficient evidence.

The ASA also said the website should not reference conditions for which medical supervision is necessary when addressing those seeking treatment in the future.”

114,Seeking advice or experiences on how to cope with a very painful break up 🤐,"TW: breakup, being cheated on

Hey!

Does anyone have any experience or recommendations on how to cope after a very painful relationship ending?

 How not to drown in self-hatred when I contributed to this painful outcome?

Also on how to not slide into the next toxic relationship right away? 

It's been over for nearly 3 months. 

And I'm just not coping well.

And I want him back even if I should realise that we are obviously not good for each other.

End here if that's too long :3

We had a lot of ups and downs, started as an unlucky affair in a polygam setting, ended up monogamous, which manifested a lot of mistrust and fear on my side throughout the relationship. Nevertheless, we were incredibly close and I have rarely felt so connected. 

I was in a really bad shape mentally due to depression and life circumstances, in therapy yes but it did not help that much and he wasn't fine either. I always pushed him away bc I felt not worth it, felt too dependent and pulled him in if our distance intensified and he gave too much into it, nearly gave himself up for me without setting healthy boundaries. Which we would have both needed. 

Of course he cheated on me trough online sex dates when we were at our lowest. And he immediately replaced me when he was inpatient himself with someone he seeked relationship advice from and never mentioned towards me, telling me we both need to work on ourselves and need time.

My main fear of people leaving because I am too much for them when I am at my worst is confirmed and it hurts so incredibly because it was the first time I loved someone so intensely and felt safe in some way. 

I think we had a very explosive relationship because it was mutual love but at one point also trauma bonding on both ends (both being emotionally dependent on each other, me being PwBPD and him being mainly anxiously attached) 

I try to move on, live my life, continuing therapy, find myself again, start to depend on myself, being and enduring being single for the first time in over 8 years without jumping from one to another relationship, hobbies, seeing people, discovering new things.

But still I feel broken and scared to death to get close to someone again bc all of this is so painful.

Thanks for reading.

115,"Worry that I'm abusing, want to recover","Hi all! I'm so glad to have found this sub and I hope my contributions can be positive. I am writing because I feel like I have cyclically encountered the same obstacles and instigated the same disputes in my relationship with a stable, patient, loving partner who I am currently long-distance from. I have never physically hurt him in any way, but I recurrently get into the same argument, which he has begun to vocalize more freely is really hurting him. Obviously, both because I love him and don't want him to leave me, I would do anything to stop hurting him. But I need help figuring my way out of this self-contained paradox that is plaguing me. 

In an argument we had today, which started from a facetime call when I began to rant about some interpersonal troubles I was having with friends and then became embarrassed / felt like he didn't understand me and ended the call, he asked me whether I was trying to hurt him on purpose. I said no, I am trying to understand why someone so stable would stay with me(this is a continual issue I face, embedded in the fact that I don't see myself as healed yet and thus convince myself I'm undeserving of secure attachment). He has heard this before, and undoubtedly he will hear it again.

I asked him why he thought I was trying to hurt him, and how I could stop. 

He responded with the following, which I think pegged the issue pretty well.

We agreed we can both take space, as every phone call with him runs me into emotional overdrive and I'm left alone without any present comfort, but I really want to use this opportunity to explore my cognitive dysfunctions / dissonance so I can at least get a little bit better. I know recovery doesn't happen overnight, but I've been on this healing journey for long enough that regression makes me lose hope in the endgoal altogether.

I am seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow. I just took the whole summer to taper off of cymbalta and detox from adderall and really don't want to go back on antidepressants, but as I am about to enter my last year of university and work two jobs I know I need some medication; my current plan is to ask for adderall xr and rely on TM and yoga to cope with emotional instability, but I don't know if it will be enough. I also am no longer to see my last/only therapist, and am really hesitant to look for and begin with a new one as I've had such disheartening experiences in the past.

I would really, really appreciate any input or advice from anyone who has felt this way, dealt with similar issues, or just has some support or criticism to share.

116,i have a feeling i got misdiagnosed but i don’t want to self diagnose either,"hi! i’m 17, i got admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 2018. it’s been two years since i was admitted n it really opened my eyes in way. anyways, i was put on medication, zoloft and aripiprazole. they haven’t really worked in my opinion. i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety because i used to self harm in middle school n attempted suicide. i have a feeling there’s more to that, you know? i experience mood swings most of the time but they don’t last long. my family always refers to me being “bipolar” but the symptoms don’t match what i feel. i was doing research on things i was feeling, etc. i came across BPD, now like i’ve mentioned before, i’m not trying to self diagnose but i happen to meet with all the criteria symptoms for BPD. i do have a therapist and i’ve met mentioned to her my fear of being abandoned. being abandoned by my own mother as a kid, i guess it really affected me. i have a history of “roller coaster” like relationships, not only with partners but friendships as well, along with family relationships. the therapist i currently have is not going to continue working with the agency i’m at so she’s referring me to another therapist. i was wondering if i should bring up BPD with her? or at least ask if i can talk to a psychiatrist about it? i’m just very scared because i’ve been shut down about how i felt before, my old therapist would just brush away my feelings and say it was because “i was depressed” but i always knew there was more to it.. especially because i was young going into the psychiatric hospital and all i wanted to do was leave there, so of course i lied and made them think i was perfectly fine when deep down i knew i was struggling with more.. opinions?",1588463570.0,False,3,6,ffunkadelick,None,gcgm1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/gcgm1j/i_have_a_feeling_i_got_misdiagnosed_but_i_dont/
117,Fear of abandonment so bad that I would just rather be alone. Anyone have some good coping skills?,"I have one single friend and if it weren't for her family issues and mine occurring at the same time we probably never would have become so close. It's been a nice 3 years of being around a healthy person and observing what is and is not 'normal' behavior. I love my friend but I just can't feel her love or anyone else's and maybe that is the whole problem.

We went on vacation together back in September and ever since I have had this feeling like I'm losing her. These episodes are increasing in severity and I am aware that I am coping by splitting. Until this time she was 'an angel' and now I am looking at the faults and wondering, am I making this up or were they there all along? 

I had an extreme episode a few weeks ago and in a desperate attempt to curb my reaction I finally reached out to her, explained that I feel like I'm losing her and could we get together soon. I don't share much of my disorder, I play normal whenever I can because 1, who wants to hear about it and 2, who really understands anyway

Her reaction was to downplay what I was feeling, which isn't a surprise, she doesn't get it, and that's ok.

On my birthday I was kinda blown off, no big deal just another day. When we finally did get together she was less than attentive to me and our friendship. So I've kinda eased back, but I send her a good morning text telling her I love her, hoping she will understand I need to hear that I am loved too. I got a response but no ""I Love you too""

At this point I feel like she's pulling away from our friendship, but I don't know if that's my insecurity screaming or if it's real. The stress of being aware that this may all be in my head is what makes me want to shut out the whole world so I don't have to deal with this uncertainty.

Anyone have suggestions on how to deal with this kind of insecurity? I am taking an anti anxiety medication now and it is helping, but it's a PRN and I need to be careful of addiction. It would help to know that someone out there can identify with this.

119,Hurt my best friend need advice,"TLDR: pwBPD Hurt my best friend need advice on how to make things right from a person without BPD

Maybe this is unwelcome since I have BPD but I’m so profoundly aware of it and my symptoms, I’m in Therapy, I take medication, I’m trying with all my might to be normal and it’s working for the most part. I’m in a happy relationship, I’ve had my outbursts (never mean or aggressive, they look more like seeking reassurance and sobbing out of nowhere), but I have strategies to temper them 


HOWEVER. 
My best friend of 11 years and I had a falling out last weekend and idk what to do. I was at her engagement party when my boyfriend called me. He found texts in my iPad (ironically, with her) of me complaining in the past about things he did that hurt me (when he would ignore me or little things like that, things I didn’t want to bother him with. I know better now). He found texts of me saying I think a guy friend of ours is hot, even though my bf is the love of my life. He found texts of me ruminating to my best friend about my bf’s ex and how I went through his iPad back in April and deleted all pics of her in a fit of sadness. Anyway, the call was very intense and I thought he was breaking up with me so I left her party to talk things through with him. After an hour, I felt bad for leaving and came back. I told her what happened and gave her a hug and tried to dance (we were at the club). But I was constantly about to cry so I didn’t wanna cause a scene and left. The next few days were shit, convincing my bf to not take a break over what he saw, fixing things with him. I gave her space and she was so kind, saying she loves me and hopes I’m ok, I told her the same. Then after I resolve things with my boyfriend, she texts me saying she’s so hurt, she’d never do this to me, etc etc. I text her back a little angry and impulsively, saying it’s not like I asked for this to happen. I then calmed down and said bottom line - I’m sorry for even answering his call  at your party. The next week i was in jersey for Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his family. I told her I’d see her when I’m back and call when she had time. I suppose I should’ve just called myself but truthfully she can be very pointed and I’m extremely sensitive and HATE confrontation, and hoped my texts were enough. It’s now over a week later, I haven’t found the space to call her and apologize. I also posted on IG an hour ago of a November photo dump and didn’t include pics from her party. I deleted the post because I felt bad but that’s not before I notice she commented saying “glad I made the cut” in a petty way. 

I sent a text apologizing to her saying I’m tired and I didn’t mean to exclude her. She told me she expected an apology phone call from me a long time ago and she’s shocked and sad and hurt and she thinks I don’t care about her. I’m exhausted and it scares me that I have thoughts of so coldly just throwing her away because the effort involved in confronting and apologizing to her (not even sure how at this point) is so draining and I’d rather just not deal with it. It also scares me that a reaction I have to potentially losing her is what my boyfriend would think and my family and other few friends. I will discuss these toxic thoughts in therapy.  But if I ever want to get better I have to face my fear of her and of confrontation and just call and apologize. I feel like a horrible person and tbh I probably am.

121,(TW: Suicidal thoughts),"You can't talk about suicide. You just can't. 

I don't want to live. I've been dealing with the emotional pain (and literal physical pain and discomfort because of the emotional pain) for the better part of a year. My wife left me after 10 years together. She now is back in our old city, has been dating for months and is allegedly 'serious' about someone. 

I can't fall asleep because of the memories of all my awful monstrous behavior. When I do sleep, I wake up and am somehow shocked to discover I'm alone. This is every morning for the last 8 months. 

I've moved three times to try to reboot myself. But it's the same pain every day and it occupies my mind most of the day. I don't know how anyone cries this much. 

2 good friends who know of my diagnosis try to be encouraging. They push me saying things are better, don't think about it, focus on other things. Fellow pwBPD who I respect are understanding and (like my friends) tell me I'm not alone. All these people live in other countries. 

I am alone. I live alone in a small town in a country not my own where I don't speak the language. When these well meaning folks say helpful things; they will shortly put down their phone and live their own lives. 

I don't have and can't afford insurance. Because I'm American, insurance is more expensive for me than any other nationality; and therapists and psychiatrists who are from the English speaking world are exorbitantly expensive.  I no longer take medication because I had to make the choice between rent/food and the hit-or-miss prescription-happy behavior of the medical school psychiatrists I could once afford. 

I want to end my life. I'm told things will get better but they haven't for over 8 months and I see no relief ahead. I'm over 50, I had a great life for several years with her, so I've gotten more than many people do. Now my life is just crying, having the same sad conversations with the same 5 people who must be sick and tired of my same song over and over. 

I want to end my life and this pain.  I'm not allowed to talk about this and neither are you. Forums like this require trigger warnings, reddit has ONE subreddit called 'suicidewatch' which basically represents the entire fucking world's programmed reaction to anyone voicing any thoughts of suicide- stop listening, get that person safe at all costs. Great intentions; but for a person like me it means people share hotlines or videos or articles then go back to their day and forget it all. 

There's only one reason I don't just end my life- the mess that leaves behind. Someone (likely someones who have no idea of my actual situation) would have to deal with my body, the cleanup, Communication with authorities and those few who care about me- and the trauma they would endure. 

But every day it gets harder and harder. Reading books like REASONS TO STAY ALIVE or the hokey elementary condescension of DBT workbooks turn me off and make it worse.  

There's a growing open minded conversation regarding self euthanasia and 'right to die,' but these are centered around people with cancer, terminal physiological illnesses, chronic pain, etc. But hey not me, not pwBPD, we can chin up and buck up and think of other things because our pain is not only less valid- to many it's not even real!! 

I don't know what I want from this post. All I know is I'm focusing a lot of energy on researching painless, inexpensive, and low impact suicide methods. I even looked into ways that would leave no mess, no body- for all intents and purposes I'd just have 'disappeared.' 

And we all know the truth- a few people would be hurt by my disappearance but not many and not for long, because they're loved by people who are physically present. They'll move on and I'll be just a memory. I don't really matter that much. 

My ex is not a good person, I've come to learn; or has drastically changed. Yet I still make sure enough of my income is routed to a bank in her city under her name so she can be ok. I love her still and I know I'd she wanted to be together again I'd crumble and submit to anything she asked. Even though that's a fantasy I know it wouldn't work out. 

But if I died- lets say in a true accident- there's loads of benefits for her and others. She'd inherit our small company and my reputation, I'd become a mascot for our company and organization, she would get the support and sympathy of a widow and be truly free of me so she can be with her new someone freely, and my close friends wouldn't have to bear my daily sadness-by-text. 

I'm so tired. The idea of this as my future is not something I can face anymore. I see no brightness ahead- the only thing I see for sure is another 6-8 months of this life and I do not see any light at the end of that tunnel. 

I once had a life I thought I was dissatisfied with. But now I see it was ambition and drive for more that blinded me to the happiness i had before me. 

I have moments when I think ok, I feel a bit stable- but so far these periods of time are never longer than a few hours. 

Today I won't try to take my life. But it's harder every day and suicide is tempting. 

I hope society can normalize talking about death, suicide, and mental/emotional challenges without judgment (and knee jerk reactions of medication, institutionalization etc ARE judgmental).  Maybe if there was a way to openly discuss these feelings without fear of being treated like that, and without fear of the conversation hurting others who suffer, then maybe people like me could find some answer. 

I think that answer is normalizing suicide. A structure that provides non judgmental realistic exploration of the potential reasons to die or not die; allowing the suicidal person the opportunity to make a truly informed choice. 

I know I'm posting this in reddit. I know there are no safe subreddits. I'm preparing myself for the trolls... or maybe I'm hoping their cruelty will motivate me to stop being a fucking coward and just end it. 

I wish I didn't feel this way and instead could offer genuine support to others suffering here. Instead I'm just taking up too much space- look at how much I've written now already, demanding attention. I'm disgusted with myself. 

I guess that's my rant. If you read this far thank you, and I'm sorry if it was hurtful or unpleasant in any way.",1615514627.0,False,26,11,IraJohnson,None,m36wo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/m36wo2/tw_suicidal_thoughts/
122,My partner accused me of stealing his emotions (cross-post),"My partner (m38) is also extremely mentally ill. He's erratic, mercurial and has bouts of explosive anger. It's typically not towards me specifically but he screams and stammers in this high pitch voice and when I (m30) get upset or freaked out and say anything, he tells me that I'm stealing his thunder and that I keep him from expressing his emotions because I make everything about me. He even suggested that he could prove it by manipulating me by faking emotions to see if I copy him. It's gotten worse since he learned that pwBPD have the potential for elevated emotional mirroring.

This is not my intention. I try to stay quiet and keep a cool head but sometimes I cannot keep from saying something or being physically affected (i.e. crying or having an angry expression) He is currently in the middle of an ongoing breakdown and as a result, literally anything that upsets me is considered paltry. He constantly asks me, ""what are you so sad about?"" As though I don't have a personality disorder, cPTSD, GAD, depression and a myriad of other fucked up shit from both genetics and a shitload of trauma. Our relationship is toxic but hey, unstable relationships are part of the game, I guess.

I have no job because my brain is fucking fried and he's under an absurd amount of pressure to work a job he hates and so I try to minimize what I can because he has so much responsibility. If he puts me down or accuses me of only caring about myself, like he often does, and I begin telling him that he is obviously better off without a burden like me, I get the routine, ""ope, here we going. Swinging the pendulum."" Or again, accusing me of trying to make everything about myself. He also gets angry if I don't say anything to him and will start asking, ""are you not talking to me?"" I have extremely bad days too and I can't express them without him claiming that I'm one upping him. I'm so exhausted.

I can't leave him because I have literally nothing. No money, no car, no family to rely on. My family essentially cut ties because I'm trans. (Today he also guilted me about not getting along with the rest of my estranged, bigoted family because both of his parents have passed away, whereas my mom is still alive and I have 4 siblings) I'm also fairly certain that if I leave, he might cease to exist. That's not even an exaggeration. I can't have him committed because he'd lose his job and everything he has. I can't commit myself because I'd be seen as attention-seeking.

As the child of an alcoholic, I guess it's no surprise that my partner of eight years would end up being one too. He's been sober for 9 months and constantly reminds me that it wasn't his choice. (He had become increasingly emotionally abusive over a period of a couple years and I was trying to make plans to leave him.) I'm not sure two people with these levels of mental illness can be together without destroying each other. I can't fall apart because he's falling apart. I can't feel joy because he can't feel joy. I can't be upset because he is upset.

There's nothing left. I want to not be in existence anymore so so often but I'm trying. I'm in therapy and on medication that doesn't fucking help, I've done workbooks, done things affirm important parts of my life, I've set and achieved goals and in the end, everything in my life is a fucking wreck and so much of it feels like it's my fault. Maybe I really am an emotional vacuum.

I'm trying hard to keep it together. I'm trying hard to be the strong one. I am exhausted every day of my life, physically and mentally and it all just gets worse. Everyone leaves. My family, my friends, my other partners and my partner has emotionally checked out of our relationship. Every circumstance is fucked, the climate, the government, my family, my past, my relationships, my brain and even my pets. I don't know who I am from day to day. Apparently I am a selfish, attention seeking, spotlight thief.

Even now, I've made this whole post about myself, my needs and my emotions. I hate myself so much. I don't want this life or this body or mind. I hate me.

I know no one will read all of this and that it's filled with a thousand different directions of problems. I just needed to spill my guts somewhere where I can't hurt anyone else.

123,I don't know if I should breakup,"I have been dating someone for a month now. And it's just small things that are starting to make me resent them and make me nit want to be near them. 

I was meant to see him the other day and I slept in alot of the day until 2pm in the afternoon because my medication makes me extremely tired. I never have any enegry. He texts me ""are you coming or am I going to sit here all day waiting for you doing nothing? I thought you would be here already"" I got quite upset. In the end he came to see me after a argument about it because he was worried about me. 

Then he said ""your watching the show catfish?  Now I know why your so insecure, because your always watching these shows about false insecurities""  his brought up that I'm insecure afew times now. I know I am. I make it known. I get jealous and I do think he will find someone else. Someone better. 

And then the same night I felt unloved and I don't know why. So I left the bed he was sleeping in and stayed in anther room sleeping. He woke up and told me he was leaving because he can't sleep and what's the point being at my place when I'm not there when he can sleep alone at his by himself. He did tell me that he was triggered though afterwards. he also suffers BPD and alot of trumua from childhood. 

I don't like how he raises his voice at my dog because she doesn't like him alone with me. She is a guard dog and always comes to check on me near the bed. I get tired of him getting angry at her and raising his voice at her. She does this with everyone btw. She's just trying to keep me safe

This is all new to me btw. This all happened within 1 day. I had not seen this side to him prioir to this. Normally his extremely caring, giving, understanding, and communicates really well. But it's sending me into a trumua state. It's making me scared of him and cry and not want to be near him. I have been in abusive relationships before so I don't know if it's a trumua response or not or if it's him. But I feel scared. I have done many years of threapy and I'm on so many meds all I want to do is sleep all the time because I'm so tired. I can barely get out of bed because I am a zombie at this point with the amount of meds I'm on just to make me act more ""normal"". 

Please don't say to work on yourself and just be single. I've been told that my whole life. It doesn't solve anything.. and im almost infertile at this stage. I'm even to infertile for IVF. I want a family. I've done years of threapy. I've tried so hard. I just don't know what to do. And this guy actually trys to understand me. Even when I get upset or have my stupid tantrums. But these things I pick apart about him I can't let go. He may do 100 things right , but the few things he does wrong makes me want to crawl into a ball and not see the light of day again and just breakup with him. And idk if the internet is really the best place for advice because it has ruined other relationships before by taking the wrong advice . But I feel out of my depths with this.

124,What Support Groups Have You Found for BPD?,"It sucks to be alone! It also sucks to not be able to afford group therapy! Share your experiences with free support groups from whatever perspective of recovery.

I've been going to two, with a generally positive experience. My experience so far is that it's lovely to have a support group at all; that's about 80% of the benefit. The details of the remaining 20% vary.

1) Emotions Anonymous is a recovery group modified from traditional 12 Step recovery programs like AA or NA. I've been going about once a week for about a year, now. The only requirement to join is a ""desire to become better emotionally."" It's very diagnosis-agnostic, so there are a diversity of psychological geogrpahy. Most of the people I meet there are bipolar, BPD, or suffering from PTSD, with a couple of DID cases. Meetings are supposed to be safe sharing spaces, meaning no unasked advice or commentary on others sharing. I'd say the major benefit other than a sharing space is the anonymity. The structure of the 12 steps might help some people and might frustrate others. The major con, to me, is the higher power stuff. 

https://emotionsanonymous.org/

2) The Icarus Project is a mutual-aid network and support system for people dealing with Mental Health Challenges that normally get called mental illness. I've attended about three meetings in my lifetime. Groups are organized autonomously and non-heriarchically, and groups provide a variety of functions. It is implicitly anarchist, and as such a lot of the literature it offers links mental health policy to repressive political apparati like the prison system. The major thing I like about Icarus is that it is harm reductive and self determinative regarding diagnosis, medication, and treatment options. The hardest part of making the groups happen is that it's hard to get political activists interested in mental health and it's hard to get emotionally debilitated people interested into politics. 

https://theicarusproject.net/

Oh, and Icarus has tons and tons of really good resources though, including a 1 page handout of crisis advice and space to write an advance directive. I highly recommend that anyone with BPD fill out a 1 page sheet on your needs during a crisis rather than let random medical professionals guess at your needs and preferences.

125,Recovery is possible and I might have done it,"Hi!

I hope all of you are having a good day. I'm just checking in to tell you that during our last appointment, my therapist of 3 years told me that she thinks I no longer meet the criteria for BPD and am what she calls ""a therapeutic success"". We went over how I got there over the course of my treatment and how some things will stay–""borderline traits"" that are part of my personality but no longer a handicap to my day-to-day life; and dissociative episodes that are now few and far between but not entirely gone. I know that setbacks are possible and even likely, but it does not scare me nearly as much as it used to! I have grown more confident in my skills and myself as a person despite previous therapists and medical professionals telling me there was no hope for me.

I wanted to share this feel-good news because I know that ""recovering"" from a personality disorder is so often seen as impossible that it really feels like there's no point in trying to get better. But there is!! I will be borderline my whole life but it doesn't have to be pathologic forever. I want to tell you that it does happen, changing is possible and work pays off. There's no way I could have imagined this just a couple years ago. You deserve care and your life is worth living, in and of itself, but also because it can and will get better. I also wanna thank this sub because you guys have been a really positive influence during my treatment and I hope this post contributes to give back a little.

126,Any advice for me? I could use a hand,"Hi everyone, 

This is the first time I've really out myself out there and spoken about my mental health in depth. 
I was emotionally and physically abused as a child by my step father and mother over several years. I was raised in a military family in Germany and because of that I didn't really have any support. I left home when I was 15 and although there were periods where I tried to go back to live with my family, it would always end the same way. In the end I was diagnosed with BDP (EUPD) and the therapists that I have spoken to think there is a correlation between my childhood and my diagnosis.

I have tried so hard to rekindle a relationship with my parents but I can't let go of what happened to me. They consistently called me a liar and berated me whenever I spoke about my childhood. I couldn't live that way and so I chose to change my surname and try to move on with my life. I can't live with the weight of that burden, not when I'm being forced to bare it alone. I just think that I couldn't trust them with my own children (in the future) if they can't even be honest about my upbringing. 

It's hard though. I just wish they would admit that it happened. I don't even want an apology, just vindication for the fact that there actually was a lot that went on that shouldnt have. 

Lately I have night terrors where I see flashbacks. It's debilitating, especially when I'm sleeping next to my partner. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, I take everything personally. I was berated all my life and now when I feel any negativity coming my way, I shut down.

I tend to find myself in pursuit of little highs, whether that's by smoking weed or buying frivolous things that I can't afford. I feel like I'm out of control when it comes to my impulses. I'm not as bad as I used to be. A year or two ago I was sinking x16 tablets of cocodamol at a time to feel numb. It made me really sick. I don't mess with that anymore and I have regular medication for my BPD, but I don't mess around with them.

I can't live this way, it's exhausting. Does anybody have any advice?

127,Passed the Bar Exam Today,"At the risk of seeming egotistical, I (29M) wanted to post this for anybody really going through it as proof that you can do that thing people say you can’t do because you’re borderline.

I’ve had a lifelong struggle with what I know now to be Borderline Personality Disorder. In highschool, I was bullied so aggressively I had multiple near death experiences and my family’s home was repeatedly vandalized. My dad was repeatedly battling advanced stage cancer and I had to take care of my brother through the end of highschool while struggling with what I know to be CPTSD now. I was (mistakenly) diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety when I was 18 and told I would need to live a low-stress, safe, low pressure lifestyle. I hated this. 

For years, through college I struggled with both being over-medicated while also being inadequately helped. I hungout with dangerous, aggressive people through college because that level of dysfunction felt normal. I graduated college with a double major, but struggled to function well in the workplace. Bad relationships with toxic people was all I knew.

I spent 5 years in a majorly abusive relationship with a toxic narcissist that resulted in multiple hospital trips for stitches and broken glass removal. When that ended, I was a law student and the stress of the breakup led to lots of psychiatric problems, the vast majority of my friends abandoning me, isolation, suicide attempts, and self harm. I had to drop out of law school twice. My CPTSD and providers’ mismanagement of meds was so extreme that I lost the ability to read for almost 18 months. But I graduated.

I wasn’t even able to take the bar exam when I wanted to- my law school made me join a disciplinary program designed for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems because of my mental health problems through law school due to the extreme stigma against mental illness in law. I had to delay taking the bar exam after graduating because my mental illness was regarded as “a danger to the public.” Joining that punitive program was the only way to convince my state licensure board I could be trusted.

Finally, I was diagnosed BPD and started to get better through DBT. DBT saved my life. I gained the skills to put myself back together. Today I have an amazing girlfriend, a nice small house, rescue pitbull, new friends (through my girlfriend) and a couple old friends that stood by me, and now a new career in law as an attorney in a mid size American city as of finding out I passed the bar just this morning. 

Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn’t a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it’s an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don’t deserve it. Do that thing everybody says you can’t do and tell anyone who tries to stop you to eat shit.

129,love when other women drag my partner,"They see a snippet of one issue in our relationship and make huge assumptions about the intire relationship and that he must be a terrible person and that I should run :( 


His honestly the first person in my life who has cared for me so deeply and takes care of me immensely. He puts up with all my psyical and mental problems and we always are able to communicate and problem solve. Like the other day I fainted due to a medical condition I have and he carried me back to my car and stayed with me the intire time to make sure I was okay and then layed me in bed and ordered foods. He goes above and beyond. He takes time off work just to be by my side. Other women think he is ""creepy"" because he is not as attractive and they think his ""ugly"" or his using me because of my ""beauty"". It's pretty discusting. He hardly asks me for anything other then to be by his side and be loyal.

130,Invalidation vs lost Credibility,"I have no credibility in my relationship because of years when my distorted perception went unchecked. Now I'm medicated, doing the right treatment, and it's not perfect but it is a lot better. I find it incredibly hard to accept that I still have no credibility in my relationship, my version of truth is automatically questioned and doubted, he often treats my concern like a jury trial where I have to prove that my reason for being upset is valid. It's very painful and frustrating for the closest person to me to doubt my truth constantly. I see no other solution but ending the relationship to find a partner who doesn't have the same history with me bc my partner seems incapable of seeing me as I really am now, and just sees what he expects to see - which feels like, no matter what I'm upset about, it must be splitting or attachment issues and couldn't possibly be valid. That's the message I get, and I don't know how to have a healthy relationship with someone who believes this. Not to mention it makes me much less likely to catch when I am making assumptions or have an unnecessarily negative read of a situation because I'm distracted by pain and frustration of his Invalidation as a default position.

131,About to embark on a 32 week DBT/Therapy program - spaces available in the group DBT sessions,"I am about to bite the bullet and begin a course of therapy and DBT training.  It’s going to send me into debt, but I’ve been in debt before and never for anything this valuable.

After searching online, I have found a licensed professional counselor and psychologist who is trained and experienced in working with pwBPD and in facilitating DBT Skills training sessions.

This therapist has a solid track record and (like Linehan) does not suggest medication – and very importantly to me, does not suggest facing or exploring traumas during this program.  This appeals to me.

I am in Asia, so I have been looking all over.  This counselor is based in the UK – and recommends a 32 week program – two sessions a week. One session each week will be group DBT Skills training, and the other will be 1 on 1 sessions exploring and applying the DBT training.

Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 2 (8 weeks) 	emotion regulation
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 3 (8 weeks)	interpersonal effectiveness
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 4 (8 weeks)	distress tolerance
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness

What is really tough for me is the cost – the session cost is 95GBP per session.  However, they would pro-rata this rate for the group DBT sessions – 95 divided by the number of participants.  That appeals to me because I learn very well in a group, and the pwBPD support group I take part in has been very valuable to me.

They are currently reaching out to colleagues to learn if there are others being treated who would like to be part of DBT Skills training and therapy.  So I want to share that opportunity here.

I recognize it is expensive.  I am fortunate enough that a close friend has seen how I suffered in the past 18 months and is lending me the money – it will take me quite a while to pay it back but its so much more important than anything I ever went into debt for.   It is also a solid commitment – they require we sign a contract  to commit to the program.

While it might not be for everyone here, I thought it might be worthwhile to present it to see who in this subreddit is interested.  I am eager to get started, to finally take a step I have never done and commit to 8 months of difficult weekly work.  It would certainly make it easier if the group sessions had 3-5 people, and not only me or me and one other.

IF you are interested, feel you can manage the cost (with a group session reduction as indicated), and want to know more; PM me.  I am happy to share the therapists profile and answer what I can, and connect you with them if you want to know more – they offer a free consultation session to help you decide if its right for you.

132,"Giving up hope= peace? (TW: suicidal ideation, overlong post)","I’m currently in Pokhara, Nepal on a work trip (teaching and performing theater) and stuck in he hotel with a rough sinus infection.  I found this in a bookstore here and those four questions made me think about living with BPD. 

Context about me: diagnosed in 1993, many years of many medications with intermittent success. Moved overseas and built a new life and business in 2007, married the love of my life and enjoyed a decade of life but was unmindful of my emotional volatility and how it impacted others. After moving to yet another country to grow the business in 2019, the pandemic led to bankruptcy and my wife leaving me and beginning a clear plan to end it all. Fortunately I was introduced to DBT and IT WORKS WHEN I DO THE WORK… but when things get extremely difficult it can be overwhelming to do the work. 

I’ve lost most of my close friends due either to distance or them being overwhelmed by me being ‘too much.’  I have been living alone now in the second country for a while, and over-working to fill the emptiness (and to try to pay debts and build some sort of financial stability). My DBT therapist declared I’d mastered the skills and was changing his business model, so that relationship ended two months ago. I wished him well and lied that I don’t fantasize about suicide any longer. I enjoyed the healthiest living relationship of my life for 6 months; yet we began knowing it would end when she relocated to the other side of the world. Although I was a much better partner to her- even so, at the end, she shared that I left her very little emotional space because I took up most of it. Now I’m in a third country for another week; much less developed than I’ve encountered, and managing this sudden illness alone. 

I used to think happiness was found in relationships. Yet, my emotional BPD mind (and to a large extent my personal experience) reminds me that everyone will leave my life at some point. Obviously with BPD Abandonment issues, this is a challenging thought to embrace. 

I’ve known all emotions are transitory and impermanent and that DBT isn’t a method to happiness but a way to manage and tolerate our pain and behaviors. 

I crave connection; I want to talk to someone who loves me and wishes to understand me. Yet when I’ve had these people I always eventually burn them out. 

I take things very literally. When my ex wife insisted we would remain close friends I believed her and of course that didn’t happen.  When my ex said she wanted to remain close and always talk, of course that did not happen. It’s hard for me to parse that someone can say something they don’t mean, or that later will be untrue.

Now I’m sick in a strange land.  And I crave conversation and validation and affirmation and love.  There are those that would say they’re there for me but history has shown most aren’t interested in my drama. Even my best friend is dismissive and too busy to talk. 

Then I find this book. 

I now theorize that interpersonal connections inevitably bring pain and suffering to one or both. No interpersonal relationships will last. The idea of joy and love and affirmation from others is illusory.  And ‘hope’ is the most destructive and hurtful concept. 

I’ve built a double career based on interpersonal connections - both in theater and corporate consulting. I’m more consistently unhappy than I was pre COVID. I’ve invested so much, and I’m still struggling so hard…. I’m debating retiring from the theater side (although I have a strong international reputation) and focusing on consulting and training and money.   This is something I’d prefer to talk through with a loved one… but my best mate said I’m ‘just spiraling’ and a person I’ve begun dating told me to ‘calm down.’

I don’t expect others to make concessions for me. And although my diagnosis isn’t my fault; it’s my responsibility to manage how I impact others. 

Maybe it’s time for radical acceptance- give up hope and understand life for me will be continued pain.

133,can't get a diagnosis!,"So I am usually not one to self-diagnose. I have been under psychiatric care since I was 13 (now 23) and have been diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, social phobia, OCD, anorexia, ADHD, and PTSD and I typically defer to my doctors/therapists. But it's pretty fucking obvious to me that there is something bigger going on here... how would a person have 7 unrelated mental illnesses?! I have been on a cocktail of psychiatric medications since age 13, tried every type of therapy that I could and I still feel like I'm grasping at straws and trying to treat things that are just symptoms of a larger problem.

I have done A LOT of research (I'm talking hours upon hours) and am reasonably confident that I have Quiet BPD. I think the reason that no practitioner has caught onto it is because I internalize everything and I only lash out at myself. I don't really show any external signs of having BPD, however I have 8/9 BPD characteristics in the DSM (for context, diagnosis is appropriate with 5/9 symptoms). 

When I brought this up with my psychiatrist, she said she doesn't really see typical BPD traits in me (which I think is because I have quiet subtype and it's highly internal) and that she is hesitant to diagnose BPD because of the stigma it carries... okay, but I am confident that I meet the diagnosis standards under the DSM and need to be treated for BPD instead of the other seven issues, as the BPD & PTSD are no doubt what is causing everything else. 

I really don't want to self diagnose. But I have brought this up with multiple therapists, psychiatrists, etc. and my ED recovery coach is the only one to see the truth in what I'm saying. I *know* something deeper is going on. I have felt this way my whole life and only when reading about quiet BPD was I able to understand the chronic emptiness that has caused all of the other issues. Yes, I have an ED, yes I am depressed. But they are not the root issues and I feel like I'm not being listened to.

I don't really know where I am on my BPD remission journey... But it's possible. 

It's possible to have healthy relationships in both friends and romance without splitting so bad. It's even easier when they all understand that you're a human and need a chance to process and hold you accountable for the the things that hurt them. 

They gave me a chance to grow, believed in my potential to heal and be better, they aided me with peer review and accountability and of course with every friend and romantic partner i lost, I begin to realize, newer, better ones come in and offer new perspectives and different ways to cope and grow. 

I sit here now, writing this as I do my Relationship DBT questions on two new friends i've met, and reading through it, reflecting back on it, makes me remember how far I've genuinely have come. 

Abandonment is a horrible thing to heal from. It's hard it sucks and it's painful and sometimes healing isn't for everyone. But the friends I have now, the ones I make, and the ones who stay with me, they make me feel less alone. And yes while I'll rehash old traumas and deal with the symptoms as they come, 

I can honestly say that life has been a lot better the more i continue my healing journey from bpd. 

And BPD is terminal. It can't be cured with anything. Therapy and medications and learning ways to make things easier and healthier for yourself through coping strategies may be the closest thing to a ""cure"" but it's a lot of hard work. 

it's hard work that I actively continue in order to keep healthy relationships, strong boundaries and honest communications with, because I deserve a chance to be happy and live a healthy life while living with BPD. 

So I guess if you're reading this, It's possible. It's possible to heal and to grow from the severity of it all. While it'll always be with you, You can find comfort in knowing that it's at least possible to ease the symptoms, to live a normal and healthy life style as Someone wBPD. So to whoever needed a sign to not give up and to see if it was possible, 

It is. 

Here's to the long progression of my own recovery, and all the beautiful places and people it will lead me to. 

And Here's to you, the reader. 

Everyone's journey is different, it's scary and it can be hard. But peace is just right around the corner. So don't trip, move at your own pace and just know there's someone out there who believes in you.",1686345948.0,False,16,2,Kitchen_Case1862,None,145hbh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/145hbh9/slowly_but_surely_im_making_it/
135,Seeking diagnosis,"Hi, 37F, just coming here to vent.
Currently seeing a psychologist and seeking diagnosis for BPD or cPTSD alongside my current social anxiety/phobia...

Fighting a constant hate and exhaustion of living.
Trying to take control.
Trying to stop self medicating with alcohol and food.

My behavior has been getting more extreme to the point where I am embarrassed and ashamed and my marriage of 6 years is a mess.
Alcoholism, self harm, suicide attempts, plain desperation.
Emotionally abusing as well as physical retaliation to my partner.
Wishing I could just be gone, not exist.
Not inflict myself on others.
Feeling outside of myself and my life or feeling it too much.
Dissociation constantly.

I want to come out the other side of this and find ways to cope and deal with my day to day life as well as strengthen rather than lose my marriage.

But at the moment despite seeking help and admitting my problems I find myself constantly in a destructive cycle.

Every time I 'genuinely' take steps in the right direction and want to change, days later I am at the other extreme.
Constant anger, mood swings, idealisation followed by self loathing and seeing the worst in myself and my partner.

Worse than that is the emptiness.
When I should be happy...
Lacking certain things I feel and it hurts.
When those needs are met... nothing.
It is hollow.

I didn't expect my life to be like this at this age.
Hoping to heal, and learn to help myself without hurting myself and those around me.

Hoping a diagnosis gives me solutions to help my current problems and struggles.

If you have read this far, thank you.

Here is to finding a way through life that is fulfilling and happy despite the difficulties put in our place.
Here is to finding a way to thrive.
Here is to beating what life has thrown at us.

136,ex.,"i am struggling so heavy. i’m doing better than i ever have, but god. we’ve only been broken up for 2 months and our relationship was short lived, 4 months. but i’m sure a bulk of you can relate to how intense your feelings for a significant other/relationship is. we started strong off the bat and jumped into things so fast, but it honestly felt so worth it. i’ve done this before in past relationships, but never as intimate/vulnerable/meaningful as this one was. 

i miss everything. i miss showering together, i miss spending so much of our time together, i miss our concerts in the car. our car time was our music time and it was something both of us were so excited for, we were constantly updating our playlists specifically for our car rides together. i miss going grocery shopping together, i miss running errands together. god do i miss our meal times. she focused so heavily about our meals. we typically would go to waffle house for breakfast, or if we slept in we would make breakfast together. we’d go out for lunch or again, make something together. but for dinner we always planned out a meal to make at home. she was the cook, i was just around her for “moral support” i suppose. she would always get so excited for dinner time. i would always be in there while she cooked because she wanted to be around me, she couldn’t do it without me. we ate together and always cleaned up afterwards. i miss taking care of her animals while she was at work, i miss taking care of them together. i miss cleaning the house together or surprising her with a cleaned room when she came home from work. i miss taking her starbucks on occasion while she was at work. i miss picking her up sometimes on her lunch break to spend that time laughing and talking in the car together. i fucking miss laughing with her. we spent so much of our time teasing, joking around, and just genuinely happy with one another. 

when we were together in person at least, when we got into arguments/fights.. she always got me to sit with her, hold her hands or touch in some way, and we would both talk about our side of the problem and then collectively came up with a solution or a compromise. god i fucking miss her. 

we broke up based off of a miscommunication and my actions. i was convinced she had it out for me and didn’t care about me. she tried validating my feelings everyday and communicated to me that she was extremely tired from work and college, but i was CONVINCED that wasn’t the case. so i ended up blowing up and left her. she didn’t want me to leave, i did it based off of imaginary fear of abandonment and basing my actions from my emotions. 
this was our second time being together, our first time was practically the same reasoning. so this time she was basically just really exhausted from me and how i reacted with that. i completely understand.

what i would fucking do to hear her talking about her favorite things. to do everything with her. or even just to lay in bed with her doing nothing. 

how do you overcome these intense feelings? how do you know when you need to keep trying, just with time; or when to completely give up? 

i wore a hoodie of hers that i still have, it smelled like her. i sobbed my eyes out for 3 hours and went through our pictures/videos together and re-read some of our messages. i’m a disaster. 


i am focusing on myself. i’m dieting, im in therapy weekly, im on medication, i paint, i read, i go on walks, i do things for myself. i just miss her with practically every bone in my body",1667448629.0,False,10,3,Fun_Sea_1109,None,ykrums,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ykrums/ex/

138,Relationship dilemma,"BPD, CPTSD, Bipolar 2

Sorry for this long rant, trying to make sense of my broken life and needed to share with others who might be more understanding about what I’m going through, with my mental illness.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I’m afraid I’m too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I’d he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me….. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can’t and won’t get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",1688449467.0,False,1,0,Old-Meet-1322,None,14q68cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14q68cv/relationship_dilemma/
139,~Triggers probably~ trying not to act out for attention,"I'm so starving for attention in my relationship that my emotional mind is telling me all the things I should be trying to get it. I have a box full of my medications that would get some attention if I gave in to my urges. 

I've been struggling with an undiagnosed chronic illness for 12 months. I had to give up my much loved job because of it, the thing that gave me my own identity.

I feel like the person I was has died.

And all my partner of 8 years can do is remind me the reasons why she resents me right now. Of all the reasons I'm the issue in our relationship. Of how frustrated she is that I'm not working. I get a disability allowance, I have for 15 years so I am contributing financially to this family. But it's not enough.

Today I find out that I'm not ""sick enough"" for the specialist to want to see me until February. I'm fucking devastated. Told my partner. No reply. Nothing. No discussion. No sympathy. Nothing.

So I'm all sliced up again. Was clean for 2 weeks. Fighting so hard not to do those things I want to do to get attention. From someone. Anyone. 

Back to my GP on Tuesday. She's insisting on seeing me fortnightly right now, after my meltdown 2 weeks ago over much the same thing.

Why am I 15 emotionally again? I'm 34 for fuck sake.

140,need some insight,"TW some ED and SH and S**cide mentions

So basically rn I'm 16. About 3 years ago I started having problems with depression and anxiety due to many factors including a huge move overseas and some serious cyber bullying from people close to me. With lockdown happening not much later everything because worst especially with the isolation and all that. I also did start having social media and pretty quickly got into the ""quirky depression"" side of tiktok but soon removed the app because I realised how stupid it was. 

Then the depression got pretty bad and it got to the point where I would sleep at 5 am everyday after spending hours in my bed doing nothing bit literally just crying. Sorry if I'm skipping things or not explaining properly I'm not very good with explaining. Also later on the suicidal thoughts were very frequent and for a few months they were very hard to get out of my head. 

I also started developing ED symptoms. It started with just running outdoors during lockdown which was allowed. After a while I would run up to 2hours a day. Then I switched to cycling which progressed to 4 hours a day. And finally I started obsessing over calories and the worst it got was 500 cals a day plus hours of cycling. I had a lot of free time as It was the summer holiday during the first lock down. My parents didn't mind me going out and stuff too. Just what was allowed.

After around 2 months of this I travelled for a while to go on holiday and slowly let go of most of the extreme ed behaviours. The depression didn't get better tho. 

Then a few months later I started have problems with severe anxiety. I got anxiety tics, unexplainable panic attacks and even a couple of short attacks that were later labelled as anxiety induced mania attacks. That was likely triggered due to the return of school and exams and all that. Also during that time my dad got diagnosed with cancer. At first they thought it was terminal and he had a few months but the diagnosis changed and thankfully he got treated and became cancer free about 8 months later. That period was pretty hard tho especially due to the caution we had to take as my dad didn't have any immunity and he because quite aggressive due to the effects of chemo and other medication. He still had problems with it but I can't say it's his fault. 

During that time I also struggles with SH and have problems with skin picking and some intrusive thoughts which I think is related to anxiety. 

Anyway lately the depression hasn't been too bad but I still have problems with anxiety and now the worst thing is anger problems. I would be fine but out of no where have a rage episode about stupid things. In the last 2 weeks I had like 3 extreme episodes leading to big family fights and I got to levels of crazy anger. I literally couldn't calm down except for when I started punching myself really hard. That left me with a few bruises. Also I started going to the gym a few weeks ago to help release that anger but idk it didn't help stop those anger episodes. This is really starting to bother me because idk how to stop them and i later I realise how stupid the trigger was and honestly I don't want to be another thing my parents have to add to their list Of worries. 

Anyway sorry this ended up being kind of a vent. But I wanted to ask for tips on how to manage the anger. 
Also I went into a great depth because I wanted to ask if it's worth looking into me possibly having BPD. I've been researching for around 2 years now because I just relate with a lot of the symptoms. I'm not diagnosing myself obv I just want to find the right help. Ik I'm under 18 so it's not easy to diagnose it but is it worth asking to be checked for it ? Also my grandad has it.

141,"I love my GP (it got long, sorry)","So I've been having a bad BPD style relapse over the last month or so. But now that I'm more of a quiet borderline girl it's a slow spiral into hell.

So I went and saw my GP last week (yay me, waited until crisis point) and she stuck my back on Seroquel for a month just to stop my head racing all the damn time. Seriously, my anxiety was so out of control that my brain was almost turning itself off. I was convinced I was losing my mind because I just became so fucking dumb. Losing words, getting lost, forgetting things the second I heard them.

I voiced the fact that after being off Seroquel for 3 years it felt like I was failing by going back on them. She made me stop and listen. She said that it's no different to someone with asthma who's had it under control for years. Sometimes there will be some trigger that nobody can predict or see coming, so they add in extra help (medication) until it's passed and then go back to their usual routine.

She heard me, validated me and reassured me.

I went back yesterday for a follow up (I'm 100 times better than I was, love Seroquel) and we got to talking about the nature of BPD. I'm her most managed borderline patient so she can often get a different perspective from me. 

I told her my theory that we don't necessarily grow out of the BPD traits and behaviours, that I think we just learn to turn them inwards instead. I know I'd rather take it out on myself than others like I used to. I told her that even with all the therapy my thinking patterns are the same, I just have that filter between thoughts and actions that usually works really well.

I also told her how I've learnt the biggest reason behind BPD behaviours is control. Lack of, needing. I've always been at my worst when my emotions (and therefore my life) were out of control. So I'd do ANYTHING to feel like I had some kind of control. So, manipulation, SH, disordered eating, risky behaviours, impulsive behaviours. All of it, for me, was about control. That obsessive need for control.

She took notes. She's going to talk to her colleagues about it and see if they've had other patients voice the same kind of thing. And I know she's not patronising me.

She heard me. She validated my point of view. She thanked me for adding my insight and changing how she looks at BPD recovery.

Yes she's only a GP, but she specialises in mental health and is always learning about things like BPD because they're so misunderstood.

142,Perceived vs real betrayal/abandonment - advice for me and my SO please 🙏 (tweet for reference),"TLDR; with reference to this Tweet that I showed my bf, he asked when I am triggered and experience this, how can he deal it in the best way possible to avoid as much conflict possible? I honestly don't know the answer to this so would appreciate some advice please.

More context: I (29F) showed my boyfriend (33M) of 4 years this Tweet as it applies to me and I try to educate him about my trauma and how it affects me and how my brain operates so he can understand me better. We are trying to work through and improve our relationship which is heavily affected by my BPD and mental health issues. Sometimes he will do or say things that trigger me to feel/think he is betraying or abandoning me and my brain fully convinces me that this is the case (and I never know if it is real or imagined), I guess subconsciously to protect myself from getting hurt which inevitably does the opposite and leads us to break into massive blowout fights, which ruin all of our progress up to that point, even when things have been going super well for a while and then before I know it we're suddenly on the brink of splitting up and he starts questioning if there is any hope for our future at all. All because of my fucking triggers, disassociations, neurosis when my mind perceives the threat of betrayal or abandonment.

He always claims he is not doing what I think he is and I have no way of knowing if he is telling the truth or lying. For me trust doesn't even matter at this point because after experiencing so many REAL betrayals and abandonments from people close to me who I never would have ever expected to do so, my brain is so hypervigilant and on alert to suspect anyone could do that to me, it doesn't matter who they are anymore. Nobody is safe, no one can be trusted. Whenever I let my guard down and allow myself to trust and be vulnerable, people take advantage of it and then stab me in the back. The pain that occurs inside of me is gut wrenching and makes me withdraw and feel suspicious of people even more.

I am nothing like the person I used to be. I used to be a social butterfly and musician, I could not go a week without seeing friends, going to gigs and performing and ocializing, but since I've been so ill and debilitated the past few years as well as other factors, I've become an empty shell of who I used to be, severely isolated and living a hermit lifestyle. I have not seen any friends in 4 months, back in active addiction, anxiety, depression, BPD at its worst. This is my rock bottom.

I have a plethora of personal and family crises going on constantly piling up (the list just never ends, my whole adult life has been in survival mode), causing me so much inner turmoil, pain, grief, distress, depression, anxiety. I have become disabled by my multiple incurable chronic illnesses, my social life has become non existent, I fucking dread waking upon every next day miserably existing and nightmares at night. It's unbearable to be awake and be not awake. There's no escape, no peace, no way out. My illnesses have stolen my life away and everything I ever enjoyed and loved doing. I have lost all purpose in life, my sense of identity, motivation and any hope of ever being happy. I'm constantly overwhelmed, started self harming for the first time in my life, relapsed on drugs a few months ago (landed me up in the ER one night in Dec) and I'm admitting myself into a mental health clinic for 3 weeks on Thursday before I finish my degree online (there is no way I can study like this so it has to be before). 

I am in therapy, medicated (although I need to adjust/change my meds), but we just had our end of year summer holidays and my psychologist was away for a month, my psychiatrist has become absolutely useless and unreliable and has ignored me since mid December and other times last year when I needed his help (actual abandonment). I've been seeing my psychiatrist since 2020 and he has let me down so badly and become impossible to get hold of, I genuinely don't think this man has any interest in helping me anymore and may have to find another one, starting new after 4 years will be so fucking exhausting.",1707169567.0,False,6,0,tabasco_kat,None,1ajskqw,https://i.redd.it/lyqzryvl7ugc1.jpeg

For the last year I’ve been doing much better than I was before hospital. I’ve landed my dream job and my career is going exactly how I’ve always wanted. I’ve moved forward tremendously with being able to sustain professional relationships which was a problem for me in the past. I also have had a close group of female friends for the first time in many years, for the last year or two. However that has imploded a few times, due to my interpersonal issues and those of another girl in the group also. Most recently (a few days ago) it imploded again due to my closest friend saying she’d been talking to a guy I had liked and asking if she could date him. I was intensely hurt and expressed that. I didn’t completely explode the way I have in the past but I most definitely expressed I felt very hurt and it resulted in a massive rift and her wanting space. I feel caught between validating my feelings and wanting to keep people around (which means denying my feelings, often). 
I keep seeing people post on fb “happy birthday to my best friend of 20 years” or similar and it makes me incredibly sad. I’ve had many close friendships but they’ve all crashed and burned.

144,I don't know what to do...,"After hearing about this place from a friend of my boyfriend I decided to give it a go. I was diagnosed with Bpd two years ago, I had been battling major depressive disorder since I was 12, when I started self harming. About 5 months ago when I met my boyfriend I was going through a difficult time with my mental illness, thinking of suicide every day, fighting the urge to cut with every tear that fell. I was in a dark place. When he entered my life, I started to want a future, I wanted to enjoy life again... and I did! Up until about a month ago. I was offered a job somewhere I always wanted to work, but the catch was I needed transportation. So after a stressful 2 weeks of trying to acquire a certain car, I was finally able to accept the job offer. Meanwhile I quit my job, lost a few ""friends"" in the making, and started cutting again to relieve the plethora of emotions I was feeling. Lately I've been thinking about suicide again.. and today I even contemplated it. My boyfriend is my best friend, my only real friend, the only person I can talk to. But I can't talk to him about this. I don't want him to worry and/or leave me. Please help.. I don't know if I need to talk to someone about this or if I need to find some different coping mechanisms.

145,First few days...,"It  has been an exhausting 5 years. I escaped my abusers, got married to my soulmate (yikes), started therapy for PTSD, got diagnosed with ADHD, and tried medication this year. There’s one huge problem: I’m on dialysis and Adderall XR is __undializable__ meaning it’s has no way to exit my body. I went full psychotic you guys. So I stopped taking the Adderall and it finally has broken down to its components and filtered out. 

But then I was still getting angry. Just like I used to. I still couldn’t sleep, just like I used to. My inner critic used me as a whipping girl, just like she did when I was mentally hallucinating that she was gonna eat my face off. 

I got a Generalized Personality Disorder diagnosis from a resident marriage therapist about a year ago. 

It’s been a long ass fucking year. I’ve touched on DBT, and fought tooth and nail with my behaviors to “prove” I didn’t have BPD. But I was bent until I was broken and I had to pick up the pieces. And the BPD was still there. 

Y’all, I’ve never got a 9/9 on anything. I finally watched a few videos. My flip-switch, ends-quick rage, my self hate, my suicidal but not really tendencies, it was all in there. Even the parts where I was more prone to stressed-based psychosis. (Previously I had been diagnosed as “depression with psychosis”) 

So over the weekend I’ve been trying to hard. I’ve been messaging my therapist instead of my husband. When I do tell my husband stuff it’s consise and not 15 pages. I isolated myself today while I was mad, and “rode the wave” and was able to figure out almost everything behind that particular shitfit. I also didn’t escalate my anger at something my husband was doing, into anger at him, and I avoided a good bit of verbal abuse. 

But all of this is so tiring. And I’m barely scratching the surface. The conversations my husband and I are having are deep and scary and I haven’t been this honest with anybody about this stuff. I have new fears, and new ways to practice old fears. 

I just wanna be better. I wanna stop abusing my husband. I wanna not feel like shit all the time. I wanna stop fighting because I have a hairline trigger and he accidentally makes it worse somehow. 

The road has been long, and the road will be long ahead. But I am recognizing how sneaky (In a good way) my therapists have been and how I actually have a few DBT skills already, I just have to learn how to apply them. Radical acceptance a few months ago helped us stop fighting about the dishes. Riding the Wave has helped me isolate and quickly manage breakdowns before they affect my husband. 

He just is so afraid of me now. He’s so jumpy. And I am heartbroken. I can’t believe I’ve done this to the man I love. Except this time instead of my inner critic taking hold, I’m using it to be better every time in cognizant enough to S T O P. 

On the one hand, this is such a tall mountain. An Everest perhaps. But I have told him that he is my Foreverest Love, because I would climb Everest for him. Well now I’m being called to task, and I just gotta pick up my ropes and start climbing, no matter how hard it is.

I’m posting this cause I’m anxious I can’t do it. I’m so early in my journey I still have most of my disordered thoughts and behaviors. I’ve been looking for the evidence to calm my anxiety, but even so, my critic pesters me “you’ll never be good enough and he’ll leave” even though he knows I’m afraid of that and had literally guaranteed the opposite.

146,(BPD) Does anyone else REALLY intensely struggle internally with being alone having bpd?,"(There is 1 use of the F bomb in here and I do apologize I’m just trying to get the point across.) Hi guys i am a 24 year old woman who was Diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and a few others in 2018 I never use my disorders as a crutch or an excuse but I enlighten the people around me about the disorders to help them better understand ME. I use to be on many medications but about a year ago I stopped all mental health meds because I felt they weren’t working right for me but just the last two years I have found it EXTREMELY hard to almost be by myself without the in person company of my “favorite person”…text drives me crazy because it’s so slow and the texts are usually short and boring and they won’t ever call me because they are shy behind the phone. as toxic as this may sound I will open up in hopes of someone out there finding relatability in this or someone that may give me advice on how to help myself. I have been recommended DBT but just with my insane schedule already and not having a car or license, being a full time stay at home mom at my parents with a 3 month old baby, baby sitting my siblings everyday, and occasionally my niece and nephew, therapy, and helping take care of my grandma. I just haven’t found a way around to it yet. I’m not making any excuses by no means my mom is the one that takes me to all of my therapist and psychiatrist appointments and her schedule is insane with work, taking care of my grandma (her mom) being a mom to 6 kids (myself included) and many other things herself. I would LOVE the help of a DBT therapist but right now I can’t fit that into my already hectic schedule. But when my S/O can’t come see me or wants to stay at home it’s like my mind inadvertently takes it as a threat almost, like punishment. In my mind I know they know how much I love and crave to be with them but there’s a part of me that actually truly understands and respects that they need time to themselves also. The world can’t revolve around ME. but the other part of me when I find out they aren’t going to be with me that night or for a few days shatters me me. Its like this never ending game of tug of war that never ends. It’s like a heavy blow to the chest and gut that leaves me in tears and angry and frantic. Cussing at myself, hyperventilating My heart races and I think all sorts of scenarios. I will admit that I do have trust issues due to past experiences with this person so that at times can intensify that thinking also into who are they texting? What are they really doing? Are they on a phone call with someone else? Do they have someone secretly over and are they ignoring me? I’m not thinking or feeling this way INTENTIONALLY I want you guys to try to understand that as best as you can is all that I ask. I understand if some of you just can’t agree with this or see how I could think or feel this way. That’s okay I accept that and am willing to put myself out here in need of guidance. But it’s the way that I can’t help but end up JUST FEELING. I love this person with every ounce of my heart that I have with every breath that I take. I do NOT want to be like this or continue to be like this. Can anyone give me any pointers? Distractions only help for so long until it just immediately comes on again sometimes more intensified than before. I understand that with BPD it is characterized with abandonment issues. And it’s not even the whole trust issue thing that always makes me feel this way so much as it is the whole hearted pain of them not being beside me and me being alone. In my head it just doesn’t even feel like abandonment issues really it feels more like I just understand what I’m feeling and I want to fix it NOW. To some, including myself. MY way of thinking is and can be considered “selfish” not all people with BPD is like THIS. So please I do encourage you to try be understanding to others with this disorder it’s a fucking nightmare that we never asked for But I also ask please try to understand that it’s not to gain “control” or to “manipulate” this person with the way I feel and act. I am in absolute love with this person and I’ve been with them since 2016 I just can’t control all of my emotions and thought process and hurt when it’s “so much so quickly at one time” the emotions and feelings just flood in when I can’t be with them, and it’s a somber feeling that words could never describe. I’m sorry for the paragraph and for any possible typos. I just wanted to see if someone else experiences it in a way sort of like mine or has any pointers on what I can do this to help control myself during the time being until I can get DBT.

147,"Looking for any advice about support in the UK, please help","So sorry for this being so long but I've got a lot to ask and get off my chest. For about a year I've known of BPD and from the start I've felt the symptoms explained really well the problems I'd had through childhood and teen years. I've never been good at identifying my feelings (some types of thought feel hard to reach, like theres a push back and everything gets more jumbled when i try) so it felt really validating. But I can't help worrying that I've always just wanted to feel special and now I'm assuming I have symptoms of a real disorder as an excuse for being a pathetic lazy person. As a result, I've avoided seeing a GP until now because I didn't know what I'd do if they didn't then validate me. But i got a couple counseling sessions from uni last summer (they can't diagnose). They helped me to realise how hurtful my parents attitudes had been (growing up lots of ""you're selfish/ungreatful"" ""you're lazy"" ""you're manipulative/spoiled"", "" why can't you be more like X"" ""or else"" ""don't say you're afraid of me or I'll...!"" recently I get "" you're naïve "") and that I drag myself down with self hate and that with my mam being suicidal for most of my childhood I felt like my needs weren't being met and I always had to prove my love to her or she'd die. For about a day after the sessions I was floating on a warm pillow of self love that helped motivate me. But it dissolved away, my GF broke up with me and I couldn't stand being around my parents back home for the summer (they pressured me to get a summer job, I didn't feel like I could handle it but couldn't refuse or I'm just taking their money). So I very suddenly moved back down to uni and isolated myself. This year has been a shit show. Impulsive drug taking has gone up, I go through patches of day drinking and feeling nothing and boredom to feeling so sad and isolated (life feels like a realistic film) to having narcissistic waves of mania, mainly when on a substance. I regularly can't stand to look at my reflection when I'm alone (looks like someone else scary looking back) and I do stupid shit like taking drinks from strangers in clubs fully aware that I'm probably being spiked or going to random music venues in areas of the city that I don't know with my weedguy. I haven't been able to keep up with uni, putting all work off until it was late and I'd have to take a 10% hit to any grade I got on them. I don't care. With about a day left to finish my dissertation I had nothing started and broke down. My mam picked me up the next day, that was last Monday and I now can't graduate with honors (as if I give a shit). Since then I've been having mood swings out the wazoo, apprehensive about doing anything and getting these sessions where my hate and distrust for my parents (who are loving and hurtful but not malicious) gets overwhelming. But its more like, I get angry at the world and everything is bad and then I feed my relationships through this hate machine and the only things I can remember about my family are the negatives (delusions as a child that my parents were plotting to murder me/read my thoughts, strangers were plotting to murder me, etc). Then I snap out of it, like when you splash a bath it gets crazy but quickly settles down and goes flat. After these episodes I can't remember what it felt like, I just know it was bad. For the past year having suspected BPD, I often check in on this sub but dont post and almost self medicate with the advice here and online which often helps (trying to remind myself that the average me doesn't agree with the extreme views and given some time I'll go back to baseline). I don't have a sense of identity past my name, body and memories which is maybe all we have but I feel so hollow most of the time. The part that resonated the most with me though is splitting which I think I've observed happening over and over during my life (I never knew why I suddenly hated people or stopped and started loving partners) and even this year I've gone from idolising a uni colleague for her prowess to hating her for her judmentality just because she rightly pointed out that I have been underperforming as a group. However she did confront me in front of the whole group which was the trigger that made me no longer trust her, now she's an outsider, probably working against me and I can only remember the events previous to the trigger that support this, not all the impressive and likeable memories of her. Anyway, I finally decided enough was enough and got an appointment at my GP, thinking that I could get some kind of mental health referral to a professional who could diagnose me (or worst case say I'm faking it but at least give some closure).  I told her everything here and more, including the fact I was sexually experimenting as a child with other children (when I was~4-6 yr old) which up until recently I thought was all consensual until I remembered a very old fuzzy memory of dodgy stuff with some older relatives of the kids my age. I told her how my suicidal thoughts have gone from intrusive at Christmas, to a consideration of a way out, to being afraid of the platform edge, to now knowing how I'd do it. I thought it was going well and she tried to reasure me that my delusions of her invalidating me would be unfounded, until we got to the end and she asked if I'd tried church, I was taken aback and said no, that its not my thing. She said ""that's a shame, not many young people in this area are willing to give it a go but it can be a good place to talk and find God"". Then she asked what I hoped to get out of this. I said I didn't understand the mental health service but I hoped I could get a diagnosis as I didn't feel general talking therapy worked and I'd like to have a target/explanation of why I feel these things. I was told she can't diagnose as a non specialist and when I asked if I could then see a specialist she just said no. So I asked what was wrong, to which I got "" well something deep is obviously wrong and it looks  you've got some depression in there too"". She also said that 'we' avoid giving diagnosises because there can be stigma, but in my experience here in the UK there is more stigma towards the undiagnosed as rhey seem less valid. Then she gave me a number to a public over the phone therapy service (Talking Change) and a website with general mental health self help leaflets. She also said back to me that I was clearly coping, a low suicide risk and that my family relationships were obvious still functional. I didn't know what to say so I just quietly left and got so angry on my bike ride home I didn't even feel going uphill. I feel let down, I'm no further in regards to improving and I have no more resources than what I was already using falsely to self medicate. In fact, I've now exhausted my last hope. I don't know where to go next and I feel so alone despite once again having a support network that claims to love me, so I'm posting here to ask for advice in the UK, what the process is, what I should think. I dunno. Please just help.",1558708792.0,False,6,4,Throwawaysawayohhek,None,bshpx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/bshpx4/looking_for_any_advice_about_support_in_the_uk/
148,The same thing every morning. (TW: Suicidal thoughts),"What will happen when I die: 

A few people will be really sad, for several weeks or months. 
Several more will be genuinely sad as well, but will note it as another sad day. 
Many will openly post and share lovely things. Some will be sincere, many will be performative. 

I won't feel any positive benefits or love from this. I'll be dead. 

After a few months life will return to normal- on my birthday or when memories pop up on social media, many will comment with likes or hearts or memories- then go back to their day. 

I'll become a story and a footnote that will, in time, be forgotten. Eventually I won't have mattered. 

The love and attention I'll get as a dead man is something I crave now. But asking for these isn't ok. If I do this I'll be love bombed by a few who want to do/say something but feel awkward so a lot of it will be empty positivity.  More than a few would respond derisively- usually folks from my generation/home region. They will shame me. 

It's harder and harder to push back the darkness. And my friends who can bear me when I'm like this are growing fewer, and I feel their weariness.  There's no clear light at the end of the tunnel and everyone is burned out- as I'm reminded by burned out people when I try to ask for help. 

I spent years of happiness surrounded by loving people. I failed to fully appreciate it because I was always focused on the future, and I neglected the presence that could have brought me peace and joy... and I hurt those I loved most and did not see it. 

I'm alone, in physical and emotional pain, cut off from my career and income, and there seems to be no return to my old life- and no image of a positive future. Looking back, I see shame and guilt and regret. Looking forward, I see years of harder work than I've ever encountered and no clear positive goal. Looking at the present, I see nothing but pain and sadness and fear as I scramble to make it through each day with dwindling resources and energy. 

No help is coming. I can reach out for attention, but as soon as the call is disconnected I'm out of their life again and once again alone in the pain. 

I'm currently making plans and getting ready for more life changes as I seek an environment to get professional help, make friends, and begin the long journey back to me. But as I make these plans it's daunting, overwhelming- and I'm utterly alone. 

I'm doubting my neurodivergence. I don't fully believe in BPD. A big part of me is shouting shame in my head, that I have the will and the methods to love myself and become the cliches and platitudes. 

Why keep going?  I stared at a package of pain medication for a long time, calculating what painless yet fatal dosage would be. I've spent hours on the internet researching effective low pain suicide methods that would have the lowest impact on those few who still speak to me. 

What's stopping me? Conditioning. Maybe my amygdala. And fear of doing it 'wrong' and remaining alive but broken, and a bigger burden than ever. 

It doesn't seem worth it. There's no happy ending ahead.  So I cry, I scream, and I mark the hours and minutes and seconds that pass until the day is done... then begin it all again the next morning. Every day, little change except that the people who would support me get farther away, or lose energy to deal with the constant hunger of the black void inside me. 

Now as I write this I feel more shame. There are so many who hurt, in more legitimate ways than me. I see myself as a drama queen, a whining child, the Boy Who Cried 'Suicidal.'  

I want someone to read this and respond somehow. I know posting this in most social media platforms will not go well or be received well- it's too much for people to take on.  Even posting this in this one subreddit- strangely the only place on the internet I feel relatively safe- makes me feel guilt and shame. I have not balanced my cries of pain posts with helpfulness or support. Plus others in this subreddit could be triggered and I don't want people to hurt. I'll put a Trigger Warning on the title... which will cause readers to have a preconceived mindset as they read it. 

I don't know what to do. But I do know every day is harder, every morning is exhausting, and psychiatric help is over a month away and I'll have to go deeper in debt for mental health care. 

I'm afraid. I'm scared that one morning like today, facing the same situation with no end in sight, I'll finally take the steps to take my life... and I really fear that I'll fuck that up and make things worse for others. 

Its 8am. 14 hours more of this then I can sleep, and start the process again. I will likely use weed or alcohol or food to comfort myself or avoid the pain- but everything will be here tomorrow morning for me to face again. 

I've been alone for 4 months, but for my cat.  Living as a hermit, interacting online, no one in real everyday life that isn't a transactional relationship. 

It's been 7 months since I felt the physical touch of someone who cared. 

It's been over a year since my partner expressed finality and ended their love. 

We've all suffered for more than a year. And no one knows what anyone really has suffered inside. There are certainly wealthy people with families and people around who still suffer the pain I do and feel hopeless. There are certainly many more much worse off than me- unable to even type thoughts and post them. 

I can't even manage my own pain. And I'm so tired and tired of being tired. I'm so exhausted by emotional and physical pain, compounded by THINKING about the emotional and physical pain, further compounded by FEELINGS about THINKING about emotional and physical pain. 

I'm sorry if this triggered you or if you read all this way to see I actually don't have a point.   But if you did get this far, and you have people in your life, reach out and just talk. Maybe not everyone has to live like this.

149,Rant/BSsadstuff,"So
Sorry this is my first post and I’m sorry but holy crap I need to get this off my chest
And trigger warning: S/H and sewerslide mentioned

I’m not sure where to start. I (23F) have dated this guy we shall call Renegade (25M)
He and I met around 3 years ago. We were both single parents and freshly out of a horrible marriage and engagement. When we first dated things were awkward. His ex wife still lived with him and she hated my guts. Used her limited knowledge of my past against me (her go to ammo was the fact I had my daughter under surveillance for accused child neglect by DSS (side note that shit got thrown out the window and I got her back once the investigation was over and the accusations against me were deemed as false) and she would even go as low as the issues with my mental health despite the fact she had “self diagnosed” herself with the same disabilities that I have) 
Freaky right?
Anyway ex wife threatened to take Ren’s daughter away if I wasn’t immediately thrown out of the picture so I was stuck in a game of “how can I get rid of my new girlfriend without getting rid of her?” Until the game got too old to play for ren and he ditched me. 
After not hearing from ren in almost 2 years he reached out to me. Told me he finally moved out of his ex wife’s house and had split custody. For a few weeks I was hesitant on being involved with him again. I even mentioned the fact I can’t trust him because of the abandonment and the drama. But spoiler alert I eventually had no choice but to move in with him and restart our relationship. 
Weeks go by and things are decent. He helped me get back onto my feet financially however the issues still remained and even got worse with my mental health. I was constantly facing relapse after relapse with my self mutilation. He verbally expressed how disgusted and sad he was to see my scars and hated the fact that I was still addicted to the pain. Therapy and medications can only do so much sometimes. 
This was the start of the big downfall. 
Months go by and I’m finally trying to open up. If I could talk about my depression and suicidal thoughts maybe it would lessen to urge to cut?
Only downside is he hated hearing it. He would constantly bring up his dead grandfather and the trauma he had been given due to his death as a way to get me to stop talking. 
It seemed fair. 
And then when I got the memo to literally just shut up about my problems it created a psychological warfare. 
He would say or do something that would hurt me, I would shut down and not talk, and then he would go on a tangent about his problems with my problems. Even go as far as to set up timers for how long I would lay in bed crying and not saying a word to him and even use it against me. And when he realized that the verbal patronize on my issues wasn’t going much of anywhere because I can’t change overnight, he would go back to square one. 
The concept of “I don’t like how your body looks” 
And then cutting began all over again. And he would get angry. So angry as to yell at me, threaten to throw me into a psych ward and cut off all ties to me again. 
It didn’t stop. 
I couldn’t stop. 
I am a young broken hearted person that didn’t want others to fix me. I just want to stop being angry all the damn time. 
He wanted someone to fix; someone who had a happiness to control. 
Yes I did do and say things that were equally hurtful to him. He had insecurities too and I openly used some of them against him whenever I had the chance to walk away from his rant sessions of using my insecurities against me. Cat and mouse. Eye for an eye. A Mental western gun battle. 
And one day I had enough. Enough fights. Enough patronizing. Enough begging. Enough screaming and crying. Enough of asking him to show that he cares the way I want him to care. 
I was too angry to be civil so I went to war. 
I told him the way he talks to me when I’m already down is enough to make me want to die. I told him if he didn’t want to care (because he said it during a fight when it came to my emotions and why I was annoyed with him saying “I don’t care”) then I wasn’t going to ask him to try anymore. I was done for the last time. 
When I got home from work hours after that fight, my last moments with him were just a matter of time. 
I was drowning in guilt and sadness and anger. And I wanted to say I was sorry. 
I can’t remember much of that night. All I remember is him yelling at me for locking the bathroom door and saying I’m just a parasite. 
But sometime after the fight I had decided to take my life through OD. One second I’m sitting on the floor reading my text messages and the next I’m puking on a toilet and trying to allow my body to drift to sleep. The worst part of this was that both of our children were eating dinner. You read that right. I tried to take my life in front of our two 2 year olds. 
Some hours pass and I wake up on the couch. I can’t speak. Breathing is hard. I can’t move. All I feel is nausea and pain in my head. 
Ren wasn’t pleased with my condition and he knew. Eventually he put 2 and 2 together and realized that I was dying right in front of him like I promised I would do earlier that day. 
That was back in early august this year. 
Well I’m not going into the gory details of what happened afterwards other than I got help. Didn’t have a choice but I got it. 
I moved out of Rens house and into my manager’s house- let’s call her Aurora. 
Aurora and I have known and worked with each other for years and she always kept her door open for me. I’ve been with her for 4 months now. Our relationship truly is good and we only ever had 1 serious fight. We did agree on the decision to take things slow given the fact we are both scared and insecure and batshit crazy. 
Anyway onto the “where we are now” for this useless post:
My mental health is still in the trash where it always has been for the past 16 years. And that’s okay. 
My issue is that with time- grief never goes away. So everytime I think of ren or mentally see his face I want to cry and kind of punch it. I wish I could say I’ve moved on and that I’m no longer hurt or sad or angry but 
Well
Grief is difficult. A part of me still loves ren enough to have him tucked away in a tiny corner of my life, another part of me wants him to disappear off the face of the earth, and even a bigger part of me just wishes that attempt didn’t fail just so I wouldn’t have to be dealing with this. 
So as your TLDR: I dated a shallow guy with a kink of verbal humiliation and attempted to take my life in front of him after I saw how much of a bad person I am and months later, grief is weird and never goes away.",1700276763.0,False,1,0,Unanimousbeetle,None,17xwwu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17xwwu1/rantbssadstuff/
150,"REALIZED I HAVE BPD....SUPPLEMENTS? 5HTP, GABA?","ill try to make this brief,even though we all know  BPD Struggle is far from...

i think i have been dealing with BPD all my life but i never quite knew it..

in hindsight i can see where BPD played a role in a lot of situations throughout my life..

2 years ago on my birthday i had a huge panic attack i thought i was going to die, i was smoking weed,drinking and i took some pills..i still dont know wtf they were...then my heart started beating..my vision started getting blurry..i was seeing white...it was like i was dieing...i was taken to the ER...i left the ER and was experiencing depersonalization and derealization for the first time ever...my gf left the next day and i was left by myself with this horrible fuckin feeling...

i stayed in that house for months...i couldnt even leave the house..i would go buy food at 2 or 3 in the morning..i was smoking weed even though the weed instantly gave me panic attacks..i was just hoping that it would fix me somehow...i stayed in this horrible state for months..non stop panic attacks..no sleep...barely eating...shut off from the world..having to fake like i was okay when i spoke with my mother...i cant worry her..i couldn't tell her that i wanted to kill myself and that looking in the mirror i did not recognize myself..

 time goes by...cant work...cant function..im just in hell all day 24/7

its been a while and i dont really feel depersonalized anymore but my emotions are out of control...like on a severe level...

for the longest i was so focused on the DP/DR that i never took the time to look at the cause of the anxiety..i was so focused on treating anxiety and dp/dr but this last month my girlfriend broke up with me because i had an instance of ""splitting"" i guess they call it and for the very first time i actually noticed that my way of thinking is waaay screwed up.....i finally see alot of the BPD symptoms...i now know that i don't think like everyone else...im always thinking negative...typical bpd things like the black and white..the favorite person...the splitting..and the shame...guilt...all these things i had been feeling my whole life...but before it was manageable...i was able to function...i didnt ever think about suicide..but after that huge panic attack and dp/dr/depression/ it seems my BPD is just fuckin exploded full force and all those symptoms are flaring all day....im sensitive as hell..on edge

i cant function...the only thing keeping me calm is a benzo..klonapin...that takes the anxiety away but without it...i feel like ill fall back into the pitts of dp/dr...i have been taking it for a while..maybe 2 years?

My  ex gf broke up with me after i had an instance where i ""split"" because she didnt answer my phone call it was scary.......fear of abandonement kicked in and everything else aswell..but thanks to her breaking up with me...i came to the realization that im not just dealing with extreme anxiety...but that i have deeper problems like bpd...

my thoughts are suicidal and negative all the time but now i am aware of the thoughts and i am aware that i am thinking incorrectly..i know can see and observe...where as before i didnt...i just felt the emotions and  rolled with them unknowingly...

ive done my due diligence on several other disorders...bipolar..bipolar 2..schizophrenia..etc but BPD describes me down to a T..it finally makes sense..any thoughts?opinions??questions??

theres more to the story such as im not in the U.S which is where i was raised till the age of 19, i was deported for buying alcohol with a fake id.

i was sent  to a 3rd world country..people dont speak the language and i cant relate,ive been here for 8 years and all that stress was probably building till the mind just couldn't handle it anymore? causing me to dissociate..?

but why the severe BPD?

i am always on the brink of tears..i am agitated and sad...suicidal thoughts are most of my day..i remember my ex gf and i feel guilty because i put her through alot of bad moments in life...from her witnessing me having to go to the ER to a lot of emotional abuse,she is a sweetheart.. truly beautiful..she not once disrespected me ever..so when i think of those times...my anxiety instantly revs up..and i start thinking suicidal thoughts due to the guilt and negative self talk..racing thoughts etc... its like its happening all over again...i feel pathetic because i fucked up bad and put her through hell..

i know i shouldnt feel that way beacause i really dont think im too much at fault,the bpd was fucking my life up for the longest and i had no clue..now i challenge my thoughts,meditate,supplement,trying to do CBT...wish there was DBT here but there is not...im really down and out..i feel alone...im isolated...i think im what is considered a quiet borderline...why? because no one here speaks english..i have no family here in this country.. gf left me..no medical help...i cant even express my thoughts concerns or anything...if only someone here spoke some english..that would be helpful i feel...situation sucks...i've begun to kind of tip my family off to the fact that suicide is something i consider alot...its horrible i don't want to make them sad but this sucks...i cant go on this way...they are in the U.S. and i cant see them..they cant come here and i cant go back to the U.S. im kind of trying to ease the idea of me not being here but at the same time i feel horrible doing so..

I HAVE 2 SISTERS,AND MY MOTHER..I AM THE ONLY MALE..FATHER IS OUT THE PICTURE..

Help anyone?  
sometimes a kind word works wonders for me

SUPPLEMENTS TAKEN..OMEGA 3,POTASSIUM,VITAMIN B COMPLEX,VITAMIN D,MAGNESIUM,VITAMIN A,CENTRUM DAILY VITAMIN FOR MEN,MELATONIN EVERY OTHER MONTH...

THINKING OF TRYING 5HTP AND GABA....THEY JUST CAME IN THE MAIL.

i can elaborate more but im going to try and sleep now...just thought id post something quickly about supplements but it turned into this...  


i find comfort in youtube channels such as BIGNOKNOW,DR DANIEL FOX,NOAH ELKRIEF AND DIVING DEEP INFINITE WATERS,RALPH SMART..

(Trigger Warning),"Im new to the sub reddit, relatively new to reddit and definitely not a massive one for writing (especially about such personal topics). I just kinda needed to get this out i think and i do wonder if people feel the same, or is it just me. The road of self discovery i suppose (with the help of you lovely people).

Got wrongly diagnosed at 23 w/ Mixed Personality Disorder w/ Narcissistic Tendencies (wtf) , 'corrected' at 25 to BPD, sort of 'corrected' again at 27/28 BPD/Bipolar.

To the fucking point... Over the last few years, id say from 27 to 30, every year seemed to be like one big cyclical event, repeating itself but speeding up and getting harder and harder. Careless, worthless, suicidal, isolated, so much more self destruction. I've always had those thoughts since the age of 13, i think they started. But when you get used to them, they are always there. When you're happy, socialising, walking, trying to sleep, depressed, MANIC. My cycle feels like it speeds up every year, the thoughts can become like an entity that takes over. It plans, puts pieces in place, thinks for you about the ramifications, enabler, instigator. The only thing i can liken it to is when you are not of sound mind through some sort of intoxicant, but more like a disassociated state. It's like i have two me's. And i'm a believer of the ego driven self and the true inner self. But this is like a split of ego as it's still ego driven but when i get into a self destructive cycle it is raging till it ends badly.

So just this year:

* I overdosed on Heroin in a blacked out state after drinking two bottles of shitty wine in half hour (oh yeah my Dad was there for half of it, watched me prep my gear). I would really give a shit about that, entity didn't give a shit
* I made an attempt on my life.
* I ended up in hospital in Portugal with 7 stitches in my head because of some bullshit Hostel
* Recently nearly got hospitalised because i was semi conscious on a park bench 5 minutes away from my house after consuming a lot of different things and then decided i was gonna drink Buckfast for the first time cos i knew a garage sold it in my city. Downed a bottle in 5 minutes, remember buying the second bottle and then just snapshots. Till police and medical found me on the bench, persuaded them to do one basically (but got a lift home lol)

So this is one as well, and its weighing down on me, crushing me. I've been a recovering addict for quite a while and then very recently i started getting back into the tricks of the trade on the internet - then comes out the addict again. So this week addict mode is engaged, fully. Stayed up all night before a ACT group meeting id been waiting a year for, i was actually fine but fucked up thing is i find me to be more like me the day after i've had no sleep, even without any drugs. It's kinda like i lose my inhibitions when i'm over tired. Any way i should get to the fucking point - Addict mode engaged, also just hit Manic stage as well (not good combo). Yesterday i lterally spent 12-14 hours on my laptop looking for drugs, researching about drugs, trying to find out if Noootropics would help me. Was so frustrated because i just wanted something NOW! Late, late hours are bad for me. Around 3am finally decided to try a new marketplace, end up buying half g of Crystal Meth & half g of H, next day delivery. (I've only told one person that). I've never done crystal meth and i the heroin, well i haven't done that since a week after my overdose (for obvious reasons). When i woke up the next day i just had this feeling of dread, a blanket of 'what have i done!?'. And i'm not stupid,i know i don't have to do them, i could throw them away - but i know i wont. They will turn up tomorrow and i will be taken over by this fucking thing that just wants to destroy. It sounds like i have no will power and this is what i mean by the circle it seems with every year that passes my will power decreases and this entity gains it. So this thing that is still me he has my fucking will power, destructive will power. And when the other part of me is down to like 30% left its not a fair fight. I cant blame it on something else becaue it is me, its not separate it just feels that way. They are still my actions and i am accountable for them. I just worry because with every year it gets harder and harder.... And believe me i try to change, i try to engage with anything that is available (when i can). I know baby steps and all that and i was actually doing well for ages and then your head or life just changes the context and you are back there again. It's got to the point where i feel like i just want to let it take over. Im tired. Really fucking tired. Of all the bullshit in the world and the ignorance of people that can't see the bigger picture. I know to change the world you start one person at a time and that begins with your self.... But all of this i understand, but i can't seem keep consistency, or any sort of routine. I can't engage in any of my hobbies anymore, i haven't worked in 6/7 years, a lot of the time i cant leave the house, my phone is a massive trigger and because of that ive lost a lot of loved ones... I've said it a few times recently, i feel like a waste of air. Theres so much more but im just having a self pitiful rant at a screen atm lol...

I just needed to write it down, get it out. I haven't told bits of this stuff to anyone, and the rest is definitely not common knowledge. For some reason id rather it be here, rather than anyone else know  🤷🏻‍♂️

Summary: I'm trying but every year gets harder, cycles seem to speed up and last for longer, self destruction goes up stupid amounts, and i get magnetised into more fucked up situations... And it get pretty much unbearable. I don't know if to post this... I'm not really looking for responses. I know a lot of it would be you're a fucking idiot for giving in to the drugs, (that aren't even here yet). But i know i will. And i except people may not understand, i dont fucking understand... I know im an addict, but its not for the effect of the drug, its for self destruction... Thats the condition in me, buried so deep, like its weaved into me and impossible to separate

I kept being told bipolar is definitely my diagnosis. No one would let me off mood stabilizers even though they literally did nothing for me. I have been off my mood stabilizers since Thursday, yay! I have been fighting for this for so long and no one was willing to listen to me. I truly believe you have to fight for your own health.

159,I’m really sick and tired of taking 5 steps forward only to take 10 steps backwards.,"I know that when it comes to recovery to mental illness you will take 5 steps forward only to take 10 steps backwards. I know that healing isn’t linear... but I’m sick and tired of taking those 10 steps backwards. 

I allowed my emotions to overwhelm me yesterday, I ended up sh, breaking a towel rack and lied to my roommate about how the towel rack broke. I’m so incredibly upset with myself. I know the DBT skills and which one would have been good to use in that situation. But I didn’t. 

I’m disappointed in myself because I allowed the “old” me to come out. I’ve fought so hard to change my old patterns. I’ve fought so hard to have a life worth living. I will say that last night, I did admit to my roommate that I lied and told him the truth about the towel rack. I promised him that neither him or my son will never see that anger. He told me that he knows that I am able to keep my anger under control around both of them.

160,How to support my partner,"My partner recently came out as having BPD. They knew about the diagnosis but kept it a secret for the year we’ve been together.

My immediate boundary was they need to be on their meds and see a therapist on a regular basis. We even saw a therapist together, but they had a bad time because they session wasn’t supporting their abusive behaviour. I want to stay but we can’t stop fighting and I’m at the point where I need to leave because of the hurt and broken trust. I’m trying to save this relationship, but they threaten suicide or get angry and drive away at 4AM. 

This person is in an early stage of their recovery and I’m worried they are not well enough to really understand how hurtful they’ve been to me. I need some distance because they lied, but what is the best way to support someone with BPD? Is there anything I can do, or is it up to them if they want to or are ready to be healthy.

5,"Drugged and raped, told to get over it","I’m basically 23F, diagnosed with BPD for over 2 years now. Basically 3 years ago I was on holidays they last night I went out to a night club and then BOOM no memories. Was reported as a missing person in Spain, my mum was manic looking for me and then my first memory is being found a beach getting covered up and guided into a police car. 

I don’t remember the drive, I remember pulling up outside my resort...waiting at reception, then I remember my mum opening the door and I just come in and collapse on the bed and start crying like I’ve never cried before.

I then try snap myself out off it as my 10 & 11 year old sisters are in the room, I take myself to the bathroom to clean up and I go for a pee. That’s when I notice I’m in pain down there, I call my mum threw and just break down feeling like a shell off a person with no idea what happened, did I consent, was a passed out facedown and someone decided to take advantage. I dread coming across myself on a porn site one day.

I spoke to my closets friends day this happened as I was a mess and just trying to make sense off everything. All I had to do was make it to 6am and I would be on a plane out of the country. I put it too the back off my head, just told myself it’s just another stupid drunken situation I’ve got myself in. 

Now I didn’t think I was affected my this until recently, I have IBS and the past 3 years put me feeling sick and spewing every time I drink down to this, however this has now been ruled out and I was baffled. 

Then one day in the car I just realised omg I think it’s my trauma, I’m too scared to drink cause off what happened. I think off that day more than I’d like to admit to myself. 

I tried to speak with my partner about this, He told me I just need to get over..
he’s never good about talking about feelings, I wish he was but okay...my feelings are justified (I tell myself this and that I didn’t deserve to get raped pretty much most days over and over, cause I don’t really believe it) 
Okay I’ll try talk to my mum, she can be a selfish person at times but she said that was the worst day off her life and she pictured taking me home in a coffin when I was missing. First time i try she just tell me to get over it (I tell myself maybe she doesn’t get how much this effects me). So I try to talk to my BF and Mum and second and try to explain how much it’s effecting me in so many different aspects off my life I’m told to get over it again.

When I was trying to drinking, whether that be 3 cans or 3 sips I feel I’ll and spew. So I stop drinking at parties and decide if I feel up for it I’ll drink...I’ll still spew and have heart palpitations. So now I’ve decided I don’t drink alcohol, when me and BF have friends up for drinks I still get nervous butterflies but it’s okay. I struggle with the fact, that’s I should have been more careful in a strange country, I know no one and I’m at the club alone. So many bad decisions I hate myself (I partially blame undiagnosed, Unmedicated me)

Sorry for the rant, people won’t even read all this just need this off my chest. 
But if you do, first thank you and second answer me this

6,Just venting- rambling run on sentences- CW - mentions of ineffective behaviors and drugs,"I’m about to be one month without cigarettes after smoking for 10 years, I’m doing EMDR, and I recently stopped taking my seroquel because it was making me too tired. 

I’ve been extremely emotional and moody since coming off of seroquel and I’m super sensitive because of EMDR. 

Since quitting cigarettes I feel like I’m smoking waaaaaay more weed because it gives me something to do. Plus I JUST got my MMJ card so I’m like binging on it all. 

I’m relying way too much on my partner to fill my boredom. 

I’m avoiding packing and I’m moving in two weeks. It’s stressing me out because I’ve only moved from my bedroom at my parents to my dorms and then to this apartment. I have so much more stuff now and it’s overwhelming. 

 I can’t handle my money for shit and idk I won’t have any money to do anything fun for the next two months - my whole vacation (I’m working as close to 40 hours as I can but I’m a teacher so my summer job does not pay as much and I haven’t saved money because as mentioned before, I suck at money) - and it’s really bumming me out. And I’m just freaking out about being able to actually afford the place that I’m moving into. 

Plus the amount of therapy I do is really taking a toll on me. I’ve been in DBT groups on and off for the past few years as well as individual dbt therapy. Now I’m doing EMDR and it’s draining. Especially the day after. So like 3 a appointments a week. It’s the worst. It’s so much harder than I expected. I’ve only processed my first memory like two thirds of the way and i felt so emotional for the following 48 hours and it was supposed to be one of the “less intense” ones. 

I’m just not having a good time. I’m really emotional and really bored and codependent. None of it feels good. I’m having trouble sitting through the discomfort of my life right now. I’m 25 so I guess it makes sense. It’s just growing pains.

17,need advice for my bpd daughter,"My daughter (16) has bpd. Recently diagnosed. Has had an ""on and off"" boyfriend for 2 years. She talks suicide when they argue or break up. She cuts herself. She has never attempted suicide. Boyfriend caught her talking to other boys and being sexual with at least one. Obviously, he's upset. He broke up with her today. I only know this because boyfriend called and told me. He told me she sent him a suicide note this evening. He also said she threatened to ""shoot up the school"". (No guns in our home, so I don't know how she'd get access to one). She smokes Marijuana joints and carts (illegal in our state) so she gets them illegally. She has no job, and I give her limited money when she wants to go out with a friend...so not sure how she pays for her weed. Not sure if other drugs are involved.
She shoplifts. She's failing all her classes. Right now she's barricaded in her room. She says she's fine and to leave her alone. She started DBT 2 weeks ago...its once a week individual and once a week skills group for 9 months. She's on meds to help regulate her mood. I'm considering a residential DBT program because I'm so scared for her.

18,I'm terrified my partner is cheating,"I've been diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago. It helped me tremendously, It meant i wasn't crazy and the things I've always felt were legitimate and had an explanation. From there I started treatment with medication and therapy and DBT skills and my life got more balanced. 

So now I've been in a serious relationship for 3 years. We got married and had a baby and I'm currently pregnant. We both work from home and he is a very present father and husband, he is always with us. He is not secretive with his phone and gives me no reason to think he is cheating. 

However my BPD brain thinks something is happening. I downloaded an app yesterday for school (telegram) and saw he had an account and was last seen online last month. I freaked out and accused him of using it for cheating and he got extremely mad I and began to react saying he was making his bed and that this was the beginning of the end. I calmed down a bit and asked him to explain why he had downloaded it but he got defensive and said he doesn't need to justify himself. I began spiring, that hadn't happened to me in a while, this is the first relationship I have that I didn't cheat and we built a family so I feel super vulnerable. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this but maybe someone has some insight or tips on how to handle this, my first instinct was always to ""cheat back"" once I've felt threatened.",1696423146.0,False,2,7,SilverGirl-,None,16zm5er,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/16zm5er/im_terrified_my_partner_is_cheating/
19,I have a terrible relationship with my parents and it’s my fault.,"unfortunately i haven’t been officially diagnosed with bpd yet but it’s the diagnosis that makes the most sense for me  and i’m working toward getting it officially. 

i’m a female, 19 
my parents are pretty good people, they definitely love me, and there’s no way i’d be where i am today if not for their efforts. i’ve also put them through a lot of shit (repeated drug abuse, nearly failing out of school, getting in lots of terrible situations, genuinely screaming that i want to die, yk.. crazy people shit) and they’ve dealt with and loved me through it all. yet for some reason i don’t feel an attachment to these people like i should. sure we disagree on some things like most all parent child relationships but fundamentally i should be closer with them. but for some reason i cannot fucking stand the thought of even hugging them most of the time. i also have no idea how to talk to these people. it’s honestly easier to talk to strangers. i feel awful because i know how much they’ve done for me but for some reason there’s a buried resentment of some kind towards them. 

i have a terrible track record when it comes to relationships of any kind, in fact i couldn’t name any one person in my life at this moment that’s been around for more than a year. but the relationship with my parents is supposed to be one of the longest and most meaningful ones i have, and i desperately want to understand what’s wrong and how i can improve my relationship with them

21,he doesn't want anymore children..,"Me and someone I've liked for such a long time have been waiting on eachother until we could try and and make things work. Because he has been in the process of getting full custody of his 3 kids over the last 2 years because the mother is truly awful and she just leaves her kids anywere and does drugs. 

He also lives in a different state. The next state over. So things have taken time to come to the point we're we could finally meet face to face. Finally he is here. It's like a dream come true. And he has finally gotten full custody of all his kids. 


But the problem is now, since getting full custody and a house near were his kids grandparents live etc. Is that he does not want anymore kids .. he told me he did. But after taking on full care as a single dad, he just can't deal with it. His mental health is suffering because of it. Quite alot. He has no help or support system and his family his not very supportive. His very stern on never wanting anther one ever again. But I am 32 and I have no kids and I don't have the best fertility... I'm stern on having atleast one child of my own. 


I'm just really upset. It's not just that, but I'd have to move to were he is, which is a very very small town. Theres not much there at all. There are alot of people on drugs in that area, orthough it is by the sea and nice, it has nothing for me there. He doesn't want to move his kids away from their family or school. Which is fair. 


It hurts so bad. We have both been crying every single night since he has been here when we have brought this up in order to try and find a way around this but we can't. And we both end up in tears. I've never met anyone in my intire life that I have loved like this before... Even from the very beginning we would spend 6 hours on the phone every night. Even when he had nothing and was living in his car meant the world to me and idk what it is but the chemistry is to intense to deny for both of us. We make love and it's like nothing I've ever experienced in my life. We both end up crying during. But in a good way. And life always leads us back to eachother even when we have lost contact in the past. 


I hate this. I can't stop crying. I may never find someone like this again in my life. I've never met someone like this so I debut I will again.

I definitely have had a lot of psychosis especially since I dabbled in mushrooms. Then my psychosis never went away ever again.

31,What should I do to get a wake up call? What was yours?,"I am 30 and my life has gradually deteriorated over the past few years. Now I live in nigh-total isolation, my friends don't think about me and I don't have meaningful relationships. I am always bored and I don't feel any love towards myself or anyone else. I'm reaching the point where I feel it's not worth continuing my life anymore.

I've been trying therapies and therapists, but somehow they don't work. Perhaps I'm expecting too much, I don't know.

I never did drugs, but I read recounts about heroine users. It seems that once they have experienced the sensation of perfect happiness and they come back to everyday life, nothing makes them happy anymore. Well, this is basically how I feel. I have been resentful and undecided in my youth and I always wanted to be more energetic, more cool, more social, to live life to its fullest but I got depressed and resentful ahead of time and missed all my opportunities. I failed to develop the winners' attitude and lost my enthusiasm that I once had. My adolescent years feel like I have been sleeping. It still feels like that.

I have decided several times not to give up and change, but somehow nothing changes. My family perhaps offers me a too comfortable and safe option. I have never lived among my peers, people of the same age. Honestly, I don't really want to face with who I am now. It feels like I can still undo it, but I know I can not at this point. I've grown and I am too old now to make up for my missed late teens. I am unequipped to start my own life.

32,Social anxiety tips?,"Hi, I have struggled with BPD for most of my life. I have also had interlinked difficulties with intense social anxiety/general anxiety. At points it is extremely difficult to leave my house or talk to anyone at all, other than my partner who I live with. 

Recently my social anxiety has become really bad again, partly because of spending way less time outside (pandemic/lockdown etc), and partly cuz of other factors. 

I can't take the bus anymore without having sudden intense panic attacks. I also have to talk to people on the phone for my work, and have had difficulties with that. Yesterday I had to reschedule a call because I just couldn't overcome my anxiety enough to get on the phone. 

What are your tips for overcoming this anxiety? It makes me feel really awful about myself and it's making my everyday life very difficult.

I don't like therapy at all because of this social anxiety, I always feel so uncomfortable in front of a therapist. I'm already on medication (cymbalta), and I don't think I can take benzos (I'm a drug addict).

Edit: tried to take a long trip outside today, transferred buses, was in public for a while, etc. All went great! Then an aggressive, leery dude mumbled to me about my genitals and followed me swiftly for many blocks. I was terrified he was going to attack me because that was his vibe, and it's happened to me before where some random guy tried to murder me out of nowhere.

33,Does anyone see BPD/Bipolar as one massive cyclical entity? (Trigger Warning),"Im new to the sub reddit, relatively new to reddit and definitely not a massive one for writing (especially about such personal topics). I just kinda needed to get this out i think and i do wonder if people feel the same, or is it just me. The road of self discovery i suppose (with the help of you lovely people).

Bit of background; Male, just turned 30, have had 'problems since age of 11', addict, mum has Bipolar etc, I'm on valium, codeine & pregabalin each day. Got wrongly diagnosed at 23 w/ Mixed Personality Disorder w/ Narcissistic Tendencies (wtf) , 'corrected' at 25 to BPD, sort of 'corrected' again at 27/28 BPD/Bipolar.

To the fucking point... Over the last few years, id say from 27 to 30, every year seemed to be like one big cyclical event, repeating itself but speeding up and getting harder and harder. Careless, worthless, suicidal, isolated, so much more self destruction. I've always had those thoughts since the age of 13, i think they started. But when you get used to them, they are always there. When you're happy, socialising, walking, trying to sleep, depressed, MANIC. My cycle feels like it speeds up every year, the thoughts can become like an entity that takes over. It plans, puts pieces in place, thinks for you about the ramifications, enabler, instigator. The only thing i can liken it to is when you are not of sound mind through some sort of intoxicant, but more like a disassociated state. It's like i have two me's. And i'm a believer of the ego driven self and the true inner self. But this is like a split of ego as it's still ego driven but when i get into a self destructive cycle it is raging till it ends badly.

So just this year:

* I overdosed on Heroin in a blacked out state after drinking two bottles of shitty wine in half hour (oh yeah my Dad was there for half of it, watched me prep my gear). I would really give a shit about that, entity didn't give a shit
* I made an attempt on my life.
* I ended up in hospital in Portugal with 7 stitches in my head because of some bullshit Hostel
* Recently nearly got hospitalised because i was semi conscious on a park bench 5 minutes away from my house after consuming a lot of different things and then decided i was gonna drink Buckfast for the first time cos i knew a garage sold it in my city. Downed a bottle in 5 minutes, remember buying the second bottle and then just snapshots. Till police and medical found me on the bench, persuaded them to do one basically (but got a lift home lol)

So this is one as well, and its weighing down on me, crushing me. I've been a recovering addict for quite a while and then very recently i started getting back into the tricks of the trade on the internet - then comes out the addict again. So this week addict mode is engaged, fully. Stayed up all night before a ACT group meeting id been waiting a year for, i was actually fine but fucked up thing is i find me to be more like me the day after i've had no sleep, even without any drugs. It's kinda like i lose my inhibitions when i'm over tired. Any way i should get to the fucking point - Addict mode engaged, also just hit Manic stage as well (not good combo). Yesterday i lterally spent 12-14 hours on my laptop looking for drugs, researching about drugs, trying to find out if Noootropics would help me. Was so frustrated because i just wanted something NOW! Late, late hours are bad for me. Around 3am finally decided to try a new marketplace, end up buying half g of Crystal Meth & half g of H, next day delivery. (I've only told one person that). I've never done crystal meth and i the heroin, well i haven't done that since a week after my overdose (for obvious reasons). When i woke up the next day i just had this feeling of dread, a blanket of 'what have i done!?'. And i'm not stupid,i know i don't have to do them, i could throw them away - but i know i wont. They will turn up tomorrow and i will be taken over by this fucking thing that just wants to destroy. It sounds like i have no will power and this is what i mean by the circle it seems with every year that passes my will power decreases and this entity gains it. So this thing that is still me he has my fucking will power, destructive will power. And when the other part of me is down to like 30% left its not a fair fight. I cant blame it on something else becaue it is me, its not separate it just feels that way. They are still my actions and i am accountable for them. I just worry because with every year it gets harder and harder.... And believe me i try to change, i try to engage with anything that is available (when i can). I know baby steps and all that and i was actually doing well for ages and then your head or life just changes the context and you are back there again. It's got to the point where i feel like i just want to let it take over. Im tired. Really fucking tired. Of all the bullshit in the world and the ignorance of people that can't see the bigger picture. I know to change the world you start one person at a time and that begins with your self.... But all of this i understand, but i can't seem keep consistency, or any sort of routine. I can't engage in any of my hobbies anymore, i haven't worked in 6/7 years, a lot of the time i cant leave the house, my phone is a massive trigger and because of that ive lost a lot of loved ones... I've said it a few times recently, i feel like a waste of air. Theres so much more but im just having a self pitiful rant at a screen atm lol...

I just needed to write it down, get it out. I haven't told bits of this stuff to anyone, and the rest is definitely not common knowledge. For some reason id rather it be here, rather than anyone else know  🤷🏻‍♂️

Summary: I'm trying but every year gets harder, cycles seem to speed up and last for longer, self destruction goes up stupid amounts, and i get magnetised into more fucked up situations... And it get pretty much unbearable. I don't know if to post this... I'm not really looking for responses. I know a lot of it would be you're a fucking idiot for giving in to the drugs, (that aren't even here yet). But i know i will. And i except people may not understand, i dont fucking understand... I know im an addict, but its not for the effect of the drug, its for self destruction... Thats the condition in me, buried so deep, like its weaved into me and impossible to separate

34,Passed the Bar Exam Today,"At the risk of seeming egotistical, I (29M) wanted to post this for anybody really going through it as proof that you can do that thing people say you can’t do because you’re borderline.

I’ve had a lifelong struggle with what I know now to be Borderline Personality Disorder. In highschool, I was bullied so aggressively I had multiple near death experiences and my family’s home was repeatedly vandalized. My dad was repeatedly battling advanced stage cancer and I had to take care of my brother through the end of highschool while struggling with what I know to be CPTSD now. I was (mistakenly) diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety when I was 18 and told I would need to live a low-stress, safe, low pressure lifestyle. I hated this. 

For years, through college I struggled with both being over-medicated while also being inadequately helped. I hungout with dangerous, aggressive people through college because that level of dysfunction felt normal. I graduated college with a double major, but struggled to function well in the workplace. Bad relationships with toxic people was all I knew.

I spent 5 years in a majorly abusive relationship with a toxic narcissist that resulted in multiple hospital trips for stitches and broken glass removal. When that ended, I was a law student and the stress of the breakup led to lots of psychiatric problems, the vast majority of my friends abandoning me, isolation, suicide attempts, and self harm. I had to drop out of law school twice. My CPTSD and providers’ mismanagement of meds was so extreme that I lost the ability to read for almost 18 months. But I graduated.

I wasn’t even able to take the bar exam when I wanted to- my law school made me join a disciplinary program designed for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems because of my mental health problems through law school due to the extreme stigma against mental illness in law. I had to delay taking the bar exam after graduating because my mental illness was regarded as “a danger to the public.” Joining that punitive program was the only way to convince my state licensure board I could be trusted.

Finally, I was diagnosed BPD and started to get better through DBT. DBT saved my life. I gained the skills to put myself back together. Today I have an amazing girlfriend, a nice small house, rescue pitbull, new friends (through my girlfriend) and a couple old friends that stood by me, and now a new career in law as an attorney in a mid size American city as of finding out I passed the bar just this morning. 

Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn’t a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it’s an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don’t deserve it.

35,Finally sober but now I'm worried about my emotions. Tips?,"(Pwbpd)
I've abused kratom for four years. I was a very high dose user majority of the time (50gpd/+). Im almost at two weeks now. 
Kratom, if you don't know, is an opiate. Im not saying I've been numb this whole time, as I've had outbursts. Kratom made my emotions worse, I think, in a lot of ways. Also made some of it easier, as I was able to block a lot out, too- especially in the later years. 
I'm starting to panic that I'll have issues with my emotions. I'm worried sick at the moment due to random bursts of anxiety that are both related to lack of the drug, but also due to actual stressful shit. 
What were the tools that y'all used to help with anxious thinking? What were your favorites to use whilst being in a predicament that brings you insurmountable stress? 
I've done a shitton of research, reading, learning, chit chatting with others and im so fucking worried right now that I cant recall a single thing. 
We haven't seen my stepdaughter in about two weeks and she's going to be here this week. It's always stressful to be with SO and SD for reasons that are too long to explain, too tiring, and it doesn't matter right now. 
I need to figure out what the hell to do with myself so I don't fuck anything up this week, or any week.

37,Is she a bad friend or is this just my BPD and I’m splitting?,"Is she a bad friend or is this just my BPD and I’m splitting?

Okay so I’ve had this friend off and on for like 11 years. We have had a lot of falling outs and the last one we had lasted for almost six years. My twin sister who has an array of mental health issues as well as mental deficits stemming from being exposed to drugs as an infant, and also a pretty bad heroin addiction, was letting this friend use her food stamp card in exchange for cash. I explained to her at the time that I really wished she wouldn’t ask her to use it because I knew that my sister was just going to end up using the money for drugs. My friend told me that I was overreacting and that my sister is a grown woman who can make her own decisions. I dropped it but it always bothered me deep down. Fast forward a few months and my sister tells me that my friend asked her if she could use her social security number to get a phone, in exchange for 50 dollars. And it turns out this friend and her boyfriend used my sisters social security number to buy and sell ten iPhones. Basically she scammed her, and my sister now owed thousands of dollars to different phone companies. Her credit is still suffering because of it. When I approached her about it she again told me that my sister is a grown adult who knew what she was doing. I explained to her she didn’t know what she was doing because of her mental health and active addiction. I told her that she was a bad person and that I didn’t want to be friends with someone like that. We didn’t speak for like I said almost six years.

About a year ago I messaged her on Facebook and she ended up apologizing and we became close friends again very fast. She comes to me with all of her personal problems and I always listen to her without judgment and I always try to make her feel like she has a safe space to vent to me. I have other support systems so I really don’t call her that often when I’m triggered and very upset, at least I thought I didn’t, but this past weekend I got into a really bad fight with my boyfriend and I called her very upset. I explained to her what was going on and she rolled her eyes and I could tell she was pretty annoyed. She said “you need to calm down”. I could feel myself get super angry and I blurted out “dont tell me To calm down it pisses me off! This isn’t like when you and your boyfriend get into it, there’s a child involved!” She hung up on me and the next day texted me: “you always have some slick shit to say about me not having a child, and you know I want one!” I tried to explain to her the emotions behind why I said that, aplogized for making her feel that way and reminded her that I have bpd. She said I’m using it as an excuse and that she rolled her eyes at me because I make my life out to be harder than it actually is. And that I only get upset when I don’t get my way and that I sit around all day not trying to do better. And that she’s never been a bad friend. I told her there were times when she has been a bad friend and listed some of them for her, ending with what she did to my sister and that was only the tip of the iceberg. She again told me that my sister was a grown woman and that she didn’t make her give her her social security number. Which makes me think she was never really sorry about it in the first place. 

I was thinking about apologizing today again because I really didn’t mean any harm in saying I have a child. But another part of me genuinely hates her.

I even offered to pay just so we can be together (i didnt want to go alone but would if i had to since this is such a bucket list goal)

39,Is weed a medicine for my emptiness or a crutch?,"When I realized I had BPD, it came as a relief to be able to give a name to the subtle wrong feeling I've always lived with: emptiness. Not quite depression, not quite anger. An absence of contentment and in it's place uncomfortable uncertainty. Waking up and my first thought of the day being ""did I do something wrong yesterday?"" 

I don't always feel this way. Sometimes, when things are going really well or I receive praise or have sex or good luck I feel all the good feelings. I enjoy these times but I no longer trust the feelings. They are a great natural high, probably the best high, and like all highs they don't last.

But I can bring the good feelings back anytime I want, with weed. Take me at my emptiest: give me some bad news on a day when I am already full of emptiness and I'll be a despondent mess, unable to smile, seeking isolation, crying and wanting to be asleep. I smoke some weed and voila, I'm back baby, all grins, improvised songs, making bids for the attention of my loved ones, giving back rubs, eventually falling into deep untroubled sleep in my bed, relaxed, comfortable as I've ever been.

""Why are you such a pothead"" I've been asked many times over the years and I've never known how to answer. Dunno, I like to get high I guess? ""Can you even go a day without your weed?"" ""Why do you have to be high all the time?"" These assholes questions throw shade, imply a weakness, a lack of self control, a tendency for escapism. I'm not weak, and I have decent self control. But yes, I do like to escape the goddamn emptiness because I want to live rather than cry.

The assholes have a point though. Weed has side effects that make it unsuitable for use all the time. If I use it during the day I become less productive and too inwardly focused, less interested in other people, happy but dumb. 

I have a busy life, a family and a job, volunteer work, home renos to do, appointments to get to, and I can't be dumb during the day when all my responsibilities need tending to. So years ago I settled on the routine of waiting until the evening to indulge. Although I may have felt emptiness during the busy day, I could always look forward to collapsing into comfort for an hour or two before a delicious sleep. 

It's not a perfect system because I still need to endure the emptiness throughout the day. And there are still side effects from the weed, like hazy memory, and difficulty waking up at 5:30am when I like to go to the gym.

And I also wonder if my regular weed use contributes to the emotional disregulation I feel as a person with BPD. Weed has been part of my life for so long, I can't clearly remember what I'm like without it.

So there are more than enough reasons to quit weed, at least for awhile. And I have tried to do this, many many times, and yet I keep coming back to it. 

The last time I took a break from weed was a few years back. The break was about three months long. I was proud of myself for being able to put it down and I even started to wonder why I used to do it every day. I felt a sense of freedom from having to go through the same rituals every day. 

The evenings were hard. I found myself craving some kind of special treat and ended up drinking alcohol more often. I found the best way to cope with evening emptiness was to throw myself into creative projects. As long as my hands were busy I was usually distracted from the emptiness until bedtime. I had to keep moving. I was more productive. I had a harder time sitting still.

Maybe one day some a pharmaceutical company will make a drug that contains the parts of weed that combat emptiness, without the side effects.

41,Episode/struggling/venting,"TL;DR - I was doing really damn good for a few years and now my life is crumbling and idk where to turn. 




I’ve been doing good for so long. I was helped by my counselor and psychiatrist to wean off my meds, discharged from counseling a few years ago, and really thought I had my mental health under control and in check for the first time in a long time. 

All it takes is a short lived series of events and I’m already fearing another hospitalization. The impulsive spending, the increasing urge to self harm, isolating myself, extreme mood swings for the first time though including fits of rage, and panic attacks are back and have taken on new symptoms there too. Feelings of emptiness, dissociating, and dysphoria. I’m grasping at anything that will make me feel like it’s worth it to be alive. My drinking is getting out of control again and I’m afraid it’ll spiral into drugs again too. 

My marriage is (more likely than not) ending, and I’ll be left alone again. I feel like a waste and burden to everyone around me, and it really feels like everyone would be better off if I was gone. I’m really struggling to use my coping/DBT skills but I don’t feel connected or able to share these feelings in my relationship, with people loosely associated as friends, and I’m afraid my counselor will want to admit me which right now, I can’t afford as that would result in homelessness too.",1609860305.0,False,13,3,redwolfshoes,None,kr0gzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/kr0gzu/episodestrugglingventing/
42,No where else to turn,"I’ve had to leave FB because of this situation. Mostly venting,  but also open to advice/resources. 

My husband and I are separated right now. We got married too soon, and I let my feelings get the best of me when he love bombed me. 

I’ve had to leave most social media, and he doesn’t know I have a Reddit account, so this feels safe. I know he has one but I don’t know his name here so I can’t find him and can really focus on...I guess me at this point. 

I’ve been doing really well up until recently, and I’m still using all my coping mechanisms but all the same BPD feelings are rushing back and I feel like it’s snowballing quickly. The splitting, rapid mood cycling, feelings of emptiness, fear, irrational thoughts and impulsivity. 

I’m just lost and don’t know what to do. 

We agreed to use our time apart to find a solution for our marriage, but he drew money from the atm (we share an account) and I can’t imagine what you need cash for that a card can’t purchase other than drugs. It seems like he’s using this time to party and get high rather than actually working on our marriage. 

I have a plan in place, and am physically safe, but man I’m just....lost.

44,Perceived vs real betrayal/abandonment - advice for me and my SO please 🙏 (tweet for reference),"TLDR; with reference to this Tweet that I showed my bf, he asked when I am triggered and experience this, how can he deal it in the best way possible to avoid as much conflict possible? I honestly don't know the answer to this so would appreciate some advice please.

More context: I (29F) showed my boyfriend (33M) of 4 years this Tweet as it applies to me and I try to educate him about my trauma and how it affects me and how my brain operates so he can understand me better. We are trying to work through and improve our relationship which is heavily affected by my BPD and mental health issues. Sometimes he will do or say things that trigger me to feel/think he is betraying or abandoning me and my brain fully convinces me that this is the case (and I never know if it is real or imagined), I guess subconsciously to protect myself from getting hurt which inevitably does the opposite and leads us to break into massive blowout fights, which ruin all of our progress up to that point, even when things have been going super well for a while and then before I know it we're suddenly on the brink of splitting up and he starts questioning if there is any hope for our future at all. All because of my fucking triggers, disassociations, neurosis when my mind perceives the threat of betrayal or abandonment.

He always claims he is not doing what I think he is and I have no way of knowing if he is telling the truth or lying. For me trust doesn't even matter at this point because after experiencing so many REAL betrayals and abandonments from people close to me who I never would have ever expected to do so, my brain is so hypervigilant and on alert to suspect anyone could do that to me, it doesn't matter who they are anymore. Nobody is safe, no one can be trusted. Whenever I let my guard down and allow myself to trust and be vulnerable, people take advantage of it and then stab me in the back. The pain that occurs inside of me is gut wrenching and makes me withdraw and feel suspicious of people even more.

I am nothing like the person I used to be. I used to be a social butterfly and musician, I could not go a week without seeing friends, going to gigs and performing and ocializing, but since I've been so ill and debilitated the past few years as well as other factors, I've become an empty shell of who I used to be, severely isolated and living a hermit lifestyle. I have not seen any friends in 4 months, back in active addiction, anxiety, depression, BPD at its worst. This is my rock bottom.

I have a plethora of personal and family crises going on constantly piling up (the list just never ends, my whole adult life has been in survival mode), causing me so much inner turmoil, pain, grief, distress, depression, anxiety. I have become disabled by my multiple incurable chronic illnesses, my social life has become non existent, I fucking dread waking upon every next day miserably existing and nightmares at night. It's unbearable to be awake and be not awake. There's no escape, no peace, no way out. My illnesses have stolen my life away and everything I ever enjoyed and loved doing. I have lost all purpose in life, my sense of identity, motivation and any hope of ever being happy. I'm constantly overwhelmed, started self harming for the first time in my life, relapsed on drugs a few months ago (landed me up in the ER one night in Dec) and I'm admitting myself into a mental health clinic for 3 weeks on Thursday before I finish my degree online (there is no way I can study like this so it has to be before). 

I am in therapy, medicated (although I need to adjust/change my meds), but we just had our end of year summer holidays and my psychologist was away for a month, my psychiatrist has become absolutely useless and unreliable and has ignored me since mid December and other times last year when I needed his help (actual abandonment). I've been seeing my psychiatrist since 2020 and he has let me down so badly and become impossible to get hold of, I genuinely don't think this man has any interest in helping me anymore and may have to find another one, starting new after 4 years will be so fucking exhausting.",1707169567.0,False,6,0,tabasco_kat,None,1ajskqw,https://i.redd.it/lyqzryvl7ugc1.jpeg
45,I’m so tired.,"Tired of everything. Tired of having to take breaths to keep myself living. I’m tired of living, forcing myself to get out of bed when I wake up at 12 or 1PM so that the depression doesn’t turn into a series of tangled and knotted thoughts of anxiety and self-hatred. 

I don’t know who I am, and that stresses me out. I’ve only 
Lever been what I thought other people wanted. I used to pride myself on being entertaining and a social chameleon at the very least, but I’m scared that it came from some sort of weird obsessive need for others to validate me. I’ve been on the borderline of a religious psychosis. I know this is a “BPD” sub, but I’ve got a slew of trauma and a mother with undiagnosed but apparent BPD. Everyone in my extended family hates her, yet the comparisons are always there, and for good reason. I’m a 19 y/o male, but I’m still scared of becoming just like her.

I’ve struggled with dependency on alcohol, thc, and pornography starting from 12 years old. I finally decided to quit everything because I’m just ready to really get better, but it’s such a hard weird and confusing process. I feel like I cant really be helped. My only hope is moving out from my grandparents place this august, but even then I haven’t been taking care of anything I’m supposed to. 

I can’t hold down a job, I’m admittedly immature and narcissistic a lot. I have really bad problems with lashing out at others. I lost my best friend last week because she told me she “liked me better on drugs”. It was a joke I’m sure, but on top of her continuing to pretty much ignore me, I got the message that she hated me now. I cussed her out, said almost every terrible thing I could to her (I can think of more now), and continued to cut off every other person from my small town because I realized as a gay man, I was completely neglecting who I really felt I was fall ‘22 semester of college, before I dropped out because I was never focused on my schoolwork and just completely neglected every responsibility of mine. That’s also when I “dated” someone for the first time, only for him to cut it off after two months because I made a little gift basket for him when he got sick, and only then for me to find out that he moved on right afterwards.

I’m so tired of my fucked up early life experiences having absolute control over my shitty fucked up life. My last suicide attempt was in March, because on the second date with a guy, I asked him what he graduated from high school that May. 

No one understands me. I hate everything, everyone and this whole world. I can’t look anywhere, even at myself without seeing nothing but shit. I know I need to challenge all of this or whatever, but I genuinely don’t know how to. My therapist of two years apparently doesn’t know how to help someone with BPD. I got my diagnosis in March, and we haven’t done much of anything since. She gave me a workbook, so that’s something, but I feel like there’s no hope. I don’t know where to start. I thought that by understanding my mind and condition fully, that I’d just be able to get over this but I can’t. And I don’t know if I ever will. It’s so easy to just find a permanent solution to what seems like a permanent problem, especially since I hurt everyone when I get the slightest whim of emotion.",1687551119.0,False,6,2,Houseof1000horses,None,14h8fwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14h8fwq/im_so_tired/
46,A lesson in splitting and honoring your needs,"Hey guys so I learned a big lesson this week on BPD and on speaking my own boundaries.

Long story short my parents died about 5 months ago and it sent me into the worst regression of my symptoms I have ever had.

I’ve spent the past five months clinging to my bf like a leech and having crisis after crisis over tiny things like him seeing friends or turning over in bed wrong (he’s rejecting me in his sleep?!? Spoiler: he wasn’t. He was sleeping)

Long story short - things have gotten better slowly over the past few months. I’ve gone from being constantly terrified to being mostly regulated. However - he had a few big trips coming up at the end of the summer that were giant triggers for me.

I spent the past month preparing for his trip with my therapist and it was going pretty smoothly! I wasn’t jealous, I was even able to relax and have fun on my own. Was having lots of bad thoughts come up but was dealing with them well without needing any outside help, and he was staying in more contact than usual knowing that this was a big challenge for me.

While on his trip he brought up that he wanted to do some psychedelics on the last night of his trip and I got triggered SO hard upon even hearing about it. (Parents were terrible addicts who abused me under the influence). 

What ended up happening is I kind of felt guilted to let him do it even though I was extremely uncomfortable with it. I felt really guilty from being so clingy the past few months and from having a major meltdown/splitting episode when he was at a party in early July. I felt like I HAD to agree otherwise I was terrible and controlling. He also mentioned he had abstained multiple times over the past several months because I was in such a state of arousal, he knew it wouldn’t go over well. This just added to my guilt and shame.

He ended up doing it and guess what happened? I had a meltdown and split the hardest I ever have.

And now that we are through it I realized that it just shouldn’t have happened. 

Because even though I cried and cried about it and talked to him and my therapist about it, I was still extremely uncomfortable the day of. But we pushed through and it went really fucking badly.

And the thing is: I’m not against drug use. I know that my normal self had handled it fine in the past, but right now I’m extra sensitive. But instead of honoring my needs, and just telling him: hey, I’m not ready for this right now, I can’t handle it well right now - I instead felt the episode coming on and cried and cried and felt terrified but let him do it anyway. What happened next makes sense: the emotions built up and exploded on him after a few hours.

And I think the lesson here is: I should have just said ‘no’. 

But instead of noticing my symptoms and how triggered I was - I let the shame of my past actions and the fear of abandonment control me (he won’t love me if I say no). 

But looking back - I deserve someone who will understand that I’m not ready. And at the end of they day, I’m the only person who can know my own boundaries. Tbh - if I had just said straight up: “I’m not ready for this right now, I’m not stopping you forever, I just need some time”, I think he would have been really understanding and accommodating.

If he had just waited, and I spent a few weeks talking to my therapist and him about it - he probably would have been able to go back to doing his usual usage without a giant problem. But instead he was impatient, and I was shaming myself for my feelings - and it led to something really bad.

I think we can let the shame of our BPD control us. Thinking: ‘I should be better than this. I should be able to control this.’

But what if instead we view it through the lens of self love and acceptance of our BPD? 

“This is really difficult for me, and knowing how I am and how I react to triggers, I’ll probably have an episode if this continues.”

I think maybe working together with your partner, realizing that you’re a work in progress, and giving yourself TIME to learn how to cope healthily before exposure is the way to go if you can swing it. It’s ok to need time to adjust and to take time to heal and prepare for big triggers. Don’t shame yourself and jump in, because you’ll both end up feeling worse than if you had just waited. Speaking your boundaries will protect your relationship!

If you’re building a house together, and you really want to put up a roof, you need to build the walls first, instead of just throwing up a roof without proper support. Because then you’re left with the mess and expense of a broken roof to deal with, instead of just doing it right the first time.",1691170421.0,False,8,1,Astrnougat,None,15i6e7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15i6e7x/a_lesson_in_splitting_and_honoring_your_needs/
47,I need help Understanding this.,"What i've found out about myself has scared tf out of me. I just found out why I act the way I act, and it almost made me slip into insanity.  So let me start by saying this: I now know there is and was nothing wrong with me, but this is still a massive fucking problem.

I used to abuse tf out of hallucinogens like dxm, lsd, ket etc. I thought I could change who I was fundamentally because I was foolish. I didn't like myself at the time, but I had no idea why. This all changed for me when I had the most traumatic acid and mushroom trip that would change everything I knew about myself. Long story short: I have a monster inside me. (I wont get into details, but I know who I am now.)

After this trip, I went straight into denial, pretending this hungry monster with an insatiable appetite wasn't inside of me. I did everything I could to run away from my demon, but with every effort I made to push him down, it only gave him time to grow stronger and smarter. I thought I had control, but I never really did. 

When he was pushed down by my own mental faculties, he started to use those against me to start questioning my own reality because, in a way, I was trying to run away from it. He was gaslighting me...

I started looking for meaning through the most mundane things, but little did I know this meaning I was looking at was pointing at my face laughing. Why was it laughing, I didn't know. My psychotic ass thought it was everyone else persecuting me, but it was me the entire time: in an effort to hide my true nature from myself.

This got really bad because, I thought people at work where trying mock me, belittle me, but they were all putting a genuine effort for me to feel like I fit in, but the monster found ways to sabotage their efforts, gaslighting my reality once more, telling me all my feelings had a deeper meaning behind them. They didn't 😑.

Now, I am coming to terms what my psychosis actually meant. It was just a projection of my own psyche against the world in an effort to tell me: ""take a hard fucking look in the mirror.

I'm still traumatized by all of this. I threw away all of my drugs and paraphanelia. I don't want to enable this monster. I just want to love him, help him see the good in himself because, his/my parents denied him the love and attention he craved, so he acts out in hoping that our parents will see the monster they've created, but they never did.

I am greatly appreciative of those who care for me…the unfortunate part and truth about my disability and mental illness impacts me on a daily in life…
I would never wish this on anyone in my life, my emotional Roller coaster makes the world seem more dangerous than not, I’m trying really hard to counteract this…I cry so often and feel pain so much I don’t even have words to describe or express how I'm feeling…I feel the pain in depth…and I try so hard not to feel the emotion of being happy as that doesn’t last long enough, I'm exhausted from emotions, I feel stuck with it, like it just never ends and doesn’t go away. Forever right there… 

I haven’t completely forgiven myself yet, for all of the damages and self inflicted trauma wounds that I suffered, it’s best to lay down and let the feelings and emotions pass by then to cope with maladaptive behaviours that did exist once before…its so easy for me to just cope with sex And drugs or trying to control and blame shift on to others, when it’s not anyone else’s responsibility or issue with how I’m doing emotionally…it’s mine I own this, happiness is supposed to come from within, I find it very difficult to be in control of my happiness when I have this stupid fucking mental illness, mixed with depression and autism as well as adhd. 

I want the best outcome for my life but this is the worst mental illness mixed with autism too and the self harming traits that are found on the spectrum…I’m impressed I’ve lived…I'm sorry for those I have hurt either by hurting myself trying to end my pain, and making everyone walk away or walk on eggshells around me. I am trying to be better and get better and be positive and more happier and healthier, and not hurt anybody or self mutilate. I am full of optimism and goals and day dreams too. I am just trying to survive like every other person, not making excuses for how badly I’ve acted in my past.  I feel like a disgusting human though blaming everyone else around me because in my reality I didn’t see myself as having any problems with anything, I know I struggled a bit in school…and in life chalked this up as a learning disability…it’s much more than that… 
I’m learning how to actually love myself how I am…i have mindfulness now to think about my next steps I ask myself this question every time I go to do something new, am I doing this out of self love or not so much, am I really taking care of myself and my actions, and my time, am I taking care of others around me, am I to aware of their needs above my own…are they even a good person, with the heathy way I want to live. 



There’s so much to process in a very small timeline with one decision…

I’ve make so many mistakes and errors, I keep growing through this, I keep going even though I’m in so much pain emotionally ever single day. I find it very difficult to stand up for myself as well, especially now since my life has completely collapsed around me…I’m mentally unstable and always will be, with delusional thinking patterns and maladaptive daydreams which honestly make my life more manageable…as well as the dissociative episodes too. I hate fighting with myself day after day it’s exhausting to say the least almost always feel like I’m in crisis. Underneath is a feeling of rage and anger, disappointment and dissatisfaction that would make anyone feel uncomfortable. 

I am and will aim to align myself with what my heart and values are… and what I can to to achieve a healthy lifestyle and learn how to live and trust myself too especially when I’m overwhelmed or doomed with stress. 
I have come along ways with how I view reality, and how my thinking patterns have changed it’s going to be a life long struggle…and others may misunderstood  me and I myself misunderstand me I’ll always be weird and different. 

The reality of my mental health 

Trying really hard not to have a special/ favourite person, I’m not emotionally prepared for another one, I’ve done the most devastating damage with the fp/sp in my opinion, it’s done me nothing but more harm and them too, yes the devastation of not knowing who I am or how to act or how to express myself or my opinions, being misunderstood and mistreated, and manipulated and suffering. I’m not ready to start up a new relationship life again, I’m not willing to open up for just anyone anymore, I’ve done more damage than good ,he’s gotta have knowledge on what my Life looks like for me and knowledge or an understanding of what I am dealing with, before he gets serious… In ways I cannot see myself in another relationship, I have to many narcissistic traits that I have learned from being used. Im not proud to admit or address any of this, I have major co dependency traits and people pleasing too, I’m in constant battle with this, and don’t know how to say no. Im just trying to cope and make it through life no one said it’d be easy. I am focusing on the negatives right now yes, I am labeling myself. I don’t wish to hurt my partner or anyone for that matter…not even myself when I was experiencing no suicidal self injuries. I don’t understand how to have a healthy relationship with someone and have boundaries that are not smashed to pieces, by my partner, not able to assert my own boundaries. Just learned to trust myself. 



 I feel obligated to justify myself to others because I’ve misunderstood myself and others have misunderstood myself for far too long and the same is going to be for the rest of my life.

49,"To the BPD who is addicted to shoplifting, read this","Hey, that used to be me too.

Once I realized I could get away stealing one or two things, I started pushing my limits. Once I stole one of those $70 Instax cameras. Another time I stole a $100 desk. I even started to calculate how much I would steal by collecting the price tags and creating a spreadsheet. I’m talking thousands of dollars. Every single store I went to, I would steal something. It was second nature at that point. I wasn’t even thinking about it. My thought was, “It’s no question that I can get away with this.”

For the most part, it was food. Quality food I normally wouldn’t buy because of the price tag, and things like non-generic vitamins and shampoo, soaps, etc. Essentials like those. But that wouldn’t stop me from going to the mall, taking a bunch of things into the dressing room of a store that doesn’t count items, cutting the security tags off of a few and shoving them into another bag, then putting the rest into the rack so one one could really tell. This went on for a couple years.

Shoplifting culture in America, especially among teens and young adults, has been so normalized. I would tell someone their top is cute and they’d go “Thanks! I lifted it :)” because this was something everyone was so comfortable doing that they could tell someone about and it wasn’t a big deal. This made it feel like, since this is so normal, there’s nothing wrong with it. I’m not breaking the law. I’m immune since everyone else does it too. I can’t tell you why I did this so much. I empathize with you. But I want to let you know that nothing, and I mean nothing, hits harder than when you’re caught.

I got caught stealing groceries from a Walmart in the middle of a BPD/manic episode. It was bad. I was glad I was only groceries, and only about $48, and not something stupid and frivolous like makeup from Ulta or clothes from the mall. But even though it was less than $50, they have a 100% prosecute policy.

I had finished my usual routine at the self checkout, then as I was pushing my cart and leaving, some plain clothes people approached me and told them to follow them to the back. As I followed them to the “Employees Only Area”, I felt my vision going white and my whole body was shaking. I knew I had been caught. They took my cart away to count the items and check the receipt (they had printed their own copy from the machine I just used) and another lady took me to the loss prevention room. Let me tell you, there was no worse feeling than them showing me footage of myself stealing. I thought I was so slick. I thought no one was watching. I thought the cameras couldn’t see me. I thought I could get away with it. Nope. I was forced to watch myself go to different aisles placing items out of sight, then at the self checkout. It was mortifying. I couldn’t stop crying. They asked to scan my ID, then told me they called the police and they’re on their way to file a report. Luckily I wasn’t brought down to the station, but I still had to sign everything. They also gave me a sheet of paper that said to “Write out the incident/what you did” and sign and date at the bottom of the page.

The nightmare didn’t end. After that, I was hospitalized because my combined BPD/manic episode was spiraling me out. But to make matters worse, I had to go into court. Public defender and everything. Hundreds of dollars of court fees too. And the disappointment on my parents’ faces. I was lucky I got my case deferred. But then I was put on probation for a year. I also had to do an online “STOPlifting” course, was banned from Walmart, had to get drug tested once a month, and had community service hours.

Even though I wasn’t convicted, I was still charged, and still am part of the court system. This meant that whenever I had applied to a job that does a background check on me (even things like Uber and Instacart) and they see I got a Class 1 Misdemeanor shoplifting charge, I don’t get hired. I’ve had places I really wanted to work at reject me because of this background check. This happened over two years ago and my probation has since ended, BUT this record still gets pulled up when I have a check run on me.

Nothing, and I mean nothing, was worth this. No amount of money saved, gratification won, or feeling of a “rush”, was worth having to relive the feeling of getting caught, watching footage of myself stealing, telling my parents I was arrested and had to go to court, be on probation for a year, and have a semi-permanent record (until I can figure out how to get it expunged).

I’m telling you this as one BPD person to another, it’s not too late to stop. I wish someone told me to stop sooner, and not just a righteous cop-loving person, but someone who actually understands me and knows what this feels like. Whenever I see anyone talking about shoplifting, I feel like I have to share what happened to me so that no one else has to go through this either.

I know the appeal shoplifting has as someone with BPD. There’s a rush, you get something good out of it, you feel invincible, you feel like you’re always going to get away with it. Until you don’t, and you end up reliving this nightmare every day for a year. This post is for those who know they have a problem but haven’t been able to stop yet, and if only one person decides this is the sign to stop, I will be happy for you.

50,The victim in me,"
I’m writing this because I often avoid the pending anxieties that ding at the top of my nose. That’s where I feel it. Thoughts clouding my vision. I can no longer see myself. My stomach saturates with guilt. Panic like protein for my insecurity. Bone on bone. I have been shedding layers. It’s been nearly two years of this. I’m writing this because my brain is in constant fight or flight. I’m left with a very weak will to live. I am in survival mode at all times. There is a victim inside of me. She screams for my help. For my attention. I often ignore her. Tonight I will not only listen to her, hear her, comfort her. But I will let her speak. The person I want to be and the person that I was and the person I am all sit inside of my body. They each have different dreams, personalities, fears, insecurities. I am none of them and all of them. I am nothing and everything. I don’t know who I am. I am lost. And I’ll admit that. The way other people see me, the way they feel about me, the way they treat me and the way they don’t is something I obsess over. I have an urgency to gain the acceptance and love of others. I have a frequency to prove I can gain it. So I can love myself. I set limits on my own self love contingent on the love I receive from others. This is because I have a deeply routed fear of being abandoned. Being forgotten. Being replaced. Watching energy shift. Watching people grow out of me. Fall out of love with me. Out of friendship with me. I would do anything to reverse this fear. To be self sufficient and self loving. I often attract careless people. I often attract intentionally harmful people. I often attract specifically harmful people. I am sensitive to others. I am hurt easily. I attach easily. I detach easily. It is painful. It is exhausting. It is harmful. I have spent the last two years running from hard truths. My life has changed forever. I am incapable of returning to the way I felt and the way I saw the world before these events. I tried to heal on my own. I made a mess. I trusted everyone I knew. It was a mistake. I shared my deepest painful secret with my closest friends. It was a mistake. I confused friendship for therapy and I thought my transparency with my trauma would grant me some kind of rain check on life. Life kept moving. I did not. I lost myself entirely. I could not look myself in the eyes. My relationships with people I loved very deeply changed. My relationship with simple things like food and sleep changed. I could feel myself going crazy. Misdiagnosed. Drugged. Lost. And losing it. I became dependent on things. People. Drugs. Alcohol. Spending money. I thought if I could just stay manic. I could stay sane. I could be happy. The more I would open up, the heavier I would feel. I started to feel lonely. I became complacent. I started praying that God himself would wipe my existence from this earth. I prayed that I could run very away and become a new person. I still pray for this. I had a very hard year. Mental illness is not a small thing. I am the captain of a very large ship and I do not know the first thing about the sea. I’ve never driven a boat. The water is aggressive. I have several diagnoses and several pending. I have not been transparent with many people about my experiences with mental health. I think it’s because I care so deeply to be accepted by others and it is defining me. Taking me from my truths. I have had to remove people from my life. I have had to fully detach myself to grasp at what peace would feel like in my head. I am consumed by the idea and the fear that the people I love the deepest will eventually leave me. That they hate me. That they have never loved me. So I fulfill this and prove my fear correct by detaching. By running. When I see that no one has chased me, it is now not peace I feel from knowing I was right all along. It is my fight or flight. It is overwhelming anxiety. It is insecurity that now my deepest darkest painful secrets are now public record. That whatever hate I feared before is amplified. I often attract people with a specific trait. People who know everyone’s business, tell everyone’s business to everyone, talk horribly about the people that love them. Make others believe they would never do this to them because they are somehow immune. Lack empathy. Create a chaotic and mutually symbiotic environment that is in no way beneficial to either party. Create abusive cycles in which they with hold their love and support. This invents a competitive Olympic codependent gymnastics where I reinforce their ego and lack of empathy by falling to my knees and discarding whatever healthy pride I have preserved in order to service them. I remember being moments away from killing myself but instead responding to a text about a hookup crisis. My pain was never valid. My family member passed away. I was devastated. The day of the funeral I was having an anxiety attack because I needed to be of service to someone. The clock had started. I was afraid if I didn’t reach out and prove my service, they would have no reason to comfort me while i grieved. I was afraid I would altogether lose them. I have been so afraid of losing people that I have gripped on to them. Gone out of my way to check on them. Take care of them. Listen to them. I became a service industry. Still unhealed. Exhausted. People I had made permanent places for in my life had been revealing their true colors to me. I found out one of my friends had developed a deep routed hate for me during this transitional and life altering period in my life. Saying terrible things about me to others and plotting their exit. This person ghosted me. Can I blame them? I am suffering from the residuals of deeply routed sexual traumas. The PTSD infiltrates my brain in many forms. I also suffer from borderline personality disorder. Body dysmorphia. Disordered eating. Major depression. Anxiety. Panic Disorder. ADHD. I fight myself daily to accomplish any goals. Sometimes I’m lucky if I brush my teeth. My exhaustion is defeating. I have dreams. Big dreams. Sometimes I think maybe I should kill myself before I have to live to see them never come true. I compare myself to everyone I see on the internet. I have low self esteem. I have a college degree. I cannot hold a job. I cannot find a job to hold. Everything feels like it was all for nothing. But still I have hope. Despite spending all of my energy on the worry of what others think of me. I have hope. I have friends. I have family. I am not hopeless. Not anymore. But I am lost. And I feel like a victim to my own life. I’m trying to take control of the way I feel and push myself into the wings I’m expecting to grow in. I am being to forceful. Too impatient. I am harming myself. Stunting my growth. Haulting my healing. People want explanations from me. I don’t have one to give. I am in pain. I am suffering from my own mind. I am trapped inside my body. I am trying to find my way out. I am trying to find my peace. Pray for me. Please someone pray for me. Tell me my feelings are valid. Tell me to stop blaming myself for the things I can’t change. Give me a shortcut to healing. Show me a cheat sheet. Hand me the blueprint. This came with no instructions. I’m exhausted. I’m trying to keep my momentum. I’m trying to push myself farther but not harder. The added stress will only make me shut down and turn off. I am in need of kind words and encouragement. I am in desperate need of love.",1604740418.0,False,8,2,sadbutveryhotbutsad,None,jpnslz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/jpnslz/the_victim_in_me/
51,My FP just ended our friendship,"I feel numb and then I feel everything. 

&#x200B;

For context, my FP and I met when we were both in very serious relationships. We had amazing chemistry and were both very aware of it. I wasn't getting sexual validation in mine and I think it was his attention that suddenly made me lock him in to Favorite Person status. I have spent two years chasing his approval and having my feelings drug through the mud in the process. We started messing around early in the friendship and at a particularly rocky part of his own romantic relationship, we slept together. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months, he is no longer in his relationship and is dating again. We've kept it pretty kosher, but his dating someone new who's been getting his attention was sending me into spiral after spiral. I kept brining up situations to my therapist, trying to have some outside perspective to tell if I was being abandoned or if I was making it up. In a lot of cases I was making it up - there was no real evidence - but in the past 2 weeks some significant things happened. Most notably, I found out that he had planned a trip with our mutual friends and I was the only one excluded. Weirdly, he followed up my concern by asking if he thought we could ever be platonic friends...which, I felt like we were currently doing just fine. He switched the subject back to the trip - his first excuse for not inviting me was ""it was last minute"" then ""I thought you'd be busy.""  My therapist helped confirmed to me that, yes, this was him being shitty and I had the right to tell him so. 

&#x200B;

Today, I met him for coffee and we both hashed it out. He truly didn't invite me because of the new girl he's dating and how shameful he feels when I'm around. He knows he cheated with me AND he knows how used I've felt about it (he's apologized about that a lot). And honestly? I get that. It makes SO MUCH sense. I told him he should've told me from the beginning. It would've saved me a lot of hard emotional times wondering what I did wrong that NO ONE invited me. He said he was scared to tell me, but that he just doesn't think he can be my good friend. He's worried he's going to grow resentful of me. His radical honesty put me more at peace than I have been in ages. It gave me a feeling of sanity - here I was thinking that I was having an intense BPD-fueled freakout, but there an actual withdrawal. I didn't make it up!

&#x200B;

We ended things fine - I barely teared up. I understood where he was coming from and my therapy combined with a renewed effort in my current relationship was making a huge difference. 

&#x200B;

I'm certain a HUGE emotional fallout is chillin' right around the corner for me, but right now I feel kinda...free? We're amiable, we still have mutual friends, but now I get to focus on my healthy relationships. I feel like I have a lot of headspace. I've been making this list to ""get to know myself"" and I've been brutally honest about shit I've lied to myself about when I built the personality for this FP, so I feel like this change happened at a lucky time, where I feel a little more at home in my skin than I have for the past 3 years. 

&#x200B;

It's going to be really hard not turning to him with every piece of news about my life - sending him songs - snapping him cute dogs - all that shit. But, I'm just going to try to hold myself the fuck together and start redirecting those things to other people who care about me.

52,There is hope.,"I have no formal diagnosis but I firmly believe that I once had BPD. I used fit the criteria to a T. I'm writing this in hope that I can help others, give others hope and maybe inspire some of you. 

First, background, as it's all relevant. 

I had an unstable childhood, lots of trauma and abuse. I was thrown out at 15 and had to pretty much fend for myself. From the ages of 15 to 27 I lived a hugely chaotic life, moving from place to place and unable to hold down a job, relationship or anything meaningful. 
I was abusive in all my previous relationships, never physical, but emotional. I would lash out at the most minor inconvenience, I was angry and aggressive and I create an environment whereby all those around me felt as though they were walking on eggshells. I had the most poisonous tongue known to man and I'd hit people exactly where I knew it would hurt. I was never satisfied. I always wanted and expected far too much from those around me and when I felt I hadn't gotten what I deserve, I would attack with words and empty threats. I would threaten partners with leaving them. I would tell partners they were meaningless to me, I'd tell them I didn't love them, nor did I want them around. I would cause arguments with people literally every day of my life. I would ruin outings and social events. I used suicide as a threat and as a means of control. I don't believe, during these years, I had the mental capacity, or genuine desire to better my behaviour. Luckily for me I have a fantastic group of friends who have stood by me, regardless of all my faults, and regardless of pain I have caused them. 

Fast forward to my 26th year and I decided I needed to change. For me, there was no big event that led to this, it was a decision I made based on how I felt my life and relationships would turn out if I continued as I was. I wanted to be a better person and rectify my wrongdoings as much as is possible. I began reading self-help books and researched BPD. I was later diagnosed with ADHD, severe depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Eventually, after months of trying medicines, I was put on Venlafaxine. This was both a blessing and a curse. My moods became stable, I had better emotional regulation and I had no desire to hurt those around me, no matter how upset I became. Alas, this came with conditions: My sex drive is constantly low and I have to actively work on this, although able to understand emotion, I feel very little emotion and my passion for life and my previous interests has dissipated. It's a sacrifice I choose to make because I want to be a good person.
Since taking meds I have invested countless hours reading and educating myself on neuropsychology, BPD, trauma, neuroplasticity, anything I felt may help me to better understand my behaviours, and various literature, both academic and otherwise, regarding changing responses and behaviours. 

It's been a long road and it isn't over. I still slip up every now and again but I am so much healthier and better able to handle emotional situations. I am emotionally available, discussing feelings and thoughts with those in my life. I take my meds as I am supposed to. I rarely react with anger. I ask others opinions before I respond, so as to guage whether or not my feelings/reactions are in line with the situation. I NEVER call anyone names in malice. I listen before I jump to conclusions and I try to think with logic and reason at all times. I am now an asset to the people around me. 

I attribute my progress to a few things; education and understanding my conditions, discussing, with everyone in my life, all the negative things I had done and taking ownership of the damage I caused... This was paramount; taking Venlafaxine, for me this is a wonder drug, although please bear in mind that what works for one of us may not work for you; and taking LSD in a therapeutic environment, engineered for self reflection. 

I wanted to change so very much that I actively make it happen. It was my decisions alone that have led me to recovery and I cannot stress enough that recovery is only accessible to those who see the damage they cause, see the hurt and chaos, and then act alone (without need for encouragement from others) to better themselves. 

I still need therapy and I will continue to work on my flaws. I may have to do this for the duration of my life. I still suffer with the invasive thoughts. The evil remarks and hurtful comments still enter my head, but now I can observe these thoughts and I choose to act with compassion and understanding over anger and frustration. There is a better way. 

TL;DR Was an ar*sehole, sought meds and education. Now much better for it. LSD for a mind reset and discussions with everyone in my life led me to take ownership of my behaviours. Not an ar*sehole anymore.",1583850127.0,False,10,13,kitamajita,None,fgek26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fgek26/there_is_hope/
53,How to find your sense of self with BPD,"As a daughter of someone who has severe BPD, and someone with moderate BPD, i have done a lot of reflection and implemented grand changes in my life that have brought me to this point of self-awareness. I have realized that if you are someone with a personality disorder or any mental illness in fact, it is best to cut out any stimulating substances, coffee included to find your real sense of self. I have been drinking since I was 15, (I am now 22) and I have been deliberately and perpetually drunk for almost every weekend of my life since I was 18. When I turned 19, I was drunk 3-4 days a week while still enrolled in full time university, holding two jobs. I would also regularly smoke cigarettes and weed  drink coffee since 15. I also began dabbling in hard drugs between 20-22 years old, cocaine being my preferred choice. I never realized how much alcohol was a part of my life and something that I depended on, even if I was still very highly functioning. I was so stubborn, I thought I wasn't impressionable at all. The thing is, nobody tells you in your youth you should stop drinking, especially those you surround yourself with. It has become so normalized to ingest toxins for ""fun"" that people don't even develop a proper personality or know who they truly are because they are consistently taking substances that drive them farther away from reality. These substances also rewire our brain and make us think and do things our sober self wouldn't say. But we don't know that because we aren't ever truly sober. Our brain is constantly being attacked by substances, media, LED lights, and information overload. We keep ingesting them and think it is a part of our personality, thinking there is something so severely wrong with us, when really we have accumulated years of stress (high cortisol levels) in our minds, bodies and veins.

One thing I realized is that I am a completely different person without alcohol, because without it I am truly an introvert. Many people know me to be confident, outgoing and a social butterfly, fearless and free of anyone's judgement. Although this is true, I genuinely don't care what anyone thinks, I did realize (after therapy, moving out, being physically active and cutting back on substances) that I am truly introverted rather than extroverted. I would always wonder why I am so drained after a party, a social interaction, or after many meetings or conversations with people I never cared about. Now that I go to parties with people my age, everyone is concerned with drinking and smoking and listening to most conversations as someone who is sober or is hyperaware of the social, philosophical and psychological state of themselves and the party, it is genuinely a very uninteresting and nerve wrecking and anxiety inducing experience. Alcohol really does bind people and create a mutual sense of ""we're all fucked together"", making is easier for people to tolerate each other. I realized how much I don't have in common with anyone my age. I realize how much I would rather be at home reading or going on a hike or just being in my own company, rather than being around people who I may never see again, or hope I never do. Alcohol makes us do things we wouldn't or are normally too scared to do. I have many so many friends and connections and experiences just from being DRUNK. Not because of my interests or desires or ambitions.I am not saying these experiences were useless or a waste of time, or haven't taught me anything. I had a lot of fun and have learned a great deal just from being in these situations. But they aren't permanent, they never last and they aren't as fulfilling as they are when you're drunk. 

When you're perpetually drunk, you do a lot of things you don't care about and you don't know why. I drove myself into such a deep depression that I don't have words or feelings to express how lost I was, or still am in this ocean of nothingness. However, things only get better once you increase your self-awareness. Some people have an inclination do that, others never get there. But this can also be a curse because I have also thunk myself into a very neurotic, delusional, dissociative and hallucinogenic state while being so self-aware of this condition. All you can do is get yourself to a point of being so self-aware that realizing that ingesting any toxin in an attempt to numb or kill something inside you means you truly don't love yourself. But beware, self-awareness can also drive us to such a paralyzing state of apathy that it becomes difficult to show anyone your true self.  Everything is a double-edged sword.

You don't even know what pain and suffering are Andy. There's no possible way you could ever feel what it's like. You haven't the slightest clue mr. Snotsdale preppy boy prick dicksucker niggerbitchfucker;;;; wah wah ur mommy died almost exactly 1 year ago and what? And what Andy and what??? Nothing that's what. You don't actually give a shit about it or that she died or what she probably struggled with and all that crap that goes along with being a mentally ill misunderstood drug addicted woman that is abandoned by men she fair to say devoted her life too. And her kids too. Like you Andy. And ur a fuckhead. You just ended up being a stuck up snob pompous self-centered prickfucker , hey haha, just like your dad? Yeah cool. Congrats. 

I may not have gotten to meet your mother but I sure as hell can confidently say that from all of what you told me about her that last year of her life, well damn, she was broken into oblivion , into dust, kinda like the dust you people actually literally turned her into by cremating her. Wow. Yeah I said that. 

But no, you don't really understand any of what it's like that whole pain and suffering thing and you just go ""wah wah mommy's dead I haven't faced those facts yet wah wah"" because you want people to feel <<bad>> for you and you want to pretend like you are so dark and depressed and wah wah wah. Cool but REAL people with REAL PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS THAT DISABLE THEM FROM ALL OF NORMAL LIFE can see right directly thru ALLLLLLL of your bullshit Andy. 

You ain't fooling the real ""sick ones"", not us, nope. But haha ain't nobody of yourr stuckup snotsdale kind is ever going to listen to what we ""the others"" ""the unimportant"" ""the dismissable"" the fucking <<underground ones>> have to say.  Cuz we the underground folk are ""crazies"" and a ""blemish to your superior high society"" ...  PSH. Fuck you and fuck your truce.

None of you know anything real or significant or pain or suffering or struggle from the soul, that in tune perception of ""I am alive yet I am dying each and every single day, each minute, each second and I watch those who think they're living it up..Merely lie to themselves because they too are dying each and every day as I am.."". 

You don't know anything Andy. You got brainwashed by your stuck-up prick society phonies and you are up all the garbage they flashed in front of you. You used to have a clever spark to you though, I saw it in those journal entries of yours from when you articulated onto paper your thoughts and true feelings about Arizona, Scottsdale, and all the friends and people you worked for..... Funny but very sad and disgraceful fact now is that you had forgotten all of your true self within a very short amount of time once returning to this disgusting desert land. *****You, Andy, forgot what it meant to be aliveee...... And with that amnesia you proceeded to shovel biblical dirtbag fakeness and arrogant ""laws"" onto the already-made-meek&shallow graves of ones like myself, ones like me who entered a forsaken land only with the sole purpose to keep the proximal connective power strong of one soul split between two bodies: you and I. God's will. 


Do whatever Andy. You're wrong though. Call me a psycho, call me crazy, call me or haha don't call me bc u neverrrr call me anymore. Whatever. I'm right. You're wrong. All of them on ""your side"" are wrong, they're blind deaf and dumb.

Good luck finding yourself when all you continue doing is living a lie and running from the truth. Yeah I'm sure you'll get super far and feel so accomplished once that whole journey of bullshit nothing ends for you, oh wait no it won't because you CANNOT attain a state of NIRVANA without first experiencing the stages of SUFFERING. 


WHAM! BAM BAM BAM!!!

I am so witty. I know I know.  Have fun -not knowing- Andy. Must be hella fun. Nah, LOL boring!!!! Ur fucking lame. Loser. Scumbag idiot.

55,I fear I'm doomed to never be the father I was meant to be.,"How can I actually believe I'll be an amazing dad someday like I want and visualise so desperately. I always wanted to be the fun adventurous goofy golden retriever like dad. My partner wants me to throw in a mix of my rancher man, assertive, calm grounded and sometimes stern side which I also totally see as my dynamic. I see this so clearly and I want it so bad with her I think I could strive to be a perfect dad without leaving my character or struggling at all. 

Before I met my partner and healed significantly my fear was my splitting and rage. I couldn't control it I would always fear I was a loaded gun and would not be able to regulate my emotions and accidentally release it on my kids. I'm not ready quite yet of course I need some more years of consistency. But at this point I'm fully confident I will be able to heal enough to never EVER repeat my cycle of abuse. But now I fear something different and in a way much much worse. 

My partner recently asked me something along the lines of what would be my reaction if I got news my mum died. She's constantly on the brink of death and spiralling so that wasn't too odd a question especially since I was dodging another call. To my discomfort and disappointment I realised I wouldn't shed a tear over it. I told her that after giving it some proper thought, and I can exactly imagine the scenario I can literally put myself there. Imagine the text coming in from my sister. Hearing she took it too far. Considering details like she's in Australia and the news would come delayed. And I know I wouldn't feel that level of devestation. Sadness for sure, heavy sadness. She's been alone for so long. Yearning for her lost children, dead brother, and drinking herself into oblivion. And that's a depressing thought I would feel a lot of guilt. But in a fucked way I was over all more sad about all the stories she was yet to tell me that I was curious about. Backstory on her, my father, them together, my childhood, my ancestors etc. Less about the actual loss of her as a mother or even a person in my life. 

Then Maddie asked about my dad. My dad recently has had a major shift of character and has come through for the first time in my life as a shadow of 20% of an actual father. Once again I thought I would feel particularly sad because of his character arc and the level of genuine love and care he's shown for me recently. And it would hurt a lot. Especially sting because of that but... Ultimately my biggest fear and thought would be losing what little financial security he offered. And the major opportunity in the future of taking over his company after getting my MBA and working under him for some years like we've set up. 

Maddie is never like this at all, but she rolled her eyes at me annoyed and said I sounded like an edgy teenager and I wasn't considering this clearly. She didn't believe me. But I'm not in the slightest worked up about them and I'm pretty damn good at picturing these things completely realistically. 

There's a reason though. I mean I'm not a complete monster. The problem is she wouldn't even feel like a mother dying to me. Someone who I love and care for sure. I would be deeply sad, but I wouldnt feel the anguish of losing a mother. I never even got a mother figure. My mum was an alcoholic who for the short period of time I lived with her I had to mother, provide and clean up after myself. My father isn't much better he left me to an actual psychopath of a step mum for my entire childhood while he was away on his business trips, well aware of a significant portion of what she was doing to me. And when he was home he was explosively abusive. (It wasn't torture but it fucked me up mentally with my own emotional regulation) They will never be able to be my parents in my head I could never internalise that even if I wanted to. They never became that figure in my life or even showed me what that could look like from the start.

I realised the absolute lack of desire or understanding of a parental figure a while ago when my sister was sobbing to me as a teenager telling me all she wanted was a mother figure. And I remember comforting her but thinking in my head that was downright stupid. Absolutely no empathy for that feeling myself, I had no desire or longing for a mother figure or father for that matter. My sister has much much better memory than me of early on in our lives. She was also in general treated much better so it makes sense that pain and longing was established for her.


The thing is I don't think my partner Maddie can extend me that empathy for my detachment because despite her parents horrible neglect and abuse of her, even surpassing mine (and mine is bat shit insane levels) especially her father jesus fucking christ. She still loves his ass. She still insists on seeing him, keeping an (admittedly very distant and ghosty) relationship with him. She still has forgiven and sees her mother truly as her mother, and a good one at that. The bar is in hell. I think her mother deserves to be forgiven for being a heroin abusing drug dealing addict because of her situation and trauma sure. But jesus christ her dad, he did absolutely unthinkable things to her. And he didn't even have the trauma to back it up. Even if according to her he stopped abusing meth and calmed the fuck down recently... 

Though hardly even really fucking true since she's worried about me repeatedly meeting him because he may get abusive or aggressive with her and of course I would defend her. And apparently her dad may try to start a fight with my ass if I set boundaries with him. (Just from the scenario of me warning him assertively and calmly that I'll take her back home and he won't see her for a while if he doesn't quit it and stabilise) He's 6'4 and over 30 but he's literally an emotionally stunted baby. Also if he hurt her I wouldn't be worried about fucking losing at all but the fact she has to worry about that says enough. This is turning into a completely off topic side vent my point is she is an incredibly forgiving person even for her bpd jealous bf of a dad. Her mum had a turn around so fair enough ig. And even though she had to parent her baby brother for her mother from a very young age, I think she was able to establish and connect with her at some point earlier on. It helps she has an incredibly good memory of her early childhood especially considering her trauma level. Maybe it's all rooted in that. I'd have to give it more thought why she is like this and what I lack. Other than her insane amount of emotional intelligence maturity and empathy of course. Maybe not so much with her attachment to her parents lol.

And she seems like despite all her shit she's made to be an amazing mother. She's so mature and calm and prepared and affectionate and intelligent and understanding ugh the list goes on. She's fucking set. I mean she's swamped on the kid side of tiktok and is far far down the path of studying psychology surrounding childhood development and parenting. She's very confident and has already set out very clearly how our kids will be properly supported and parented by us. I mean theres rules lol and I can't argue them she knows what she's talking about. We must undo our generational trauma and set them up for complete success. 

But I'm still nervous. So nervous. Especially after giving thought to and realising that revelation about my true feelings towards my parents and why. How can I be the dream dad I envision for myself when I never even had a glimpse of the real thing my entire life. There's no foundation not even subconscious. Never had any idea of what a parental figure even really was. She can help lead me a little and I have the passion and dedication to do this right but god I feel like in a deeper way to my core and maybe even developed character over time I'm just fucked in this regard. 

But I keep imagining myself in those golden retriever, goofy, adventurous, assertive rancher dad scenarios and I do truly think that's just me and I could nail it naturally (assuming I'm fully healthy which I wouldn't dare have children unless that was done for years first) 

Doesn't matter. Fucked inherently or not I'll try my absolute hardest and bring all the love, support and healthiness to my children that I was never given. 

I'm so awkward around kids too I get scared of them that doesn't help things. I gotta go practice with them a lot before.

56,"Looking for any advice about support in the UK, please help","So sorry for this being so long but I've got a lot to ask and get off my chest. For about a year I've known of BPD and from the start I've felt the symptoms explained really well the problems I'd had through childhood and teen years. I've never been good at identifying my feelings (some types of thought feel hard to reach, like theres a push back and everything gets more jumbled when i try) so it felt really validating. But I can't help worrying that I've always just wanted to feel special and now I'm assuming I have symptoms of a real disorder as an excuse for being a pathetic lazy person. As a result, I've avoided seeing a GP until now because I didn't know what I'd do if they didn't then validate me. But i got a couple counseling sessions from uni last summer (they can't diagnose). They helped me to realise how hurtful my parents attitudes had been (growing up lots of ""you're selfish/ungreatful"" ""you're lazy"" ""you're manipulative/spoiled"", "" why can't you be more like X"" ""or else"" ""don't say you're afraid of me or I'll...!"" recently I get "" you're naïve "") and that I drag myself down with self hate and that with my mam being suicidal for most of my childhood I felt like my needs weren't being met and I always had to prove my love to her or she'd die. For about a day after the sessions I was floating on a warm pillow of self love that helped motivate me. But it dissolved away, my GF broke up with me and I couldn't stand being around my parents back home for the summer (they pressured me to get a summer job, I didn't feel like I could handle it but couldn't refuse or I'm just taking their money). So I very suddenly moved back down to uni and isolated myself. This year has been a shit show. Impulsive drug taking has gone up, I go through patches of day drinking and feeling nothing and boredom to feeling so sad and isolated (life feels like a realistic film) to having narcissistic waves of mania, mainly when on a substance. I regularly can't stand to look at my reflection when I'm alone (looks like someone else scary looking back) and I do stupid shit like taking drinks from strangers in clubs fully aware that I'm probably being spiked or going to random music venues in areas of the city that I don't know with my weedguy. I haven't been able to keep up with uni, putting all work off until it was late and I'd have to take a 10% hit to any grade I got on them. I don't care. With about a day left to finish my dissertation I had nothing started and broke down. My mam picked me up the next day, that was last Monday and I now can't graduate with honors (as if I give a shit). Since then I've been having mood swings out the wazoo, apprehensive about doing anything and getting these sessions where my hate and distrust for my parents (who are loving and hurtful but not malicious) gets overwhelming. But its more like, I get angry at the world and everything is bad and then I feed my relationships through this hate machine and the only things I can remember about my family are the negatives (delusions as a child that my parents were plotting to murder me/read my thoughts, strangers were plotting to murder me, etc). Then I snap out of it, like when you splash a bath it gets crazy but quickly settles down and goes flat. After these episodes I can't remember what it felt like, I just know it was bad. For the past year having suspected BPD, I often check in on this sub but dont post and almost self medicate with the advice here and online which often helps (trying to remind myself that the average me doesn't agree with the extreme views and given some time I'll go back to baseline). I don't have a sense of identity past my name, body and memories which is maybe all we have but I feel so hollow most of the time. The part that resonated the most with me though is splitting which I think I've observed happening over and over during my life (I never knew why I suddenly hated people or stopped and started loving partners) and even this year I've gone from idolising a uni colleague for her prowess to hating her for her judmentality just because she rightly pointed out that I have been underperforming as a group. However she did confront me in front of the whole group which was the trigger that made me no longer trust her, now she's an outsider, probably working against me and I can only remember the events previous to the trigger that support this, not all the impressive and likeable memories of her. Anyway, I finally decided enough was enough and got an appointment at my GP, thinking that I could get some kind of mental health referral to a professional who could diagnose me (or worst case say I'm faking it but at least give some closure).  I told her everything here and more, including the fact I was sexually experimenting as a child with other children (when I was~4-6 yr old) which up until recently I thought was all consensual until I remembered a very old fuzzy memory of dodgy stuff with some older relatives of the kids my age. I told her how my suicidal thoughts have gone from intrusive at Christmas, to a consideration of a way out, to being afraid of the platform edge, to now knowing how I'd do it. I thought it was going well and she tried to reasure me that my delusions of her invalidating me would be unfounded, until we got to the end and she asked if I'd tried church, I was taken aback and said no, that its not my thing. She said ""that's a shame, not many young people in this area are willing to give it a go but it can be a good place to talk and find God"". Then she asked what I hoped to get out of this. I said I didn't understand the mental health service but I hoped I could get a diagnosis as I didn't feel general talking therapy worked and I'd like to have a target/explanation of why I feel these things. I was told she can't diagnose as a non specialist and when I asked if I could then see a specialist she just said no. So I asked what was wrong, to which I got "" well something deep is obviously wrong and it looks  you've got some depression in there too"". She also said that 'we' avoid giving diagnosises because there can be stigma, but in my experience here in the UK there is more stigma towards the undiagnosed as rhey seem less valid. Then she gave me a number to a public over the phone therapy service (Talking Change) and a website with general mental health self help leaflets. She also said back to me that I was clearly coping, a low suicide risk and that my family relationships were obvious still functional. I didn't know what to say so I just quietly left and got so angry on my bike ride home I didn't even feel going uphill. I feel let down, I'm no further in regards to improving and I have no more resources than what I was already using falsely to self medicate. In fact, I've now exhausted my last hope. I don't know where to go next and I feel so alone despite once again having a support network that claims to love me, so I'm posting here to ask for advice in the UK, what the process is, what I should think.

5,Just venting- rambling run on sentences- CW - mentions of ineffective behaviors and drugs,"I’m about to be one month without cigarettes after smoking for 10 years, I’m doing EMDR, and I recently stopped taking my seroquel because it was making me too tired. 

I’ve been extremely emotional and moody since coming off of seroquel and I’m super sensitive because of EMDR. 

Since quitting cigarettes I feel like I’m smoking waaaaaay more weed because it gives me something to do. Plus I JUST got my MMJ card so I’m like binging on it all. 

I’m relying way too much on my partner to fill my boredom. 

I’m avoiding packing and I’m moving in two weeks. It’s stressing me out because I’ve only moved from my bedroom at my parents to my dorms and then to this apartment. I have so much more stuff now and it’s overwhelming. 

 I can’t handle my money for shit and idk I won’t have any money to do anything fun for the next two months - my whole vacation (I’m working as close to 40 hours as I can but I’m a teacher so my summer job does not pay as much and I haven’t saved money because as mentioned before, I suck at money) - and it’s really bumming me out. And I’m just freaking out about being able to actually afford the place that I’m moving into. 

Plus the amount of therapy I do is really taking a toll on me. I’ve been in DBT groups on and off for the past few years as well as individual dbt therapy. Now I’m doing EMDR and it’s draining. Especially the day after. So like 3 a appointments a week. It’s the worst. It’s so much harder than I expected. I’ve only processed my first memory like two thirds of the way and i felt so emotional for the following 48 hours and it was supposed to be one of the “less intense” ones. 

I’m just not having a good time. I’m really emotional and really bored and codependent. None of it feels good. I’m having trouble sitting through the discomfort of my life right now. I’m 25 so I guess it makes sense. It’s just growing pains.

6,"Drugged and raped, told to get over it","I’m basically 23F, diagnosed with BPD for over 2 years now. Basically 3 years ago I was on holidays they last night I went out to a night club and then BOOM no memories. Was reported as a missing person in Spain, my mum was manic looking for me and then my first memory is being found a beach getting covered up and guided into a police car. 

I don’t remember the drive, I remember pulling up outside my resort...waiting at reception, then I remember my mum opening the door and I just come in and collapse on the bed and start crying like I’ve never cried before.

I then try snap myself out off it as my 10 & 11 year old sisters are in the room, I take myself to the bathroom to clean up and I go for a pee. That’s when I notice I’m in pain down there, I call my mum threw and just break down feeling like a shell off a person with no idea what happened, did I consent, was a passed out facedown and someone decided to take advantage. I dread coming across myself on a porn site one day.

I spoke to my closets friends day this happened as I was a mess and just trying to make sense off everything. All I had to do was make it to 6am and I would be on a plane out of the country. I put it too the back off my head, just told myself it’s just another stupid drunken situation I’ve got myself in. 

Now I didn’t think I was affected my this until recently, I have IBS and the past 3 years put me feeling sick and spewing every time I drink down to this, however this has now been ruled out and I was baffled. 

Then one day in the car I just realised omg I think it’s my trauma, I’m too scared to drink cause off what happened. I think off that day more than I’d like to admit to myself. 

I tried to speak with my partner about this, He told me I just need to get over..
he’s never good about talking about feelings, I wish he was but okay...my feelings are justified (I tell myself this and that I didn’t deserve to get raped pretty much most days over and over, cause I don’t really believe it) 
Okay I’ll try talk to my mum, she can be a selfish person at times but she said that was the worst day off her life and she pictured taking me home in a coffin when I was missing. First time i try she just tell me to get over it (I tell myself maybe she doesn’t get how much this effects me). So I try to talk to my BF and Mum and second and try to explain how much it’s effecting me in so many different aspects off my life I’m told to get over it again.

When I was trying to drinking, whether that be 3 cans or 3 sips I feel I’ll and spew. So I stop drinking at parties and decide if I feel up for it I’ll drink...I’ll still spew and have heart palpitations. So now I’ve decided I don’t drink alcohol, when me and BF have friends up for drinks I still get nervous butterflies but it’s okay. I struggle with the fact, that’s I should have been more careful in a strange country, I know no one and I’m at the club alone. So many bad decisions I hate myself (I partially blame undiagnosed, Unmedicated me)

Sorry for the rant, people won’t even read all this just need this off my chest.

Because he has been in the process of getting full custody of his 3 kids over the last 2 years because the mother is truly awful and she just leaves her kids anywere and does drugs. 

He also lives in a different state. The next state over. So things have taken time to come to the point we're we could finally meet face to face. Finally he is here. It's like a dream come true. And he has finally gotten full custody of all his kids. 


But the problem is now, since getting full custody and a house near were his kids grandparents live etc. Is that he does not want anymore kids .. he told me he did. But after taking on full care as a single dad, he just can't deal with it. His mental health is suffering because of it. Quite alot. He has no help or support system and his family his not very supportive. His very stern on never wanting anther one ever again. But I am 32 and I have no kids and I don't have the best fertility... I'm stern on having atleast one child of my own. 


I'm just really upset. It's not just that, but I'd have to move to were he is, which is a very very small town. Theres not much there at all. There are alot of people on drugs in that area, orthough it is by the sea and nice, it has nothing for me there. He doesn't want to move his kids away from their family or school. Which is fair. 


It hurts so bad. We have both been crying every single night since he has been here when we have brought this up in order to try and find a way around this but we can't. And we both end up in tears. I've never met anyone in my intire life that I have loved like this before... Even from the very beginning we would spend 6 hours on the phone every night. Even when he had nothing and was living in his car meant the world to me and idk what it is but the chemistry is to intense to deny for both of us. We make love and it's like nothing I've ever experienced in my life. We both end up crying during. But in a good way. And life always leads us back to eachother even when we have lost contact in the past. 


I hate this. I can't stop crying. I may never find someone like this again in my life. I've never met someone like this so I debut I will again.

20,I'm terrified my partner is cheating,"I've been diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago. It helped me tremendously, It meant i wasn't crazy and the things I've always felt were legitimate and had an explanation.

So now I've been in a serious relationship for 3 years. We got married and had a baby and I'm currently pregnant. We both work from home and he is a very present father and husband, he is always with us. He is not secretive with his phone and gives me no reason to think he is cheating. 

However my BPD brain thinks something is happening. I downloaded an app yesterday for school (telegram) and saw he had an account and was last seen online last month. I freaked out and accused him of using it for cheating and he got extremely mad I and began to react saying he was making his bed and that this was the beginning of the end. I calmed down a bit and asked him to explain why he had downloaded it but he got defensive and said he doesn't need to justify himself. I began spiring, that hadn't happened to me in a while, this is the first relationship I have that I didn't cheat and we built a family so I feel super vulnerable.

i have a terrible track record when it comes to relationships of any kind, in fact i couldn’t name any one person in my life at this moment that’s been around for more than a year. but the relationship with my parents is supposed to be one of the longest and most meaningful ones i have, and i desperately want to understand what’s wrong and how i can improve my relationship with them

Now I live in nigh-total isolation, my friends don't think about me and I don't have meaningful relationships. I am always bored and I don't feel any love towards myself or anyone else. I'm reaching the point where I feel it's not worth continuing my life anymore.

I've been trying therapies and therapists, but somehow they don't work. Perhaps I'm expecting too much, I don't know.

I never did drugs, but I read recounts about heroine users. It seems that once they have experienced the sensation of perfect happiness and they come back to everyday life, nothing makes them happy anymore. Well, this is basically how I feel. I have been resentful and undecided in my youth and I always wanted to be more energetic, more cool, more social, to live life to its fullest but I got depressed and resentful ahead of time and missed all my opportunities. I failed to develop the winners' attitude and lost my enthusiasm that I once had. My adolescent years feel like I have been sleeping. It still feels like that.

I have decided several times not to give up and change, but somehow nothing changes. My family perhaps offers me a too comfortable and safe option. I have never lived among my peers, people of the same age. Honestly, I don't really want to face with who I am now. It feels like I can still undo it, but I know I can not at this point.

28,Is she a bad friend or is this just my BPD and I’m splitting?,"Is she a bad friend or is this just my BPD and I’m splitting?

Okay so I’ve had this friend off and on for like 11 years. We have had a lot of falling outs and the last one we had lasted for almost six years. My twin sister who has an array of mental health issues as well as mental deficits stemming from being exposed to drugs as an infant, and also a pretty bad heroin addiction, was letting this friend use her food stamp card in exchange for cash. I explained to her at the time that I really wished she wouldn’t ask her to use it because I knew that my sister was just going to end up using the money for drugs. My friend told me that I was overreacting and that my sister is a grown woman who can make her own decisions. I dropped it but it always bothered me deep down. Fast forward a few months and my sister tells me that my friend asked her if she could use her social security number to get a phone, in exchange for 50 dollars. And it turns out this friend and her boyfriend used my sisters social security number to buy and sell ten iPhones. Basically she scammed her, and my sister now owed thousands of dollars to different phone companies. Her credit is still suffering because of it. When I approached her about it she again told me that my sister is a grown adult who knew what she was doing. I explained to her she didn’t know what she was doing because of her mental health and active addiction. I told her that she was a bad person and that I didn’t want to be friends with someone like that. We didn’t speak for like I said almost six years.

About a year ago I messaged her on Facebook and she ended up apologizing and we became close friends again very fast. She comes to me with all of her personal problems and I always listen to her without judgment and I always try to make her feel like she has a safe space to vent to me. I have other support systems so I really don’t call her that often when I’m triggered and very upset, at least I thought I didn’t, but this past weekend I got into a really bad fight with my boyfriend and I called her very upset. I explained to her what was going on and she rolled her eyes and I could tell she was pretty annoyed. She said “you need to calm down”. I could feel myself get super angry and I blurted out “dont tell me To calm down it pisses me off! This isn’t like when you and your boyfriend get into it, there’s a child involved!” She hung up on me and the next day texted me: “you always have some slick shit to say about me not having a child, and you know I want one!” I tried to explain to her the emotions behind why I said that, aplogized for making her feel that way and reminded her that I have bpd. She said I’m using it as an excuse and that she rolled her eyes at me because I make my life out to be harder than it actually is. And that I only get upset when I don’t get my way and that I sit around all day not trying to do better. And that she’s never been a bad friend. I told her there were times when she has been a bad friend and listed some of them for her, ending with what she did to my sister and that was only the tip of the iceberg. She again told me that my sister was a grown woman and that she didn’t make her give her her social security number. Which makes me think she was never really sorry about it in the first place. 

I was thinking about apologizing today again because I really didn’t mean any harm in saying I have a child. But another part of me genuinely hates her.

29,Does anyone see BPD/Bipolar as one massive cyclical entity? (Trigger Warning),"Im new to the sub reddit, relatively new to reddit and definitely not a massive one for writing (especially about such personal topics). I just kinda needed to get this out i think and i do wonder if people feel the same, or is it just me. The road of self discovery i suppose (with the help of you lovely people).

Bit of background; Male, just turned 30, have had 'problems since age of 11', addict, mum has Bipolar etc, I'm on valium, codeine & pregabalin each day. Got wrongly diagnosed at 23 w/ Mixed Personality Disorder w/ Narcissistic Tendencies (wtf) , 'corrected' at 25 to BPD, sort of 'corrected' again at 27/28 BPD/Bipolar.

To the fucking point... Over the last few years, id say from 27 to 30, every year seemed to be like one big cyclical event, repeating itself but speeding up and getting harder and harder. Careless, worthless, suicidal, isolated, so much more self destruction. I've always had those thoughts since the age of 13, i think they started. But when you get used to them, they are always there. When you're happy, socialising, walking, trying to sleep, depressed, MANIC. My cycle feels like it speeds up every year, the thoughts can become like an entity that takes over. It plans, puts pieces in place, thinks for you about the ramifications, enabler, instigator. The only thing i can liken it to is when you are not of sound mind through some sort of intoxicant, but more like a disassociated state. It's like i have two me's. And i'm a believer of the ego driven self and the true inner self. But this is like a split of ego as it's still ego driven but when i get into a self destructive cycle it is raging till it ends badly.

So just this year:

* I overdosed on Heroin in a blacked out state after drinking two bottles of shitty wine in half hour (oh yeah my Dad was there for half of it, watched me prep my gear). I would really give a shit about that, entity didn't give a shit
* I made an attempt on my life.
* I ended up in hospital in Portugal with 7 stitches in my head because of some bullshit Hostel
* Recently nearly got hospitalised because i was semi conscious on a park bench 5 minutes away from my house after consuming a lot of different things and then decided i was gonna drink Buckfast for the first time cos i knew a garage sold it in my city. Downed a bottle in 5 minutes, remember buying the second bottle and then just snapshots. Till police and medical found me on the bench, persuaded them to do one basically (but got a lift home lol)

So this is one as well, and its weighing down on me, crushing me. I've been a recovering addict for quite a while and then very recently i started getting back into the tricks of the trade on the internet - then comes out the addict again. So this week addict mode is engaged, fully. Stayed up all night before a ACT group meeting id been waiting a year for, i was actually fine but fucked up thing is i find me to be more like me the day after i've had no sleep, even without any drugs. It's kinda like i lose my inhibitions when i'm over tired. Any way i should get to the fucking point - Addict mode engaged, also just hit Manic stage as well (not good combo). Yesterday i lterally spent 12-14 hours on my laptop looking for drugs, researching about drugs, trying to find out if Noootropics would help me. Was so frustrated because i just wanted something NOW! Late, late hours are bad for me. Around 3am finally decided to try a new marketplace, end up buying half g of Crystal Meth & half g of H, next day delivery. (I've only told one person that). I've never done crystal meth and i the heroin, well i haven't done that since a week after my overdose (for obvious reasons). When i woke up the next day i just had this feeling of dread, a blanket of 'what have i done!?'. And i'm not stupid,i know i don't have to do them, i could throw them away - but i know i wont. They will turn up tomorrow and i will be taken over by this fucking thing that just wants to destroy. It sounds like i have no will power and this is what i mean by the circle it seems with every year that passes my will power decreases and this entity gains it. So this thing that is still me he has my fucking will power, destructive will power. And when the other part of me is down to like 30% left its not a fair fight. I cant blame it on something else becaue it is me, its not separate it just feels that way. They are still my actions and i am accountable for them. I just worry because with every year it gets harder and harder.... And believe me i try to change, i try to engage with anything that is available (when i can). I know baby steps and all that and i was actually doing well for ages and then your head or life just changes the context and you are back there again. It's got to the point where i feel like i just want to let it take over. Im tired. Really fucking tired. Of all the bullshit in the world and the ignorance of people that can't see the bigger picture. I know to change the world you start one person at a time and that begins with your self.... But all of this i understand, but i can't seem keep consistency, or any sort of routine. I can't engage in any of my hobbies anymore, i haven't worked in 6/7 years, a lot of the time i cant leave the house, my phone is a massive trigger and because of that ive lost a lot of loved ones... I've said it a few times recently, i feel like a waste of air. Theres so much more but im just having a self pitiful rant at a screen atm lol...

I just needed to write it down, get it out. I haven't told bits of this stuff to anyone, and the rest is definitely not common knowledge. For some reason id rather it be here, rather than anyone else know  🤷🏻‍♂️

Summary: I'm trying but every year gets harder, cycles seem to speed up and last for longer, self destruction goes up stupid amounts, and i get magnetised into more fucked up situations... And it get pretty much unbearable. I don't know if to post this... I'm not really looking for responses. I know a lot of it would be you're a fucking idiot for giving in to the drugs, (that aren't even here yet). But i know i will. And i except people may not understand, i dont fucking understand... I know im an addict, but its not for the effect of the drug, its for self destruction... Thats the condition in me, buried so deep, like its weaved into me and impossible to separate

30,"My birthday is next week and every year the one thing i have my heart set on, noone wants to do.","So last year i had a camping trip and the whole trip i kept telling everyone to be prepared for this one hike i wanted to do. Kept going over it again and again so ppl knew i was serious. Well everyone bailed last minute cuz they did drugs the night before and i had to do it alone (which i didnt care about) but apparently that made me look like an asshole. 

This year MY 30th birthday , a birthday i didnt even know i was gonna live till , and i decide to camp again. This time 7 hours away and the one thing i want is to have dinner at this fancy restaurant thats really expensive. (I tried going 3 years ago and had to cancel my reservation) A friend says its too expensive and doesnt want to go, even though i again stated we are having this dinner a while ago (only kicker is we found out its 75 bucks a person) its the main thing i want to do and i want to live alittle for this important day. I even offered to pay just so we can be together (i didnt want to go alone but would if i had to since this is such a bucket list goal) 
Shes now saying she might not want to go on the trip at all because i am so selfish and i dont realize the sacrifices and money shes putting down for this trip already.

36,Episode/struggling/venting,"TL;DR - I was doing really damn good for a few years and now my life is crumbling and idk where to turn. 




I’ve been doing good for so long. I was helped by my counselor and psychiatrist to wean off my meds, discharged from counseling a few years ago, and really thought I had my mental health under control and in check for the first time in a long time. 

All it takes is a short lived series of events and I’m already fearing another hospitalization. The impulsive spending, the increasing urge to self harm, isolating myself, extreme mood swings for the first time though including fits of rage, and panic attacks are back and have taken on new symptoms there too. Feelings of emptiness, dissociating, and dysphoria. I’m grasping at anything that will make me feel like it’s worth it to be alive. My drinking is getting out of control again and I’m afraid it’ll spiral into drugs again too. 

My marriage is (more likely than not) ending, and I’ll be left alone again. I feel like a waste and burden to everyone around me, and it really feels like everyone would be better off if I was gone. I’m really struggling to use my coping/DBT skills but I don’t feel connected or able to share these feelings in my relationship, with people loosely associated as friends, and I’m afraid my counselor will want to admit me which right now, I can’t afford as that would result in homelessness too.",1609860305.0,False,13,3,redwolfshoes,None,kr0gzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/kr0gzu/episodestrugglingventing/

38,No where else to turn,"I’ve had to leave FB because of this situation. Mostly venting,  but also open to advice/resources. 

My husband and I are separated right now. We got married too soon, and I let my feelings get the best of me when he love bombed me. 

I’ve had to leave most social media, and he doesn’t know I have a Reddit account, so this feels safe. I know he has one but I don’t know his name here so I can’t find him and can really focus on...I guess me at this point. 

I’ve been doing really well up until recently, and I’m still using all my coping mechanisms but all the same BPD feelings are rushing back and I feel like it’s snowballing quickly. The splitting, rapid mood cycling, feelings of emptiness, fear, irrational thoughts and impulsivity. 

I’m just lost and don’t know what to do. 

We agreed to use our time apart to find a solution for our marriage, but he drew money from the atm (we share an account) and I can’t imagine what you need cash for that a card can’t purchase other than drugs.

39,Perceived vs real betrayal/abandonment - advice for me and my SO please 🙏 (tweet for reference),"TLDR; with reference to this Tweet that I showed my bf, he asked when I am triggered and experience this, how can he deal it in the best way possible to avoid as much conflict possible? I honestly don't know the answer to this so would appreciate some advice please.

More context: I (29F) showed my boyfriend (33M) of 4 years this Tweet as it applies to me and I try to educate him about my trauma and how it affects me and how my brain operates so he can understand me better. We are trying to work through and improve our relationship which is heavily affected by my BPD and mental health issues. Sometimes he will do or say things that trigger me to feel/think he is betraying or abandoning me and my brain fully convinces me that this is the case (and I never know if it is real or imagined), I guess subconsciously to protect myself from getting hurt which inevitably does the opposite and leads us to break into massive blowout fights, which ruin all of our progress up to that point, even when things have been going super well for a while and then before I know it we're suddenly on the brink of splitting up and he starts questioning if there is any hope for our future at all. All because of my fucking triggers, disassociations, neurosis when my mind perceives the threat of betrayal or abandonment.

He always claims he is not doing what I think he is and I have no way of knowing if he is telling the truth or lying. For me trust doesn't even matter at this point because after experiencing so many REAL betrayals and abandonments from people close to me who I never would have ever expected to do so, my brain is so hypervigilant and on alert to suspect anyone could do that to me, it doesn't matter who they are anymore. Nobody is safe, no one can be trusted. Whenever I let my guard down and allow myself to trust and be vulnerable, people take advantage of it and then stab me in the back. The pain that occurs inside of me is gut wrenching and makes me withdraw and feel suspicious of people even more.

I am nothing like the person I used to be. I used to be a social butterfly and musician, I could not go a week without seeing friends, going to gigs and performing and ocializing, but since I've been so ill and debilitated the past few years as well as other factors, I've become an empty shell of who I used to be, severely isolated and living a hermit lifestyle. I have not seen any friends in 4 months, back in active addiction, anxiety, depression, BPD at its worst. This is my rock bottom.

I have a plethora of personal and family crises going on constantly piling up (the list just never ends, my whole adult life has been in survival mode), causing me so much inner turmoil, pain, grief, distress, depression, anxiety. I have become disabled by my multiple incurable chronic illnesses, my social life has become non existent, I fucking dread waking upon every next day miserably existing and nightmares at night. It's unbearable to be awake and be not awake. There's no escape, no peace, no way out. My illnesses have stolen my life away and everything I ever enjoyed and loved doing. I have lost all purpose in life, my sense of identity, motivation and any hope of ever being happy. I'm constantly overwhelmed, started self harming for the first time in my life, relapsed on drugs a few months ago (landed me up in the ER one night in Dec) and I'm admitting myself into a mental health clinic for 3 weeks on Thursday before I finish my degree online (there is no way I can study like this so it has to be before). 

I am in therapy, medicated (although I need to adjust/change my meds), but we just had our end of year summer holidays and my psychologist was away for a month, my psychiatrist has become absolutely useless and unreliable and has ignored me since mid December and other times last year when I needed his help (actual abandonment). I've been seeing my psychiatrist since 2020 and he has let me down so badly and become impossible to get hold of, I genuinely don't think this man has any interest in helping me anymore and may have to find another one, starting new after 4 years will be so fucking exhausting.",1707169567.0,False,5,0,tabasco_kat,None,1ajskqw,https://i.redd.it/lyqzryvl7ugc1.jpeg
40,Social anxiety tips?,"Hi, I have struggled with BPD for most of my life. I have also had interlinked difficulties with intense social anxiety/general anxiety. At points it is extremely difficult to leave my house or talk to anyone at all, other than my partner who I live with. 

Recently my social anxiety has become really bad again, partly because of spending way less time outside (pandemic/lockdown etc), and partly cuz of other factors. 

I can't take the bus anymore without having sudden intense panic attacks. I also have to talk to people on the phone for my work, and have had difficulties with that. Yesterday I had to reschedule a call because I just couldn't overcome my anxiety enough to get on the phone. 

What are your tips for overcoming this anxiety? It makes me feel really awful about myself and it's making my everyday life very difficult.

I don't like therapy at all because of this social anxiety, I always feel so uncomfortable in front of a therapist. I'm already on medication (cymbalta), and I don't think I can take benzos (I'm a drug addict).

Edit: tried to take a long trip outside today, transferred buses, was in public for a while, etc. All went great! Then an aggressive, leery dude mumbled to me about my genitals and followed me swiftly for many blocks.

41,Passed the Bar Exam Today,"At the risk of seeming egotistical, I (29M) wanted to post this for anybody really going through it as proof that you can do that thing people say you can’t do because you’re borderline.

I’ve had a lifelong struggle with what I know now to be Borderline Personality Disorder. In highschool, I was bullied so aggressively I had multiple near death experiences and my family’s home was repeatedly vandalized. My dad was repeatedly battling advanced stage cancer and I had to take care of my brother through the end of highschool while struggling with what I know to be CPTSD now. I was (mistakenly) diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety when I was 18 and told I would need to live a low-stress, safe, low pressure lifestyle. I hated this. 

For years, through college I struggled with both being over-medicated while also being inadequately helped. I hungout with dangerous, aggressive people through college because that level of dysfunction felt normal. I graduated college with a double major, but struggled to function well in the workplace. Bad relationships with toxic people was all I knew.

I spent 5 years in a majorly abusive relationship with a toxic narcissist that resulted in multiple hospital trips for stitches and broken glass removal. When that ended, I was a law student and the stress of the breakup led to lots of psychiatric problems, the vast majority of my friends abandoning me, isolation, suicide attempts, and self harm. I had to drop out of law school twice. My CPTSD and providers’ mismanagement of meds was so extreme that I lost the ability to read for almost 18 months. But I graduated.

I wasn’t even able to take the bar exam when I wanted to- my law school made me join a disciplinary program designed for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems because of my mental health problems through law school due to the extreme stigma against mental illness in law. I had to delay taking the bar exam after graduating because my mental illness was regarded as “a danger to the public.” Joining that punitive program was the only way to convince my state licensure board I could be trusted.

Finally, I was diagnosed BPD and started to get better through DBT. DBT saved my life. I gained the skills to put myself back together. Today I have an amazing girlfriend, a nice small house, rescue pitbull, new friends (through my girlfriend) and a couple old friends that stood by me, and now a new career in law as an attorney in a mid size American city as of finding out I passed the bar just this morning. 

Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn’t a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it’s an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don’t deserve it. Do that thing everybody says you can’t do and tell anyone who tries to stop you to eat shit.

42,I’m so tired.,"Tired of everything. Tired of having to take breaths to keep myself living. I’m tired of living, forcing myself to get out of bed when I wake up at 12 or 1PM so that the depression doesn’t turn into a series of tangled and knotted thoughts of anxiety and self-hatred. 

I don’t know who I am, and that stresses me out. I’ve only 
Lever been what I thought other people wanted. I used to pride myself on being entertaining and a social chameleon at the very least, but I’m scared that it came from some sort of weird obsessive need for others to validate me. I’ve been on the borderline of a religious psychosis. I know this is a “BPD” sub, but I’ve got a slew of trauma and a mother with undiagnosed but apparent BPD. Everyone in my extended family hates her, yet the comparisons are always there, and for good reason. I’m a 19 y/o male, but I’m still scared of becoming just like her.

I’ve struggled with dependency on alcohol, thc, and pornography starting from 12 years old. I finally decided to quit everything because I’m just ready to really get better, but it’s such a hard weird and confusing process. I feel like I cant really be helped. My only hope is moving out from my grandparents place this august, but even then I haven’t been taking care of anything I’m supposed to. 

I can’t hold down a job, I’m admittedly immature and narcissistic a lot. I have really bad problems with lashing out at others. I lost my best friend last week because she told me she “liked me better on drugs”. It was a joke I’m sure, but on top of her continuing to pretty much ignore me, I got the message that she hated me now. I cussed her out, said almost every terrible thing I could to her (I can think of more now), and continued to cut off every other person from my small town because I realized as a gay man, I was completely neglecting who I really felt I was fall ‘22 semester of college, before I dropped out because I was never focused on my schoolwork and just completely neglected every responsibility of mine. That’s also when I “dated” someone for the first time, only for him to cut it off after two months because I made a little gift basket for him when he got sick, and only then for me to find out that he moved on right afterwards.

I’m so tired of my fucked up early life experiences having absolute control over my shitty fucked up life. My last suicide attempt was in March, because on the second date with a guy, I asked him what he graduated from high school that May. 

No one understands me. I hate everything, everyone and this whole world. I can’t look anywhere, even at myself without seeing nothing but shit. I know I need to challenge all of this or whatever, but I genuinely don’t know how to. My therapist of two years apparently doesn’t know how to help someone with BPD. I got my diagnosis in March, and we haven’t done much of anything since. She gave me a workbook, so that’s something, but I feel like there’s no hope. I don’t know where to start. I thought that by understanding my mind and condition fully, that I’d just be able to get over this but I can’t. And I don’t know if I ever will. It’s so easy to just find a permanent solution to what seems like a permanent problem, especially since I hurt everyone when I get the slightest whim of emotion.",1687551119.0,False,5,2,Houseof1000horses,None,14h8fwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14h8fwq/im_so_tired/

I've abused kratom for four years. I was a very high dose user majority of the time (50gpd/+). Im almost at two weeks now. 
Kratom, if you don't know, is an opiate. Im not saying I've been numb this whole time, as I've had outbursts. Kratom made my emotions worse, I think, in a lot of ways. Also made some of it easier, as I was able to block a lot out, too- especially in the later years. 
I'm starting to panic that I'll have issues with my emotions. I'm worried sick at the moment due to random bursts of anxiety that are both related to lack of the drug, but also due to actual stressful shit.

45,I need help Understanding this.,"What i've found out about myself has scared tf out of me. I just found out why I act the way I act, and it almost made me slip into insanity.  So let me start by saying this: I now know there is and was nothing wrong with me, but this is still a massive fucking problem.

I used to abuse tf out of hallucinogens like dxm, lsd, ket etc. I thought I could change who I was fundamentally because I was foolish. I didn't like myself at the time, but I had no idea why. This all changed for me when I had the most traumatic acid and mushroom trip that would change everything I knew about myself. Long story short: I have a monster inside me. (I wont get into details, but I know who I am now.)

After this trip, I went straight into denial, pretending this hungry monster with an insatiable appetite wasn't inside of me. I did everything I could to run away from my demon, but with every effort I made to push him down, it only gave him time to grow stronger and smarter. I thought I had control, but I never really did. 

When he was pushed down by my own mental faculties, he started to use those against me to start questioning my own reality because, in a way, I was trying to run away from it. He was gaslighting me...

I started looking for meaning through the most mundane things, but little did I know this meaning I was looking at was pointing at my face laughing. Why was it laughing, I didn't know. My psychotic ass thought it was everyone else persecuting me, but it was me the entire time: in an effort to hide my true nature from myself.

This got really bad because, I thought people at work where trying mock me, belittle me, but they were all putting a genuine effort for me to feel like I fit in, but the monster found ways to sabotage their efforts, gaslighting my reality once more, telling me all my feelings had a deeper meaning behind them. They didn't 😑.

Now, I am coming to terms what my psychosis actually meant. It was just a projection of my own psyche against the world in an effort to tell me: ""take a hard fucking look in the mirror.

I'm still traumatized by all of this. I threw away all of my drugs and paraphanelia. I don't want to enable this monster. I just want to love him, help him see the good in himself because, his/my parents denied him the love and attention he craved, so he acts out in hoping that our parents will see the monster they've created, but they never did. But I do, and I know he's hurting which makes me pity him, but if I ever see him try to use me ever again, best believe I will put my foot down and tell him this is not ok.",1636828837.0,False,10,6,GenuineMeHopefully,None,qt7cdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/qt7cdg/i_need_help_understanding_this/
46,Is weed a medicine for my emptiness or a crutch?,"When I realized I had BPD, it came as a relief to be able to give a name to the subtle wrong feeling I've always lived with: emptiness. Not quite depression, not quite anger. An absence of contentment and in it's place uncomfortable uncertainty. Waking up and my first thought of the day being ""did I do something wrong yesterday?"" 

I don't always feel this way. Sometimes, when things are going really well or I receive praise or have sex or good luck I feel all the good feelings. I enjoy these times but I no longer trust the feelings. They are a great natural high, probably the best high, and like all highs they don't last.

But I can bring the good feelings back anytime I want, with weed. Take me at my emptiest: give me some bad news on a day when I am already full of emptiness and I'll be a despondent mess, unable to smile, seeking isolation, crying and wanting to be asleep. I smoke some weed and voila, I'm back baby, all grins, improvised songs, making bids for the attention of my loved ones, giving back rubs, eventually falling into deep untroubled sleep in my bed, relaxed, comfortable as I've ever been.

""Why are you such a pothead"" I've been asked many times over the years and I've never known how to answer. Dunno, I like to get high I guess? ""Can you even go a day without your weed?"" ""Why do you have to be high all the time?"" These assholes questions throw shade, imply a weakness, a lack of self control, a tendency for escapism. I'm not weak, and I have decent self control. But yes, I do like to escape the goddamn emptiness because I want to live rather than cry.

The assholes have a point though. Weed has side effects that make it unsuitable for use all the time. If I use it during the day I become less productive and too inwardly focused, less interested in other people, happy but dumb. 

I have a busy life, a family and a job, volunteer work, home renos to do, appointments to get to, and I can't be dumb during the day when all my responsibilities need tending to. So years ago I settled on the routine of waiting until the evening to indulge. Although I may have felt emptiness during the busy day, I could always look forward to collapsing into comfort for an hour or two before a delicious sleep. 

It's not a perfect system because I still need to endure the emptiness throughout the day. And there are still side effects from the weed, like hazy memory, and difficulty waking up at 5:30am when I like to go to the gym.

And I also wonder if my regular weed use contributes to the emotional disregulation I feel as a person with BPD. Weed has been part of my life for so long, I can't clearly remember what I'm like without it.

So there are more than enough reasons to quit weed, at least for awhile. And I have tried to do this, many many times, and yet I keep coming back to it. 

The last time I took a break from weed was a few years back. The break was about three months long. I was proud of myself for being able to put it down and I even started to wonder why I used to do it every day. I felt a sense of freedom from having to go through the same rituals every day. 

The evenings were hard. I found myself craving some kind of special treat and ended up drinking alcohol more often. I found the best way to cope with evening emptiness was to throw myself into creative projects. As long as my hands were busy I was usually distracted from the emptiness until bedtime. I had to keep moving. I was more productive. I had a harder time sitting still.

Maybe one day some a pharmaceutical company will make a drug that contains the parts of weed that combat emptiness, without the side effects. 

I would love to hear from others with BPD. Has weed been helpful and does it have side effects?",1680373379.0,False,10,14,bpdlearnerburner,None,128ubhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/128ubhw/is_weed_a_medicine_for_my_emptiness_or_a_crutch/
47,Journalling,"Could be triggering to some people, just getting some thoughts out on the screen tonight dipped into a crying spell then decided to write   


I am greatly appreciative of those who care for me…the unfortunate part and truth about my disability and mental illness impacts me on a daily in life…
I would never wish this on anyone in my life, my emotional Roller coaster makes the world seem more dangerous than not, I’m trying really hard to counteract this…I cry so often and feel pain so much I don’t even have words to describe or express how I'm feeling…I feel the pain in depth…and I try so hard not to feel the emotion of being happy as that doesn’t last long enough, I'm exhausted from emotions, I feel stuck with it, like it just never ends and doesn’t go away. Forever right there… 

I haven’t completely forgiven myself yet, for all of the damages and self inflicted trauma wounds that I suffered, it’s best to lay down and let the feelings and emotions pass by then to cope with maladaptive behaviours that did exist once before…its so easy for me to just cope with sex And drugs or trying to control and blame shift on to others, when it’s not anyone else’s responsibility or issue with how I’m doing emotionally…it’s mine I own this, happiness is supposed to come from within, I find it very difficult to be in control of my happiness when I have this stupid fucking mental illness, mixed with depression and autism as well as adhd. 

I want the best outcome for my life but this is the worst mental illness mixed with autism too and the self harming traits that are found on the spectrum…I’m impressed I’ve lived…I'm sorry for those I have hurt either by hurting myself trying to end my pain, and making everyone walk away or walk on eggshells around me. I am trying to be better and get better and be positive and more happier and healthier, and not hurt anybody or self mutilate. I am full of optimism and goals and day dreams too. I am just trying to survive like every other person, not making excuses for how badly I’ve acted in my past.  I feel like a disgusting human though blaming everyone else around me because in my reality I didn’t see myself as having any problems with anything, I know I struggled a bit in school…and in life chalked this up as a learning disability…it’s much more than that… 
I’m learning how to actually love myself how I am…i have mindfulness now to think about my next steps I ask myself this question every time I go to do something new, am I doing this out of self love or not so much, am I really taking care of myself and my actions, and my time, am I taking care of others around me, am I to aware of their needs above my own…are they even a good person, with the heathy way I want to live. 



There’s so much to process in a very small timeline with one decision…

I’ve make so many mistakes and errors, I keep growing through this, I keep going even though I’m in so much pain emotionally ever single day. I find it very difficult to stand up for myself as well, especially now since my life has completely collapsed around me…I’m mentally unstable and always will be, with delusional thinking patterns and maladaptive daydreams which honestly make my life more manageable…as well as the dissociative episodes too. I hate fighting with myself day after day it’s exhausting to say the least almost always feel like I’m in crisis. Underneath is a feeling of rage and anger, disappointment and dissatisfaction that would make anyone feel uncomfortable. 

I am and will aim to align myself with what my heart and values are… and what I can to to achieve a healthy lifestyle and learn how to live and trust myself too especially when I’m overwhelmed or doomed with stress. 
I have come along ways with how I view reality, and how my thinking patterns have changed it’s going to be a life long struggle…and others may misunderstood  me and I myself misunderstand me I’ll always be weird and different. 

The reality of my mental health 

Trying really hard not to have a special/ favourite person, I’m not emotionally prepared for another one, I’ve done the most devastating damage with the fp/sp in my opinion, it’s done me nothing but more harm and them too, yes the devastation of not knowing who I am or how to act or how to express myself or my opinions, being misunderstood and mistreated, and manipulated and suffering. I’m not ready to start up a new relationship life again, I’m not willing to open up for just anyone anymore, I’ve done more damage than good ,he’s gotta have knowledge on what my Life looks like for me and knowledge or an understanding of what I am dealing with, before he gets serious… In ways I cannot see myself in another relationship, I have to many narcissistic traits that I have learned from being used. Im not proud to admit or address any of this, I have major co dependency traits and people pleasing too, I’m in constant battle with this, and don’t know how to say no. Im just trying to cope and make it through life no one said it’d be easy. I am focusing on the negatives right now yes, I am labeling myself. I don’t wish to hurt my partner or anyone for that matter…not even myself when I was experiencing no suicidal self injuries. I don’t understand how to have a healthy relationship with someone and have boundaries that are not smashed to pieces, by my partner, not able to assert my own boundaries. Just learned to trust myself. 



 I feel obligated to justify myself to others because I’ve misunderstood myself and others have misunderstood myself for far too long and the same is going to be for the rest of my life.

48,A lesson in splitting and honoring your needs,"Hey guys so I learned a big lesson this week on BPD and on speaking my own boundaries.

Long story short my parents died about 5 months ago and it sent me into the worst regression of my symptoms I have ever had.

I’ve spent the past five months clinging to my bf like a leech and having crisis after crisis over tiny things like him seeing friends or turning over in bed wrong (he’s rejecting me in his sleep?!? Spoiler: he wasn’t. He was sleeping)

Long story short - things have gotten better slowly over the past few months. I’ve gone from being constantly terrified to being mostly regulated. However - he had a few big trips coming up at the end of the summer that were giant triggers for me.

I spent the past month preparing for his trip with my therapist and it was going pretty smoothly! I wasn’t jealous, I was even able to relax and have fun on my own. Was having lots of bad thoughts come up but was dealing with them well without needing any outside help, and he was staying in more contact than usual knowing that this was a big challenge for me.

While on his trip he brought up that he wanted to do some psychedelics on the last night of his trip and I got triggered SO hard upon even hearing about it. (Parents were terrible addicts who abused me under the influence). 

What ended up happening is I kind of felt guilted to let him do it even though I was extremely uncomfortable with it. I felt really guilty from being so clingy the past few months and from having a major meltdown/splitting episode when he was at a party in early July. I felt like I HAD to agree otherwise I was terrible and controlling. He also mentioned he had abstained multiple times over the past several months because I was in such a state of arousal, he knew it wouldn’t go over well. This just added to my guilt and shame.

He ended up doing it and guess what happened? I had a meltdown and split the hardest I ever have.

And now that we are through it I realized that it just shouldn’t have happened. 

Because even though I cried and cried about it and talked to him and my therapist about it, I was still extremely uncomfortable the day of. But we pushed through and it went really fucking badly.

And the thing is: I’m not against drug use. I know that my normal self had handled it fine in the past, but right now I’m extra sensitive. But instead of honoring my needs, and just telling him: hey, I’m not ready for this right now, I can’t handle it well right now - I instead felt the episode coming on and cried and cried and felt terrified but let him do it anyway. What happened next makes sense: the emotions built up and exploded on him after a few hours.

And I think the lesson here is: I should have just said ‘no’. 

But instead of noticing my symptoms and how triggered I was - I let the shame of my past actions and the fear of abandonment control me (he won’t love me if I say no). 

But looking back - I deserve someone who will understand that I’m not ready. And at the end of they day, I’m the only person who can know my own boundaries. Tbh - if I had just said straight up: “I’m not ready for this right now, I’m not stopping you forever, I just need some time”, I think he would have been really understanding and accommodating.

If he had just waited, and I spent a few weeks talking to my therapist and him about it - he probably would have been able to go back to doing his usual usage without a giant problem. But instead he was impatient, and I was shaming myself for my feelings - and it led to something really bad.

I think we can let the shame of our BPD control us. Thinking: ‘I should be better than this. I should be able to control this.’

But what if instead we view it through the lens of self love and acceptance of our BPD? 

“This is really difficult for me, and knowing how I am and how I react to triggers, I’ll probably have an episode if this continues.”

I think maybe working together with your partner, realizing that you’re a work in progress, and giving yourself TIME to learn how to cope healthily before exposure is the way to go if you can swing it. It’s ok to need time to adjust and to take time to heal and prepare for big triggers. Don’t shame yourself and jump in, because you’ll both end up feeling worse than if you had just waited. Speaking your boundaries will protect your relationship!

If you’re building a house together, and you really want to put up a roof, you need to build the walls first, instead of just throwing up a roof without proper support. Because then you’re left with the mess and expense of a broken roof to deal with, instead of just doing it right the first time.",1691170421.0,False,8,1,Astrnougat,None,15i6e7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15i6e7x/a_lesson_in_splitting_and_honoring_your_needs/
49,How to find your sense of self with BPD,"As a daughter of someone who has severe BPD, and someone with moderate BPD, i have done a lot of reflection and implemented grand changes in my life that have brought me to this point of self-awareness. I have realized that if you are someone with a personality disorder or any mental illness in fact, it is best to cut out any stimulating substances, coffee included to find your real sense of self. I have been drinking since I was 15, (I am now 22) and I have been deliberately and perpetually drunk for almost every weekend of my life since I was 18. When I turned 19, I was drunk 3-4 days a week while still enrolled in full time university, holding two jobs. I would also regularly smoke cigarettes and weed  drink coffee since 15. I also began dabbling in hard drugs between 20-22 years old, cocaine being my preferred choice. I never realized how much alcohol was a part of my life and something that I depended on, even if I was still very highly functioning. I was so stubborn, I thought I wasn't impressionable at all. The thing is, nobody tells you in your youth you should stop drinking, especially those you surround yourself with. It has become so normalized to ingest toxins for ""fun"" that people don't even develop a proper personality or know who they truly are because they are consistently taking substances that drive them farther away from reality. These substances also rewire our brain and make us think and do things our sober self wouldn't say. But we don't know that because we aren't ever truly sober. Our brain is constantly being attacked by substances, media, LED lights, and information overload. We keep ingesting them and think it is a part of our personality, thinking there is something so severely wrong with us, when really we have accumulated years of stress (high cortisol levels) in our minds, bodies and veins.

One thing I realized is that I am a completely different person without alcohol, because without it I am truly an introvert. Many people know me to be confident, outgoing and a social butterfly, fearless and free of anyone's judgement. Although this is true, I genuinely don't care what anyone thinks, I did realize (after therapy, moving out, being physically active and cutting back on substances) that I am truly introverted rather than extroverted. I would always wonder why I am so drained after a party, a social interaction, or after many meetings or conversations with people I never cared about. Now that I go to parties with people my age, everyone is concerned with drinking and smoking and listening to most conversations as someone who is sober or is hyperaware of the social, philosophical and psychological state of themselves and the party, it is genuinely a very uninteresting and nerve wrecking and anxiety inducing experience. Alcohol really does bind people and create a mutual sense of ""we're all fucked together"", making is easier for people to tolerate each other. I realized how much I don't have in common with anyone my age. I realize how much I would rather be at home reading or going on a hike or just being in my own company, rather than being around people who I may never see again, or hope I never do. Alcohol makes us do things we wouldn't or are normally too scared to do. I have many so many friends and connections and experiences just from being DRUNK. Not because of my interests or desires or ambitions.I am not saying these experiences were useless or a waste of time, or haven't taught me anything. I had a lot of fun and have learned a great deal just from being in these situations. But they aren't permanent, they never last and they aren't as fulfilling as they are when you're drunk. 

When you're perpetually drunk, you do a lot of things you don't care about and you don't know why. I drove myself into such a deep depression that I don't have words or feelings to express how lost I was, or still am in this ocean of nothingness. However, things only get better once you increase your self-awareness. Some people have an inclination do that, others never get there. But this can also be a curse because I have also thunk myself into a very neurotic, delusional, dissociative and hallucinogenic state while being so self-aware of this condition. All you can do is get yourself to a point of being so self-aware that realizing that ingesting any toxin in an attempt to numb or kill something inside you means you truly don't love yourself. But beware, self-awareness can also drive us to such a paralyzing state of apathy that it becomes difficult to show anyone your true self.  Everything is a double-edged sword.

If you have BPD, or are just emotionally disregulated, or are just a human bean in the 21st century, please take this post as a sign to cut back on everything that overstimulates your brain because this is the only way you can find your true self, and what you do after that determines your true character.",1620004928.0,False,23,6,PsychologicalLog4022,None,n3kqcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/n3kqcy/how_to_find_your_sense_of_self_with_bpd/
50,The victim in me,"
I’m writing this because I often avoid the pending anxieties that ding at the top of my nose. That’s where I feel it. Thoughts clouding my vision. I can no longer see myself. My stomach saturates with guilt. Panic like protein for my insecurity. Bone on bone. I have been shedding layers. It’s been nearly two years of this. I’m writing this because my brain is in constant fight or flight. I’m left with a very weak will to live. I am in survival mode at all times. There is a victim inside of me. She screams for my help. For my attention. I often ignore her. Tonight I will not only listen to her, hear her, comfort her. But I will let her speak. The person I want to be and the person that I was and the person I am all sit inside of my body. They each have different dreams, personalities, fears, insecurities. I am none of them and all of them. I am nothing and everything. I don’t know who I am. I am lost. And I’ll admit that. The way other people see me, the way they feel about me, the way they treat me and the way they don’t is something I obsess over. I have an urgency to gain the acceptance and love of others. I have a frequency to prove I can gain it. So I can love myself. I set limits on my own self love contingent on the love I receive from others. This is because I have a deeply routed fear of being abandoned. Being forgotten. Being replaced. Watching energy shift. Watching people grow out of me. Fall out of love with me. Out of friendship with me. I would do anything to reverse this fear. To be self sufficient and self loving. I often attract careless people. I often attract intentionally harmful people. I often attract specifically harmful people. I am sensitive to others. I am hurt easily. I attach easily. I detach easily. It is painful. It is exhausting. It is harmful. I have spent the last two years running from hard truths. My life has changed forever. I am incapable of returning to the way I felt and the way I saw the world before these events. I tried to heal on my own. I made a mess. I trusted everyone I knew. It was a mistake. I shared my deepest painful secret with my closest friends. It was a mistake. I confused friendship for therapy and I thought my transparency with my trauma would grant me some kind of rain check on life. Life kept moving. I did not. I lost myself entirely. I could not look myself in the eyes. My relationships with people I loved very deeply changed. My relationship with simple things like food and sleep changed. I could feel myself going crazy. Misdiagnosed. Drugged. Lost. And losing it. I became dependent on things. People. Drugs. Alcohol. Spending money. I thought if I could just stay manic. I could stay sane. I could be happy. The more I would open up, the heavier I would feel. I started to feel lonely. I became complacent. I started praying that God himself would wipe my existence from this earth. I prayed that I could run very away and become a new person. I still pray for this. I had a very hard year. Mental illness is not a small thing. I am the captain of a very large ship and I do not know the first thing about the sea. I’ve never driven a boat. The water is aggressive. I have several diagnoses and several pending. I have not been transparent with many people about my experiences with mental health. I think it’s because I care so deeply to be accepted by others and it is defining me. Taking me from my truths. I have had to remove people from my life. I have had to fully detach myself to grasp at what peace would feel like in my head. I am consumed by the idea and the fear that the people I love the deepest will eventually leave me. That they hate me. That they have never loved me. So I fulfill this and prove my fear correct by detaching. By running. When I see that no one has chased me, it is now not peace I feel from knowing I was right all along. It is my fight or flight. It is overwhelming anxiety. It is insecurity that now my deepest darkest painful secrets are now public record. That whatever hate I feared before is amplified. I often attract people with a specific trait. People who know everyone’s business, tell everyone’s business to everyone, talk horribly about the people that love them. Make others believe they would never do this to them because they are somehow immune. Lack empathy. Create a chaotic and mutually symbiotic environment that is in no way beneficial to either party. Create abusive cycles in which they with hold their love and support. This invents a competitive Olympic codependent gymnastics where I reinforce their ego and lack of empathy by falling to my knees and discarding whatever healthy pride I have preserved in order to service them. I remember being moments away from killing myself but instead responding to a text about a hookup crisis. My pain was never valid. My family member passed away. I was devastated. The day of the funeral I was having an anxiety attack because I needed to be of service to someone. The clock had started. I was afraid if I didn’t reach out and prove my service, they would have no reason to comfort me while i grieved. I was afraid I would altogether lose them. I have been so afraid of losing people that I have gripped on to them. Gone out of my way to check on them. Take care of them. Listen to them. I became a service industry. Still unhealed. Exhausted. People I had made permanent places for in my life had been revealing their true colors to me. I found out one of my friends had developed a deep routed hate for me during this transitional and life altering period in my life. Saying terrible things about me to others and plotting their exit. This person ghosted me. Can I blame them? I am suffering from the residuals of deeply routed sexual traumas. The PTSD infiltrates my brain in many forms. I also suffer from borderline personality disorder. Body dysmorphia. Disordered eating. Major depression. Anxiety. Panic Disorder. ADHD. I fight myself daily to accomplish any goals. Sometimes I’m lucky if I brush my teeth. My exhaustion is defeating. I have dreams. Big dreams. Sometimes I think maybe I should kill myself before I have to live to see them never come true. I compare myself to everyone I see on the internet. I have low self esteem. I have a college degree. I cannot hold a job. I cannot find a job to hold. Everything feels like it was all for nothing. But still I have hope. Despite spending all of my energy on the worry of what others think of me. I have hope. I have friends. I have family. I am not hopeless. Not anymore. But I am lost. And I feel like a victim to my own life. I’m trying to take control of the way I feel and push myself into the wings I’m expecting to grow in. I am being to forceful. Too impatient. I am harming myself. Stunting my growth. Haulting my healing. People want explanations from me. I don’t have one to give. I am in pain. I am suffering from my own mind. I am trapped inside my body. I am trying to find my way out. I am trying to find my peace. Pray for me. Please someone pray for me. Tell me my feelings are valid. Tell me to stop blaming myself for the things I can’t change. Give me a shortcut to healing. Show me a cheat sheet. Hand me the blueprint. This came with no instructions. I’m exhausted. I’m trying to keep my momentum. I’m trying to push myself farther but not harder. The added stress will only make me shut down and turn off. I am in need of kind words and encouragement. I am in desperate need of love.",1604740418.0,False,6,2,sadbutveryhotbutsad,None,jpnslz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/jpnslz/the_victim_in_me/
51,"To the BPD who is addicted to shoplifting, read this","Hey, that used to be me too.

Once I realized I could get away stealing one or two things, I started pushing my limits. Once I stole one of those $70 Instax cameras. Another time I stole a $100 desk. I even started to calculate how much I would steal by collecting the price tags and creating a spreadsheet. I’m talking thousands of dollars. Every single store I went to, I would steal something. It was second nature at that point. I wasn’t even thinking about it. My thought was, “It’s no question that I can get away with this.”

For the most part, it was food. Quality food I normally wouldn’t buy because of the price tag, and things like non-generic vitamins and shampoo, soaps, etc. Essentials like those. But that wouldn’t stop me from going to the mall, taking a bunch of things into the dressing room of a store that doesn’t count items, cutting the security tags off of a few and shoving them into another bag, then putting the rest into the rack so one one could really tell. This went on for a couple years.

Shoplifting culture in America, especially among teens and young adults, has been so normalized. I would tell someone their top is cute and they’d go “Thanks! I lifted it :)” because this was something everyone was so comfortable doing that they could tell someone about and it wasn’t a big deal. This made it feel like, since this is so normal, there’s nothing wrong with it. I’m not breaking the law. I’m immune since everyone else does it too. I can’t tell you why I did this so much. I empathize with you. But I want to let you know that nothing, and I mean nothing, hits harder than when you’re caught.

I got caught stealing groceries from a Walmart in the middle of a BPD/manic episode. It was bad. I was glad I was only groceries, and only about $48, and not something stupid and frivolous like makeup from Ulta or clothes from the mall. But even though it was less than $50, they have a 100% prosecute policy.

I had finished my usual routine at the self checkout, then as I was pushing my cart and leaving, some plain clothes people approached me and told them to follow them to the back. As I followed them to the “Employees Only Area”, I felt my vision going white and my whole body was shaking. I knew I had been caught. They took my cart away to count the items and check the receipt (they had printed their own copy from the machine I just used) and another lady took me to the loss prevention room. Let me tell you, there was no worse feeling than them showing me footage of myself stealing. I thought I was so slick. I thought no one was watching. I thought the cameras couldn’t see me. I thought I could get away with it. Nope. I was forced to watch myself go to different aisles placing items out of sight, then at the self checkout. It was mortifying. I couldn’t stop crying. They asked to scan my ID, then told me they called the police and they’re on their way to file a report. Luckily I wasn’t brought down to the station, but I still had to sign everything. They also gave me a sheet of paper that said to “Write out the incident/what you did” and sign and date at the bottom of the page.

The nightmare didn’t end. After that, I was hospitalized because my combined BPD/manic episode was spiraling me out. But to make matters worse, I had to go into court. Public defender and everything. Hundreds of dollars of court fees too. And the disappointment on my parents’ faces. I was lucky I got my case deferred. But then I was put on probation for a year. I also had to do an online “STOPlifting” course, was banned from Walmart, had to get drug tested once a month, and had community service hours.

Even though I wasn’t convicted, I was still charged, and still am part of the court system. This meant that whenever I had applied to a job that does a background check on me (even things like Uber and Instacart) and they see I got a Class 1 Misdemeanor shoplifting charge, I don’t get hired. I’ve had places I really wanted to work at reject me because of this background check. This happened over two years ago and my probation has since ended, BUT this record still gets pulled up when I have a check run on me.

Nothing, and I mean nothing, was worth this. No amount of money saved, gratification won, or feeling of a “rush”, was worth having to relive the feeling of getting caught, watching footage of myself stealing, telling my parents I was arrested and had to go to court, be on probation for a year, and have a semi-permanent record (until I can figure out how to get it expunged).

I’m telling you this as one BPD person to another, it’s not too late to stop. I wish someone told me to stop sooner, and not just a righteous cop-loving person, but someone who actually understands me and knows what this feels like. Whenever I see anyone talking about shoplifting, I feel like I have to share what happened to me so that no one else has to go through this either.

I know the appeal shoplifting has as someone with BPD. There’s a rush, you get something good out of it, you feel invincible, you feel like you’re always going to get away with it. Until you don’t, and you end up reliving this nightmare every day for a year. This post is for those who know they have a problem but haven’t been able to stop yet, and if only one person decides this is the sign to stop, I will be happy for you.

52,My FP just ended our friendship,"I feel numb and then I feel everything. 

&#x200B;

For context, my FP and I met when we were both in very serious relationships. We had amazing chemistry and were both very aware of it. I wasn't getting sexual validation in mine and I think it was his attention that suddenly made me lock him in to Favorite Person status. I have spent two years chasing his approval and having my feelings drug through the mud in the process. We started messing around early in the friendship and at a particularly rocky part of his own romantic relationship, we slept together. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months, he is no longer in his relationship and is dating again. We've kept it pretty kosher, but his dating someone new who's been getting his attention was sending me into spiral after spiral. I kept brining up situations to my therapist, trying to have some outside perspective to tell if I was being abandoned or if I was making it up. In a lot of cases I was making it up - there was no real evidence - but in the past 2 weeks some significant things happened. Most notably, I found out that he had planned a trip with our mutual friends and I was the only one excluded. Weirdly, he followed up my concern by asking if he thought we could ever be platonic friends...which, I felt like we were currently doing just fine. He switched the subject back to the trip - his first excuse for not inviting me was ""it was last minute"" then ""I thought you'd be busy.""  My therapist helped confirmed to me that, yes, this was him being shitty and I had the right to tell him so. 

&#x200B;

Today, I met him for coffee and we both hashed it out. He truly didn't invite me because of the new girl he's dating and how shameful he feels when I'm around. He knows he cheated with me AND he knows how used I've felt about it (he's apologized about that a lot). And honestly? I get that. It makes SO MUCH sense. I told him he should've told me from the beginning. It would've saved me a lot of hard emotional times wondering what I did wrong that NO ONE invited me. He said he was scared to tell me, but that he just doesn't think he can be my good friend. He's worried he's going to grow resentful of me. His radical honesty put me more at peace than I have been in ages. It gave me a feeling of sanity - here I was thinking that I was having an intense BPD-fueled freakout, but there an actual withdrawal. I didn't make it up!

We ended things fine - I barely teared up. I understood where he was coming from and my therapy combined with a renewed effort in my current relationship was making a huge difference.

I'm certain a HUGE emotional fallout is chillin' right around the corner for me, but right now I feel kinda...free? We're amiable, we still have mutual friends, but now I get to focus on my healthy relationships. I feel like I have a lot of headspace. I've been making this list to ""get to know myself"" and I've been brutally honest about shit I've lied to myself about when I built the personality for this FP, so I feel like this change happened at a lucky time, where I feel a little more at home in my skin than I have for the past 3 years.

It's going to be really hard not turning to him with every piece of news about my life - sending him songs - snapping him cute dogs - all that shit.

53,There is hope.,"I have no formal diagnosis but I firmly believe that I once had BPD. I used fit the criteria to a T. I'm writing this in hope that I can help others, give others hope and maybe inspire some of you. 

First, background, as it's all relevant. 

I had an unstable childhood, lots of trauma and abuse. I was thrown out at 15 and had to pretty much fend for myself. From the ages of 15 to 27 I lived a hugely chaotic life, moving from place to place and unable to hold down a job, relationship or anything meaningful. 
I was abusive in all my previous relationships, never physical, but emotional. I would lash out at the most minor inconvenience, I was angry and aggressive and I create an environment whereby all those around me felt as though they were walking on eggshells. I had the most poisonous tongue known to man and I'd hit people exactly where I knew it would hurt. I was never satisfied. I always wanted and expected far too much from those around me and when I felt I hadn't gotten what I deserve, I would attack with words and empty threats. I would threaten partners with leaving them. I would tell partners they were meaningless to me, I'd tell them I didn't love them, nor did I want them around. I would cause arguments with people literally every day of my life. I would ruin outings and social events. I used suicide as a threat and as a means of control. I don't believe, during these years, I had the mental capacity, or genuine desire to better my behaviour. Luckily for me I have a fantastic group of friends who have stood by me, regardless of all my faults, and regardless of pain I have caused them. 

Fast forward to my 26th year and I decided I needed to change. For me, there was no big event that led to this, it was a decision I made based on how I felt my life and relationships would turn out if I continued as I was. I wanted to be a better person and rectify my wrongdoings as much as is possible. I began reading self-help books and researched BPD. I was later diagnosed with ADHD, severe depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Eventually, after months of trying medicines, I was put on Venlafaxine. This was both a blessing and a curse. My moods became stable, I had better emotional regulation and I had no desire to hurt those around me, no matter how upset I became. Alas, this came with conditions: My sex drive is constantly low and I have to actively work on this, although able to understand emotion, I feel very little emotion and my passion for life and my previous interests has dissipated. It's a sacrifice I choose to make because I want to be a good person.
Since taking meds I have invested countless hours reading and educating myself on neuropsychology, BPD, trauma, neuroplasticity, anything I felt may help me to better understand my behaviours, and various literature, both academic and otherwise, regarding changing responses and behaviours. 

It's been a long road and it isn't over. I still slip up every now and again but I am so much healthier and better able to handle emotional situations. I am emotionally available, discussing feelings and thoughts with those in my life. I take my meds as I am supposed to. I rarely react with anger. I ask others opinions before I respond, so as to guage whether or not my feelings/reactions are in line with the situation. I NEVER call anyone names in malice. I listen before I jump to conclusions and I try to think with logic and reason at all times. I am now an asset to the people around me. 

I attribute my progress to a few things; education and understanding my conditions, discussing, with everyone in my life, all the negative things I had done and taking ownership of the damage I caused... This was paramount; taking Venlafaxine, for me this is a wonder drug, although please bear in mind that what works for one of us may not work for you; and taking LSD in a therapeutic environment, engineered for self reflection. 

I wanted to change so very much that I actively make it happen. It was my decisions alone that have led me to recovery and I cannot stress enough that recovery is only accessible to those who see the damage they cause, see the hurt and chaos, and then act alone (without need for encouragement from others) to better themselves. 

I still need therapy and I will continue to work on my flaws. I may have to do this for the duration of my life. I still suffer with the invasive thoughts. The evil remarks and hurtful comments still enter my head, but now I can observe these thoughts and I choose to act with compassion and understanding over anger and frustration. There is a better way. 

TL;DR Was an ar*sehole, sought meds and education. Now much better for it. LSD for a mind reset and discussions with everyone in my life led me to take ownership of my behaviours. Not an ar*sehole anymore.",1583850127.0,False,9,13,kitamajita,None,fgek26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fgek26/there_is_hope/
54,Ex fiancé of a woman with borderline personality disorder.,"I struggle with how to preface this, so I'll keep it short. I get messages like this all day, most days of the year. For the past two years. Please help. 

You don't even know what pain and suffering are Andy. There's no possible way you could ever feel what it's like. You haven't the slightest clue mr. Snotsdale preppy boy prick dicksucker niggerbitchfucker;;;; wah wah ur mommy died almost exactly 1 year ago and what? And what Andy and what??? Nothing that's what. You don't actually give a shit about it or that she died or what she probably struggled with and all that crap that goes along with being a mentally ill misunderstood drug addicted woman that is abandoned by men she fair to say devoted her life too. And her kids too. Like you Andy. And ur a fuckhead. You just ended up being a stuck up snob pompous self-centered prickfucker , hey haha, just like your dad? Yeah cool. Congrats. 

I may not have gotten to meet your mother but I sure as hell can confidently say that from all of what you told me about her that last year of her life, well damn, she was broken into oblivion , into dust, kinda like the dust you people actually literally turned her into by cremating her. Wow. Yeah I said that. 

But no, you don't really understand any of what it's like that whole pain and suffering thing and you just go ""wah wah mommy's dead I haven't faced those facts yet wah wah"" because you want people to feel <<bad>> for you and you want to pretend like you are so dark and depressed and wah wah wah. Cool but REAL people with REAL PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS THAT DISABLE THEM FROM ALL OF NORMAL LIFE can see right directly thru ALLLLLLL of your bullshit Andy. 

You ain't fooling the real ""sick ones"", not us, nope. But haha ain't nobody of yourr stuckup snotsdale kind is ever going to listen to what we ""the others"" ""the unimportant"" ""the dismissable"" the fucking <<underground ones>> have to say.  Cuz we the underground folk are ""crazies"" and a ""blemish to your superior high society"" ...  PSH. Fuck you and fuck your truce.

None of you know anything real or significant or pain or suffering or struggle from the soul, that in tune perception of ""I am alive yet I am dying each and every single day, each minute, each second and I watch those who think they're living it up..Merely lie to themselves because they too are dying each and every day as I am.."". 

You don't know anything Andy. You got brainwashed by your stuck-up prick society phonies and you are up all the garbage they flashed in front of you. You used to have a clever spark to you though, I saw it in those journal entries of yours from when you articulated onto paper your thoughts and true feelings about Arizona, Scottsdale, and all the friends and people you worked for..... Funny but very sad and disgraceful fact now is that you had forgotten all of your true self within a very short amount of time once returning to this disgusting desert land. *****You, Andy, forgot what it meant to be aliveee...... And with that amnesia you proceeded to shovel biblical dirtbag fakeness and arrogant ""laws"" onto the already-made-meek&shallow graves of ones like myself, ones like me who entered a forsaken land only with the sole purpose to keep the proximal connective power strong of one soul split between two bodies: you and I. God's will. 


Do whatever Andy. You're wrong though. Call me a psycho, call me crazy, call me or haha don't call me bc u neverrrr call me anymore. Whatever. I'm right. You're wrong. All of them on ""your side"" are wrong, they're blind deaf and dumb.

Good luck finding yourself when all you continue doing is living a lie and running from the truth. Yeah I'm sure you'll get super far and feel so accomplished once that whole journey of bullshit nothing ends for you, oh wait no it won't because you CANNOT attain a state of NIRVANA without first experiencing the stages of SUFFERING.

55,I fear I'm doomed to never be the father I was meant to be.,"How can I actually believe I'll be an amazing dad someday like I want and visualise so desperately. I always wanted to be the fun adventurous goofy golden retriever like dad. My partner wants me to throw in a mix of my rancher man, assertive, calm grounded and sometimes stern side which I also totally see as my dynamic. I see this so clearly and I want it so bad with her I think I could strive to be a perfect dad without leaving my character or struggling at all. 

Before I met my partner and healed significantly my fear was my splitting and rage. I couldn't control it I would always fear I was a loaded gun and would not be able to regulate my emotions and accidentally release it on my kids. I'm not ready quite yet of course I need some more years of consistency. But at this point I'm fully confident I will be able to heal enough to never EVER repeat my cycle of abuse. But now I fear something different and in a way much much worse. 

My partner recently asked me something along the lines of what would be my reaction if I got news my mum died. She's constantly on the brink of death and spiralling so that wasn't too odd a question especially since I was dodging another call. To my discomfort and disappointment I realised I wouldn't shed a tear over it. I told her that after giving it some proper thought, and I can exactly imagine the scenario I can literally put myself there. Imagine the text coming in from my sister. Hearing she took it too far. Considering details like she's in Australia and the news would come delayed. And I know I wouldn't feel that level of devestation. Sadness for sure, heavy sadness. She's been alone for so long. Yearning for her lost children, dead brother, and drinking herself into oblivion. And that's a depressing thought I would feel a lot of guilt. But in a fucked way I was over all more sad about all the stories she was yet to tell me that I was curious about. Backstory on her, my father, them together, my childhood, my ancestors etc. Less about the actual loss of her as a mother or even a person in my life. 

Then Maddie asked about my dad. My dad recently has had a major shift of character and has come through for the first time in my life as a shadow of 20% of an actual father. Once again I thought I would feel particularly sad because of his character arc and the level of genuine love and care he's shown for me recently. And it would hurt a lot. Especially sting because of that but... Ultimately my biggest fear and thought would be losing what little financial security he offered. And the major opportunity in the future of taking over his company after getting my MBA and working under him for some years like we've set up. 

Maddie is never like this at all, but she rolled her eyes at me annoyed and said I sounded like an edgy teenager and I wasn't considering this clearly. She didn't believe me. But I'm not in the slightest worked up about them and I'm pretty damn good at picturing these things completely realistically. 

There's a reason though. I mean I'm not a complete monster. The problem is she wouldn't even feel like a mother dying to me. Someone who I love and care for sure. I would be deeply sad, but I wouldnt feel the anguish of losing a mother. I never even got a mother figure. My mum was an alcoholic who for the short period of time I lived with her I had to mother, provide and clean up after myself. My father isn't much better he left me to an actual psychopath of a step mum for my entire childhood while he was away on his business trips, well aware of a significant portion of what she was doing to me. And when he was home he was explosively abusive. (It wasn't torture but it fucked me up mentally with my own emotional regulation) They will never be able to be my parents in my head I could never internalise that even if I wanted to. They never became that figure in my life or even showed me what that could look like from the start.

I realised the absolute lack of desire or understanding of a parental figure a while ago when my sister was sobbing to me as a teenager telling me all she wanted was a mother figure. And I remember comforting her but thinking in my head that was downright stupid. Absolutely no empathy for that feeling myself, I had no desire or longing for a mother figure or father for that matter. My sister has much much better memory than me of early on in our lives. She was also in general treated much better so it makes sense that pain and longing was established for her.


The thing is I don't think my partner Maddie can extend me that empathy for my detachment because despite her parents horrible neglect and abuse of her, even surpassing mine (and mine is bat shit insane levels) especially her father jesus fucking christ. She still loves his ass. She still insists on seeing him, keeping an (admittedly very distant and ghosty) relationship with him. She still has forgiven and sees her mother truly as her mother, and a good one at that. The bar is in hell. I think her mother deserves to be forgiven for being a heroin abusing drug dealing addict because of her situation and trauma sure. But jesus christ her dad, he did absolutely unthinkable things to her. And he didn't even have the trauma to back it up. Even if according to her he stopped abusing meth and calmed the fuck down recently... 

Though hardly even really fucking true since she's worried about me repeatedly meeting him because he may get abusive or aggressive with her and of course I would defend her. And apparently her dad may try to start a fight with my ass if I set boundaries with him. (Just from the scenario of me warning him assertively and calmly that I'll take her back home and he won't see her for a while if he doesn't quit it and stabilise) He's 6'4 and over 30 but he's literally an emotionally stunted baby. Also if he hurt her I wouldn't be worried about fucking losing at all but the fact she has to worry about that says enough. This is turning into a completely off topic side vent my point is she is an incredibly forgiving person even for her bpd jealous bf of a dad. Her mum had a turn around so fair enough ig. And even though she had to parent her baby brother for her mother from a very young age, I think she was able to establish and connect with her at some point earlier on. It helps she has an incredibly good memory of her early childhood especially considering her trauma level. Maybe it's all rooted in that. I'd have to give it more thought why she is like this and what I lack. Other than her insane amount of emotional intelligence maturity and empathy of course. Maybe not so much with her attachment to her parents lol.

And she seems like despite all her shit she's made to be an amazing mother. She's so mature and calm and prepared and affectionate and intelligent and understanding ugh the list goes on. She's fucking set. I mean she's swamped on the kid side of tiktok and is far far down the path of studying psychology surrounding childhood development and parenting. She's very confident and has already set out very clearly how our kids will be properly supported and parented by us. I mean theres rules lol and I can't argue them she knows what she's talking about. We must undo our generational trauma and set them up for complete success. 

But I'm still nervous. So nervous. Especially after giving thought to and realising that revelation about my true feelings towards my parents and why. How can I be the dream dad I envision for myself when I never even had a glimpse of the real thing my entire life. There's no foundation not even subconscious. Never had any idea of what a parental figure even really was. She can help lead me a little and I have the passion and dedication to do this right but god I feel like in a deeper way to my core and maybe even developed character over time I'm just fucked in this regard. 

But I keep imagining myself in those golden retriever, goofy, adventurous, assertive rancher dad scenarios and I do truly think that's just me and I could nail it naturally (assuming I'm fully healthy which I wouldn't dare have children unless that was done for years first) 

Doesn't matter. Fucked inherently or not I'll try my absolute hardest and bring all the love, support and healthiness to my children that I was never given. 

I'm so awkward around kids too I get scared of them that doesn't help things. I gotta go practice with them a lot before.

56,"Looking for any advice about support in the UK, please help","So sorry for this being so long but I've got a lot to ask and get off my chest. For about a year I've known of BPD and from the start I've felt the symptoms explained really well the problems I'd had through childhood and teen years. I've never been good at identifying my feelings (some types of thought feel hard to reach, like theres a push back and everything gets more jumbled when i try) so it felt really validating. But I can't help worrying that I've always just wanted to feel special and now I'm assuming I have symptoms of a real disorder as an excuse for being a pathetic lazy person. As a result, I've avoided seeing a GP until now because I didn't know what I'd do if they didn't then validate me. But i got a couple counseling sessions from uni last summer (they can't diagnose). They helped me to realise how hurtful my parents attitudes had been (growing up lots of ""you're selfish/ungreatful"" ""you're lazy"" ""you're manipulative/spoiled"", "" why can't you be more like X"" ""or else"" ""don't say you're afraid of me or I'll...!"" recently I get "" you're naïve "") and that I drag myself down with self hate and that with my mam being suicidal for most of my childhood I felt like my needs weren't being met and I always had to prove my love to her or she'd die. For about a day after the sessions I was floating on a warm pillow of self love that helped motivate me. But it dissolved away, my GF broke up with me and I couldn't stand being around my parents back home for the summer (they pressured me to get a summer job, I didn't feel like I could handle it but couldn't refuse or I'm just taking their money). So I very suddenly moved back down to uni and isolated myself. This year has been a shit show. Impulsive drug taking has gone up, I go through patches of day drinking and feeling nothing and boredom to feeling so sad and isolated (life feels like a realistic film) to having narcissistic waves of mania, mainly when on a substance. I regularly can't stand to look at my reflection when I'm alone (looks like someone else scary looking back) and I do stupid shit like taking drinks from strangers in clubs fully aware that I'm probably being spiked or going to random music venues in areas of the city that I don't know with my weedguy. I haven't been able to keep up with uni, putting all work off until it was late and I'd have to take a 10% hit to any grade I got on them. I don't care. With about a day left to finish my dissertation I had nothing started and broke down. My mam picked me up the next day, that was last Monday and I now can't graduate with honors (as if I give a shit). Since then I've been having mood swings out the wazoo, apprehensive about doing anything and getting these sessions where my hate and distrust for my parents (who are loving and hurtful but not malicious) gets overwhelming. But its more like, I get angry at the world and everything is bad and then I feed my relationships through this hate machine and the only things I can remember about my family are the negatives (delusions as a child that my parents were plotting to murder me/read my thoughts, strangers were plotting to murder me, etc). Then I snap out of it, like when you splash a bath it gets crazy but quickly settles down and goes flat. After these episodes I can't remember what it felt like, I just know it was bad. For the past year having suspected BPD, I often check in on this sub but dont post and almost self medicate with the advice here and online which often helps (trying to remind myself that the average me doesn't agree with the extreme views and given some time I'll go back to baseline). I don't have a sense of identity past my name, body and memories which is maybe all we have but I feel so hollow most of the time. The part that resonated the most with me though is splitting which I think I've observed happening over and over during my life (I never knew why I suddenly hated people or stopped and started loving partners) and even this year I've gone from idolising a uni colleague for her prowess to hating her for her judmentality just because she rightly pointed out that I have been underperforming as a group. However she did confront me in front of the whole group which was the trigger that made me no longer trust her, now she's an outsider, probably working against me and I can only remember the events previous to the trigger that support this, not all the impressive and likeable memories of her. Anyway, I finally decided enough was enough and got an appointment at my GP, thinking that I could get some kind of mental health referral to a professional who could diagnose me (or worst case say I'm faking it but at least give some closure).  I told her everything here and more, including the fact I was sexually experimenting as a child with other children (when I was~4-6 yr old) which up until recently I thought was all consensual until I remembered a very old fuzzy memory of dodgy stuff with some older relatives of the kids my age. I told her how my suicidal thoughts have gone from intrusive at Christmas, to a consideration of a way out, to being afraid of the platform edge, to now knowing how I'd do it. I thought it was going well and she tried to reasure me that my delusions of her invalidating me would be unfounded, until we got to the end and she asked if I'd tried church, I was taken aback and said no, that its not my thing. She said ""that's a shame, not many young people in this area are willing to give it a go but it can be a good place to talk and find God"". Then she asked what I hoped to get out of this. I said I didn't understand the mental health service but I hoped I could get a diagnosis as I didn't feel general talking therapy worked and I'd like to have a target/explanation of why I feel these things. I was told she can't diagnose as a non specialist and when I asked if I could then see a specialist she just said no. So I asked what was wrong, to which I got "" well something deep is obviously wrong and it looks  you've got some depression in there too"". She also said that 'we' avoid giving diagnosises because there can be stigma, but in my experience here in the UK there is more stigma towards the undiagnosed as rhey seem less valid. Then she gave me a number to a public over the phone therapy service (Talking Change) and a website with general mental health self help leaflets. She also said back to me that I was clearly coping, a low suicide risk and that my family relationships were obvious still functional. I didn't know what to say so I just quietly left and got so angry on my bike ride home I didn't even feel going uphill. I feel let down, I'm no further in regards to improving and I have no more resources than what I was already using falsely to self medicate. In fact, I've now exhausted my last hope. I don't know where to go next and I feel so alone despite once again having a support network that claims to love me, so I'm posting here to ask for advice in the UK, what the process is, what I should think.

1,Finally stable. Heres how.,"For one, i'm on SSRI, so my depression doesnt go low, I just have bad moods.
I am working out regularly, which also has a stabilizing effect.
Trying to eat healthy.
And most importantly, I have a boyfriend who is very emotionally stable and predictable (never misses a good morning text even if we had an argument before), always replies to my texts when he has the chance, and I can respect him for who he is. He tries his best to be supportive but doesnt put up with dramatic behaviour and he made it pretty clear that drama wont work long term, so I had to cut it.
With boyfriends I didnt respect much, splitting was easy along the lines of devaluing. With narcissistic ones who were unpredictable and abusive I could split along those lines.
But now there is not much to split. Even if I split it isnt that bad.
This calmness is extremely strange, I need to learn to live in it, it is a bit boring even. Nice boring.

2,Some help here.,"

Can anybody help me. I am all alone. I am 31 yo Indian man.I feel stagnant in life. I have never been in a relationship and never will be. 
I have a family that has mental health issues. I got them from age 16. I know no one cares for this too but atleast some might gaze through.
I have no talent. I lived my life fighting what was diagnosed OCD and anxiety in the beginning and now after 15 years passing through psychotic diagnoses, has reached dependent traits hyper vigilant and now I conclude based on years long suffering and self redirections, and recent counseling that involved a psychometric test as a form of bpd known as quiet bpd. Now, before seeing my worthlessness right away for a relationship, I am not harmful like the other bpd types( even though they suffer much more and get no help from society), mine is not evident and hence took so long to find. 
Now, I have no purpose in life no self image, dependent, people pleasing( I hate myself for that, because world is so selfish when I look it through my bpd glasses.)I worked in different domains in a job I got and now I am a jack of all.
I hate myself.
I don't want this life. But I am not suicidal. I just want to walk away. Just avoid the trauma altogether. You know what on top of all this I took an snri a few years ago along with the high dose ssri(prescribed) without asking anyone or consulting, because I felt ( rn I am sure nobody will read it but there is a very small hope a little light, a fantasy rather. It's very painful to recollect it in a way that conveys my situation here).
So I took that snri because I felt so down and afraid of myself and my future as I stayed alone in the apartment and thought atleast I overcome that fear, because somehow I had to complete the integrated mtech that was the only way forward for me. I did all the work I could and somehow got out with some experience and the degree sponsored by the company.
In the end, here is the funny part, the snri complicated my condition. I have this frozen feeling with no emotions. I was in a constant fight or fright mode and it even affected my health. I started feeling zero hope in life. All I could do was sit on a bed and being I don't know just felt empty all the time. Actually I stopped feeling anything, let alone fear. No docs could help. Because I don't know how to relax. I am processing that stressed state in some other way
that I can't let go. I just start to panic when I feel stressed. I tried many relaxation techniques like emdr and eft and all that. I am now using CBD daily and it is helping my psychotic mind as well as slowly I am able to process the stuck energy.

2,Struggling with nightmares from the past.,"Throwaway account here.
So first a bit about us. You can skip to the question if you want.

My wife with BPD and i are together since 2008. We were at the tim 16 and 19 and did go through alm rough times together.
She got diagnosed at first with depression during our relationship and at the age of 18 with BPD and ADD. We did go to different therapist over the years. Some more usefull than others. She had for around one year a really creative one, who brought some ideas for her sleeping problems, but dropped out of the profession due pregnancy. She has now a therapist specialized on DBT. And she did some hughe improvements.


Question;

Now that she made hughe improvements in the last half of this year, but still struggles a lot with nightmares, where she falls back in her childhood, mixed with her current life.
We're now hoping to find something, that might her help with this. It really bothers her, since she feels like every progress she made, isn't there. In addition, she's not well rested.
Anyone had similar problems? If so, what helped you?

In one study, 70 percent of patients with treatment-resistant depression who were started on an oral antidepressant and intranasal esketamine improved, compared to just over half in the group that did not receive the medication (called the placebo group).

7,Help Navigating Help,"Howdy! Last year around October, I started counseling and medication again. I was in the tail end of a bad relationship and hadn’t had a job in months. Now, I’m single, live with super supportive friends, and have a job I’m extremely passionate about.

Unfortunately, I can’t really muster any of that passion. Since I began taking antidepressants in October, I have documented a severe decrease in my overall quality of life. This has also been documented on the app by both myself and my care team. I am on my 4th course of antidepressants this episode with only an increase in depression symptoms. I expressed this to my psychiatrist as well as my suggestion that I stop this course of meds, just to see if some of my symptoms decrease. There was some back and forth, and she called me aggressive (which was annoying because I’m just asserting myself, it’s my brain after all and no shit I’m irritable when I haven’t felt a positive emotion to my core in months). But I also understood because I was definitely channeling my anger to help me blow past my fawn response of compliance. Eventually, I explain that I had done some independent research and knew that other types of medications (anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics) could potentially be more useful. After that she backed off and was like, oh well if you need an anticonvulsant then we need to refer you to someone irl. To which I replied, I would rather be on the right course of meds than be on an online platform. In the end, we are trying new anxiety and sleep meds with no antidepressant (against the doc’s recommendation) for two months. If there’s no change, then she’ll recommend an antidepressant again. Ugh, the whole thing was really hard and I was shaking for most of it. I feel like my doc made it harder than it had to be though. Especially since I didn’t want to even begin the 4th course, at the end of the 3rd I said I wanted to stop antidepressants completely and was told to try again. 

Sorry, that was a lot, but I want to know how y’all go about recommending changes in your medications to your doctors and what you do when you meet resistance.

9,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

In an argument we had today, which started from a facetime call when I began to rant about some interpersonal troubles I was having with friends and then became embarrassed / felt like he didn't understand me and ended the call, he asked me whether I was trying to hurt him on purpose. I said no, I am trying to understand why someone so stable would stay with me(this is a continual issue I face, embedded in the fact that I don't see myself as healed yet and thus convince myself I'm undeserving of secure attachment). He has heard this before, and undoubtedly he will hear it again.

I asked him why he thought I was trying to hurt him, and how I could stop. 

He responded with the following, which I think pegged the issue pretty well.

We agreed we can both take space, as every phone call with him runs me into emotional overdrive and I'm left alone without any present comfort, but I really want to use this opportunity to explore my cognitive dysfunctions / dissonance so I can at least get a little bit better. I know recovery doesn't happen overnight, but I've been on this healing journey for long enough that regression makes me lose hope in the endgoal altogether.

I am seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow. I just took the whole summer to taper off of cymbalta and detox from adderall and really don't want to go back on antidepressants, but as I am about to enter my last year of university and work two jobs I know I need some medication; my current plan is to ask for adderall xr and rely on TM and yoga to cope with emotional instability, but I don't know if it will be enough. I also am no longer to see my last/only therapist, and am really hesitant to look for and begin with a new one as I've had such disheartening experiences in the past.

I would really, really appreciate any input or advice from anyone who has felt this way, dealt with similar issues, or just has some support or criticism to share.

21,"After having this med cocktail+not burdening myself, I am better. I was having a huge mental breakdown a year ago.","Forgive me if I have typo, I’m typing on my phone.

I was going crazy. Just crazy. I don’t even want to talk about it because it’s so shameful.
The breakdown was caused by lots of things, but major thing was school stress, alcohol, etc.

I got hospitalized again. 3rd time.
I was having a good calming 72 hours.
Later on I have realized I am an alcoholic. 

So I quit, I think at least 40% of my sanity comes from not drinking. I tried A.A in person and online plus networking, I personally didn’t like it.

Then my psychiatrist prescribed me Librium, I was on over than reg dose for anxiety -(reg dose that ppl take in google) 
I was being a zombie but I think it was worthy, I’m tired of laying down all day.

Since I was a zombie I decreased the dose, switched to klonopin since quantity is not available for some reasons in my area. 
I was on 1 mg, started SNRI -Pristiq. 
25mg once daily didn’t work.
50mg I felt difference after I started taking it for like more than 3 weeks.

As time goes on, I added weed (vaping and consuming medical weed) for tapering benzo+I like the effect. Makes me distracted when I am upset sometimes, when I need a calming time, morning time before my pharma med kicks in, before I go to bed.

I take only 0.25 of klpin twice daily.



So
-Antidepressant reg dose (everyone is different, Pristiq was my match)

-No alcohol (my emotional side gets crazy)

-Benzo(I don’t recommend it because of severe physical withdrawal, but it’s working well for my anxiety. Before I would be walking and looking back v often and thinking someone would attack me. I don’t have those thoughts unless someone gets super x2 close to me. 

-Medical mmj. Since I don’t like how potent flower smells it works. 
 I don’t recommend black market for vaping. Since I have been paying for my therapy out of pocket, I have 2sessions a month now. Used to have 3-4 sessions a month. 
Tbh now albeit I use about 3g of vaping mmj within in a month in a med mmj expensive City(half gram would cost me $65-75), I pay less for my mental health(it’s been 12 years, going to therapy, looking for right medication. I couldn’t handle dbt. I hated group sessions.)



I am far better than who I was exactly a year ago. I dropped out of school, I got a small job, talking to my parents, I don’t feel so miserable like before. I don’t want to kill myself for things that don’t matter. 

I feel like I am gifted. 
Even tho I have some struggles daily, ofc life is not a easy thing. My work place is stressful, min wage. But at least I can kill time with studying.
I’m just gonna get a certification.


I had 100,000 thoughts a day. Now I have 5000 thoughts and those are not suicidal.

3,Issues with my Husband and Parents,"Anyone here with a mom who worries about your problems more than you & that makes you worry more about her because you are guilty that you are responsible for these problems - now that she is worrying, you have to worry about the problem & also about her (more)? Thus, trapped in an anxious cycle.

I have come from a country where mental health is not taken seriously. So, when my Mom used to be extremely angry and frustrated, I was her source of venting out bearing the brunt as the elder child. When I was 3, she even suffered from Sinus Tachychardia that she visited a hospital and took anti depressants for a while. But she brushed all that aside without diagnosing properly. This happened back in 1990s.

Post her menopause, she became a better version of her self but even today she keeps getting anxious. She has fear of abandonment as well and therefore, I observed she only stays close to family and noone else. However, I had to fight with her for almost 3 years to get approval from her for my Inter-religion marriage. Being a BPD person, my fp was my lover. However, he has an avoidant attachment style and through the period, he made me feel unwanted.

After 5 years of relationship and 6 months of marriage, where he started blaming me everyday and saying that he has married me out of pity and that he is not happy with me, I acted on my impulse and developed a sexual relationship (for 2 months) that complicated my marriage. My husband came to know about it and now he claims that he trusted me with all his heart (immense gaslighting) and wants a divorce (sometimes I think its just an excluse to leave me - Because I have accepted his 10 year old affair when we were in relationship and he cheated on me thrice even after coming clean to me). I am not saying its tit for tat, but he didn't even listen to me once.

That being said, he is not living with me currently. While I am trying to make peace with my fp leaving me after a suicide attempt and 2 months of crippling anxiety, I have to now worry about my Mom because marriage is a big thing here and my parents will definitely not take my divorce concept well. On top of that, they will only keep blaming me for making a wrong decision. My mother being a perfectionist, always made me feel that I am not enough no matter how much I tried.

So, the abandonment by fp and the fear of confronting my parents as they negativiely criticise me (which is not the same for a BPD person as it spirals us into self-loathe), I am currently clueless. However, I am going through therapy and it is helping me a bit. I don't know if I should only think about myself now and focus on my own happiness as an individual and be called as a selfish human or instead give into the expectations of my parents and again fall in the cycle of borderline disability.

I also would like to mention that I talked about BPD to my husband and tried explaining him about what made me cheat on him (which is not right, I agree but I was feeling so emotionally unsafe at that point post my miscarriage with my husband), but all he did is tell everyone in my social circle that I am manipulating them into my perspective. I even got a professional assessment done and it confirmed that I am on the extreme range of BPD with a lot of depression, anxiety, petulance, impulsive and self-destruction. Not only that he said some very hurtful things to me like he is creeped to even look at me and that I am dead for him. All of these things stemmed out of his angst and his fear that I might not divorce him but it is always me reasoning out to his abuse (sometimes physical as well).

Not to mention, my husband has been jobless for many years now and I used to take care of him in the past 5 years. I beared all of his expenses and gave money for him to spend as well. I know it can be an act of selfishness but more than that he was my purpose. He was thing that kept me going through the day. Now, he says that I manipulated him into liking me by giving gifts and spending money on him which honestly wasn't the case. It was a mere act of showing affection. So, I am right now feeling very unloved and scared of both my parents and my husband.

7,Is weed a medicine for my emptiness or a crutch?,"When I realized I had BPD, it came as a relief to be able to give a name to the subtle wrong feeling I've always lived with: emptiness. Not quite depression, not quite anger. An absence of contentment and in it's place uncomfortable uncertainty. Waking up and my first thought of the day being ""did I do something wrong yesterday?"" 

I don't always feel this way. Sometimes, when things are going really well or I receive praise or have sex or good luck I feel all the good feelings. I enjoy these times but I no longer trust the feelings. They are a great natural high, probably the best high, and like all highs they don't last.

But I can bring the good feelings back anytime I want, with weed. Take me at my emptiest: give me some bad news on a day when I am already full of emptiness and I'll be a despondent mess, unable to smile, seeking isolation, crying and wanting to be asleep. I smoke some weed and voila, I'm back baby, all grins, improvised songs, making bids for the attention of my loved ones, giving back rubs, eventually falling into deep untroubled sleep in my bed, relaxed, comfortable as I've ever been.

""Why are you such a pothead"" I've been asked many times over the years and I've never known how to answer. Dunno, I like to get high I guess? ""Can you even go a day without your weed?"" ""Why do you have to be high all the time?"" These assholes questions throw shade, imply a weakness, a lack of self control, a tendency for escapism. I'm not weak, and I have decent self control. But yes, I do like to escape the goddamn emptiness because I want to live rather than cry.

The assholes have a point though. Weed has side effects that make it unsuitable for use all the time. If I use it during the day I become less productive and too inwardly focused, less interested in other people, happy but dumb. 

I have a busy life, a family and a job, volunteer work, home renos to do, appointments to get to, and I can't be dumb during the day when all my responsibilities need tending to. So years ago I settled on the routine of waiting until the evening to indulge. Although I may have felt emptiness during the busy day, I could always look forward to collapsing into comfort for an hour or two before a delicious sleep. 

It's not a perfect system because I still need to endure the emptiness throughout the day. And there are still side effects from the weed, like hazy memory, and difficulty waking up at 5:30am when I like to go to the gym.

And I also wonder if my regular weed use contributes to the emotional disregulation I feel as a person with BPD. Weed has been part of my life for so long, I can't clearly remember what I'm like without it.

So there are more than enough reasons to quit weed, at least for awhile. And I have tried to do this, many many times, and yet I keep coming back to it. 

The last time I took a break from weed was a few years back. The break was about three months long. I was proud of myself for being able to put it down and I even started to wonder why I used to do it every day. I felt a sense of freedom from having to go through the same rituals every day. 

The evenings were hard. I found myself craving some kind of special treat and ended up drinking alcohol more often. I found the best way to cope with evening emptiness was to throw myself into creative projects. As long as my hands were busy I was usually distracted from the emptiness until bedtime. I had to keep moving. I was more productive. I had a harder time sitting still.

Maybe one day some a pharmaceutical company will make a drug that contains the parts of weed that combat emptiness, without the side effects.

First here me out, the last 3 attempts I've had at smoking weed, has helped. But about 2-4 days afterwards my anger and emotions become insane. It takes afew weeks for it to subside.

I have been on this since February (almost 7 months) and I greatly believe it has helped with my suicidal thoughts as I do not experience these nearly as much as I did and I sometimes think if the benefits are that great but last year I genuinely cried daily, self harmed (haven't in 6 months+) and had attempted (also to do with stressful life situations). I was on 25mg, then 50 for a couple-few months but dropped back to 25mg as I don't think my body could handle it as I always felt sick. I was previously on sertraline which worsened my bpd mood swings but it also made me feel sick everyday so I don't know if medication is just a bit detrimental to me.

2,I have sex repulsion that’s been spreading even to being repulsed by romantic relationships after a traumatic breakup,"I was/am deeply in love with my first love. We’ve been broken up for almost a year now. I idealized them so much and they felt like a god to me at times. I’m demisexual so they were the first person I felt comfortably sexual with (all online, we never met in person thankfully) and I really felt like I gave myself to them and I would tell them that. They had a porn addiction and would cheat on me online and hide it from me, which led to huge suicidal breakdowns. I felt really violated and degraded from it but I couldn’t leave them. I have bad jealousy and passiveness issues to begin with and this fueled them, causing intrusive thoughts (I have a lot of pure ocd symptoms) and worsened my sex repulsion so much. They broke up with me but wanted to stay in contact as friends but they led me on that we’d get back together again (not on purpose). Months later I find out they are in their first in person relationship with someone and was hiding it from me bc they were scared of how I’d react bc of my bpd. I blocked them on everything after this. I now have this repulsion/phobia of romantic relationships. It makes me not want to see/talk to people in relationships. It’s just so triggering and causes jealousy and intrusive thoughts of my ex with their current partner. I feel so ashamed and pathetic from this. I feel scared and uncomfortable with people who have sex. I can’t even talk to my current DBT therapist about this partly bc she’s married. I’ve told her about my sex repulsion a bit. I don’t know how to fix this but I hate it and want to think normally. I’m on Prozac and am slowly increasing to 80mg which is the dosage for OCD. I want to try EMDR when I graduate DBT.

3,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

I'm nervous because I've been in a bad place for the majority of my life. Struggling with BPD, CPTSD, anxiety, and depression. I'm really hoping this is going to help me. As a teenager I tried Zoloft, Lexapro, lithium and then effexor, was on effexor until I was about 21, couldn't orgasm and switched to prozac, felt okay but felt shitty whenever I drank. Tried Wellbutrin but felt anxious and had intrusive thoughts and bad sleep. Tried trintellix but had a horrible stomach ache so gave up on meds all together until I started not sleeping and having constant shortness of breath in 2019 so I started taking Lexapro again, it worked for a while but I gained a ton of weight and I don't think it's helping me as much anymore. My psychiatrist prescribed me pristiq, I'll go down from 10mg of lexapro to 5 these next few days then quit cold turkey.

5,What works best for you?,"Hi all!

I have been on the long and exhausting journey of finding the right medication combo for the side effects of my BPD. I am also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder w/ Agoraphobia, and PTSD. But, I believe my Borderline is the biggest disruption, as it triggers all of my other disorders.

I have huge abandonment issues, causing me to feel like it's next to impossible to let go of people, ideas, irrational thoughts, etc.). My irritability is moderate. My depression is severe, it comes with suicidal ideations. Lastly, my anxiety is on and off, but when it's bad, it is debilitating.

I am currently on Prozac 20mg x1, Hydroxyzine 50mg x3, Clonidine .02mg x3, Trazodone 100mg x1, Zofran 4mg xAs needed, and Adderall 30mg XR x1.

I have tried numerous other medications, but my med management has been a mess since August 2020. I have been put on and taken off so many medications, I am not sure what has made things worse or helped out (even though, I don't feel like I have been stable since March 2020).

6,how to work on attachment,"Hi. I (20F) just got broken up with by my ex (22M) last night and have been NC. It's a very long story, but he ended things because of my behavior in the past few months being toxic and harmful. He said he loved me, he didn't want to do it, was ugly crying with me, but it was done anyway. Over the course of our nearly 8 month relationship, major life events happened, I lost sight, and he ended up becoming my Favorite Person unintentionally. 

I have been in bouts of crying, but I have been talking with many people and have a rocky plan for the foreseeable future. First, I have CBT and DBT in the next two days, and then on Wednesday I'm going to the doctor to switch my medication (cymbalta) to something else that will target mood swings. I am going to join a grief support group to manage the grief I felt these past couple months. I've written out the toxic attachments I developed and boundaries that we had at the beginning that fell away. 

I'm going to stay NC until Friday, wherein I'll reevaluate everything, but I don't know how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? I don't have these issues with anyone else in my life, only my romantic partner(s), and until the shit of life hit the fan, I was navigating my attachment very well. 

He is truly the love of my life, and we had so many things planned together. Everything was mapped out, and I was so secure with him. I believe when things went down that I used him too much for emotional reliance and we became a tad codependent. We are both anxious attachment, I think, and I have BPD whereas he does not. I do still love him, though, and I want to firstly work on my own issues for a while, but I do want to be with him again, if he'd try us out again.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? Or just any advice in general? 

edit: broke no contact. found out he and his sister are leaving town for a while, so I left him a voice-mail last night telling him to stay safe and that I miss him. said I love you. texted his sister a similar sentiment. the lack of response really feels like I just tore my own insides out, but I suppose that's the decision that's been made. I dont want to lose him, and I feel I already have

edit 2: talked to my dr. the medication I was on for my arthritis gave me psychosis, and my rheumatologist didn't check my mental history before prescribing them. I stopped those, started taking prozac instead of cymbalta, and started 3 omega-3 fish oils, 1 vitamin b1, and 2 magnesium glycinate. i had a phone call w his sister a few days ago and she said he isn't ready to talk yet but it was fairly amicable. sending a text tmrw for his birthday but haven't reached out. going to the psychiatrist in a few weeks to get mood stabilizers. ive done a lot of journaling, therapy, and talking and distracting. I know I can thrive without him and I don't NEED him to survive, but I do love him and he enhances my life. I want us to work out, but I'm not going to spam or go crazy w the contact. After the bday text, I'm not going to reach out, which is hard, but if it's meant to be he will come back.",1711942056.0,False,4,4,casineb,None,1bstfxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1bstfxm/how_to_work_on_attachment/
7,I don’t have a single long term friend,"Hey all, new here but not new to BPD. I’ve been in active DBT therapy for 6 years, hospitalised once for a month, and have been on 10 different medications (currently on Prozac and seroquel which serve me well for the most part)
For the last year I’ve been doing much better than I was before hospital. I’ve landed my dream job and my career is going exactly how I’ve always wanted. I’ve moved forward tremendously with being able to sustain professional relationships which was a problem for me in the past. I also have had a close group of female friends for the first time in many years, for the last year or two. However that has imploded a few times, due to my interpersonal issues and those of another girl in the group also. Most recently (a few days ago) it imploded again due to my closest friend saying she’d been talking to a guy I had liked and asking if she could date him. I was intensely hurt and expressed that. I didn’t completely explode the way I have in the past but I most definitely expressed I felt very hurt and it resulted in a massive rift and her wanting space. I feel caught between validating my feelings and wanting to keep people around (which means denying my feelings, often). 
I keep seeing people post on fb “happy birthday to my best friend of 20 years” or similar and it makes me incredibly sad. I’ve had many close friendships but they’ve all crashed and burned.

0,Some help here.,"

Can anybody help me. I am all alone. I am 31 yo Indian man.I feel stagnant in life. I have never been in a relationship and never will be. 
I have a family that has mental health issues. I got them from age 16. I know no one cares for this too but atleast some might gaze through.
I have no talent. I lived my life fighting what was diagnosed OCD and anxiety in the beginning and now after 15 years passing through psychotic diagnoses, has reached dependent traits hyper vigilant and now I conclude based on years long suffering and self redirections, and recent counseling that involved a psychometric test as a form of bpd known as quiet bpd. Now, before seeing my worthlessness right away for a relationship, I am not harmful like the other bpd types( even though they suffer much more and get no help from society), mine is not evident and hence took so long to find. 
Now, I have no purpose in life no self image, dependent, people pleasing( I hate myself for that, because world is so selfish when I look it through my bpd glasses.)I worked in different domains in a job I got and now I am a jack of all.
I hate myself.
I don't want this life. But I am not suicidal. I just want to walk away. Just avoid the trauma altogether. You know what on top of all this I took an snri a few years ago along with the high dose ssri(prescribed) without asking anyone or consulting, because I felt ( rn I am sure nobody will read it but there is a very small hope a little light, a fantasy rather. It's very painful to recollect it in a way that conveys my situation here).
So I took that snri because I felt so down and afraid of myself and my future as I stayed alone in the apartment and thought atleast I overcome that fear, because somehow I had to complete the integrated mtech that was the only way forward for me. I did all the work I could and somehow got out with some experience and the degree sponsored by the company.
In the end, here is the funny part, the snri complicated my condition. I have this frozen feeling with no emotions. I was in a constant fight or fright mode and it even affected my health. I started feeling zero hope in life. All I could do was sit on a bed and being I don't know just felt empty all the time. Actually I stopped feeling anything, let alone fear. No docs could help. Because I don't know how to relax. I am processing that stressed state in some other way
that I can't let go. I just start to panic when I feel stressed. I tried many relaxation techniques like emdr and eft and all that. I am now using CBD daily and it is helping my psychotic mind as well as slowly I am able to process the stuck energy.

2,"After having this med cocktail+not burdening myself, I am better. I was having a huge mental breakdown a year ago.","Forgive me if I have typo, I’m typing on my phone.

I was going crazy. Just crazy. I don’t even want to talk about it because it’s so shameful.
The breakdown was caused by lots of things, but major thing was school stress, alcohol, etc.

I got hospitalized again. 3rd time.
I was having a good calming 72 hours.
Later on I have realized I am an alcoholic. 

So I quit, I think at least 40% of my sanity comes from not drinking. I tried A.A in person and online plus networking, I personally didn’t like it.

Then my psychiatrist prescribed me Librium, I was on over than reg dose for anxiety -(reg dose that ppl take in google) 
I was being a zombie but I think it was worthy, I’m tired of laying down all day.

Since I was a zombie I decreased the dose, switched to klonopin since quantity is not available for some reasons in my area. 
I was on 1 mg, started SNRI -Pristiq. 
25mg once daily didn’t work.
50mg I felt difference after I started taking it for like more than 3 weeks.

As time goes on, I added weed (vaping and consuming medical weed) for tapering benzo+I like the effect. Makes me distracted when I am upset sometimes, when I need a calming time, morning time before my pharma med kicks in, before I go to bed.

I take only 0.25 of klpin twice daily.



So
-Antidepressant reg dose (everyone is different, Pristiq was my match)

-No alcohol (my emotional side gets crazy)

-Benzo(I don’t recommend it because of severe physical withdrawal, but it’s working well for my anxiety. Before I would be walking and looking back v often and thinking someone would attack me. I don’t have those thoughts unless someone gets super x2 close to me. 

-Medical mmj. Since I don’t like how potent flower smells it works. 
 I don’t recommend black market for vaping. Since I have been paying for my therapy out of pocket, I have 2sessions a month now. Used to have 3-4 sessions a month. 
Tbh now albeit I use about 3g of vaping mmj within in a month in a med mmj expensive City(half gram would cost me $65-75), I pay less for my mental health(it’s been 12 years, going to therapy, looking for right medication. I couldn’t handle dbt. I hated group sessions.)



I am far better than who I was exactly a year ago. I dropped out of school, I got a small job, talking to my parents, I don’t feel so miserable like before. I don’t want to kill myself for things that don’t matter. 

I feel like I am gifted. 
Even tho I have some struggles daily, ofc life is not a easy thing. My work place is stressful, min wage. But at least I can kill time with studying.
I’m just gonna get a certification.


I had 100,000 thoughts a day. Now I have 5000 thoughts and those are not suicidal.

0,BPD & ADHD,"Hi guys :)

I (27f) was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 9. My parents didn't really believe in therapy so they kinda forgot about it, never did anything with it, and haven't told me about this diagnosis until a few years back. I've been diagnosed with BPD for 10 years. I mentioned the ADHD thing to my psychiatrist but never really focused on those symptoms as I've always been more preoccupied with the BPD symptoms.

Now, I know that ADHD could be mistaken for BPD and the other way around, but I definitely have BPD, so let's not get into that.

**I wanna ask those of you who have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD if you're taking** (or were in the past) **any medication for it? How did it work with the medication prescribed for BPD** (yes, I know BPD can't be treated with medication alone, but again - let's not go there)**? Did it make your life easier on the BPD side of things too? And in general, did it make your life easier?**

I'm tired of having to work/study twice as hard as people around me to achieve the same results. Among other things. But this is my main issue atm.

If that makes any difference, I take Effexor (venlafaxine) and trazodone.

2,There is hope.,"I have no formal diagnosis but I firmly believe that I once had BPD. I used fit the criteria to a T. I'm writing this in hope that I can help others, give others hope and maybe inspire some of you. 

First, background, as it's all relevant. 

I had an unstable childhood, lots of trauma and abuse. I was thrown out at 15 and had to pretty much fend for myself. From the ages of 15 to 27 I lived a hugely chaotic life, moving from place to place and unable to hold down a job, relationship or anything meaningful. 
I was abusive in all my previous relationships, never physical, but emotional. I would lash out at the most minor inconvenience, I was angry and aggressive and I create an environment whereby all those around me felt as though they were walking on eggshells. I had the most poisonous tongue known to man and I'd hit people exactly where I knew it would hurt. I was never satisfied. I always wanted and expected far too much from those around me and when I felt I hadn't gotten what I deserve, I would attack with words and empty threats. I would threaten partners with leaving them. I would tell partners they were meaningless to me, I'd tell them I didn't love them, nor did I want them around. I would cause arguments with people literally every day of my life. I would ruin outings and social events. I used suicide as a threat and as a means of control. I don't believe, during these years, I had the mental capacity, or genuine desire to better my behaviour. Luckily for me I have a fantastic group of friends who have stood by me, regardless of all my faults, and regardless of pain I have caused them. 

Fast forward to my 26th year and I decided I needed to change. For me, there was no big event that led to this, it was a decision I made based on how I felt my life and relationships would turn out if I continued as I was. I wanted to be a better person and rectify my wrongdoings as much as is possible. I began reading self-help books and researched BPD. I was later diagnosed with ADHD, severe depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Eventually, after months of trying medicines, I was put on Venlafaxine. This was both a blessing and a curse. My moods became stable, I had better emotional regulation and I had no desire to hurt those around me, no matter how upset I became. Alas, this came with conditions: My sex drive is constantly low and I have to actively work on this, although able to understand emotion, I feel very little emotion and my passion for life and my previous interests has dissipated. It's a sacrifice I choose to make because I want to be a good person.
Since taking meds I have invested countless hours reading and educating myself on neuropsychology, BPD, trauma, neuroplasticity, anything I felt may help me to better understand my behaviours, and various literature, both academic and otherwise, regarding changing responses and behaviours. 

It's been a long road and it isn't over. I still slip up every now and again but I am so much healthier and better able to handle emotional situations. I am emotionally available, discussing feelings and thoughts with those in my life. I take my meds as I am supposed to. I rarely react with anger. I ask others opinions before I respond, so as to guage whether or not my feelings/reactions are in line with the situation. I NEVER call anyone names in malice. I listen before I jump to conclusions and I try to think with logic and reason at all times. I am now an asset to the people around me. 

I attribute my progress to a few things; education and understanding my conditions, discussing, with everyone in my life, all the negative things I had done and taking ownership of the damage I caused... This was paramount; taking Venlafaxine, for me this is a wonder drug, although please bear in mind that what works for one of us may not work for you; and taking LSD in a therapeutic environment, engineered for self reflection. 

I wanted to change so very much that I actively make it happen. It was my decisions alone that have led me to recovery and I cannot stress enough that recovery is only accessible to those who see the damage they cause, see the hurt and chaos, and then act alone (without need for encouragement from others) to better themselves. 

I still need therapy and I will continue to work on my flaws. I may have to do this for the duration of my life. I still suffer with the invasive thoughts. The evil remarks and hurtful comments still enter my head, but now I can observe these thoughts and I choose to act with compassion and understanding over anger and frustration. There is a better way. 

TL;DR Was an ar*sehole, sought meds and education. Now much better for it. LSD for a mind reset and discussions with everyone in my life led me to take ownership of my behaviours. Not an ar*sehole anymore.",1583850127.0,False,10,13,kitamajita,None,fgek26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fgek26/there_is_hope/
0,BPD & ADHD,"Hi guys :)

I (27f) was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 9. My parents didn't really believe in therapy so they kinda forgot about it, never did anything with it, and haven't told me about this diagnosis until a few years back. I've been diagnosed with BPD for 10 years. I mentioned the ADHD thing to my psychiatrist but never really focused on those symptoms as I've always been more preoccupied with the BPD symptoms.

Now, I know that ADHD could be mistaken for BPD and the other way around, but I definitely have BPD, so let's not get into that.

**I wanna ask those of you who have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD if you're taking** (or were in the past) **any medication for it? How did it work with the medication prescribed for BPD** (yes, I know BPD can't be treated with medication alone, but again - let's not go there)**? Did it make your life easier on the BPD side of things too? And in general, did it make your life easier?**

I'm tired of having to work/study twice as hard as people around me to achieve the same results. Among other things. But this is my main issue atm.

If that makes any difference, I take Effexor (venlafaxine) and trazodone.

Tried trintellix but had a horrible stomach ache so gave up on meds all together until I started not sleeping and having constant shortness of breath in 2019 so I started taking Lexapro again, it worked for a while but I gained a ton of weight and I don't think it's helping me as much anymore.

6,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

7,"Lonely, clingy, emotionally promiscuous, hopeless case","TW: domestic violence

Not sure why I am writing this. I am 21. And I am losing hope. My borderline patterns started at 12. And they keep getting worse and more complicated with time. Never been in proper therapy. I was not compliant. Never found a good therapist. Was just heavily medicated with antipsychotics. But my patterns? Worse and worse with time. Dad died at 18. No financial stability and abuse at home of all kinds. Writing this post outside of my family house where my brother broke my nose. 

Just following with a convenient psychiatrist for the time. But no real change. Just staying afloat. CBT doesn’t work.

I am lonely. I do not fit in. People mostly bullied me for being autistic. In teen years and adulthood, I was sometimes repulsive. I lost my elementary school friends. I traveled and didn’t contact them for a decade. I don’t make real friends . I just act like a clown and mask. Or trauma dump.

Was stuck in a toxic FP situation for 3 years. Took my emotions and energy and complicated things. Much older person (3 times my age) and was pretty much groomed at 18. Finally left him . I was clingy desperate for a toxic person.

But I am always emotionally promiscuous anyway. Any guy shows the slightest bit of attention, I run into his arms regardless of red flags.

Epileptic and chronically ill. Health not stable.

Unfortunately, I can’t really muster any of that passion. Since I began taking antidepressants in October, I have documented a severe decrease in my overall quality of life. This has also been documented on the app by both myself and my care team. I am on my 4th course of antidepressants this episode with only an increase in depression symptoms. I expressed this to my psychiatrist as well as my suggestion that I stop this course of meds, just to see if some of my symptoms decrease. There was some back and forth, and she called me aggressive (which was annoying because I’m just asserting myself, it’s my brain after all and no shit I’m irritable when I haven’t felt a positive emotion to my core in months). But I also understood because I was definitely channeling my anger to help me blow past my fawn response of compliance. Eventually, I explain that I had done some independent research and knew that other types of medications (anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics) could potentially be more useful. After that she backed off and was like, oh well if you need an anticonvulsant then we need to refer you to someone irl. To which I replied, I would rather be on the right course of meds than be on an online platform. In the end, we are trying new anxiety and sleep meds with no antidepressant (against the doc’s recommendation) for two months. If there’s no change, then she’ll recommend an antidepressant again. Ugh, the whole thing was really hard and I was shaking for most of it. I feel like my doc made it harder than it had to be though. Especially since I didn’t want to even begin the 4th course, at the end of the 3rd I said I wanted to stop antidepressants completely and was told to try again.

I’ve been extremely emotional and moody since coming off of seroquel and I’m super sensitive because of EMDR. 

Since quitting cigarettes I feel like I’m smoking waaaaaay more weed because it gives me something to do. Plus I JUST got my MMJ card so I’m like binging on it all. 

I’m relying way too much on my partner to fill my boredom. 

I’m avoiding packing and I’m moving in two weeks. It’s stressing me out because I’ve only moved from my bedroom at my parents to my dorms and then to this apartment. I have so much more stuff now and it’s overwhelming. 

 I can’t handle my money for shit and idk I won’t have any money to do anything fun for the next two months - my whole vacation (I’m working as close to 40 hours as I can but I’m a teacher so my summer job does not pay as much and I haven’t saved money because as mentioned before, I suck at money) - and it’s really bumming me out.

7,"I love my GP (it got long, sorry)","So I've been having a bad BPD style relapse over the last month or so. But now that I'm more of a quiet borderline girl it's a slow spiral into hell.

So I went and saw my GP last week (yay me, waited until crisis point) and she stuck my back on Seroquel for a month just to stop my head racing all the damn time. Seriously, my anxiety was so out of control that my brain was almost turning itself off. I was convinced I was losing my mind because I just became so fucking dumb. Losing words, getting lost, forgetting things the second I heard them.

I voiced the fact that after being off Seroquel for 3 years it felt like I was failing by going back on them. She made me stop and listen. She said that it's no different to someone with asthma who's had it under control for years. Sometimes there will be some trigger that nobody can predict or see coming, so they add in extra help (medication) until it's passed and then go back to their usual routine.

She heard me, validated me and reassured me.

I went back yesterday for a follow up (I'm 100 times better than I was, love Seroquel) and we got to talking about the nature of BPD. I'm her most managed borderline patient so she can often get a different perspective from me. 

I told her my theory that we don't necessarily grow out of the BPD traits and behaviours, that I think we just learn to turn them inwards instead. I know I'd rather take it out on myself than others like I used to. I told her that even with all the therapy my thinking patterns are the same, I just have that filter between thoughts and actions that usually works really well.

I also told her how I've learnt the biggest reason behind BPD behaviours is control. Lack of, needing. I've always been at my worst when my emotions (and therefore my life) were out of control. So I'd do ANYTHING to feel like I had some kind of control. So, manipulation, SH, disordered eating, risky behaviours, impulsive behaviours. All of it, for me, was about control. That obsessive need for control.

She took notes. She's going to talk to her colleagues about it and see if they've had other patients voice the same kind of thing. And I know she's not patronising me.

10,How do I get some sort of personality back?,"About a year ago I fell into a depressive hole. I used to be creative, I used to actually do things. I used to want to buy things for myself. I used to spend most of my life listening to music.
This whole year i have done nothing but lay in my bed in my spare time and watch things, scroll through reddit and it’s funny because 90% of the things I’m reading and watching are about mental health and I haven’t even gotten anywhere from it. If anything iv gotten a lot worse because now i am hyper aware and paranoid. 
I feel lifeless like I have zero personality, zero hobbies, zero will to do anything but lay in my bed. How is it possible that I don’t even want to listen to music anymore.
When I see others with mental illness i see people that still have a personality, they still do things that make them who they are, whether it be art, collecting things whatever it may be. Fuck I do nothing and don’t even have the urge to anymore. I don’t feel rewarded from a hard day of work, I feel nothing from anything
What on earth is causing this? Was it my previous Seroquel use? Do I have brain damage? Maybe it’s because iv sectioned myself off from people and have been isolated for so long that I am now unable to leech personality and mould myself for others. Is there any type of scan or test I can get done to determine imbalances and what not?

12,What works best for you?,"Hi all!

I have been on the long and exhausting journey of finding the right medication combo for the side effects of my BPD. I am also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder w/ Agoraphobia, and PTSD. But, I believe my Borderline is the biggest disruption, as it triggers all of my other disorders.

I have huge abandonment issues, causing me to feel like it's next to impossible to let go of people, ideas, irrational thoughts, etc.). My irritability is moderate. My depression is severe, it comes with suicidal ideations. Lastly, my anxiety is on and off, but when it's bad, it is debilitating.

I am currently on Prozac 20mg x1, Hydroxyzine 50mg x3, Clonidine .02mg x3, Trazodone 100mg x1, Zofran 4mg xAs needed, and Adderall 30mg XR x1.

I have tried numerous other medications, but my med management has been a mess since August 2020. I have been put on and taken off so many medications, I am not sure what has made things worse or helped out (even though, I don't feel like I have been stable since March 2020).

13,~Triggers probably~ trying not to act out for attention,"I'm so starving for attention in my relationship that my emotional mind is telling me all the things I should be trying to get it. I have a box full of my medications that would get some attention if I gave in to my urges. 

I've been struggling with an undiagnosed chronic illness for 12 months. I had to give up my much loved job because of it, the thing that gave me my own identity.

I feel like the person I was has died.

And all my partner of 8 years can do is remind me the reasons why she resents me right now. Of all the reasons I'm the issue in our relationship. Of how frustrated she is that I'm not working. I get a disability allowance, I have for 15 years so I am contributing financially to this family. But it's not enough.

Today I find out that I'm not ""sick enough"" for the specialist to want to see me until February. I'm fucking devastated. Told my partner. No reply. Nothing. No discussion. No sympathy. Nothing.

So I'm all sliced up again. Was clean for 2 weeks. Fighting so hard not to do those things I want to do to get attention. From someone. Anyone. 

Back to my GP on Tuesday. She's insisting on seeing me fortnightly right now, after my meltdown 2 weeks ago over much the same thing.

Why am I 15 emotionally again? I'm 34 for fuck sake.

16,Skills for dealing with intense emotion,"I posted this in the regular BPD sub but had zero responses and I'm feeling desperate and alone. I'm hoping that I'll have more luck here. The situation: I'm in my second week of inpatient ED treatment and I've never felt so emotionally disregulated IN. MY. LIFE.

I have (quiet) BPD, and my emotions are UNBEARABLE lately, especially since I don't have access to my unhealthy coping mechanisms (food restriction, substance abuse and self-harm) OR a one-on-one therapist. I just feel like I'm going to go nuts if I don't figure out skills that actually help. They're not teaching us formal DBT (the handouts are ""inspired by"" Linehan's DBT sheets) and this isn't going to change so I need to find some alternatives. My biggest struggle rn is whether I'm ""sick enough"" or that things were ""serious enough"" to warrant me being here, and I've been looking up narrative therapy because I'm a writer and feel like this could help give me perspective. Does anyone have experience with this? Or can link me to some reliable resources? Are there any other skills other than TIP and accepts?

On top of all this my mum's been sending me nasty texts about how I'm not trying hard enough, that taking PRNs like Ativan and Seroquel are a cop out and that I have skills and that I'm ""choosing"" not to use them. I just feel so invalidated by her and the psychiatrist I deal with here is gaslighting. I won't even go in to what he's said to me but ultimately I need to learn how to validate myself and not depend on others for that validation. Any tips on how I can learn this? I'm so desperate, I'm ready to drop out of this program if things don't get better... they won't take my intense emotions seriously and I suspect they're stigmatizing due to the BPD diagnosis, but I have no proof of that and I don't want to play the victim so take that with a grain of salt.

For the last year I’ve been doing much better than I was before hospital. I’ve landed my dream job and my career is going exactly how I’ve always wanted. I’ve moved forward tremendously with being able to sustain professional relationships which was a problem for me in the past. I also have had a close group of female friends for the first time in many years, for the last year or two. However that has imploded a few times, due to my interpersonal issues and those of another girl in the group also. Most recently (a few days ago) it imploded again due to my closest friend saying she’d been talking to a guy I had liked and asking if she could date him. I was intensely hurt and expressed that. I didn’t completely explode the way I have in the past but I most definitely expressed I felt very hurt and it resulted in a massive rift and her wanting space. I feel caught between validating my feelings and wanting to keep people around (which means denying my feelings, often).

A voice in my head whispering premonitions of imminent catastrophe. 'You're going to fail, you're going to fail! You can't do this! Give up and go kill yourself! They'll never accept you! You'll never succeed! If you try, your life will be awful! Give up give up give up!'

It's not just even the voice. My stomach feels like it's going to flip over, my heart feels light and I feel dizzy. Like how you feel if you're scared of heights and you're looking down 19 floors. Is it anxiety? Self-hatred? Whatever it is, it leaves me more stressed than the task itself ever could!

I don't know how to stop it. I can't calm down, it's always so bad. The only thing that's ever helped is self-harm because the pain is distracting, but sometimes that doesn't work either.

Well of course a few days later I looked it up! And I was definitely shaken after learning more about it, in like a “wow how could I not have known all this about myself before” kind of way. So maybe a couple days later the dysphoria wore off and I began to accept it as a possibility. What’s another diagnosis, anyway? 

Fast forward to today, like I said we still haven’t got into anything too deep yet. I was telling her about how my mbti has changed three times over my adulthood I’m 35f. (I went from INTJ to INFP to now INFJ) And as I was explaining all this she started sinking in her chair and started looking at me like in a quiet terror kind of way. Like she was looking at a serial killer. I stoped my train of thought and asked her point blank “why are you looking at me that way?” And she straightened out and said she was just listening. And we continued the session as usual. 

But as I was driving away after I was feeling really unsettled to have caused that reaction. Then I was thinking about maybe I was being manipulative by telling her that, and part of me wanted to know her reaction. But I had been thinking about going over that for weeks and kind of wanted to nerd out about why my mbti changed so much. And I just came home feeling really tense and unsettled about the whole thing. So here I am, I guess. Thoughts? 

Sometimes I just feel like I have a huge blind spot. Like I can see so many angles on things but I just don’t get how people perceive me sometimes. And that seriously bothers me. Like I don’t realize how much I affect people or something.

1,"New Therapist, New Perspective","I started with a new therapist yesterday and she offered a perspective I hadn’t heard before. I was talking about wanting to learn skills to cope with the emptiness and build more self-love. The therapist likened BPD to being a reptile that cannot produce their own warmth and need outside sources to feel less empty. They proposed that it is a possibility I will never get rid of the empty feeling or really feel true self-love, but rather eventually curate healthy outside sources (not from FP) that can “spark embers within.” This outlook is both incredibly depressing and refreshing at the same time. I’ve been looking for a cure or a fix for so long and it is exhausting.

9,issues with therapist,"short backstory: I searched for the right therapist for about 2 years, went through 10+ professionals before I started therapy in January 2022 with a new therapist. I was seeking help for codependency in my relationship and suspected I had BPD. My therapist did an assessment and quickly diagnosed me. I saw her for 8 months and right away she was my favorite therapist I’ve ever had. We both cried on my last session. She moved on to a different job, but I would have seen her for years if I could have. She referred me to the therapist that I’ve been seeing for 4.5 months.

now onto the post: My therapist has a specific style. She doesn’t express very much emotion during our sessions, she does a great job of listening and piping in when I need help, but she puts up a wall and I don’t feel like I’ve really connected with her. Maybe it’s because I’m coming from my last therapist who I connected with right away, but I often leave my current therapist thinking that I don’t even know if she likes me as a person or if she wants to talk to me at all; or if she gets annoyed by the things I say. Some sessions it helps me immensely and I feel great afterward, others not. I guess I’m just looking for if anyone else has dealt with this and some advice… I don’t want to start the search for another therapist again, I don’t think that’s the real problem.

Mind you my therapist had already met and spoken to my ex a few times about me before. So my therapist became OUR therapist and I was kinda ok with it. But I started seeing how my ex was having a better relationship with them in just a few months than I’ve ever had in the whole time I’ve been in therapy with them. Now lately I feel like my therapist doesn’t like me as much as she likes my ex, and I deeply feel as if they wanted me to abandon all hope of ever getting back in a relationship with my ex (tricky story but we still love each other very much) because the main reason my ex needed to go to therapy was bc of me, and I know I make his life a little hard sometimes with my BPD. I’ve been meaning to look for another therapist but hate that I have to go through the whole process of meeting someone new and the whole thing makes me mad sometimes.

2) I cut and self-harm in various ways (pulling my hair, hitting myself, digging my nails into my skin, taking too many pills not to kill myself but because I don't care etc.), but it doesn't count because the criteria is about self-mutilation (scars all over the body) and not self-harming.

12,Should I continue with this therapist?,"
Hello, guys! I am attending scheme therapy, and for the most part we’ve been doing a simple version of the Recognizing your emotions worksheet from the DBT workbook (what happened, when, how did it make you feel etc.). It happened a few times that the therapist interrupted me in the middle of my sentence/ chain of thought, and today I finally asked them if I could finish my sentence (bc unspoken words leave me with a weird feeling in my chest), and they said they interrupted me because I wanted to prove with a negative past experience why something is not possible, instead of focusing on the future outcome, when in fact I just wanted to mention another maladaptive pattern of mine, and it wasn’t obvious to me they already knew that, they could tell. 

When we explore a maladaptive scheme, I think I feel the need to justify it, to explain my reasons behind my actions, why I feel the way I do, and they called this arguing, because when they say it’s a maladaptive thought, they expect me to accept it right away, and move on. It kinda terrifies me that my brain is so rigid, and that I didn’t see a problem with my response, cause they are right, I am there because I need to change my approach to certain situations, and they no something that I don’t, but it feels impossible to me to just accept what they say without going into detailed explanations. And they stop me, because they know and understand how I feel, and it’s not important, we need to change the scheme,  I might be dumb, but it’s not obvious to me that the other person know what I feel, so I don’t try to argue, I just try to paint the whole picture of my interior world. How could I make my brain more flexible?

I think this therapy could work, because it’s so different from what I am used (overanalyzing every emotion and situation, and constantly trying to find the root of everything), and my way didn’t take me far, so I thought this “action taking” approach could actually help. But my therapist said we might not be compatible, if I question everything, and don’t trust their knowledge, and they like to move faster, we should have achieved something by now, instead of going over my same emotions.

Now I have this weird feeling inside me, like I hesitate to talk about stuff.

After a few moments, she came to sit next to me on the couch.  She asked me if she could touch my shoulder.  I nodded yes, ever so little that I didn't think she would see it.  But she did and so she put her hand on my shoulder and said I am here with you.  At that moment, I fell over into her lap and started bawling.  She didn't really do anything other than keep a hand on my shoulder and at times saying she was there with me, I wasn't alone, she wasn't going anywhere and to take the time I needed.

16,My therapist questioned her own diagnosis,"Hi everyone!
I've been in therapy doing DBT for over 4 years. I first went to that therapist in 2018 and she pretty quickly (2 months/3 appointments) diagnosed me with BPD. To me it made a lot of sense and helped me understand myself better, and DBT has worked wonders throughout the years, with ups and downs of course. But still I have changed enormously so much so that my therapist told me a few months ago that she thought I didn't meet the criteria for diagnosis anymore.
I still struggle with BPD, and sometimes it gets frustrating that I'm not ""completely normal"" (i know, no one is) and can feel awfully intense things even though I'm managing to not let them impact my life negatively anymore. I was talking about this with my therapist at our last appointment and she reassured me that to her, I was still making progress.

I've tried to not give it too much thought but!!! It's very hard not to have an existential crisis over this. I've already had an ex partner (ADHD+autism) who told me numerous times that they thought I wasn't BPD but rather autistic etc. The fact that even my therapist would come to question my diagnosis makes me really anxious and sad, like I could lose a part of myself.

The therapist noticed that much and told me that's something I need to work with, but honestly, I am just growing tired of not being able to express week after week what's in me. I carefully consider what I want to play and then comes somebody who just feels down and boom, they get to play. And during the last session when somebody commented that it gets harder and harder for eveyone to play (because so many ppl want to play) the therapist said that the group members subconsciously feel who needs it the most and make their choice, which increased my anger tenfold. It made me outright furious! What a bs if you ask me. The group chooses according to who has the most relatable story, the same way people help puppies over the homeless, because puppies are cuter. The squeaky wheel gets greased, as the saying goes... of course, I don't cry or look shattered during the sessions, but what they don't see is that I spend every day alone, sleep too much, sometimes drink and have frequent suicidal thoughts.

I used to think I didn’t even *have* any trauma, so this has been very unsettling for me. I’ve just been trying to accept that it happened and grieve for myself as the little girl it happened to.

I know I need to talk to my therapist about all of it, but I’ve been putting it off for weeks because my job was so stressful. I wanted to wait until summer break when I had as much time to myself as possible to have a breakdown if it came to that. 

But now it’s summer break, my appointment is tomorrow, and I’m absolutely terrified. I don’t want to talk about it at all with anyone ever. I know that I need to, but the thought is excruciating.

Part of this stems from the fact that I don’t know what will happen. Do DBT therapists usually work with trauma? I think the scariest thing would be if she told me I must be misremembering or trying to victimize myself and that it likely never even happened. (To be clear, I have a wonderful therapist who has never said anything like this to me and has *always* validated how I’m feeling.)

27,My DBT therapist gave me the greatest compliment I could ever ask for.,"A little background: I started DBT in February of 2018. I completed the year long course and decided I wanted to do another 6 months of DBT. I started the other 6 months in October of 2019. I am schedule for my final session of the group portion of DBT on Monday.  

Even though the world is in chaos, I am fortunate to still be able to meet with my therapist via video appointments. At my individual appointment today, she mentioned that if I want to, I can attend Monday’s video appointment as my last DBT group session. 

We where talking about the use of DBT skills in everyday life. She told me that she is 100% comfortable with me graduating DBT. She said if she wasn’t, she would suggest I do another month. She said that where I am now in my life compared to where I was 2 years ago is a huge improvement. She said that everything that has happened in my life this last year and all the decisions I’ve made shows how truly far I have come. 

She talked about how I’ve become mindful of things in my life which has lead me to become more self-aware (the main thing that I became self-aware of was how bad my drinking had become), that I no longer use mind alternating substances, I’m repairing/handling my interpersonal relationships in a different way, I’m actively involved in my sons life, I’ve gone back to school and I’m actively using the skills in my every day life not just talking about using them. She told me to be proud of everything I’ve accomplished. 

With all that being said, I want to say if your struggling, don’t give up hope.  If you don’t think there’s time for you change the way things in your life, there is. I wasn’t diagnosed till I was 30. I didn’t start DBT till I was 33.

28,TMS therapy for BPD?," Hi!

I am 22m, diagnosed with BPD. I have tried so many things, been constantly diagnosed and rediagnosed. I've seen therapists, homeopathic therapists, psychologists, and completed an intensive outpatient therapy program. I have tried CBT, DBT, talk therapy, EMDR, and group therapy. I recently started with a new therapist with a mental health treatment system. My responses during our intake session tagged me as a potential candidate for TMS.

I haven't seen much about TMS for BPD and was hoping to hear from folks who have BPD and tried TMS. I have three therapists right now (two individual and a group facilitator), and have talked to the group facilitator and the new therapist, and they didn't have a lot of info for me. I'm going to talk to the other therapist, who I've been seeing for years, and hear his thoughts, as well as talk to the TMS therapist, but I would really like first-hand accounts if I can get them.",1703880646.0,False,2,10,worthlessinsum,None,18tw66e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18tw66e/tms_therapy_for_bpd/

38,My friend with bpd seems to hate me,"My friend was recently diagnosed with bpd, she’s also recently divorced. We got super close after her divorce even had something sexual for a time after. She would call and text me all the time, call me venting about life and I’d just listen. This went on for almost a year, we became extremely close spent most weekends together and she would always either ask to hangout, or be down to do something. Recently over the last month things have changed. In June she found out that her ex husband had moved on and found a new girlfriend. She called me crying and wanting to hurt herself. I talked her out of it and went over cuddled her until she fell asleep and then I left. Since then she has started changing, she seems annoyed to be around me, if I ask what’s wrong she flips out, she’s kicked me out of her house twice for trying to hold her while she’s upset. She admitted to me about a month ago that she and her ex husband and her never stopped sleeping together, that they had only been living apart. I asked why she kept it a secret she said she didn’t want to lose me. She then admitted that two weeks after seeing the exs new girlfriend she started talking to a guy she met on a site. They in just a month they are talking all day, have been on 8 dates, FaceTime at least three times a week, and they are going on weekend away trips. She’s rescheduling her kids and other friends to make sure she can squeeze him in, all while complaining she has not time for anything. I told her therapy is something to look into. She got herself set up and started going. I went with her to her first session and after the therapist asked if I was aware that she showed traits of bpd. I asked what it was and the therapist explained. They set her up for an evaluation and the doctor said it bpd was indeed the case. The therapist set up therapy for us together because she doesn’t have much family. The first session was brutal she never liked me, she couldn’t stand me, I wasn’t her type, she finds me disgusting, I’m annoying, I’m a bother, I’m a crybaby, I’m not her thing, I force her to sleep with me(not true at all), I cause nothing but drama. She goes back in the timeline and say she felt a particular way at whatever point but I can tell you the things she says didn’t happen and I actually at that time got something completely different. She does this with her ex husband as well she says she felt certain ways but he says that there was no way, that they actually were really good at the points she says they weren’t. The therapist says she editing the timeline with intrusive thought to try and justify behaviors. She We had , had  sex two weeks prior to the session and she actually asked me for it  and about two weeks before that same thing. When I asked about the guy she’s going away with she gets angry, she gets dismissive and says I’m bothering her. She’s been talked out of quitting therapy twice because if the therapist brings up the guy she gets big mad. When we see eachother I get the complete opposite treatment as long as I don’t bring up the guy. Shes also when given examples of fp or devaluing says she doesn’t see it that everyone is just making it up to make her sound crazy, she’s living life as a normal person would. When you point out that she’s doing thing out of the norm you are the issue. I miss my friend take away the sex and this is my friend someone I care about a lot. She’s an amazing person but I don’t know how to help or support her.

Im very new to accepting my diagnosis and ready to look toward BPD focused treatment including any medication that might help.

Should I start by explaining to my EMDR therapist my interest in refocusing my care/finding a BPD focused therapist? I feel really overwhelmed on how to seek help.

Rose states that she has BPD and has recovered. She says that she has come up with a way to help others to recover like her.  I started listening to the podcast and found it not only validating, but also helpful. She talks about truth and honesty a lot. She talks about operating through life with a moral compass.  All of that is great advice. After listening to a few episodes I decided to reach out to Rose directly and see if she would work with me.  She agreed and we started meeting for $189 an hour.  We worked together weekly and I started to really build trust with her.  My partner and I were having a lot of problems, and Rose knew about the depths of those.  My partner reached out to Rose and during their phone call she told my partner very private things that her and I spoke about in session. She then said to him, that she was only telling him this because she is my coach and not my therapist.  She then told me in the next session that she spoke with him. She did not tell me what they spoke about and then told me that she was allowed to do that because she was my coach and not my therapist.  I was crushed and yet continued working with her. Forgiveness was on my moral compass and I really wanted to believe that she knew what was best for me.  A few weeks later she strongly suggested that we have a couples session. I expressed that I wasn’t comfortable or in a good space and didn’t think it would be a good idea. She told me I needed to do it for my recovery.  So I chose to trust her. During that session, I did not handle myself well. I was overwhelmed and defensive.  She kept telling me that I needed to admit that my BPD was hard on my partner. That I had to say, “yes this is hard for me but also hard for you”. I was confused and again, defensive and overwhelmed and asked why? She then told me that if I couldn’t say it, she could no longer work with me.  That was the last time I worked with Rose.  I have since started working with a real therapist, who is held accountable by an ethics board that I can report violations to, working on actual therapy and finding some success.  People with BPD are highly susceptible to influence and my belief is that Rose has taken on the identity of her, self described, corrective relationship husband Jay. He is her husband, fitness coach, moral “North Star” and business partner. He has no licensing whatsoever and offers “mindset coaching” sessions as well.

42,Splitting,"How do I get past black and white thinking? My therapist and I got into a fight about me seeing another therapist which she now strongly believes I should do because she doesn’t think she can help me any more. She’s my FP so she’s taken a lot on and it’s put a strain on our therapist/client relationship. I want her as my SO and she has a husband. It’s kind of a shit situation. She shouldn’t be my therapist. The problem is her insisting she shouldn’t be my therapist has made me feel like she’s abandoning me like everyone else and it’s making me split hard. She is the worst person in the world and I never want to see her again. In my head I can justify that, she’s in the wrong and me needing to see someone else is her fault. I can tell myself that it’s not but I can’t actually convince myself of that. I know I’m thinking irrationally but I can’t stop. 

How do I see the good in someone when I’m splitting? If I’m going to end therapy with her after 3 years I want it to be on good terms and not because I angrily rage quit and blame her for everything. How do I accept that a big part of this - like all of it - is my fault?

It’s a week before I have to see her again and I want to be calm and reasonable enough to have a discussion with her about this and not just get angrier at her the more the week goes on. I also don’t want to just cancel my appointment and never see her again.

44,I’m doing really well but I’m scared ,"
I worked my ass of in DBT 2 years ago. My DBT therapist told me that in EIGHT YEARS of doing the program she had never seen anyone bring in a full diary card since week one. Because I was very young they couldn’t actually diagnose me with BPD but my therapist went through the criteria with me and I met 9/9 to the extreme. 

Before finding out about BPD I felt like I was just crazy I knew there was something more than just anxiety and depression and when I finally found out what BPD was it legitimately saved my life. 

I finally had a word to describe what I was going through I knew it wasn’t just me I found communities that helped me and told me I’m not a horrible monster because of my BPD. 

I fought tooth and nail to get the diagnosis of “emerging BPD” and now that I’m recovering and getting better I’m scared that if my symptoms do go into remission it’ll be dismissed as “teenage hormones” 

I’ve been out of therapy since May 2023. I’m living a good life I have two amazing partners that I adore (I’m polyamorous) and I’m getting so much better. I still experience the same symptoms I did before but now I have the skills to manage them. 

I’m scared that if my symptoms go into remission and I no longer meet the criteria for BPD then that means that all the fighting and begging to figure out what was wrong was for nothing. I’m scared I’ll be dismissed as just a “moody teenager” in future years. But I’m not going to let that stop me from recovering.

So first a bit about us. You can skip to the question if you want.

My wife with BPD and i are together since 2008. We were at the tim 16 and 19 and did go through alm rough times together.
She got diagnosed at first with depression during our relationship and at the age of 18 with BPD and ADD. We did go to different therapist over the years. Some more usefull than others. She had for around one year a really creative one, who brought some ideas for her sleeping problems, but dropped out of the profession due pregnancy. She has now a therapist specialized on DBT. And she did some hughe improvements.


Question;

Now that she made hughe improvements in the last half of this year, but still struggles a lot with nightmares, where she falls back in her childhood, mixed with her current life.
We're now hoping to find something, that might her help with this. It really bothers her, since she feels like every progress she made, isn't there. In addition, she's not well rested.

Hi! I’ve been struggling with bpd for 3/4 years now and I have made a lot of progress. I’m on medication, a dbt program and last time i attempted was in june. Ive been feeling quite proud of my accomplishments.
A couple of days ago I went to see my therapist and we were talking about sh. Last time I did it was about a month ago, it was quite dramatic, needed stitches and I got very scared because I had never gone so deep. Since then I mad the decision to go off alcohol (which makes me super impulsive) and I am just so mad at sh that I swore to myself never doing it again. And I feel like this time I am really ditching the mentality. 
I told my therapist I am very ashamed of the big scar i have and wondering how I should deal with it. I showed it to her and she said it wasn’t that bad, that she had seen bigger and worse.
And I am aware I shouldn’t care for that remark she made, but ever since then I cant stop thinking about it. And picture myself doing it. Even though I was so determined to ditch this shitty habit forever, now it doesn’t leave my head and I think about it non stop. How I should just fill my arm with scars.

52,BPD and Irresponsible Spending,"I was diagnosed with BPD in 2021, although I’ve live with it untreated for much much longer. Now knowing, has made such a difference for me. I’m able to control my emotions a lot better and I’m able to get out of situations by conflict resolution wayyy better then when I was in my 20’s. 

The thing I struggle with most is spending. We aren’t financially vulnerable in any way, and the money I spend is readily available.. but problem is, I want to do it less. I KNOW I buy things I don’t need, but it makes me feel good. 

I always have a strong urge to work on this and was hoping for some input from anyone who’s come up with ways to handle this. I’ve tried budget binders and budget graphs, just feeling plateaued. Most importantly I’m between therapists and I could likely ask a therapist this but I haven’t been able to get my next appt yet.

53,Do you guys think that talking your emotions out is ineffective?,"I recently came to terms that I have BPD. I started working with a new therapist last week and she was debating whether or not I have it. I'm pretty sure I do. Whenever I've come across something BPD related online I'd relate to it, and the more I research it the more I relate.

Anyway, I wanted to know if people here related to something I've experienced. I've always been told that I should talk about my issues with a friend. Specifically, I had a guy who would always tell me that ""a problem shared is a problem halved"". That hasn't been the case for me. It rarely helps when I talk about my emotions, especially if I'm just venting. It's like my emotions are an immovable wall that can only be changed by another immovable wall smashing on top of it.

I guess that's the main point of this post. Do other people relate to this or do you find that a problem shared is a problem halved?

Ok, now for some extra stuff.

I was in rehab for a month and I had a therapy session with my FP (I feel weird using that term when I haven't been officially diagnosed, but that's the best way I can describe it). I tried venting to him about an issue we shared thinking that he could help me. I was a huge emotional mess. He then ghosted me for a few days. Eventually, he answered my call and told me that he needed space. About two weeks later, with the encouragement of my therapist, I invited him to join in on a family session. During the session, he lamented about how hard it was on him when I vented. I'm paraphrasing a bit, but he said that it was hard on him because he couldn't get me out of my hole of self pity. I've come to the conclusion that I shouldn't talk with someone who isn't my therapist about my emotions because it'll put stress on the person I'm talking to. But it's hard to keep the emotions inside except for one day out of the week. I want to talk to people, but how can I do that when it causes people pain? Does anyone have any tips on this?

Now, after a suicide attempt, I had to move in with my parents which was worst case scenario because they emotionally neglected me during childhood, and they still do now.

58,A question about bpd and favorite person,"I have a question about favorite persons, more specifically my therapist

So I have not been medically diagnosed with BPD but I have GAD, OCD, autism, and depression and all of which have made things very hard. 

Recently I’ve been struggling with some very complex emotions and mental struggle including obsessive thoughts about my therapist. How every it feels slightly different to ocd. I get these thoughts where I over analyze and find a problem with the things she does (wears, behaviors, etc.) it has caused me to feel like a horrible person. And no matter how much cognitive reframing I do it won’t stop. My brain won’t listen to any logic or rationale. I end up checking her Facebook and pretty much every other thing online of her multiple times a day. I feel as if I NEED to know more about her. Sometimes I just have this feeling like somethings off and I relate it to her. And over all it makes me feel like a creep and a horrible person. Especially since she is basically the sweetest person I know, and has helped me so much, and always been there for me

I though originally this may have been more tied to my OCD, but after doing some research I think I may need to ask my psychiatrist about bpd.

I’ve been in CBT with some DBT features for like a year and a half and I made huge strides! But now I moved, and am starting DBT group and a one on one CBT therapist in my new city in two weeks.

I haven’t started the new therapies yet - but my friend who is a psychologist sent me a packet of DBT worksheets for my time off therapy and holy WOW - they are effective.

Personally, they take a long ass time for me to fill out, and I only feel like they work for me because a.) I already have experience with doing logs like this and with cognitive distortions and schemas through my time in CBT, and b.) I already have worked on emotional awareness a lot for several years with several therapists.

But like - this morning my partner said something innocuous of course which scared the shit out of me and immediately felt anxious and scared and angry and confused and I wanted to ask him all these questions and interrogate him and do all my impulsive behaviors…

But then I filled out “check the facts” and wow. It just wild. It took probably an hour for me to really work through it, but I can see SO clearly exactly the route my mind took, and why, and I feel empathetic with myself, and I feel like I understand my partner, and I feel safe and happy and understood and I took no actions that I regret and just…wow.

69,turning 25 really made me realize how narcissistic my parents are,"a little background for context: My whole life was spent in survival mode as I was systematically denied opportunities to grow into a healthy, happy, functional person. As the youngest in my family, for the longest time, I was told I was sick and to blame for my family's dysfunction. time after time my parents have proven to want me off their payroll and never showed genuine compassion, empathy, or support in any other way except financially. They would say cruel, horrible, hurtful things to bring me down but say they want the best for me and pull a woe-is-me card saying they have done everything they can to help. I softened and repeated to them that all I ever wanted was a cheerleader but instead, they'd continuously drag and slander me telling me I'd never get far in life and the world is a cruel place. the truth is they are the cruelest thing I have encountered in my lifetime. No matter what I did, even after 15+ years of therapy  I found my identity, improved myself, learned how to not react like them, communicated in a healthy manner, and am very confident and can defend myself properly.  it was never enough to change how they treated me. At 17 they sent me to a residential therapy center and I was in a position in which I couldn't decline or avoid it, which actually ended up saving me and changing my life forever. They were supposed to be a part of the journey but even experts couldn't convince them of their wrongdoings and who I really was, not who they interpreted me to be. They refused to listen to my therapists and tried to convince them of things they simply knew weren't true. (I lived there and interacted with them on a daily basis for a year). Eventually, it got to the point where my parents were constantly contacting my therapists, writing a literal \*book\* worth of an email, trying to tell them what to tell me or what I was doing. They wouldn't respect a professional's boundaries, how were they ever going to respect mine? hindsight is 20/20 as they spent my tuition to go to my dream college and pursue my dream job on this place. Grand total of $120,000+, to not listen to anything that was truly causing conflict. This problem persisted with all different therapists for years, looking back, they basically had me hop to different therapists throughout the years when thought they were wrong and couldn't sway them. When I was a kid I distinctly remember an incident where a therapist had restated something my mother had said to me recently, and i asked her if my mom told you to say that to which she replied, you're a smart cookie. They were convinced i would never take off and told me id never succeed yet resented me for being the reason I couldnt.

&#x200B;

Now, 25 (F), I live on my own and I have my dream job and found my dream apartment. I admit I had a late takeoff but everyone is on their own timeline, progress not perfection. They had helped me along the way financially but were consistent in their past behavior. I'm currently in the process of a move and things that shouldn't be arguments become arguments because they think I'm arguing when I'm cool as a cucumber. I did everything myself and orchestrated the move. I made plans and shared them and how we needed to get things done. they'd constantly interrogate me as if I hadn't recited the plan 10 times in a way that made me feel that they think I'm truly incapable. yet, they pushed me off when I reached out to get things done and would get so mad when id point it out respectfully and they'd blow me off while going off on me repeating the same horrible things. I know they are helping me financially but expressing my frustrations led to me being told I'm never going to have a relationship or friends and this is why people hate me and leave. to which I replied, like who? then they claim I gaslight them as they continue to try to tell me I'm this horrible person who lives to make them miserable. They go back and forth constantly from wanting to help to being punishing mean-spirited people and I'm just tired. I want to enjoy my life and I see now that even achieving what they thought I'd never do but claimed they wanted for me still isn't enough to earn their respect. I've done so much mourning over them never being the parents i needed through the years and now I just think my only option is to surrender to that. Its just really sad. I have so much anger and resentment from it, especially when I was the one told in my childhood that they had to walk on eggshells. But now I see, it was me that had to tip-toe and hold my breath. I don't want to be angry anymore, but god, do they fill me with rage. 

I don't know what I'm really looking for...  I want to preserve my identity and my recovery without their words living in my head. So maybe connection, advice, or a community.

The same day, I told my best friend (who wont talk to me on nights or weekends bc that's when she's with her husband) that I don't want to be a backup friend.

Anyways, I’m here now and only starting to accept my diagnosis. I need to, to ultimately get better.

So any recommendations on how to navigate the system ? Or tips . I just feel like i’m suppressing everything inside now because of my relationship, friendships and work. it’s making me go more into a dissociative state & hallucinations are coming up more frequently.

If psychedelics interest you, please discuss it in detail with your psychiatrist and therapist, and be as cautious as possible.

95,Inner child work and reparenting might have saved me,"Hey guys, I’ve been going to therapy for about a year and a half now and early in my therapist started talking about inner child work. It has honestly been a game changer. I know not everyone has the time, money, support or other means for therapy so I wanted to share a tactic that has really helped me take care of myself when I wanted to do the opposite, or it can just be food for thought. 
A lot of people with BPD are prone to self-harm and self-deprecating habits that stem from our childhood due to childhood experiences, as well as survival tactics and defense mechanisms to protect ourselves from more trauma. My therapist told me to imagine myself as though I was my own child. Would I think think of my own child as worthless, not worthy or food or care? How would I take care of my child if they were sad? Would I treat them the same way I treat myself? Would I treat them the way my parents treated me and my feelings? Would I validate them? Would I rationalize things for them? I know this can be hard, especially for the less nurturing type of person, but we also all want to love and be loved. It is only a small part of the bigger picture, but when it comes to self-love and taking care of myself, it has played a huge role in my process of recovery. You cannot stop other people from abandoning you. That’s a harsh truth. But you do not have to abandon yourself out of feeling worthless or acts of self-loathing. I want to hear your thoughts and how you see it, or what your experience has been with reparenting yourself or even the lack thereof. 

Also, book recommendation: The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk, M.D. It’s a popular book, but for good reason. Bessel encapsulates trauma in a way that is easy to follow yet so profound and has brought a lot of pieces together. There are sensitive subjects in the book that he gently discusses in order to explain the manifestations of trauma. TW for sexual assault, violence, abuse, etc.

Not only do their boundaries feel like abandonment, but I have no framework to set my own boundaries. I don’t need space and want no barriers between us. So, they hold all the power. “I desire more connection with you,” or “I would appreciate more check-ins throughout the day,” are not boundaries, but requests. So they set all the boundaries and I constantly seek attention and make requests. It feels awful. What does a boundary from a BPD sufferer look/sound like? How can boundaries help me get my relationship needs met when I want no boundaries? And just to add, I don’t know if it’s a BPD thing, but so much “therapy speak” makes absolutely no sense to me. Like, I get it intellectually, but none of it feels real or like it applies to my experience, including boundary setting. It all feels trite and inauthentic.

99,How do you get know if you’re projecting or not? I asked chatGPT. The response made me realize that I might. What now?,"Here’s the response I got: 

Projecting involves attributing one's own thoughts, feelings, or traits onto another person. Here are some signs that may indicate you're projecting:

1. **Overly Critical of Others**: If you find yourself frequently criticizing or judging others for traits or behaviors that you dislike in yourself, it could be a sign of projection.

2. **Strong Emotional Reaction**: Feeling intense emotions, such as anger or resentment, towards someone else for reasons that seem disproportionate to their actions may indicate projection.

3. **Denial or Rationalization**: Ignoring or denying your own feelings or behaviors while focusing on those of others, or rationalizing your actions by attributing them to someone else's behavior, can be signs of projection.

4. **Repeated Patterns**: If you notice recurring patterns in your relationships or interactions where you consistently attribute certain traits or motives to others, it may be worth examining whether you're projecting.

5. **Lack of Self-Awareness**: Difficulty recognizing or acknowledging your own emotions, desires, or flaws, while readily identifying them in others, can indicate projection.

To address projection, it can be helpful to practice self-reflection, increase self-awareness, and explore the underlying reasons for projecting onto others. Therapy or counseling can also be beneficial in gaining insight into these patterns and learning healthier ways of relating to oneself and others.",1713518997.0,False,5,3,NightStar_69,None,1c7sm45,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1c7sm45/how_do_you_get_know_if_youre_projecting_or_not_i/
100,Going to start treatment tomorrow,"I (M23) was diagnosed with BPD last month after I went to the hospital for suicidal and homicidal ideation. I also scored super high on antisocial and narcissistic traits, and I'm not sure how to feel about that, even though I know it's true. I know that having this disorder doesn't make me evil, but it felt like the psychiatrist was calling me that. The hospital people put me on Latuda (I'm on 3 other things too, and one doesn't work so I'm tapering off) and told me that I have to get a DBT therapist instead of the psychodynamic one I've been seeing for 6 years and love very much. They also referred me to a partial program, which I start tomorrow.

I'm really nervous. I'm in a lot of pain. I have rage episodes when I'm alone, and panic attacks, and I drink and cut myself. My mood swings are intense, and I go between being tired, and just hating everyone and wanting to hurt them. I'm also bipolar and am having a depressive episode right now. I know I have to stop these behaviors, but I don't know much about DBT or the coping skills that are part of it, and I'm afraid that it won't help me. I want it to, but part of me is scared to get better. I know I have to talk about the negative ways I think about people and myself, and the violent impulses, but I have so much shame. I'm also autistic and have meltdowns from overstimulation and social situations, and I struggle with communication and talking, so it's hard to gauge what is BPD and needs to be fixed with DBT, and what is autism and would be harder/unethical to try to change. I don't want my therapist to mix up the two and hurt me.

The doctors also want me to go back on lithium. I was on it for 7 years and it really helped me, but the side effects ended up being sooo bad. I think it might be best to go back on it, though, because I feel like my mind has been punishing me since I went off.

During my time off, I read the book This is Not the End. It’s a bunch of BPD essays; some I related to, some I didn’t. Most of the people in the book were diagnosed in their teens, 20s and a few in their 30s.  I don’t think anyone was diagnosed in their 40s. I know this diagnosis is gaining traction (right?) and I want to understand it better before it gets the TikTok treatment. Are there others here who were diagnosed in their 40s? Do you have advice for me? When I tried seeking help in my 20s, it was dismissed (story of my life). I wish things had been different. I’m so tired of regretting my misspent youth, and I now know focusing on the past is a symptom of our disorder.

107,Question to those who are recovering from BPD - how long does it take to 'fix' identity issues?,"Hi everyone!

I am 28 (f) and I have been diagnosed with BPD \~2 years ago (I've been in therapy long before, but it was not helpful until I found good DBT therapist).

For 1 year I had a very intensive personal therapy and DBT trainings, finished it 1 year ago (the demand is high that's why my therapist let me go once she admitted I was stable enough), I am still doing exercises, reflecting a lot, and I feel like I am recovering.

Don't take me wrong - BPD is still part of my life, but life is *in order* now.  

Here's the trick - although I managed to gain distress tolerance skills, improved interpersonal communication, managing emotions etc - disturbed identity is something that I can't 'fix' yet.

I keep questioning where's me and where's the disorder, and it seems like the most difficult part of my recovery. This is one of the reasons why I am hesitant about getting into a new romantic relationship - I am scared that because I sometimes don't know what I want/need, this won't be healthy.

I'm starting to suspect that this is something that I cannot force and it will take years of life without BPD turmoil before I start feeling more 'solid'.

Not sure why I am writing this. I am 21. And I am losing hope. My borderline patterns started at 12. And they keep getting worse and more complicated with time. Never been in proper therapy. I was not compliant. Never found a good therapist. Was just heavily medicated with antipsychotics. But my patterns? Worse and worse with time. Dad died at 18. No financial stability and abuse at home of all kinds. Writing this post outside of my family house where my brother broke my nose. 

Just following with a convenient psychiatrist for the time. But no real change. Just staying afloat. CBT doesn’t work.

I am lonely. I do not fit in. People mostly bullied me for being autistic. In teen years and adulthood, I was sometimes repulsive. I lost my elementary school friends. I traveled and didn’t contact them for a decade. I don’t make real friends . I just act like a clown and mask. Or trauma dump.

Was stuck in a toxic FP situation for 3 years. Took my emotions and energy and complicated things. Much older person (3 times my age) and was pretty much groomed at 18. Finally left him . I was clingy desperate for a toxic person.

But I am always emotionally promiscuous anyway. Any guy shows the slightest bit of attention, I run into his arms regardless of red flags.

Epileptic and chronically ill. Health not stable.

Senior in uni and trying to push through to graduate.

124,Have you tried going NC with a parent? Would doing so be considered a form of splitting? ,"Update: I phoned the parent and expressed my need to take a break and reduce our interactions, explaining that I couldn't pretend to be on good terms as they wished. They were taken aback and questioned why. I explained to them that I was grappling with the trauma from my upbringing in their house. They responded by asking if it was so awful, how come they and my brother are doing fine? They also suggested that others have it much worse. I interrupted them, stating that their remarks were incredibly invalidating. In a final attempt to dissuade me, they questioned how I could manage alone in an entirely different city and how they could ensure my safety. At this point, their concerns no longer register as genuine worry for me, but rather as a means to maintain their comfort and absolve themselves of guilt for their role in my struggles. I'm triggered but relieved I made this decision.



My situation isn't straightforward, mainly because my remaining parent isn't entirely negative. For context, a therapist once told me that this parent exhibits some unhealthy behaviour (a lot of guilt-tripping, emotional abuse and control), which I agree with. I've been living in a different city for about a year and have stopped visiting them. We occasionally text, but I increasingly feel they're trying to smother me with their attempts to mend our relationship. They seem to listen and acknowledge my feelings, but the conversation typically ends with them wanting us to be on good terms. While I understand their desire, it feels like they're glossing over the real trauma and the decisions that have led me to my current situation.

However, since moving out, I've become better at recognizing how they've wronged me and at setting boundaries. I'm wondering if going NC would be too severe? I'm eager to continue growing, but I feel held back by their expectations and the emotional weight they place on me. I'm not ready to give what they want without first processing my trauma. Is NC a form of splitting in this case?

127,I want to stop being abusive,"Title. 

I've struggled with severe mental health issues for years and had a very abusive upbringing (religious trauma, absent parents, constant guilting, parentification, and criticism). As a note, my partner is very disabled and I'm their caregiver, and them being disabled is a good part because of my abuse.

In my current relationship of 6 years I've been abusive for almost 5 , and the last 9 months I had been doing a really good job. I knew I was abusive and was working with my partner to ensure that they feel safe. Before that, I didn't realise how bad my mental health problems were, and I didn't see my actions as abusive. Things came to a head in summer 2021 and I took some steps to do better, but shit hit the fan and I ended up living in our car for 6 months to give them some space. June 2022 I got my shit together and started doing self-directed DBT (I had no money for therapists), and things went really well after that, I even shared with some friends my past and they were helping me get better (before they started to abuse my partner, so I cut ties with them). After that I was doing perfect. Except in January, some really stressful things happened, and it's been a slow decline ever since.

It started as occasional lies that were super obvious. Then, in late February I had a complete mental health breakdown. Afterward I started being more defensive and argumentative, and recently it's become a daily occurrence.

I realise that I was trying to ignore what was happening instead of just radically accepting my behaviour and trying to fix it, but I need help. I finally have some money, so I reached out to some therapists that had been recommended to me some months ago, and I want to fix my behaviour. But honestly, I don't know what to do and if this will even help. I keep falling back into the same old abusive habits, and I have no support network other than my partner. I can't even find resources online to help me, the closest thing has been support groups for men that have been sent there for domestic violence.

128,Questions fo Men with BPD,"I see that most people with BPD seem to be women, but I read an article saying that its because of men not seeking treatment, so the institutions can't record them as often. This gave me a relief as I thought me having BPD in the wrong gender made things worse (I know, that sounds stupid). I have never met a male with BPD myself, but I would like to ask these questions to the guys here. 

\- How do you deal with hiding your emotions in public/group settings when you get triggered? Men have stigma to show any extreme emotions after all, so I bet its more difficult than it is for women. 

\- Are you on any medication to treat BPD?

\- How do you deal with being alone for too long? Do you try to talk to absolutely anyone you can reach to avoid the feeling of being invisible? I know I do, it is very common for me to lose touch with reality and feel like Im vanishing from existence if I stay alone for more than a day.

132,Am I crazy or did I use my skills/boundaries properly?,"(Originally posted in r/BPD but since I'm in recovery for awhile with my BPD I thought posting here would be better)

Update as of 10/13:

//My husband and I ended up looking through other messages between social medias we used together to come to terms with their behavior and again, find more patterns because I'm still trying to fight against their gaslighting. What we found was years worth of posts switching between talking absolute ill of our friend group and idolizing me, dragging and making very long hateful posts anytime one of us ended up in a relationship, the amount of hate and jealousy filled posts related to me was so nauseating that I've been sick for the past 15 hours. There's a lot more but I don't think it's quite on topic for this thread.

I feel much more confident and happy with myself that I was able to control my emotions regarding this situation and know I really did make the right decision. Thank you everyone for the support as well 🧡//

Long story short I had to end a friendship recently due to my boundaries not being respected and asking for mutual respect/support in specific areas of my life.

 I've brought them up for over a year until it got to a point where I needed to take time away to think about my future relationship with this person as their actions were not only harming me mentally but settling into my relationship with my husband and kids (my husband is aware of my diagnosis and is very patient with me. However, I did split more regularly during the times after interacting with this person which initially made us realize maybe I needed to reevaluate the friendship.) I've been going to therapy for my BPD for 6 years, know my subtypes, know my triggers, know when I need to step away and use wise mind. I have multiple workbooks that he and I do together in between the times I don't have therapy to keep up with my recovery as I very much want to work on myself and have for years.

Here is where I feel like I'm crazy: after bringing up that we needed time away from each other and go our separate lives and stating why, I am hearing from others that they're telling people that I abused them. That I sent hateful messages and that I was clearly devaluing them because they've been researching BPD for a little. I was very confused. Had my MIL, FIL and other family look at the messages. They said what I said wasn't hateful. I even showed my therapist and she said no and that I shouldn't be made to feel guilty for putting my kids first regardless of my diagnosis or not.

Am I crazy? Did my black and white thinking kick in? Or did I truly do the right thing and trusted myself? So many people use my diagnosis against me and many times I have to spend DAYS making decisions so I can make sure I'm not reacting out of pure emotion. However, this is my family and they ARE more important to me than anything else. I know after this I don't want them around me or my family ever again anyways, especially for what lies they're spreading. 

Being a mom with BPD is hard but I will always put them first. Their safety and security is most important to me. So why do I still feel bad for ending this friendship?

To update as of today as well with talking with my therapist; she mentioned that my friend is probably a covert narcissist and that it is common for them to shift blame, lie, and fake memory issues to avoid accountability. And since I have BPD that my friend probably dipped and played into that against me, especially since i was never originally diagnosed with it during the start of our friendship.",1697085744.0,False,5,3,WanderingFoxWitch,None,175yhrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/175yhrw/am_i_crazy_or_did_i_use_my_skillsboundaries/

135,A lesson in splitting and honoring your needs,"Hey guys so I learned a big lesson this week on BPD and on speaking my own boundaries.

Long story short my parents died about 5 months ago and it sent me into the worst regression of my symptoms I have ever had.

I’ve spent the past five months clinging to my bf like a leech and having crisis after crisis over tiny things like him seeing friends or turning over in bed wrong (he’s rejecting me in his sleep?!? Spoiler: he wasn’t. He was sleeping)

Long story short - things have gotten better slowly over the past few months. I’ve gone from being constantly terrified to being mostly regulated. However - he had a few big trips coming up at the end of the summer that were giant triggers for me.

I spent the past month preparing for his trip with my therapist and it was going pretty smoothly! I wasn’t jealous, I was even able to relax and have fun on my own. Was having lots of bad thoughts come up but was dealing with them well without needing any outside help, and he was staying in more contact than usual knowing that this was a big challenge for me.

While on his trip he brought up that he wanted to do some psychedelics on the last night of his trip and I got triggered SO hard upon even hearing about it. (Parents were terrible addicts who abused me under the influence). 

What ended up happening is I kind of felt guilted to let him do it even though I was extremely uncomfortable with it. I felt really guilty from being so clingy the past few months and from having a major meltdown/splitting episode when he was at a party in early July. I felt like I HAD to agree otherwise I was terrible and controlling. He also mentioned he had abstained multiple times over the past several months because I was in such a state of arousal, he knew it wouldn’t go over well. This just added to my guilt and shame.

He ended up doing it and guess what happened? I had a meltdown and split the hardest I ever have.

And now that we are through it I realized that it just shouldn’t have happened. 

Because even though I cried and cried about it and talked to him and my therapist about it, I was still extremely uncomfortable the day of. But we pushed through and it went really fucking badly.

And the thing is: I’m not against drug use. I know that my normal self had handled it fine in the past, but right now I’m extra sensitive. But instead of honoring my needs, and just telling him: hey, I’m not ready for this right now, I can’t handle it well right now - I instead felt the episode coming on and cried and cried and felt terrified but let him do it anyway. What happened next makes sense: the emotions built up and exploded on him after a few hours.

And I think the lesson here is: I should have just said ‘no’. 

But instead of noticing my symptoms and how triggered I was - I let the shame of my past actions and the fear of abandonment control me (he won’t love me if I say no). 

But looking back - I deserve someone who will understand that I’m not ready. And at the end of they day, I’m the only person who can know my own boundaries. Tbh - if I had just said straight up: “I’m not ready for this right now, I’m not stopping you forever, I just need some time”, I think he would have been really understanding and accommodating.

If he had just waited, and I spent a few weeks talking to my therapist and him about it - he probably would have been able to go back to doing his usual usage without a giant problem. But instead he was impatient, and I was shaming myself for my feelings - and it led to something really bad.

I think we can let the shame of our BPD control us. Thinking: ‘I should be better than this. I should be able to control this.’

But what if instead we view it through the lens of self love and acceptance of our BPD? 

“This is really difficult for me, and knowing how I am and how I react to triggers, I’ll probably have an episode if this continues.”

I think maybe working together with your partner, realizing that you’re a work in progress, and giving yourself TIME to learn how to cope healthily before exposure is the way to go if you can swing it. It’s ok to need time to adjust and to take time to heal and prepare for big triggers. Don’t shame yourself and jump in, because you’ll both end up feeling worse than if you had just waited. Speaking your boundaries will protect your relationship!

If you’re building a house together, and you really want to put up a roof, you need to build the walls first, instead of just throwing up a roof without proper support. Because then you’re left with the mess and expense of a broken roof to deal with, instead of just doing it right the first time.",1691170421.0,False,8,1,Astrnougat,None,15i6e7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15i6e7x/a_lesson_in_splitting_and_honoring_your_needs/

138,Reflections After 1 Year of DBT,"  Hey there Reddit, so I wanted to do this for myself, but I know that I found these sorts of posts helpful when I was just starting my recovery journey. I post this here in the hopes that it helps one person, because having been through this shit, I know how difficult it is, and how much better things CAN get, with a combination of luck, effort, and the right therapist. None of that shit is easy to find, and I feel extremely fortunate to no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for BPD. It was the hardest thing I’ve done in my life to point – harder than college, harder than working 80 hours per week in a job I hated, harder than the nights I laid in bed crying with emotional pain. There’s a dialectic between “it’s worth the effort” and “the effort takes a LOT out of you” that I want to strike right up top here, because I know this shit doesn’t go quite so smoothly for everyone. Just know that I’m wishing all of you luck, better days, and skillful means <3

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So today marks the one year anniversary of my first visit with \[my therapist\]. I don’t honestly know if that truly “counts” as a year in DBT, since there were a few sessions we had before I formally committed, but I’m finished with group and scaling back to one-on-ones every other week, and hopefully once a month by the end of the year. So it does feel like an important date to both mark and celebrate, and a good opportunity to reflect in a bigger-picture way than I tend to do. 

It’s honestly a bit difficult to remember my mindset back then. Not to say I don’t remember the struggles and the pain of searching for the right therapist, but in a very real way I feel like a fundamentally different person now compared to when I started. So it’s both tricky and a bit painful to recall that time, because I was truly adrift. I’d quit my job with no notice after a full-on breakdown, had flown out to see my family and barely survived the trip. I knew my older brother, who I was staying with, had a gun in his house, and I remember needing to tell him NOT to let me know where it was, or how to access it. There have been some low points since then, but that trip stands out as the last truly difficult thing I went through before getting started with DBT, so I do think that’s noteworthy. 

I do remember having quite a bit of shame that I even “needed” DBT, or any sort of therapy, to start with. I was raised to believe that your problems are self-created, and I felt like if I had caused myself all of this emotional distress, there MUST be some way I could fix it by myself. I tried that for a few months, and it was a spectacular failure. I tried reaching out to non-DBT therapists, tried BetterHelp (should be called BetterNotHopeForHelp), tried just looking up resources online – I was aware of DBT, and that it was considered quite effective at treating what I was dealing with, but I was also aware it was a major commitment, and part of me still held out hope that I could salvage the burning building that was my internal reality without having to accept that there wasn’t much worth saving, and that the right move was to let it burn down to the foundations and start rebuilding. I’ve always been a bit jealous of those who got ID’d at a younger age, I think that process would have been less intimidating in my 20s, but the idea of essentially starting my life over at 34 just seemed too daunting. 

There was also a lot of shame at the beginning that I didn’t know any of the shit that DBT was teaching me – in a lot of ways, it felt like needing to take remedial classes in being human. It wouldn’t be until I was around six months in that I read through the DBT workbook cover to cover, and came across Marsha’s quote that “’Aren’t these skills your mother was supposed to teach you?’ I always say yes, but for many people their mother just did not or was not able to get around to it.” That was a big perspective shift for me - I don’t know why I expected myself to know things I was never taught, but that alone went a long way for me.

While the past year has been extremely difficult, it’s also not an exaggeration to say it’s the best year I’ve ever had as an adult. I managed to find a fairly validating environment in college, which I think went a long way to heading off the worst of my symptoms (though there are a few breakdowns that I glossed over at the time that stand out with the clarity of hindsight), but honestly I don’t know that I was ever happy after college. 12 full fucking years of misery before I could swallow my pride to reach out for help – I wish I’d done it sooner, but I also don’t know if I would have been ready for it then. Everyone has their own path, and maybe mine needed to go through a long and undeniable valley of torment to get me there. Maybe it didn’t, but no amount of regret can change the past, and I do think knowing just how deep that well went helped me stay committed during the tough times, of which there were many.

I also can’t help but reflect on how incredibly lucky I’ve been throughout this process.  When I first reached out to \[my therapist\], she wasn’t taking on new patients, but I guess I sounded desperate enough on the phone that she squeezed me in. Given how well a fit we ended up being, I can’t help but wonder if I would have gotten to where I am with another therapist. I don’t know how I would have felt about being “rejected” by the first DBT therapist I had the courage to reach out. Despite how badly I was struggling, I was very much in the “I’m sure I’m actually faking all of this shit” vortex that many of us on the quieter end of the spectrum struggle with. I might have taken that as evidence that, actually, I wasn’t even struggling that bad, that so many people had it worse than I did, that I didn’t deserve help, and that I was a true piece of shit for thinking that I did, even for a moment. I’d like to think I would have found my way to DBT sooner or later, but knowing how I was at the time, I’m very unsure and it’s scary to think what my life would look like now if I didn’t. I also can’t overstate how much having a great match with my therapist helped – I didn’t trust her right off the bat, but by a few months in I trusted her pretty much unconditionally. I don’t know that I’ve EVER trusted another person as much as I trust her, and I don’t know that this whole thing would have stuck without that trust. 

So I’ve talked about this idea of “changing” quite a bit in these journals, and it is that, but it’s maybe closer to reclaiming (or just plain claiming) an authentic self. My self-hatred went so deep. I knew all of the worst parts of myself, and I fucking detested them, was disgusted by them, couldn’t even stand to look at myself in the mirror or reflect on what I was feeling because it was so much easier to just deny and numb with an insane workload to keep me occupied during the day, and enough weed to drown out my own internal monologue at night. I’m still not sure that I love myself – that self-loathing was such a prominent feature of my existence for so long that it’s fair to say that only a year of work, even if it was incredibly hard work, wasn’t enough to completely undo that. But, I accept myself, and I think I even like myself. I wouldn’t have thought either of those things were possible at the start of the process (at least not the self that I actually ended up embracing – I was more interested in becoming a different person than I accepting the person I was). And, to be fair, despite my optimism about DBT, I didn’t have a whole lot of confidence in what was actually possible at the start of the program. When \[my therapist\] asked for long-term goals, I REALLY struggled to come up with them, because I thought that what I wanted wasn’t possible, at least not for me.

And I guess that leads me to the now, and my worries about what comes next. I’ve been a bit depressed since I got my results that I no longer meet the diagnostic criteria – I knew it was coming, but I think a part of me was holding out hope that there was some secret trick that would be revealed to me once I got to that point. And maybe I’m discounting the extent to which that did happen, but not in the “fit it on a bumper sticker” sort of simplicity I wanted. DBT has provided me with a path, the tools to stay on it, and the tools to come back to it when I wander off it (and I expect I will continue to wander off it. I tend to think success is measured more by your ability to come back rather than your ability to never stray). I suppose it’s a bit more muddled than that – there wasn’t a day when I suddenly woke up and knew the way, no more than there was a day when I woke up and realized I was no longer a child but an adult. That liminal space between the two is more massive than I think I anticipated, and only now towards the end of the process am I able to look back over my life and really appreciate and feel just how far I’ve come.

Among the many things that DBT has brought into my life, I think one of the most lasting will be end up an appreciation of Buddhist philosophies. I don’t think I realized just how baked in those practices are until after reaching Marsha’s autobiography and seeking them out myself. But, this passage still makes me happy-cry every time I read it. The author uses the word “awakening”, but I think you can just as easily substitute “recovery” or “building a life worth living” or whatever else you want. It really gets that the “two steps forward, one step back” nature of the process, and what I anticipate the next steps will look like for me. 

“But no sooner is (awakening) glimpsed than it is gone. Cessation of craving is like a momentary gap in the clouds. The sun shines brilliantly for a few moments, only to be covered over again. We find ourselves back in the humbling fog of anguish, craving, habit, restlessness, distraction. But with a difference: now we know where this track goes…

Henceforth, the resolve to cultivate this path becomes unwavering yet entirely natural. It is simply what we do…Awakening is no longer seen as something to attain in the distant future, for it is not a thing but a process – and this process is the path itself. But neither does this render us in any way perfect or infallible. We are quite capable of subverting this process to the interests of our far-from-extinct desires, ambitions, hatreds, jealousies, and fears. We have not been elevated to the lofty heights of awakening; awakening has been knocked off its pedestal into the turmoil and ambiguity of everyday life.”

139,Ex pwBPD Reflection,"My ex pwBPD [43f] told me,

>I love you but I’m not in love with you. Because the person you met before was not me. Because in the moment I was completely out of it and the person you met was a crazy f****** b**** who was 20 something. Like I can remember everything we were saying. People switch (split?), I switched (split?) myself. When I don’t want to feel pain or whatever I run away and I start doing stupid shit. And that’s the reason I’m hiding and it’s coming out this other person. The therapist said it happened because of everything you went through in your life. 
My therapist told me, “Do you know that what are you doing right is not correct, it’s not you? That you’re just toxic right now and damaging that person.” And I think it’s the best, it’s much better because when she starts working on when I was abused, and it’s going to be very soon, believe me I don’t wanna go through that pain. I don’t want to be with nobody. I don’t wanna have a boyfriend that’s the problem you don’t understand. I don’t want a boyfriend. I don’t want a man touch me. I don’t want anything. I don’t want to future with a man. want to be alone. 
Because when I met you, I was escaping from my ex-boyfriend. and I was just escaping. that’s the reason you met the person. it wasn’t me because I was lost. I’m still lost but in the moment I was completely out of control without the correct medication. 

Some questions I have,

1. Is this common for a BPD episode or a manic episode?

2. Do borderlines ever want to reconcile with their healthy/supportive ex partners after going through medication, intensive DBT and CBT? Even if this is a matter of years into recovery? We are friends now, and my ex borderline is extremely sorry and feeling beyond guilty for hurting me. She cares about me **immensely** and is still extremely sweet to me. She does not want a relationship but does not want one in general. The mention of wanting to be with nobody, not wanting a husband, and a future alone sounds like borderline black-and-white thinking. 

Also she mentioned in the past while we were still together and her BPD was triggered,

>I am not able to have a relationship with you or nobody else because It **never** going to work 
out because of my condition.

It sounds like very dichotomous thinking that you’d
see with BPD.

This woman felt **destroyed** when she knew she hurt me and broke down crying to tell me she was sorry for pushing me away, that she just wants the best for me.

142,Recovery is possible and I might have done it,"Hi!

I hope all of you are having a good day. I'm just checking in to tell you that during our last appointment, my therapist of 3 years told me that she thinks I no longer meet the criteria for BPD and am what she calls ""a therapeutic success"". We went over how I got there over the course of my treatment and how some things will stay–""borderline traits"" that are part of my personality but no longer a handicap to my day-to-day life; and dissociative episodes that are now few and far between but not entirely gone. I know that setbacks are possible and even likely, but it does not scare me nearly as much as it used to! I have grown more confident in my skills and myself as a person despite previous therapists and medical professionals telling me there was no hope for me.

I wanted to share this feel-good news because I know that ""recovering"" from a personality disorder is so often seen as impossible that it really feels like there's no point in trying to get better.

143,Husband no longer FP,"My husband used to be my FP...for about 7 or 8 years. I had a breakdown last year in the summer and he didn't help me & betrayed me to his family. Ever since then, I have not trusted him. I don't like him as a person...he has different values. I don't ever want to kiss or be intimate with him. He puts NO effort into dates and our relationship. Everything about him drives me crazy. I don't even like hearing his voice. I just don't want to be around him. I hate most of his family - this is a MAJOR issue. They are really bad people - racist, sexist, homophobic, gossipy, no boundaries etc. but he will not cut them off. They have accused me of some very bad things which are not true at all.

145,Should I be concerned?,"
I'd like to preface this post by stating that I have toxic behaviors in the relationship, such as invading space, being overly critical, heavy splitting, not listening to his side well, as well as my own yelling and general outbursts. I am in therapy partly to work on these behaviors.  
  
My bf does have some behaviors of his own that bother me, however I'm not sure if some of these are normal and I'm just splitting when I freak out about them. I've communicated about most of these and I've noticed some of it get better, however he's also told me he feels like I take everything as a personal attack and like I don't trust him. Sometimes when conflict has been very heated and I point out something that bothered me, he corrects it but explains he feels like he needs to keep a 'checklist"" of bad words/things to say. The behaviors that have been bothering me are:  
  
\-Swearing during conflict, but I've even corrected him when it isn't directed at me  
  
\-Yelling, he's also explained much of the time he does not mean to yell directly at me, but I have noticed it improve over time.  
  
\-Sometimes when we disagree he says what I said was ""stupid"", I've tried asking him to change it to say that what I'm saying doesn't make sense or something more neutral. I have noticed this get better as well, but he does get frustrated about it at times and doesn't always know how else to describe something  
  
\-Saying what I said was ""useless"", but this is often when I've repeated the same questions over and over or don't add anything to the conversation. He has gotten better about it but also does get frustrated about needing to stop.  
  
\-Saying that I'm being stupid/am stupid, however this has only been when I've highly bothered him and wouldn't give him space during the argument. He's only said this when I've split very hard and have had a giant episode where I won't let him calm down, so he likely does this because he doesn't feel like he has a choice. He does want to work on it, but I understand I provoke it and don't give him much of a chance to act differently.  
  
\-A few times he's hit things, such as the couch or his desk, but this is also often when I won't give him space when he's asked. He has thrown his phone once or twice when I was splitting very hard on him as well, but I've also done this to my phone much more. He's never thrown anything in my direction or near me, and I don't feel like he's trying to intimidate me.  
  
He does know these behaviors bother me, and when things are calm and we try to problem solve again after escalation he usually apologizes and wants to be better. However, sometimes he will say that I took some of it personally, such as swearing. Another thing that concerns me is that during arguments when I ask him not to call me stupid, he'll say ""I didn't call you stupid, I said you were being stupid."", I've read from some people that these things are forms of gaslighting, but I also know I provoke some of it after crossing his boundaries, and that BPD can often make us overreact so I am looking for input.  
  
Many of these things didn't start until I split on him more, however the yelling, swearing, and some moments of him saying I'm taking stuff personally did, as well as saying what I say in arguments at times is ""useless"".  
  
I've been bringing up couples therapy, now that our lives are less busy he said he'll try going. Going is very out of his comfort zone, as he's had trauma around therapists and doesn't think couples therapy is effective, but he said he'll try once a month then see if he's okay going more often. He's also told me if he can't figure out his behaviors on his own he'll try to see a therapist himself. For the couples therapist, he has said he doesn't want to do much of the work of looking for one, but it was my idea so I'm not sure if this is fair.  
  
We were trying to call each other out on these behaviors during conflict and then taking a break before re-engaging, but I've often failed at following through as I've explained. I am in no way trying to excuse my toxic actions. I'm just asking if his behavior seems like a valid reaction to my splitting and how I act, or if I should be concerned and he seems toxic as well.",1683955962.0,False,2,3,thelittlestone568,None,13g8f5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/13g8f5z/should_i_be_concerned/

147,hitting rock-bottom,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""
-Panic! At the Disco.

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439573.0,False,1,7,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1ad08qo/hitting_rockbottom/

152,Controlling rage without meds?,"Hello! I am in a bit of a tough situation in here, right now my life can be summed up in “Anything that can go wrong, goes wrong”. My fp broke up with me, I had to move back to my kinda toxic family, I don’t make enough money to be able to move out soon, I can’t go to sleep before six in the morning. The smallest things can cause an outburst, meltdown and my reaction is an insane rage, to the point where I physically have to hurt myself to let it out and I shout and look scary. I tried out different meds in the past, but my body had a bad reaction to even the smallest doses, so my psychiatrist told me to stop. Insurance doesn’t cover therapy, and rn I just simply can’t afford it. I downloaded some dbt workbooks, but I hope you could suggest some other methods to help me control my emotions. Of course, I should fix my sleep schedule, but I genuinely feel so apathetic towards my life (I was really ambitious during the relationship)
Also, yesterday I watched one of Dr. K’s (healthy gamer gg) videos, and he said that the method of how they cure personality disorders is by changing the meta-cognition and meta-emotion (how you think and feel about your reactions), but I’d honestly feel like a clown if I tried to pat my back and say “It’s okay buddy” after a meltdown.

153,can't get a diagnosis!,"So I am usually not one to self-diagnose. I have been under psychiatric care since I was 13 (now 23) and have been diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, social phobia, OCD, anorexia, ADHD, and PTSD and I typically defer to my doctors/therapists. But it's pretty fucking obvious to me that there is something bigger going on here... how would a person have 7 unrelated mental illnesses?! I have been on a cocktail of psychiatric medications since age 13, tried every type of therapy that I could and I still feel like I'm grasping at straws and trying to treat things that are just symptoms of a larger problem.

I have done A LOT of research (I'm talking hours upon hours) and am reasonably confident that I have Quiet BPD. I think the reason that no practitioner has caught onto it is because I internalize everything and I only lash out at myself. I don't really show any external signs of having BPD, however I have 8/9 BPD characteristics in the DSM (for context, diagnosis is appropriate with 5/9 symptoms). 

When I brought this up with my psychiatrist, she said she doesn't really see typical BPD traits in me (which I think is because I have quiet subtype and it's highly internal) and that she is hesitant to diagnose BPD because of the stigma it carries... okay, but I am confident that I meet the diagnosis standards under the DSM and need to be treated for BPD instead of the other seven issues, as the BPD & PTSD are no doubt what is causing everything else. 

I really don't want to self diagnose. But I have brought this up with multiple therapists, psychiatrists, etc. and my ED recovery coach is the only one to see the truth in what I'm saying. I *know* something deeper is going on. I have felt this way my whole life and only when reading about quiet BPD was I able to understand the chronic emptiness that has caused all of the other issues.

I struggle with extreme splitting where I do things that generally go against my moral compass. I never split on my son but I do get irritable easy when stuff is stressful. When I get angry its almost like I become the monster I used to hide from as a kid and the thought of that when I come down from the anger turns into instant remorse, pain, and regret.

The person in question has a bunch of their own issues (of course) and not enough experience in life or in relationships to know how to handle their own feelings. The main issue is that they don’t know how they feel about me and their feelings are constantly fluctuating and constantly under their scrutiny. We were friends and then they wanted more and then they weren’t sure if they wanted a relationship, now they don’t even know if they liked me at all in the first place or if they just liked the attention i gave them. They genuinely do not know and i am splitting on them badly. I really wish i didn’t have focussed people and i feel like this experience has taught me not to befriend or date focussed people.

What's there to hold on for, to hope for, when my future is filled with pain, disappointment, loneliness?  A decade ago a therapist had me write out the things I want to have/achieve in my life. Something to keep me going. Well... Not a single one is achievable at this point.

And don't tell me ""it gets better"". I'm 37 and it isn't likely  to be getting better for be. I'm thinking it's time I just cut my losses and give up. I'm just so tired of fighting.",1678944269.0,False,4,6,aerinne,None,11sl4ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/11sl4ez/ive_lost_my_hope/

163,"For those who completed their first year of DBT, how often do you go now?","So I finished up my first year of DBT late last year - easily both the hardest thing I've ever done, and the best thing I've ever done for myself, I really didn't think I'd ever get to this point when I started. 

I've been trying to tack back to sessions every other week instead of weeklies like I'd been doing through the first year and the holidays, but I find I'm REALLY struggling with the increased gaps. I know I'm still adjusting and all that, but it's frustrating because I do feel like weekly is probably too often, but every other week doesn't feel quite often enough (and since I work a day job doing sessions every 10 days or something like that isn't a realistic option).

I guess I'm curious for those of you who ""graduated"" DBT, how often did you still go to therapy?

164,Completed DBT almost a year ago and was doing great. Developed postpartum depression and I feel like it's undone all my hard work.,"I'm having feelings and thoughts that I thought I had overcome. I am so overwhelmed with my all of my baby's needs that I feel like I don't have the mental capacity or presence of mind to use any of my skills. I'm having trouble staying mindful of my thoughts and my emotions and it's led to panic attacks and angry outbursts. 

My fiance and I have argued more in the last 2 weeks than we have for the last 2 years. He said I've been emotionally abusive and gaslighting him. He said something along the lines of ""You know what BPD is, you know what you do."" and down to my very core it's never my intention to hurt him, I'm not trying to manipulate him or invalidate him. And it hurts so much that I made him feel that way and that he thinks I'm doing it on purpose. It's all making me question myself and I'm feeling like I did before I even started DBT. How do I recognise if what I'm doing IS emotionally abusive? 

For what it's worth I just started meds for PPD and I am still seeing my therapist once every couple of weeks (next appointment in a few days). We've also made an appointment with a couples therapist, which I'm feeling apprehensive about because I don't want all our issues blamed on me because of BPD. 

I just wanted to post here so that people who I know might understand what I'm feeling. Anything any of you have to say would be very welcome.",1598817631.0,False,6,7,DuckDuck_Moo,None,ijjcq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ijjcq4/completed_dbt_almost_a_year_ago_and_was_doing/
165,Going through a breakup,"I spent a LOT of time focusing on myself afyer getting out of an abusive relationship a few years back. I spent time alone finding hobbies and working on so many of my own issues as well as coping with what happened during that relationship. I ended up getting clean from self harm and I even went back and graduated high school and started working again. I was so proud of myself and thought I could handle a relationship again finally. 

I may have been wrong.

We moved really slow at first, we took our time with dates and spending the night. We didn't want to force anything and I didn't want to get addicted so fast. Things went really well until around the 3 month mark I had a bad week, I was crying a lot and upset and for the first time, I brought up how when I feel like a mess I want to selfharm. I thought he would be able ro handle it since after a while of dating I told him about BPD and he read up on it and even highlighted and annotated a book about it, just to study and better handle what could happen. But he did not handle the stress well when I break down did come, he tried to leave but ended up wanting to stay, and I felt good about his choice at first since I did not beg or freak out when he brought it up, I tried to just talk about our issues. However trying to leave 3 months in really set something off in me, immediately I sowed seeds of abandonment and left me paranoid. 

As time went on I still had breakdowns over something dumb every few months, but when he'd bring up something to me that upset him or hurt him, I'd always take the steps to start changing, and more often than not I'd stop the bad behavior he pointed out. I was lucky of he pointed it out though, he had a fear of confrontation and as he told me ""I didn't make it easy for him."" I know it should be easier for me to see what I'm doing wrong but sometimes it was hard, I told him he'd need to spell it out for me, and there's times I'd get really defensive and mad when he did. I'd always apologize afyer the fact and tell him I overreacted and that he's in the right to feel that way. I ALWAYS made sure to tell him his feelings were valid and good and I tried my best to take accountability, even of he had to point out my wrongdoings. 

Though I'd have these bad times, I will say I didn't insult him, I never uses shoes like or SH as a threat and I'd take accountability for myself feeling like that, when he was upset with me I'd even be sure to avoid talking about those feelings so he wouldn't associate them with his own emotions towards me. 

But eventually he tried to leave again, showing me no warnings and coming home and breaking the news to me a year into the relationship. I yet again, just sat there and tried to talk about it and we worked though things... only for him to do it again the next day and decide to stay AGAIN. At that point I was horrified. Always scared he's going to go and not knowing when it would happen. He wouldn't talk to me about any issues he had when they came up. He would give me the chance to talk about anything or seek any help cuz he wouldn't even let me know when he felt I was doing something wrong. I shouldn't have been so blind to it and I know that, but I thought I was trying. I tried so hard on the things he wanted fixed. I tried.

He stayed after that though. Flash forward 3 more months, I have the worst week I've had in our relationship, I was very aware of my wrong doings and told him everytime, but it didn't change how I was feeling. We were on a time crunch to get my me drivers license, I have college starting up in 2 weeks, and he's supposed to leave town for the first time for a week. This is all happening at the same time and I was horrified. I even broke down crying during my behind the wheel test and things hadn't been feeling too real for a few weeks, I didn't feel ready for any of it and because of it I felt like a failure. On top of that I felt I needed to be afraid of him leaving, like I NEEDED that fear. I knew he was stressed too because of how I felt and I knew I wasn't handling stuff well. Eventually I broke down, I was sobbing and yelling about how I wanted to die, I told him it's cuz I felt like a failure, because if I couldn't handle getting my license how am I supposed to handle school. This break down soon flipped into me yelling at him that he's going to leave. I KNEW my breakdowns were too much and I felt like he was going to go again for it, it felt inevitable.

The next day happens and all the bad feelings built up, and for the first time in 2 years I relapsed on self harm. When I got home that night i told him, and I told him I stopped because it wasn't worth it to myself to fall back into that behavior. I also told him that I was scared to tell him because I thought he'd leave if I got that weak and hurt myself. I was right, he left. He told me after he saw the mark on my leg he gave up on me. I know it's selfish to expect him to stay after that, but I really wish he did. I didn't want him to fix me, just to be there for me and talk about ways to get over this stress

After everything he came by to talk to me and told me all these things i had no clue he felt during our relationship. Things that I felt, if they were talked about, really could have been worked on and fixed, but he told me ""it's just not worth it"". He didn't want to stick around and work on anything. If he had mentioned couples therapy I would have done it in a heartbeat, if he had just needed space I would have done it in a moment, no guilt involved. 

He mentioned feeling like I didn't want him to see his siblings alone BUT HE NEVER TRIED. HE NEVER BROUGHT IT UP ONCE. I even asked him ""why haven't you seen you siblings in a whileyou should make plans soon."" But he decided that meant nothing. I tell him ""hey you should play the piano or do *insert hobby here* today, and I'll just play a video game"" but he decided I wanted him glued to me at all times. And undeniably there WERE times like that. I wanted him in the same room as me a lot, I wanted to he near him, but he never once told me that wasn't okay. He always entertained it, I didn't know. If he wasn't happy I wish he would have at least told me. Inwish he would have at least given me a chance. 

He also said i shouldn't ever ""subject"" someone to my thoughts of SH. I feel so destroyed. This was supposed to be my first healthy relationship and I did mess up, I did breathe down his neck too much but if he had at least talked to me I feel like i could have tried.

So my ex had a psychosis a couple of weeks after she got her diagnosis and broke off our relationship during that. 
Soon after things got a bit worse and then she slowely came back. 
She regretted what happened and I don't Blame her or have Any anger towards her about what happened. 
However, after the breakup i had some space and looking back i noticed some things that weren't well in our relationship. 
I could't dat no anymore, was afraid of anger and took on a caretaker role. And a couple of self-harm episodes to which i was a ""trigger"". (details later). 
So when she came back we met up a couple of times and i felt the paterns returning and asked her if we could go no contact for a while (after she had a safe place to stay). 
Now its been 6 months and I have been in therapy as well started learning more about BPD. 
Now I want to contact her again hoping that with what we both Learned we might be together again in some way. However i am still worried, and unsure if it can work or if i have already lost her. If she feels abondened 
How many of the people here are in a long term relationship and have tips? Or can tell something about their experience being with somebody?

I know I am the problem, and I want to fix it because I feel so bad and resentful towards how I treat him, I sometimes think it would be better if he just let go of me. But even though he is visibly hurt, he said we can find a solution.

Some quick context: we were in a long-distance until we moved in together last june, in a completely new country where neither of us know the language.
So I have seeked help, but since I cannot speak the language at an advanced level, there are not enough resources, meaning English-speaking therapists here. And where there are, in a different city and can do video-sessions, they are extremely expensive for me to be able to afford now.

Now, I know DBT is the main treatment for BPD, but since I have no way of going to therapy right now, I was wondering if there is any way to self-teach?

181,What is wise mind in DBT?,"Have you ever snapped at someone and surprised yourself with how harsh you sounded?

You may have thought, *whoa… where did that come from?!*

You were probably acting from what’s called “Emotion Mind” in DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy). DBT is a therapy methodology developed by Marsha Linehan which helps people feel more in control of their thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

When in emotion mind, people react based on their mood, without taking logic into account.

**You May Be in Emotion Mind If:**

* You’re reacting quickly, without thinking things through
* You’re acting on urges without taking into account your long-term goals
* You’re behaving impulsively and aren’t considering potential consequences of your actions
* You want to hurt who hurt you, even if you’re not typically a vengeful person
* You’re not considering anyone else’s feelings or additional context of the situation

On the other end of the spectrum is Reasonable Mind, which is rational, logical and steady.

You might be thinking, *okay, reasonable and rational, that sounds good! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time must be the goal, right?*

Actually, no! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time isn’t ideal, either. 

**You May Be in Reasonable Mind If:**

* You feel cut off from, or “numb” to your emotions
* You minimize or shrug off your feelings
* You rationalize your own or others’ behavior, even behavior that is unacceptable
* You are avoiding or in denial about something that is happening
* You are completely focused on a task

When we’re in Reasonable Mind, we’re cut off from our emotions. It’s important to be aware of and feel our emotions. First, because it’s an essential part of the human experience. More importantly, emotions contain very important information we need to understand our needs and boundaries.

Here’s an example of why awareness of emotions is important. Let’s say you feel angry and irritable every time you see your friend. Reasonable mind might say you’re being irrational and dismiss the feelings. But chances are there’s a good reason why you’re feeling angry at them, especially since it keeps happening.

Maybe they’re putting you down a lot, or not listening to what you’re saying. Or maybe you feel jealous of them. Finding the answer to why you’re angry is important to figuring out how to resolve your anger, whether you do so on your own or with the other person.

There are a number of potential reasons why people have difficulty being in Wise Mind. Maybe they haven’t had many people in their life model what it looks like to be in Wise Mind. Maybe staying in Reasonable Mind has protected them from extreme traumatic reactions. Maybe acting from Emotion Mind has gotten their needs met, for better or worse.

When you’re able to acknowledge your feelings without acting impulsively on them, you’re in Wise Mind.

**You May Be in Wise Mind If:**

* You’re taking both your emotions and logic into account
* You can name and feel your emotions
* You’re considering different ways to proceed before acting
* You can see the situation from multiple perspectives
* It feels like *you* are in control, not your mood

If you’re rarely in Wise Mind, don’t worry! You can increase your Wise Mind skills with practice.

**Ways to Cultivate Wise Mind Skills**

* Pause throughout the day and ask yourself which state of mind you are in.
* If you are in Emotion Mind, label which emotions you’re feeling.
* Using coping skills before acting on your feelings (for instance, journal, go on a walk, or take a hot shower).
* If you want to engage in a behavior that’s impulsive or mood-based (for example, emotional eating, texting your ex, substance abuse, etc.)
   * Delay the behavior by 1 hour
   * Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or peer before engaging in the behavior
   * Consider the negative consequences of the behavior
   * Replace the behavior with something less harmful (for example, drawing on your arms with a Sharpie instead of self-harming)
* Participate in a DBT program in your area. It can help you develop not only Wise Mind skills, but also, a wide variety of other skills related to Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Relationships.
* Practice yoga, Tai-Chi, or other physical activities that help you get in touch with your body. These can also help you develop more awareness of yourself and your emotions.
* Talk to a therapist! A therapist can help you stay accountable as you work towards strengthening your Wise Mind.

But I asked him for his password because of those women coming forward. So it was a different reason why I asked. Not because of the followers on tiktok. The women on tiktok didn't have many followers. It was like he knew them personally or something to be following them. His TikTok is ""handsome*insert name*"" and all his followers are women. He doesn't mention me at all on there. Hopefully that clears some things up. In saying that, it doesn't justify asking for his password at the end of the day or invading his privacy. I realize that now after reading the comments. However I receive mixed advice depending were I post. On a women's group I was told it's justified. Here I'm told it's not. I think it best I just ask my therapist and not ask online for relationship advice 

I asked for his TikTok password so I can always log into his account. I also have his Facebook account. He has never cheated on me but he used to chat up a lot of women before we became a item. On his TikTok I found multiple women he followed back after the requested to follow him but not messaged. I got mad and he said ""are you serious?!?"" He said I can get rid of them then since I'm on his profile anyway. So I did. These women were posting sexual suggestive content that had added him. I'm hurt. I even posted a video on his TikTok asking that any girls reach out to me if he has been talking to them. But no one came forward. I asked on Facebook too, but no one came forward either.  (After the previous two women I mentioned above, no one came forward. Since I found no evidence with the previous two women, I saw it as not cheating. This however is a separate occasion) He always invalidates me when I tell him his done something wrong or gets upset at me but once he calms down, he normally apologizes.

Only in the past 3 months have I found out that it was truly BPD and I am now engulfing myself in learning all about it. I am trying so hard to fix myself and be a better person. I want to be the person my wife wants to be with and a better father.  I have emotionally destroyed my wife over the past 15 years. She has repeatedly tried so many times over the years to get me to seek help. I did and they said I was bi polar, took meds for that for 2 years,  didn't fix anything.   I was still the same person. Then I finally found out that I have thyroid disease which caused me to be bipolar.   I have finally gotten my physical health corrected with my thyroid etc.   With hormones being so out of whack due to thyroid disease it was so hard to ever find out what the true problem was.  My wife decided that we needed to separate because she is so unhappy and feels broken.  This is not what I want, I have been begging her and begging her to stay with us and please give me a chance and that she would see real change in me. I am seeing a therapist and messaging with my therapist constantly. I am listening to books on BPD. I'm on this pages of reddit and learning that we pretty all have the same symptoms.

187,I need some sexual healing,"I was diagnosed with bpd In 2020 but sex was never discussed in therapy. A big reason for this is the shame and embarrassment that I feel surrounding my sexuality (another reason is that I was only given a children’s book to explain my condition) therefore I have been struggling in silence for years.
I am F21 and I have slept with over 70 people. Most of these are 1 night stands from after night outs (I blackout every-time I drink alcohol and end up in someone’s bed the next day). The next day I also feel sick and hate myself. I know that people with bpd sometimes have false narratives in their head but I truly believe that no would could love me if they knew how many people I had slept with they would immediately leave. I think this is reasonable to presume especially because I am a woman. 
Even though I hate myself after I sleep with someone and I tell myself I don’t want to sleep with anyone whenever I leave the house and am in any social environment I find myself sizing everyone up deciding how attractive I am compared to others and who I could fuck. I’m in my 1st year at university as a mature student and I have been isolating myself because I’m scared that I’ll go out and embarrass myself but even now I sometimes get an intense desire to just drop my life and do porn.
On top of my sever hyper-sexuality I obviously have some problematic links. I say problematic because they are causing problems in my own life. When I am having sex I can only get off if I tell myself that they don’t care about me and I’m being used. Because of this I have put myself in dangerous situations multiple times that have resulted in my being harmed.

192,Job Rejection - Avoidance Coping and Anxiety," Hi,

Any skills for coping with job rejection? Would appreciate any advice or recommendation! Just received the rejection from the job I was eagerly looking forward to joining. It was the best match for me based on my educational background and interest. I really wanted to join that place!

A bit of background: I have lost confidence to apply at other places and am already facing extreme anxiety when I do job searches or prepare for interviews and do online courses. I am absolutely avoiding everything for the past 10 months and can't bring up myself to do job preparation or even check websites for job openings. My anxiety is very high and this was the only job I was looking forward to joining and had a positive interview experience. Now I'm completely bummed again. I am hopeless as I fear I have no choices left for myself because of my self-sabotaging behaviours related to job search. I am extremely fearful to even open my laptop and continue the online courses I had paid for in the past 8-10 months. I'm absolutely terrified to look for jobs again. I have left many tasks incomplete: discontinued online courses, stopped getting back at potential interviewers, stopped checking LinkedIn, dropped exercise regime, gave up on my diet, stopped socializing and now I can not even step outside my room. I feel there is no future for me.

I am badly struggling and I want to break this cycle.

My therapist will do DBT with me but we have not yet properly started and still going very slow. I am helpless and I can't spend more weeks or months staying in this helpless state.

Any skill that will help me at least pick up my pace again after long 10-month break? Please help me. I feel mentally stuck for the past 10 months and have lost many opportunities and discontinued my progress and tasks to this neverending anxiety.

But I'm hiding and avoiding and sitting alone in the dark. I know I'm avoiding things, I understand I find things overwhelming and I'm avoiding feelings not tasks. I know I could do some mindfulness or grounding, or work through a DBT workbook, or read schema therapy things online, or remind myself I can do things even though it feels unpleasant now and will be happier afterwards etc etc. I could do yoga or go for a nice walk.

I am 30 now and turning 31 soon. I still have no kids of my own and no partner. My relationships never last long because they have almost always been abusive. Ether psyically, sexually, verbally, emotionally, and mentally. I was also abused heavily as a child for many years too. And watched my mother get abused in abusive relationships also. So I cut them off when I start seeing signs of abuse now. So this nothing lasts long at all. Maybe 6-8months? Often less. But no guy listens they think there is something wrong with me even if I tell them I was abused. They think it's justified or something. I FEEL Men nowadays just don't care about women at all. And it is scary. I went to the doctor and I was told I am to infertile for IVF and I don't meet criteria for adoption without a partner. I made a post with only my closest friends on fb could see it, and all the men just blamed me as to why I don't have a partner by now or kids. And that no guy will want me and will think there is something wrong with me now. And honestly it is true. Every date I go on now, I'm heavily questioned what I did wrong to still be single... It didn't used to be this bad to date but recent years with social media, guys are acting emotionally abusive constantly in videos and it's being praised and considered ""normal"". I picked two comments from my post I can show but obviously I can't show them all. I feel I can only talk to my therapist. I feel I'm always to blame or it's always my fault.

After ditching her years ago and living life in denial and just feeling bitter about my traumas I am finally coming to terms with the fact that I am responsible for getting better and working on my mental health even if I'm not the one who caused it. 

Now I am in a loving relationship with the man of my dreams, he really is so stable and loving. We have been dating for two years. We have the same life/career goals and he's aware of my past traumas and is the most gentle and patient person I've ever met. He is someone I see myself spending the rest of my life with.

But the thing is we have been having these constant issues that stem from my bad behavior, and he has made me aware that he cannot keep going on in this relationship if it stays the way it has. Even though he's everything I could imagine in a partner and we have such amazing moments together, I am always snapping and arguing over little things. I'm constantly questioning whether or not he hates me and he said he cannot keep dating me if he has to reassure me that he won't break up with me every night before we go to bed. I am aware of these things I do and I know it stems from just how good the relationship is, it seems too good to be true and too good for me to deserve it. It stems from my traumas, my childhood neglect and abuse, as well as a previous long term verbally/physically/sexually etc. abusive relationship. He deserves to be treated with respect and he wants a tranquil relationship, I want to be the one to give that to him. I'm owning up to my toxic behavior and I want to fix it.

I was wondering if anyone has had these problems before and have some advice/resources as to how to go about setting proper behavioral boundaries for myself in the mean time while I go about finding a therapist and working with a professional on all of this. 

It will take several months for my insurance to be established before I can even start looking for a therapist and then years of working with professionals to get even close to being better but I don't want to lose such a good thing in the mean time and I know I'm worthy of living a good life and having a healthy relationship.

We are both in DBT so I knew when I got the text from her saying “I checked the facts and I don’t see our relationship benefiting my life worth living goals, it is unhealthy and destructive” I knew it was their therapist they talked to. I had ZERO idea that something was wrong. I listened to them. I believed them. I was so proud of them for their skill usage which I would help with when asked. I genuinely believed that everything was OK. They never came to me to tell me that something was wrong. We never talked about things being wrong. I thought we were fine when we would hang out just be like any other hang out when we would have a good time if we needed to cry on each other shoulders, we were able to do that with each other. And then they decided to message me that when I asked them what happened what did I do? They ignored me completely never got a response. I love and care about them so much they’re like the only family that gets me. I helped them through so many things, and supported them every step of the way. What did I do wrong? What happened? I’m confused, I’m angry, I’m hurt. Why do I keep ruining good things? What has gone wrong? Why can’t I stop destroying shit? I thought everything was fine and I fucking ruined it like I ruined everything else. It’s obvious I did something because they said I was destructive that I was unhealthy.

208,"Time to start working on recovery, one step at a time","I'm not in therapy currently, have really struggled finding a therapist who can help me with my BPD and CPTSD (my last one was awful, and when I tried going to my GP I've ended up on a 2 year long wait list for another service because they're unable to help me because of my trauma...).

My mental health is at a critical low at the moment and I've not been taking care of myself, but I need to make a change. So, I'm finally digging out the workbooks I've had for ages but barely touched. 

I've set myself a new schedule/routine to help me make time for it, and I'm going to try really hard. Did my first session with Dr Daniel Fox's Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook.

I've seen some of his videos, and they're always pretty insightful and the first chapter of the book seems really good so far - really helped me to pin down some of the possible causes of my BPD, what subtype my BPD is (self-destructive/discouraged) and my attachment type (fearful - explains a lot!). 

So I'm feeling fairly hopeful. I think it's going to be hard work, but I think this combined with some DBT books I have can help me get things in order the best I can.

209,Progress,"Life has been super tough the last couple of years. I have been formally diagnosed with BPD last year, from then I started doing therapy(but for the wrong reason). It was hard, especially when I stopped having sessions with my therapist because of the pandemic and when I found out I was pregnant. A lot of things happened beginning of this year that I was struggling to keep up. My symptoms has gotten worse(Probably my pregnancy hormones added to my bpd). My then boyfriend started telling me he wanted to break up because of my condition, that he couldn't save me. I never said I wanted him to save me, all I want is for someone to be there and support me. I didn't want to lose the only person whom I thought understand what I'm going through. I came from a broken family and I was trying my best not to let my child experience the same. He stayed but not as my boyfriend but just a person that didn't want me to die not because we're having a child. We were living together all throughout my first and second trimester. I'd say that was the worst time of my life. I was having suicidal thoughts every single day. Thinking he would be happy if I die because whenever he's mad he'd say ""he wants me out of his life"". I endured everything because I was hoping to make the relationship work. Then, I started having complications with my pregnancy and that was the time I decided to leave. I never told him anything about my pregnancy because he takes no interest. I saved not just myself but also my child's life. I'm happier now. I stopped having suicidal thoughts when I gave birth and finally don't feel hatred towards my baby's father for being absent and for not stepping up with me. I'm just thankful I left.

I just recently got married (for the third time) and I'm really trying hard to communicate better with my husband, be more forgiving of myself, and be mindful.

I've had 3 serious relationships in my adult life, all of them with other people who have complex comorbid psychiatric disorders of their own. Partner no 1: Depression/BPD/anxiety. Partner no 2: Mania/anxiety/SUD. Partner no 3: PTSD/DID/Bipolar I/possibly ASPD/SUD.

Each relationship was it's own spectacular disaster, each one more unhealthy & intense than the last. The final one especially has left me feeling broken.

As someone with BPD/OCPD and other psychiatric issues, am I just not meant to have a partner that has problems similar to mine? Is it just too much strain on a relationship, period? Or was the issue with my specific partners not being willing to get the treatment they need? I'd like to think someone who understands could be compatible with me.

216,What coping strategies worked for you?,"Hey all, this is my first time posting on reddit so I hope I'm doing this right. Also, just a quick warning for mention of suicide and ED's.

I was around 15/16 when I was first diagnosed with BPD and transferred to a specialist. I've been coping alright since (I am now 18), and l'd thought I improved quite a lot, however as of late l've noticed that l've fallen back into old habits and rather detrimental thought patterns. I've been especially disregulated the past few months, undoubtably provoked by a relapse in my disordered eating. Right now, my emotions have plateaued, and I'm able to think critically about my situation with a clear mind, so I'll use that as an opportunity to reach out and make some progress.

I'm operating under the assumption that my restrictive food intake has been the stressor triggering my states of emotional disfunction, however my ED is a seperate problem that runs so deep that it would be very difficult to just 'stop’. Because I'm not able to remove the trigger, I'm looking for ways to manage the resultant emotional tailspin.

Yesterday was definitely one of the worst yet - my head was clouded with blatantly untrue thoughts about my family and relationships which pushed me further down the pit of self isolation. Despite being in an objectively good place in life, l'd convinced myself there was no future for me and I had nothing to live for. That was probably the closest l'd been to actually going through with my plans to end my life since my last attempt in early 2023. A few hours pass, I listen to some music, and I feel fantastic. Super productive, I'm on top of the world and nobody can stop me. It's exhausting being stuck in this cycle of utter despair and what I can only describe as borderline narcissism. It feels like my brain is split in two, and I just can't seem to get that horrible part of me ur control. It's a constant battle between critical thinking and utter delusion. 

My friends, family and therapists are fantastic, but as bystanders they can only do so much. I have EMDR booked for the end of the year, but in the interim I need to lock in and really commit to my personal development. My question is, does anyone have any coping mechanisms/ self-help that genuinely worked for them? I don't care how niche or odd it may be, I just want some advice that isn't ""read a book"" or ""go on a walk"" - not that these aren't valid control strategies, it's just difficult to convince your mind to go on a walk when you're consumed by hopelessness.

I want to get better. I cannot keep living like this, it's hurting the people I love and corrupting my mind. So, please let me know what helped you. Anything is appreciated.

217,Shame?,"Hi! Wondering if anyone else experiences this, because I have trouble communicating this into words on Google in order to see if this is common.

I will randomly have memories of things I’ve done and immediately get an intense feeling of shame/embarrassment and sometimes will even be paralyzed. For example, I was walking home the other night and remembered something I did with my FP four years ago (!) and I was so ashamed I literally froze and stopped walking completely. Or I’ll be washing dishes and remember something mean I said in like, the sixth grade, and I’ll freeze for a bit and it’s like there’s a cloud that filters everything else around me except for that painful memory. Sometimes it’s so intense I’ll shout something out to “snap out of it”. It sounds silly but if I’m at home alone I’ll shout, “I love you, Holly!” which is my dog’s name. 

Is this dissociation? Is this just feeling a negative emotion very strongly? Is this some kind of emotional paralysis? I know the solution (or at least, I can hear my therapist say it) and I know I need to practice self compassion, meditate to stay present, and catch these thoughts. But sometimes these memories and subsequent emotions are so very crippling.",1646308172.0,False,10,7,moods-,None,t5ptjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/t5ptjc/shame/
218,I have sex repulsion that’s been spreading even to being repulsed by romantic relationships after a traumatic breakup,"I was/am deeply in love with my first love. We’ve been broken up for almost a year now. I idealized them so much and they felt like a god to me at times. I’m demisexual so they were the first person I felt comfortably sexual with (all online, we never met in person thankfully) and I really felt like I gave myself to them and I would tell them that. They had a porn addiction and would cheat on me online and hide it from me, which led to huge suicidal breakdowns. I felt really violated and degraded from it but I couldn’t leave them. I have bad jealousy and passiveness issues to begin with and this fueled them, causing intrusive thoughts (I have a lot of pure ocd symptoms) and worsened my sex repulsion so much. They broke up with me but wanted to stay in contact as friends but they led me on that we’d get back together again (not on purpose). Months later I find out they are in their first in person relationship with someone and was hiding it from me bc they were scared of how I’d react bc of my bpd. I blocked them on everything after this. I now have this repulsion/phobia of romantic relationships. It makes me not want to see/talk to people in relationships. It’s just so triggering and causes jealousy and intrusive thoughts of my ex with their current partner. I feel so ashamed and pathetic from this. I feel scared and uncomfortable with people who have sex. I can’t even talk to my current DBT therapist about this partly bc she’s married. I’ve told her about my sex repulsion a bit. I don’t know how to fix this but I hate it and want to think normally. I’m on Prozac and am slowly increasing to 80mg which is the dosage for OCD. I want to try EMDR when I graduate DBT.

Hope it helps some people ❤️ please feel free to let me know what you think, if you can relate, and if you have found something else that has worked for you

\-

For those of us who grew up in invalidating environments, our realities and experiences were often denied. This may have looked like a caregiver telling us to “stop being so sensitive” or saying “it’s not a big deal”. As children we learn that we can not trust our own internal experiences and this sense of distrust within ourselves remains with us in adulthood. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, this feeling intensified as I started to question whether my reactions were valid or if it was my “disorder”. This was harmful because I began justifying other people’s toxic behaviours and using my diagnosis as an excuse to justify & rationalise my own unhealthy behaviours. Having my personality labelled as “disordered” reinforced my self-distrust.

Now when I experience intense emotional reactions, rather than telling myself “It’s my BPD talking” and dismissing my experience-

* I remind myself that my emotions are always valid. (This doesn’t mean that my actions are always okay).
* I give myself time and space to feel calmer, which may involve going on a walk, taking a shower or journalling.
* When I’m feeling calmer, which can sometimes take days, I take the time to think about the situation from different perspectives and come to a wise mind conclusion or decision (this is easier said than done and has taken lots and lots of practice).
* I also remind myself that sometimes I won’t have an answer, make the right decision or do the thing that’s most helpful, and that’s okay. I am still human, I will make mistakes and that’s okay.

When we practice putting space between our big feelings and our reactions, and take the time to try and look at all sides of a situation, the message we send ourselves is “I trust myself and my ability to handle difficult situations”. This practice can help us move towards repairing the relationship we have with ourselves and our inner world.",1681900119.0,False,36,9,Jembaby24,None,12rolri,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/12rolri/is_it_me_or_bpd/
220,Is this behaviour actually healthy?,"My 19 year old sister has BPD and gets angry really easily. She gets mad at our family over mistakes we make that we often have little control over. I understand that with BPD you have a lot of emotions so it’s hard to control anger and I don’t hold that against her. But it’s still really exhausting. When she gets angry, she deals with it by locking herself away in her room and not talking to anyone for the rest of the day (and sometimes this can go on for days). She says that it’s healthy because she needs the space to deal with her emotions and if she stays around other people she might scream at us and she doesn’t want to do that. I appreciate that she knows her limits and understand that needing space for yourself is healthy, but I also feel really uncomfortable and anxious at the fact that she spends that much time alone and not communicating with anyone. Getting silent treatment is difficult and scary. I’m completely fine with her needing time for herself, but I wish she didn’t need that much time. Like a few hours is okay, but a whole day or more makes me feel really really anxious especially because she’s angry over mistakes people make, with no one intending to hurt or upset her. Am I overreacting? Should I talk to her about how I feel? She sees a therapist so I could suggest that they talk about my sister’s anger. 

Tl;dr: when my sister with BPD gets angry over people’s mistakes, she locks herself away and/or gives everyone silent treatment for the day (and this can go on for days).

7,TMS therapy for BPD?," Hi!

I am 22m, diagnosed with BPD. I have tried so many things, been constantly diagnosed and rediagnosed. I've seen therapists, homeopathic therapists, psychologists, and completed an intensive outpatient therapy program. I have tried CBT, DBT, talk therapy, EMDR, and group therapy. I recently started with a new therapist with a mental health treatment system. My responses during our intake session tagged me as a potential candidate for TMS.

I haven't seen much about TMS for BPD and was hoping to hear from folks who have BPD and tried TMS. I have three therapists right now (two individual and a group facilitator), and have talked to the group facilitator and the new therapist, and they didn't have a lot of info for me. I'm going to talk to the other therapist, who I've been seeing for years, and hear his thoughts, as well as talk to the TMS therapist, but I would really like first-hand accounts if I can get them.",1703880646.0,False,2,10,worthlessinsum,None,18tw66e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18tw66e/tms_therapy_for_bpd/

11,BPDlovedones…helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I’m talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It’s all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that’s for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don’t really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I’m sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally. I feel like I’m trapped in the mind of a five year old as well trapped in the mind of 1000 year old person. I feel like I’ve lived 1000 lives and sometimes I’m not sure what’s real, what’s a delusion, and what is fact. This is why I love neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. It gives me explanations for why I am experiencing an emotion, why I am reacting to it, and to just remind myself that it’s not that big of a deal. I don’t want to make excuses for people who cannot take accountability of their actions however. I used to do that and thinking about it makes me ashamed. My mother has BPD and is closing in on 50. I have only repaired my relationship with her this year out of pity after cutting her off just as other people did. I understand how she does not see how her actions affect people, and that’s why the mental illness makes relationships difficult. She seems to think that she raised me perfectly fine even though sometimes I didn’t have food and we were homeless at one point and she constantly screamed in my face and hit me. She never hugged me. She never told me she loved me. I never felt like she was my mother. I don’t have a father. I don’t have siblings. I don’t have aunts and uncles. I grew up extremely lonely and the thing I struggle with the most as an adult is abandonment. I think I fear the way I felt as a child. I have had the thought “it will never get better” for as long as I can remember. And now I look around at the life I have created. With the person who I think is the love of my life, my wonderful friends and support systems, my education in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience, my ability to travel to different countries, and ability to have my own things. And yet there’s still a sense of chaos in my life and nothing can ever be stable. Am I doomed to live this way forever? All I want to do is fix this. And I don’t even know what “this” is. I fully support psychoactive compound therapy. From my readings of academic literature, and personal experiences, I think building neuroplasticity through psychoactive treatment is a key component to mental health rehabilitation. You obviously can’t just give people psychedelics and say go crazy—it needs to be monitored, and patients need directed therapy while they are experiencing altered states of consciousness. Becoming extremely emotional, and vulnerable has caused me so much grief, but has allowed me to discover so much about life and help me build extremely close personal relationships with people so I can learn more and give back to the field of neuropsychopharmacology.",1692082128.0,False,14,10,pthevslayer,None,15rku5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15rku5z/bpdlovedoneshelpful_or_harmful_idk_who_cares/

13,Best kind of threapy for relationship abuse recovery??,"Was recently heavily abused by my ex who also has BPD. Both psyically and mentally. It was pretty bad. He is now facing jail upto 3 years including the cases from his previous ex. 

I'm now a shell of my old self. Today I was looking through all my old posts on Instagram and I cried. Because I mentally had forgotten who I was and how confident and happy I was back then. I didn't even realize at the time how much I had found myself back then. How free I was.. how courageous and inspiring and truly just nothing but my unapologetic self not letting anything hold me back. Fast forward 8 months and I'm a mess.

15,"Disturbance of the sense of self is core to BPD: So developing the ""Healthy Adult"" is the solution, given that framing.","One of the primary goals of healing work is to develop the Health Adult.

&#x200B;

Specifically, developing the Healthy Adult is an important piece of developing earned secure attachment.

&#x200B;

The Healthy Adult is confident, balanced, in touch with their emotions, and able to relate well with others. Everyone has a Healthy Adult to varying degree of development.

The Healthy Adult can be understood as having two major groupings of positive traits:

1. Strength based traits

&#x200B;

The strength based traits are comprised of (drawing from Jeffrey Young’s ‘Healthy Adult Mode’, Dan Brown’s ‘Best Self’, and The Third School of Cognitive Therapy’s metacognitive skills):

&#x200B;

Healthy self-definition (knowing who you are and what you are about)

Assertiveness

A well developed sense of agency (internal locus of control)

Well developed ability to explore

Healthy self esteem

Metacognitive skills

Stress tolerance and emotional self-regulation skills

&#x200B;

2. Attachment and Connection based traits

&#x200B;

The attachment based traits of the healthy adult are (drawing form Brown & Elliott 2016 and Allan Schore):

&#x200B;

Desire to protect others and expectation that loved ones protect self

Ability to attune to others and the expectation of attunement from others

Ability to physically comfort and soothe and expectation to receive the same

Support of explorations of loved ones and expectation of support from them and

getting and giving guidance

Physical and mental entrainment/synchronization with loved ones which creates a sense of belonging

Ability to trust

Generosity

&#x200B;

So how can you strengthen the Healthy Adult Mode?

&#x200B;

To be fair, there are likely many ways.

&#x200B;

However, the means that I know of to do this work is through guided visualization meditations in which you embody these qualities.

I know why I feel that way  and have recognized that this statement is not true based on evidence to the contrary but that thought just won’t fucking go away. 

So basically I’m asking:

Been to the doctor and nothing seems to be wrong. Mentally, I'm pretty sure I have BPD, I have depression (been on meds for 2 years), and definitely on the autism spectrum. Been to therapy and a psychiatrist as well. 
My life feels unbelievably hard. I'm SO tired all the time. To the point where I'm bored, I want to be up and doing things but I'm just so tired. I won't even get up and eat, or make anything, so I'd rather starve all day instead. (Which is my main problem. I just don't eat enough.) I have 2 dogs that I didn't think I'd be raising alone, and recently quit a job that I hated and made my life even worse.

I am beyond lucky to have him. I feel like I'm letting him down with my habits even if he doesn't look down on me and just wants me to be happy and healthy. He is truly the love of my life and I want to be better.

Not sure why I am writing this. I am 21. And I am losing hope. My borderline patterns started at 12. And they keep getting worse and more complicated with time. Never been in proper therapy. I was not compliant. Never found a good therapist. Was just heavily medicated with antipsychotics. But my patterns? Worse and worse with time. Dad died at 18.

Just following with a convenient psychiatrist for the time. But no real change. Just staying afloat. CBT doesn’t work.

Was stuck in a toxic FP situation for 3 years. Took my emotions and energy and complicated things. Much older person (3 times my age) and was pretty much groomed at 18. Finally left him . I was clingy desperate for a toxic person.

But I am always emotionally promiscuous anyway. Any guy shows the slightest bit of attention, I run into his arms regardless of red flags.

25,What Is the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD?," Mental Disorders (DSM).

There's no biologically based test to definitively diagnose borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, mental health professionals often use screening instruments such as the MSI-BPD to help identify the likelihood of BPD and the need for further evaluation and treatment.

Scoring of the MSI-BPD

Each item is rated as a ""1"" if it is present and a ""0"" if it is absent, and items are totaled for possible scores from 0 to 10. A score of 7 is considered a valid diagnostic cutoff, meaning that a score of 7 or higher indicates that you likely meet the criteria for a BPD diagnosis.2

The first eight items of the MSI-BPD represent the first eight DSM-IV/5 diagnostic criteria for BPD, while the last two items assess the final DSM-IV/5 criterion, i.e., **paranoia/dissociation.**

## Uses for the MSI-BPD

Clinicians use the MSI-BPD to diagnose BPD, sometimes in conjunction with other screening tools. Research suggests the MSI-BPD is helpful in detecting BPD in the general population,3 but more studies are needed.

The MSI-BPD test has been shown to be very effective in detecting possible BPD in people who are seeking or have a history of treatment for mental health problems.

## Psychometric Properties

The MSI-BPD has demonstrated valid, reliable psychometric properties. It has adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. It has also demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for detecting borderline personality disorder when a score of 7 is used as a diagnostic cutoff.

[**Coping With Borderline Personality Disorder**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095SHGB9N) 

## Other Screening Tools

The MSI-BPD is only one of several that clinicians typically use to diagnose BPD. These include the following.  


Structured Clinical Interview

This official clinical interview of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is an update of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) but is very similar.4 Your mental health professional may use this screening tool to help determine your diagnosis by asking you questions directly related to the criteria for BPD that are listed in the DSM-5.

This screening instrument also has an optional self-reporting questionnaire with 108 questions, but not all clinicians who choose the SCID-5-PD use this. 

Causes of Borderline Personality Disorder

PDQ-4

The Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire, 4th Edition (PDQ-4) screening test consists of 99 true-or-false questions that can help screen for various personality disorders, including BPD.5

Zanarini Rating Scale

The Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD), also developed by Dr. Zanarini, is used for patients who have already been diagnosed with BPD to test for changes over time.1

Which Tool Is Best?

A recent study comparing correlations, sensitivity, and specificity among the MSI-BPD, PDQ-4, and SCID-II in adolescents and young adults showed they were equally effective in predicting a BPD diagnosis.6 On the other hand, another study concluded that the PDQ-4 ""should not be used in clinical practice as a screening instrument for PD assessment.""7

## Impact of BPD Screening

BPD is challenging to diagnose and treat because it's so often misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder and other conditions. Further complicating the issue is that BPD often exists with comorbidities, including bipolar disorder, and poses a significant risk of suicide.8 That makes accurate screening tools such as the MSI-BPD particularly important.  


Once BPD is diagnosed, the clinician can develop a treatment plan to address it. This might include such targeted approaches as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), which has been shown to be effective for people with BPD.8  


## Potential Pitfalls of the MSI-BPD

Tests such as the MSI-BPD provide a picture of person's mental status only at a particular point in time. Astute clinicians additionally take into account the person's patterns of behavior over time.9

&#x200B;

BPD is a particularly difficult disorder to diagnose and treat. Research indicates that the MSI-BPD is a valuable tool in this effort, however, and takes very little time to complete. Based on the results, a clinician can then help you address BPD's challenges and learn healthy ways to cope with and regulate your emotional states and responses.",1647850548.0,False,3,1,redditerX75,None,tj6rq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/tj6rq5/what_is_the_mclean_screening_instrument_for_bpd/
26,From the other side of recovery: realizations after 10 years of therapy,"I no longer identify with my BPD and rapid-cycling bipolar diagnoses, mostly because I do not fear abandonment like I used to, and I have fewer extreme highs/lows. It took 10 years of weekly therapy (sometimes 3 sessions a week) and lots of meditation/DBT/studying Buddhism, but I think I'm finally there. I told my therapist two months ago that I was ready to stop seeing her and try to work through things all on my own. 

It's been going really well, and my family has been supportive of my decision. I think they can see how much I've changed, which makes me really proud of myself. I've been considering whether my decision to end therapy was just another BPD splitting thing or manic decision. After two months of being locked in the same house with my family (thx COVID), it's clear that I've actually made progress, so I made a list of things that I am grateful for because of therapy/recovery from BPD--on the other side of it.

1) Having BPD means that you've been through the lowest of mental lows. I can't count how many times I felt like I was physically dying because of a BPD-related fear/sadness. Once you get better at managing BPD, you'll realize that other people don't have past experiences like that to help balance catastrophic anxiety. We already know what ""the worst"" feels like, so it's not as scary. And we know it'll get better (life has its own mood swings), even though that's hard to remember. Ngl-- knowing how deep in the dark I've been makes me feel kinda badass for making it out.

2) Our emotional depth lets us experience life in the most immersive way. Humans have something like 30,000 emotions, but I swear the people I know have 10 max. The capacity to feel is what makes life worth living. When you can manage how you respond emotionally to things, this is probably our superpower imo.

3) Compassion. The drama, trauma, and general intensity that comes with BPD has put me through a lot. Like with any hardship, getting through it has made me aware of how life is tough on all of us. I crossed paths with SO many people who had no idea I was struggling with BPD, and I'm grateful that some of them showed me compassion when I had hurt them. Now, when someone is unkind to me, I recognize that it probably has nothing to do with me. Everyone is going through something, and we're all just doing our best.

4) DBT skills are just awesome in general for everyone. I've had psychologically-sound friends tell me they need advice (read: anxiously rant while I make a mental list of DBT skills that could help them). When I share the skills that have worked for me, I realize that DBT was a HUGE stepping stone that helped me become more emotionally healthy and self-aware than the average person without a mental health diagnosis.

5) This one is personal, because I don't know how many people with BPD experience symptoms from a young age. I was diagnosed at 15 years old, and I am now 21. (My parents sent me to therapy for anxiety when I was 11, so 10 years of that). I can't believe how far I've come in terms of emotional maturation, and I'm still so young. It just makes me excited for future personal growth:)

TLDR; If you're working on recovering from BPD, you're doing great! Recovery helped me develop mental strength, capacity for emotional connection, compassion, widely-applicable DBT skills, and a better future.",1586820768.0,False,57,10,pancakes904,None,g0uafg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/g0uafg/from_the_other_side_of_recovery_realizations/
27,I feel my neighbor keeps tabs on me..,"It makes me feel uncomfortable. She also is friends with my uncle and she always notices how often I'm coming out of the house or how many times I've stepped outside. Which is crazy to me. She knows when I haven't come out for a week or so when I go into a depressive episode and assumes I have mental illness without me ever telling her... 

Unless she watches me all day I don't know how she can know these things. Or know exactly how many times I'm leaving my house. It's making me just want to stay inside even more knowing she is watching me and my every move, and makes me anxious that other neighbors may be doing the same.

Then she looked at my stomach and told me I should exercise more and get in shape .... When I already suffer a eating disorder and was having trouble standing just from the fact I have not been eating lately. (That is something I have struggled with for 10+ years. I do get therapy but it's still not her business to say something like that. I ate a tomato and that is all I have eaten all day. And now I regret even eating that ). 

I feel anything I tell her she thinks is a lie. She stands super close to me when we talk and it makes me feel so anxious and uncomfortable. At first I thought she was a lovely lady, but now I'm not to sure. It's getting abit out of hand.

28,Struggling with some things in regard to DBT treatment.,"Hi guys. Thanks for your time. I'm living in the UK, and have had CBT and counselling. I found that neither of those were helpful. DBT is, but my only option to self administer. I've already noticed that distress is much easier to tolerate, I'm more mindful, etc. It's nice.

However - there are certain things I'm struggling with, and dont know what skills to apply to combat. These are two things.

The first of which is the awareness of futility, and fear of the future. I am painfully aware of the fact that tomorrow, my entire family could die, or I could face brutal abuse, and no amount of therapy skills could help me. Frankly, the world can be a horrible and cruel place, and it makes any amount of self improvement feel almost counterintuitive, and as though as the smart solution is to...Off yourself. I won't, I'm just aware of this thought pattern, and I think it impacts my commitment to the treatment.

The second is my struggle in identifying which of my interpersonal needs are valid, and which may be unfair. For example - my boyfriend and I had a fight last night because I felt as though he never listens to me (I was showing him YouTube videos, and he rolled over and groaned). Objectively very rude - but what degree of response is warranted? Or the time I got upset with him over something I completely made up in my head, and was quite unpleasant about? In the moment - how do you distinguish, find, and calmly communicate your own fair needs as a person from mental illness symptoms when they often feel identical?",1698636329.0,False,5,6,recovet,None,17jkbv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17jkbv2/struggling_with_some_things_in_regard_to_dbt/
29,Relationships with other people w/ complex comorbid psychiatric disorders?,"(26m) Over the past 10 years of my life I've seen a multitude of therapists & other mental healthcare providers, and I've been diagnosed with Bipolar I/PTSD/BPD/OCPD/anxiety/SUD. 

I've had 3 serious relationships in my adult life, all of them with other people who have complex comorbid psychiatric disorders of their own. Partner no 1: Depression/BPD/anxiety. Partner no 2: Mania/anxiety/SUD. Partner no 3: PTSD/DID/Bipolar I/possibly ASPD/SUD.

Each relationship was it's own spectacular disaster, each one more unhealthy & intense than the last. The final one especially has left me feeling broken.

As someone with BPD/OCPD and other psychiatric issues, am I just not meant to have a partner that has problems similar to mine? Is it just too much strain on a relationship, period? Or was the issue with my specific partners not being willing to get the treatment they need? I'd like to think someone who understands could be compatible with me.

For reference, I have been in therapy & on meds since I was 17, but due to relationship trauma my mental health has only gotten worse over the years.",1651526085.0,False,13,3,SaveYourSelf_FromSin,None,ugzwnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ugzwnm/relationships_with_other_people_w_complex/
30,I hit my ab*sive partner in a argument..,"TW: relationship psyical/mental/sexual abuse and childhood abuse

Quick backstory, I have never been psyical to anyone before. But the last two relationships I've been in I have. Including the last one it has now been 3 times in total. My last relationship was incredibly mentally, emotionally, and psychologically abusive along with sexually. I'd wake up to him doing things to me when I told him multiple times not to. This relationship I'm in now is mostly psychological, mental, and emotional. The ones before were sexually and psyically abusive. Why so many abusive relationships? I had a very long childhood were I was hurt daily sexually by a family member for 10 years. Then I saw my mother constantly in abusive relationships. Even after years of threapy I still end up back in these situations sometimes. But I am getting better at leaving alot sooner. My last relationship it's like something snapped. All the years of abuse in my past bulit up and I could not handle it anymore. I was psyical with them on one occasion even though they weren't psyical with me.(in a abusive way e.g. hit them/pushed them ) After that I never did it to them again.  And in no healthy relationship have I ever felt anywhere near this way before ether. I never felt a loss of control or that I was losing my mind. 

Now with my current partner we both have bpd. But I am like a mouse. I am rarely angry or raise my voice. I do not question him out of fear for how mad he gets. He is mentally very very abusive but not psyically. Yesterday I told him not to yell or I would walk away. I stood up to him for once. This made him much much madder. It went on for awhile and I was tired of being told horrible things and constantly having to bow down to him and not say anything. I told him I will snap and do something I will regret if he doesn't stop yelling and degrading me right now. That I am not in control right now. I tried to exit the room and he followed me and put his face right up close to mine were it was touching and proceeded to yell and yell and after multiple warnings he kept telling me to hit him and then saying awful things to me. I then punched him in the eye. I went to call police and he wrestled the phones out of my hand. So I feel awful right now for hitting him. I honestly do and it's not in my personality to do this. There's a certain point I can no longer tolerate mentally. I know what I did was bad and inexcusable. We are both still in therapy. He does individual and we both do couples.  I am aware I need to leave him but right now it's much more involved then some would think as we brought a home together and we split bills/loans etc and right now I'm just working on a plan to leave but it takes time. 


Regardless, I just feel I am a monster in this instance. He was not psyical to me but I was to him. I don't deserve him. But I am still in shock and dissociation that this happened. I guess I just needed to vent. I don't expect anyone to be understanding. I don't think I'm deserving of any credit here or anything, I just really needed to talk and vent right now. I honestly can't wrap my head around it and I feel so overwhelmed my epilepsy has been in full swing and all I feel like doing is watching childrens cartoons and cuddling giant teddy bears at 30 something years old..",1683652298.0,False,0,7,Street_Cat101,None,13czm9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/13czm9m/i_hit_my_absive_partner_in_a_argument/

I’ve just been diagnosed bpd by an nhs psychiatrist. I feel so lost and abandoned by the health care system and family/ friends. Both my family and friends are in denial or underplaying my condition which I didn’t expect this reaction and the worst is the nhs are so underfunded they only are giving me group therapy which still start in 4-8 weeks. I am beyond gutted and broken by all of this I feel I am screaming and no one hears/ sees me. I don’t know what to do.... I was also really surprised with my diagnosis, I understand I have had a very traumatic life up to 21yrs (now) but I had no idea I had a mental illness. Any advice would be so appreciated I feel so alone in this world right now. The only person I have is my boyfriend but due to work he is living abroad for 1yr plus and covid I can’t see him. He tries so hard to understand what I’m going through but I feel no one gets it and this unbearable pain inside me. I have struggled with addiction in the past and after finding out I don’t have any help I’ve gone back to using. I’m so disappointed in myself but I can’t live with this pain it’s too much bare. Group therapy can’t be useful I told them I’m not comfortable to share my past with strangers and they just said pay for private then even though I’m on a typical salary of a 21 year old so that obviously not going to happen.

I am a therapist based in Australia who received a BPD diagnosis a few years ago (although I believe I no longer meet criteria) and has been facilitating DBT groups for the past year.

I am not exactly sure what this would look like, it would not be traditional/formal therapy - but I am thinking about starting a structured online DBT group or offer one-on-one online meetings where I could offer support.

35,Advice on shame/anxiety when plans go wrong/differently,"hey, I’m diagnosed with BPD with a family history of OCD and autism, so generally as a unit things not going according to plan can be very upsetting and frustrating. I was wondering if anyone has advice on how they worked to overcome this?


Example of what happened tonight leading me to reach out:
Because of my procrastination anxiety I didn’t start my homework until later in the day, that is my fault I’m usually better bout it; It was harder to focus today. I finally start, and only get 15 minutes in to what is planned to be an all nighter to prep for a Chem exam I have to make up. I’m already behind because of other mental health stuff and the prof was gracious enough to give me extensions. So, as I’m beginning chemistry after finishing English; the Wi-Fi goes out. I’ve reset it a few times and nothing; we are also currently having a really bad wind/rainstorm so I believe it’s an outside issue. It’s closed a road near me and has knocked power somewhere else. 


I’m proud with how I handled it tonight mostly,
I got really upset, and cursed quietly to myself out loud instead of raising a massive fuss. I’m not great with tech stuff and I’m also too short to see over the router, so I had to wake my brother up to ask him where the button was & how to flip it. He knows it finals for me so he was understanding, just sleepy. When i realized there was nothing I could do, I started to cry. I let myself cry as much as I could, with my own issues I tend to not cry much at a time, but a little is better than nothing. After that, I did something I usually don’t do in the past out of shame/fear; I emailed my professor. I let him know what was going on, and to let me know what he believes the best course of action should be first today. 
Since, I’ve been trying to take care of myself before bed. I’m bout to shower and I just smoked and took an edible.


 My problem is I’m still dealing with immense anger, shame, stress, anxiety, and fear over not getting to do my plan. I have whatever the “quiet” form of bpd is referred to, I forget the name; but I internalize things rather than externalize mostly. 
So I’m moving and functioning but inside I am heavily beating myself up over something currently out of my control, and for something I’ve already put myself accountable to.
How do you all cope with these feelings? Any advice would be awesome and appreciated. I’m in and out of therapy rn and trying to find a dbt place that takes my insurance.

I'm not diagnosed with BPD, I'm not diagnosed with anything, I live in a shitty country where mental health just doesn't exist.

39,Cutting people off after healing,"Last year my partner and I broke up for many, many reasons, most of which stemmed from my untreated (at the time) BPD and his avoidant behavior and overall hyper independent nature. A classic combo. Our breakup broke me in many ways, but 2023 ended up being the best year of my life because I started going therapy every week, taking medication, learning how to be alone, and forming positive relationships in my life. I still struggle deeply with my BPD, but I've gotten better at identifying my emotions as they arise. This does not mean I have completely changed my behaviors or emotions themselves.

About a month ago, my ex and I reconnected. For some reasons, a relationship isn't feasible for us however the love and friendship is still there. He is still a solitary person and has his own mental health struggles that he hasn't really addressed. He hinted at us being in an ""open relationship,"" since when we are together now, we are loving and affectionate and to him I am the first person he wants to see. But because of our time constraints we both know that we can't fully devote ourselves to each other.

Very quickly into our reconnection, I've noticed that many of my old thought patterns, triggers, and behaviors have arisen. It honestly scares me; I've been really good this year when dating other people to mitigate toxic patterns and I've overall worked really hard to be different. At this point I don't know if it's just him who causes me this pain (because of our history, our love, and his avoidant tendencies) or if I am simply not healed. It is probably both. But he wants us to remain in each other's lives and honestly I do too. But there is a chasm of distance between us and it breaks me. And feeling shitty all the time has taken such a toll on me, because after our falling out last year I vowed to never feel this way again.

I feel sad at the idea of cutting him out completely but I honestly don't know how to feel okay with him in my life or if it is even worth it. I feel so conflicted and I wish I didn't feel anything.

But after my last hospitalization I told myself I was going to change my life and was no longer gonna let my life be ruled by my BPD. It’s almost exactly a year since I was hospitalized and I don’t recognized the person I used to be. I used to be so skeptical of DBT or any therapy/therapists because I thought I was smarter than them/it. It seriously seemed so dumb to me for so long which is why I never received treatment when I was younger. I can’t attribute all of my recovery to DBT but I did find it more helpful than anything else. Anyway the point of this is that YOU CAN CHANGE NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT SEEMS LIKE YOU CANNOT. I realized I’m too smart to be blaming my mental illnesses and instead dedicated months of my life to researching how to heal myself and change my life. At this point I no longer fit the criteria for BPD diagnosis. There is this indescribable sadness or emptiness that came with recovery though- after realizing how much of my life I missed out of, how much my identity was tied to bpd, how many of my life decisions came out of my inability to regulate my emotions, etc. but there is hope in this emptiness … I can create the person I want to become and u can too",1675293186.0,False,17,2,pinklilies27,None,10r9fw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/10r9fw1/i_think_im_recovered/
41,Am I crazy or did I use my skills/boundaries properly?,"(Originally posted in r/BPD but since I'm in recovery for awhile with my BPD I thought posting here would be better)

Update as of 10/13:

//My husband and I ended up looking through other messages between social medias we used together to come to terms with their behavior and again, find more patterns because I'm still trying to fight against their gaslighting. What we found was years worth of posts switching between talking absolute ill of our friend group and idolizing me, dragging and making very long hateful posts anytime one of us ended up in a relationship, the amount of hate and jealousy filled posts related to me was so nauseating that I've been sick for the past 15 hours. There's a lot more but I don't think it's quite on topic for this thread.

I feel much more confident and happy with myself that I was able to control my emotions regarding this situation and know I really did make the right decision. Thank you everyone for the support as well 🧡//

Long story short I had to end a friendship recently due to my boundaries not being respected and asking for mutual respect/support in specific areas of my life.

 I've brought them up for over a year until it got to a point where I needed to take time away to think about my future relationship with this person as their actions were not only harming me mentally but settling into my relationship with my husband and kids (my husband is aware of my diagnosis and is very patient with me. However, I did split more regularly during the times after interacting with this person which initially made us realize maybe I needed to reevaluate the friendship.) I've been going to therapy for my BPD for 6 years, know my subtypes, know my triggers, know when I need to step away and use wise mind. I have multiple workbooks that he and I do together in between the times I don't have therapy to keep up with my recovery as I very much want to work on myself and have for years.

Here is where I feel like I'm crazy: after bringing up that we needed time away from each other and go our separate lives and stating why, I am hearing from others that they're telling people that I abused them. That I sent hateful messages and that I was clearly devaluing them because they've been researching BPD for a little. I was very confused. Had my MIL, FIL and other family look at the messages. They said what I said wasn't hateful. I even showed my therapist and she said no and that I shouldn't be made to feel guilty for putting my kids first regardless of my diagnosis or not.

Am I crazy? Did my black and white thinking kick in? Or did I truly do the right thing and trusted myself? So many people use my diagnosis against me and many times I have to spend DAYS making decisions so I can make sure I'm not reacting out of pure emotion. However, this is my family and they ARE more important to me than anything else. I know after this I don't want them around me or my family ever again anyways, especially for what lies they're spreading. 

Being a mom with BPD is hard but I will always put them first. Their safety and security is most important to me. So why do I still feel bad for ending this friendship?

To update as of today as well with talking with my therapist; she mentioned that my friend is probably a covert narcissist and that it is common for them to shift blame, lie, and fake memory issues to avoid accountability. And since I have BPD that my friend probably dipped and played into that against me, especially since i was never originally diagnosed with it during the start of our friendship.",1697085744.0,False,4,3,WanderingFoxWitch,None,175yhrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/175yhrw/am_i_crazy_or_did_i_use_my_skillsboundaries/

The long and short of it is that I just had to breakup with my live-in boyfriend, block my dad and stop talking to my FP in the period of a week. I have one friend left but she's getting tired of me. I just feel so low and don't know what to do. All I know is I'm sick of begging arguing fighting and emotionally manipulating people to get basic care and have a support system. Is me being mentally ill and trans really so bad that everyone leaves me in mass or am I just surrounded by toxic people. I feel like all I do is go to therapy and work on myself so hard just so the same toxic people don't leave me so I'm not alone.

43,Struggling with people believing my diagnosis,"Hey guys. I was told I had bpd at 17, officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist at 18. At the time I pretty much had 8/9 of the symptoms, but I was never overly impulsive. I’ve been in and out of therapy since I was 13 for about a decade. If you like using the subtypes, most of my symptoms lined up with quiet or discouraged bpd (or even high functioning bpd). After a lot of work, I got to a place where I felt stable and my symptoms were manageable. I’m back in therapy now that the symptoms are becoming more intense and unmanageable and my new therapist said the very same sentence almost everyone* (everyone new, my old friends and family do not say this) in my life keeps telling me: you don’t seem like you have borderline. 

I am starting to become more and more frustrated that the better I am at controlling myself and my symptoms, the more people dismiss those symptoms. I spent years without dealing with suicidal thoughts and those came back this past year. My mood swings and paranoid thoughts are more intense than ever before. But no one seems to believe that I am struggling because…? I guess because I am not screaming at them? Or yelling hysterically? It took a lot of work to get to where I am, and now that I am experiencing a setback, it’s frustrating that people won’t acknowledge I am struggling until I reach a breaking point. Has anyone, especially those with discouraged bpd or if your symptoms are more inwards rather than outward, dealt with this? How do you explain to someone that just because you are using coping and dbt skills to manage symptoms it doesn’t mean that they aren’t there? This is the worst my mental health has been in years and getting dismissed isn’t helping.

44,What is wise mind in DBT?,"Have you ever snapped at someone and surprised yourself with how harsh you sounded?

You may have thought, *whoa… where did that come from?!*

You were probably acting from what’s called “Emotion Mind” in DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy). DBT is a therapy methodology developed by Marsha Linehan which helps people feel more in control of their thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

When in emotion mind, people react based on their mood, without taking logic into account.

**You May Be in Emotion Mind If:**

* You’re reacting quickly, without thinking things through
* You’re acting on urges without taking into account your long-term goals
* You’re behaving impulsively and aren’t considering potential consequences of your actions
* You want to hurt who hurt you, even if you’re not typically a vengeful person
* You’re not considering anyone else’s feelings or additional context of the situation

On the other end of the spectrum is Reasonable Mind, which is rational, logical and steady.

You might be thinking, *okay, reasonable and rational, that sounds good! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time must be the goal, right?*

Actually, no! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time isn’t ideal, either. 

**You May Be in Reasonable Mind If:**

* You feel cut off from, or “numb” to your emotions
* You minimize or shrug off your feelings
* You rationalize your own or others’ behavior, even behavior that is unacceptable
* You are avoiding or in denial about something that is happening
* You are completely focused on a task

When we’re in Reasonable Mind, we’re cut off from our emotions. It’s important to be aware of and feel our emotions. First, because it’s an essential part of the human experience. More importantly, emotions contain very important information we need to understand our needs and boundaries.

Here’s an example of why awareness of emotions is important. Let’s say you feel angry and irritable every time you see your friend. Reasonable mind might say you’re being irrational and dismiss the feelings. But chances are there’s a good reason why you’re feeling angry at them, especially since it keeps happening.

Maybe they’re putting you down a lot, or not listening to what you’re saying. Or maybe you feel jealous of them. Finding the answer to why you’re angry is important to figuring out how to resolve your anger, whether you do so on your own or with the other person.

There are a number of potential reasons why people have difficulty being in Wise Mind. Maybe they haven’t had many people in their life model what it looks like to be in Wise Mind. Maybe staying in Reasonable Mind has protected them from extreme traumatic reactions. Maybe acting from Emotion Mind has gotten their needs met, for better or worse.

When you’re able to acknowledge your feelings without acting impulsively on them, you’re in Wise Mind.

**You May Be in Wise Mind If:**

* You’re taking both your emotions and logic into account
* You can name and feel your emotions
* You’re considering different ways to proceed before acting
* You can see the situation from multiple perspectives
* It feels like *you* are in control, not your mood

If you’re rarely in Wise Mind, don’t worry! You can increase your Wise Mind skills with practice.

**Ways to Cultivate Wise Mind Skills**

* Pause throughout the day and ask yourself which state of mind you are in.
* If you are in Emotion Mind, label which emotions you’re feeling.
* Using coping skills before acting on your feelings (for instance, journal, go on a walk, or take a hot shower).
* If you want to engage in a behavior that’s impulsive or mood-based (for example, emotional eating, texting your ex, substance abuse, etc.)
   * Delay the behavior by 1 hour
   * Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or peer before engaging in the behavior
   * Consider the negative consequences of the behavior
   * Replace the behavior with something less harmful (for example, drawing on your arms with a Sharpie instead of self-harming)
* Participate in a DBT program in your area. It can help you develop not only Wise Mind skills, but also, a wide variety of other skills related to Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Relationships.
* Practice yoga, Tai-Chi, or other physical activities that help you get in touch with your body. These can also help you develop more awareness of yourself and your emotions.
* Talk to a therapist! A therapist can help you stay accountable as you work towards strengthening your Wise Mind.

45,Help with SO,"My SO has been diagnosed with BPD. She is actively working on it as in she’s trying to go to therapy. She hasn’t found the right one yet. She told me the other day about the “favourite person” and believes that’s what I am. She says she doesn’t feel like she has ever had one before. 

My issue is that I love her immensely but right now I’m struggling with the extreme emotional lows. I know she can’t help it but at the same time I can’t be missing work and emotional drained myself to support her in those times. I mean I could do twice a year but it seems to be every week. 

Is there anything that can be done?  Any way things could improve?  Or should I let her go for my mental health and support her from afar?

46,"Time to start working on recovery, one step at a time","I'm not in therapy currently, have really struggled finding a therapist who can help me with my BPD and CPTSD (my last one was awful, and when I tried going to my GP I've ended up on a 2 year long wait list for another service because they're unable to help me because of my trauma...).

My mental health is at a critical low at the moment and I've not been taking care of myself, but I need to make a change. So, I'm finally digging out the workbooks I've had for ages but barely touched. 

I've set myself a new schedule/routine to help me make time for it, and I'm going to try really hard. Did my first session with Dr Daniel Fox's Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook.

I've seen some of his videos, and they're always pretty insightful and the first chapter of the book seems really good so far - really helped me to pin down some of the possible causes of my BPD, what subtype my BPD is (self-destructive/discouraged) and my attachment type (fearful - explains a lot!). 

So I'm feeling fairly hopeful. I think it's going to be hard work, but I think this combined with some DBT books I have can help me get things in order the best I can.

48,Sashbear training saved my relationship with my loved one (teenage daughter with BPD),"I have a loved one with emotional dysregulation and Sashbear (Canada) provides DBT training  (free of cost and self referral) to family members, partners, people who have a loved one with BPD.

Their webpage ([Sashbear.org](https://Sashbear.org)) states ""Empowering family members and communities with life transforming skills and hope, through workshops and evidence-based programs at no charge"" 

Their 12 week (2.5 hours/week plus homework) program teaches emotional regulation and problem solving skills so that family members can get off the emotional roller coaster that often takes over daily life.  

I completed the course 2 years ago.  After the first meeting I had hope, real genuine hope. After the second meeting, I realized, that I was going to have to change my personality and it was not going to happen overnight.  

For the first time, I am able to respond to my daughter's outbursts with a genuine calm state of mind and I am able to help her manage her emotional dysregulation rather than making the situation worse. Instead of focusing on her dysregulated behavior in the moment, I focus on understanding why the behavior happened in the first place. Our relationship or overall family connections has improved such that we say ""Love you"" multiple times a day and that especially helps to defuse blow-ups. 

In the past year, there was an emotional dysregulation event that resulted in my daughter saying ""I hate you!"" with an intensity that was unmatched to previous versions. I felt like I was struck with a load of bricks. Rather than responding immediately, I left the supper table and excused myself for 3-5 minutes. After a few deep breaths, I came back to the table, sat down and told my loved ""You said that you hate me, but I love you. I told it too you yesterday, I am telling you now and I will tell you again tomorrow. I know that you love me because you said it yesterday and the day before that. I understand that you are frustrated with XYZ but you are in a dysregulated state of mind and when you are there you are going to say things that you do not intend to say. It's okay, we will talk about this later when you are calmed the fuck down. okay?""

After I said this, there was a fearful expression on my daughters face as she realized what happened. Her hateful words were not true and she had no power over my emotions. She has not said it since, although she tells me to F-off a couple of times a week (when dysregulated), but I ignore it.

My daughter's upcoming BPD life challenges are not going to disappear, however at least I can support her in a meaningful way and protect my own mental health.

For those with BPD in Canada, please recommend Sashbear to your loved ones so they can help you to manage your BPD in a loving and supportive manner that protects and enhances their own mental health. 

The Sashbear training modules are the same or a slightly modified version of DBT training skills. This can be very helpful for those doing DBT training for the first time,  as other family members can also put the DBT skill set into practice. The more you practice, the more it sticks.

Sashbear also has an expert series of youtube videos covering many different topics.

Our family was broken, we are healing now and moving forward in a positive manner.

49,Prognosis?,"Hi all. My wife is suspected of having bpd. Sorry, no formal diagnosis I know of. But my suspicions come initially from her sister who has psych background, and the pieces fit. Sorry if that's not allowed here. 

I don't demonize her. I love her so much. But her mental stability went down really quickly a few months ago and she has made terrible, and abusive, choices that she does not take ownership. Affairs, including one with a former inmate at the prison she works at, she physically assaulted me on one occasion, threats of violence or killing me, ended up in the psych unit for suicidal ideation after holding a knife to her throat, and tons of gaslighting and projection. It's been impossible to see the person I love become this in front of me.

She had tendencies before, but she was stable. We have 4 small kids. We had such a good life. She refused to stop cheating, and I told her we couldn't be married if she didn't want to work on our relationship and was pursuing others. I wasn't perfect either, I have my issues, but I never swore at her, I never yelled, I never was physical to her or even objects. I tried validating her emotional reality and being there. She didn't feel it. Were getting divorced. She didn't even argue with me on me taking primary custody. 

She recognizes her traumatic background and that she has responses to those things. She wants therapy. She doesn't take any accountability for her choices. From all of her friends, who tried everything from tough love to expressing worry gently, she told them she didn't feel they loved her if they wouldn't agree with her on all of her decisions. 

I just want to know if anyone has any insight into what things might look like going forward for her. She isn't well. I doubt she'll be able to maintain our house on her budget even. She's been rude and challenging and abrasive in the meantime. Is she going to be able to be diagnosed and accept it? For her own sake is she going to be able to heal? My only other encounter with bpd is her mother, who never got help, and she is a confused old lady wandering around in a fog these days. I'm terrified that is what will become of my wife. Hope has burned me so much these months, but I need to know if it's likely she can get better. I'd like her to come back and heal together, but even if she won't do that I want her to grow and be whole for her own sake. Is there hope?

51,My partner accused me of stealing his emotions (cross-post),"My partner (m38) is also extremely mentally ill. He's erratic, mercurial and has bouts of explosive anger. It's typically not towards me specifically but he screams and stammers in this high pitch voice and when I (m30) get upset or freaked out and say anything, he tells me that I'm stealing his thunder and that I keep him from expressing his emotions because I make everything about me. He even suggested that he could prove it by manipulating me by faking emotions to see if I copy him. It's gotten worse since he learned that pwBPD have the potential for elevated emotional mirroring.

This is not my intention. I try to stay quiet and keep a cool head but sometimes I cannot keep from saying something or being physically affected (i.e. crying or having an angry expression) He is currently in the middle of an ongoing breakdown and as a result, literally anything that upsets me is considered paltry. He constantly asks me, ""what are you so sad about?"" As though I don't have a personality disorder, cPTSD, GAD, depression and a myriad of other fucked up shit from both genetics and a shitload of trauma. Our relationship is toxic but hey, unstable relationships are part of the game, I guess.

I have no job because my brain is fucking fried and he's under an absurd amount of pressure to work a job he hates and so I try to minimize what I can because he has so much responsibility. If he puts me down or accuses me of only caring about myself, like he often does, and I begin telling him that he is obviously better off without a burden like me, I get the routine, ""ope, here we going. Swinging the pendulum."" Or again, accusing me of trying to make everything about myself. He also gets angry if I don't say anything to him and will start asking, ""are you not talking to me?"" I have extremely bad days too and I can't express them without him claiming that I'm one upping him. I'm so exhausted.

I can't leave him because I have literally nothing. No money, no car, no family to rely on. My family essentially cut ties because I'm trans. (Today he also guilted me about not getting along with the rest of my estranged, bigoted family because both of his parents have passed away, whereas my mom is still alive and I have 4 siblings) I'm also fairly certain that if I leave, he might cease to exist. That's not even an exaggeration. I can't have him committed because he'd lose his job and everything he has. I can't commit myself because I'd be seen as attention-seeking.

As the child of an alcoholic, I guess it's no surprise that my partner of eight years would end up being one too. He's been sober for 9 months and constantly reminds me that it wasn't his choice. (He had become increasingly emotionally abusive over a period of a couple years and I was trying to make plans to leave him.) I'm not sure two people with these levels of mental illness can be together without destroying each other. I can't fall apart because he's falling apart. I can't feel joy because he can't feel joy. I can't be upset because he is upset.

There's nothing left. I want to not be in existence anymore so so often but I'm trying. I'm in therapy and on medication that doesn't fucking help, I've done workbooks, done things affirm important parts of my life, I've set and achieved goals and in the end, everything in my life is a fucking wreck and so much of it feels like it's my fault. Maybe I really am an emotional vacuum.

I'm trying hard to keep it together. I'm trying hard to be the strong one. I am exhausted every day of my life, physically and mentally and it all just gets worse. Everyone leaves. My family, my friends, my other partners and my partner has emotionally checked out of our relationship. Every circumstance is fucked, the climate, the government, my family, my past, my relationships, my brain and even my pets. I don't know who I am from day to day. Apparently I am a selfish, attention seeking, spotlight thief.

Even now, I've made this whole post about myself, my needs and my emotions. I hate myself so much. I don't want this life or this body or mind. I hate me.

I know no one will read all of this and that it's filled with a thousand different directions of problems. I just needed to spill my guts somewhere where I can't hurt anyone else.

52,BPD/EUPD Support Group! <3,"My name is Daisy Sky (she/her) and I am a Couples & Family Therapist in training! Nice to meet you, fellow BPD brains <3

I will be offering a 12-session support group for those who struggle with borderline personality disorder/emotionally unstable personality disorder this summer! This group is for you if you have trouble regulating your emotions, you struggle in your interpersonal relationships, you find yourself making impulsive and potentially destructive decisions (do they even feel like decisions??), you have an unstable sense of identity, and/or you find yourself frequently ruminating on the past or future. This group is also for you if you have a loved one who is struggling with these symptoms. While the group is centered around the struggles of those with BPD/EUPD, you do not need to identify with this condition to be welcome in the space.

Group will be held on Zoom from 7:00-8:30pm PST on Wednesdays, dates listed below. In group, I will share a new skill each week, and open up space for sharing and discussion. This group is NOT a substitute for therapy, rather a supplemental peer support space. I have been managing EUPD for over a decade, and I have lots of resources and compassion to share with those whose lives have been touched by this painful condition 📷 Influences will be drawn from my own personal therapy, as well as teachings from my MACFT program. I will be drawing from evidence-based treatments for BPD, and this group will have a strong mindfulness component, with recommended weekly journaling/practice assignments. Please share with anyone who you think would benefit; I think it's going to be a beautiful space!

Energy exchange/financial support is negotiable on a sliding scale, with discounts given to those who sign up for the entire series, BIPOC, and trans folx. NOTAFLOF! Drop-ins are also welcome! If you would like to have your camera off and remain anonymous, that is also completely acceptable, and we will have group agreements regarding communication and confidentiality.

As I've moved into adulthood and have gotten more serious about my recovery, I have noticed the further away I am from my family the better. I dont have issues with others to this degree, if im upset we'll talk it out calmly and in a mature fashion or we share our boundaries and what we need in the moment. When it comes to my family, despite them watch my journey with mental health and all kinds of therapy, their own behavior and actions seem to never improve or change. For example, Im on vacation with my family in new york to visit my sister and her husband and my baby niece. I just wanted to enjoy my time away and have fun in their company. I got irritated because we were trying to figure out plans and nobody was answering my calls/texts (were in different rooms) at this point, im not even acting out or screaming or being rude in any sort. even when im in control im aware that there can sometimes be a tone of irritation in my voice. and so do they... despite that I clearly set a boundary as simple as ""stop"" as I've learned to from therapy only for them to continue. instead of disengaging, they scream at me loudly telling me to calm down or continue invalidating me saying in the moment. Again, i was only mildly irritated. there was nothing major happening for me to \*normally outside of them\* get to a placewhere my anger gets so intense i cry. Instead of respecting my boundries after repeatedly saying ""Stop"" and giving me time to regulate myself (after pushing me to a point where i actually raised my own voice to again say STOP"" its as if they'd rather push my buttons until i get to point to where my anger gets so intense i react. And then they blame \*ME\* and feed into eachothers energy of being nasty laugh at me and sayi ""I cant deal with this"" or ""this is why we dont go on family vacations when all i want is respect and when I try to vent to the opposite party they dont want to deal with it either and tell me to stop. At 24, I've so tired of this despite living on my own already, Im finally at a point to where im ready to be financially independent, leave (them behind or go to a new state or go to school away from them) and pursue my own contentment. I'm not perfect, but there is no respect or awareness held when it comes to me in my family. Has anybody else gone through this? I'll take whatever advice I can get. I know I struggle with a disorder but I can't convince myself its just me anymore.

55,Seeking advice or experiences on how to cope with a very painful break up 🤐,"TW: breakup, being cheated on

Hey!

Does anyone have any experience or recommendations on how to cope after a very painful relationship ending?

 How not to drown in self-hatred when I contributed to this painful outcome?

Also on how to not slide into the next toxic relationship right away? 

It's been over for nearly 3 months. 

And I'm just not coping well.

And I want him back even if I should realise that we are obviously not good for each other.

End here if that's too long :3

We had a lot of ups and downs, started as an unlucky affair in a polygam setting, ended up monogamous, which manifested a lot of mistrust and fear on my side throughout the relationship. Nevertheless, we were incredibly close and I have rarely felt so connected. 

I was in a really bad shape mentally due to depression and life circumstances, in therapy yes but it did not help that much and he wasn't fine either. I always pushed him away bc I felt not worth it, felt too dependent and pulled him in if our distance intensified and he gave too much into it, nearly gave himself up for me without setting healthy boundaries. Which we would have both needed. 

Of course he cheated on me trough online sex dates when we were at our lowest. And he immediately replaced me when he was inpatient himself with someone he seeked relationship advice from and never mentioned towards me, telling me we both need to work on ourselves and need time.

My main fear of people leaving because I am too much for them when I am at my worst is confirmed and it hurts so incredibly because it was the first time I loved someone so intensely and felt safe in some way. 

I think we had a very explosive relationship because it was mutual love but at one point also trauma bonding on both ends (both being emotionally dependent on each other, me being PwBPD and him being mainly anxiously attached) 

I try to move on, live my life, continuing therapy, find myself again, start to depend on myself, being and enduring being single for the first time in over 8 years without jumping from one to another relationship, hobbies, seeing people, discovering new things.

But still I feel broken and scared to death to get close to someone again bc all of this is so painful.

56,BPD Podcast,"Hey all!

This is my first reddit experience (bum bum baaaahhhh!)! I was diagnosed with BPD about two years ago, underwent DBT therapy for about a year and have been working very, very hard to work the skills-- to find that ""life worth living"" they're talking about. The transformation has been amazing to my day-to-day life, by no means is life perfect, or am I recovered. But holy shit, I can mostly functional again, and taking these little steps is giving me hope through the challenges for the first time in a long time. 

I'm a fortunate lady, not everybody is lucky enough to get diagnosed, much less, to wrack up their credit debt to get to go to therapy. I want to share my personal experiences because what I found in group-therapy was people didn't understand the skills in a real-life scenario. It all made sense in group but the practical application piece was missing. Our dear leader had examples that frankly were a little soft while we were all living the extreme version of it- which felt invalidating in itself. So I'd really like to share my stories, share the skills, and help others feel better-- if only it helps to hear they're not alone.

I've come up with a few episodes that are ready to record-- being based off what I've struggled with most and the skills that have most impacted my life. BUT I'd really like to hear what you all struggle with the most and hear your success stories of how skills have helped you! If you care to comment, I'd really like to hear where you're at. There is no judgment from me, you are all my BPD family and I am here to listen <3",1574659486.0,False,9,10,kaitlmcd,None,e1bcp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/e1bcp2/bpd_podcast/
57,Beginning my journey.,"I (28m) have just begun a long needed journey.  I have been the victim of my own life and BPD as well as the villain in many other lives.

Last week, it cost me the life I built with the person I love and spent 9 years with. It cost me good friends, a beautiful home, 2 loving cats, a decent job, and my understanding of the world.

It cost me who I wanted to be ideally.

I have 1 year to improve as much as possible, and even after that year, the rest of my life to commit to being the person everyone believed I was.

I will no longer be a product of circumstance. I will no long be trauma for others. I will not be my BPD.

I will not be the worst version of myself.

I will be accountable, transparent, honest, and most importantly I'll do things right.

I've begun therapy, and am preparing to move out and be alone for the first time in 9 years. I am in a state I've only been in for 2 years and have lost all of my local and most of my online support system. I have come clean to all of those who remain in my life so that they have a choice to be a part of this journey. I have begun journalism, I have ordered a reputable book about BPD called ""I hate you, dont leave me."" so I can better myself between therapy sessions. I plan on starting with 2 therapists for the first few months as soon as I can get insured as I am now between jobs. I found a gym nearby to channel my energy into being as healthy a body as a mind.  I will have to effectively restart my life alone.

I have removed every trace, every presence, and every artifact of my horrible habits and self destructive mentality.

I am the most miserable I have ever been in my life, and I am in the most emotional pain I have ever experienced.

And I am filled with nothing more than the desire to overcome. To invest in this year I've been given, to give returns to those in my life, to make the rest of my life a testament to the chances I have been given undeservedly by those I love the most. By the one I love the most. Call it my FP, call her my soulmate, call this whatever you want. I am not my issues. I am not my mistakes or problems.

""What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?""

# Its time to put in the effort.

If anyone has any advice, recommendations, guidance, or tips that helped you, please feel free to share. I want to do as much as I can everyday. I want to love and be loved. I want to listen and be heard. I want to be the person I pretended to be, and then I want to be better than that.

Thanks for taking the time to read my message. Thank you for being a community where I can start my journey.

I hope by the end of this, I get to finish playing Morkredd with her. ",1679635820.0,False,3,2,FixingMyAtoms,None,120abq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/120abq6/beginning_my_journey/
58,Perceived vs real betrayal/abandonment - advice for me and my SO please 🙏 (tweet for reference),"TLDR; with reference to this Tweet that I showed my bf, he asked when I am triggered and experience this, how can he deal it in the best way possible to avoid as much conflict possible? I honestly don't know the answer to this so would appreciate some advice please.

More context: I (29F) showed my boyfriend (33M) of 4 years this Tweet as it applies to me and I try to educate him about my trauma and how it affects me and how my brain operates so he can understand me better. We are trying to work through and improve our relationship which is heavily affected by my BPD and mental health issues. Sometimes he will do or say things that trigger me to feel/think he is betraying or abandoning me and my brain fully convinces me that this is the case (and I never know if it is real or imagined), I guess subconsciously to protect myself from getting hurt which inevitably does the opposite and leads us to break into massive blowout fights, which ruin all of our progress up to that point, even when things have been going super well for a while and then before I know it we're suddenly on the brink of splitting up and he starts questioning if there is any hope for our future at all. All because of my fucking triggers, disassociations, neurosis when my mind perceives the threat of betrayal or abandonment.

He always claims he is not doing what I think he is and I have no way of knowing if he is telling the truth or lying. For me trust doesn't even matter at this point because after experiencing so many REAL betrayals and abandonments from people close to me who I never would have ever expected to do so, my brain is so hypervigilant and on alert to suspect anyone could do that to me, it doesn't matter who they are anymore. Nobody is safe, no one can be trusted. Whenever I let my guard down and allow myself to trust and be vulnerable, people take advantage of it and then stab me in the back. The pain that occurs inside of me is gut wrenching and makes me withdraw and feel suspicious of people even more.

I am nothing like the person I used to be. I used to be a social butterfly and musician, I could not go a week without seeing friends, going to gigs and performing and ocializing, but since I've been so ill and debilitated the past few years as well as other factors, I've become an empty shell of who I used to be, severely isolated and living a hermit lifestyle. I have not seen any friends in 4 months, back in active addiction, anxiety, depression, BPD at its worst. This is my rock bottom.

I have a plethora of personal and family crises going on constantly piling up (the list just never ends, my whole adult life has been in survival mode), causing me so much inner turmoil, pain, grief, distress, depression, anxiety. I have become disabled by my multiple incurable chronic illnesses, my social life has become non existent, I fucking dread waking upon every next day miserably existing and nightmares at night. It's unbearable to be awake and be not awake. There's no escape, no peace, no way out. My illnesses have stolen my life away and everything I ever enjoyed and loved doing. I have lost all purpose in life, my sense of identity, motivation and any hope of ever being happy. I'm constantly overwhelmed, started self harming for the first time in my life, relapsed on drugs a few months ago (landed me up in the ER one night in Dec) and I'm admitting myself into a mental health clinic for 3 weeks on Thursday before I finish my degree online (there is no way I can study like this so it has to be before). 

I am in therapy, medicated (although I need to adjust/change my meds), but we just had our end of year summer holidays and my psychologist was away for a month, my psychiatrist has become absolutely useless and unreliable and has ignored me since mid December and other times last year when I needed his help (actual abandonment). I've been seeing my psychiatrist since 2020 and he has let me down so badly and become impossible to get hold of, I genuinely don't think this man has any interest in helping me anymore and may have to find another one, starting new after 4 years will be so fucking exhausting.",1707169567.0,False,6,0,tabasco_kat,None,1ajskqw,https://i.redd.it/lyqzryvl7ugc1.jpeg
59,hitting rock-bottom,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""
-Panic! At the Disco.

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439573.0,False,1,7,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1ad08qo/hitting_rockbottom/
60,THERAPY SCAM ALERT!! BWRT (BrainWorking Recursive Therapy) - Terence Watts,"This is a super important post so pls don’t delete mods! I’m trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help aren’t lied to. 

Terence Watts’s “BrainWorking Recursive Therapy” or, “BWRT” is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a “full proof” solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!!

Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, it’s giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes. 

I was so amazed at first, and truly believed I’d finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be true… so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it. 

The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesn’t want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldn’t be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I don’t respond or you don’t see this post anymore… well I guess you know why. 

Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproduct… but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions. 


Here are some links about BWRT to get you started:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ts8qya/does_anyone_have_experience_with_bwrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Watts gets his inspiration from [Benjamin Libet](https://www.bwrtuk.co.uk/bwrt/), whose theory about conscious and unconscious behaviour forms the basis of his theory. He talks about it a lot on his website and in his youtube videos. 


Also, I found some interesting posts about Charles Linden - another “expert” who displays similar behaviours of secrecy, denial and harassment to Terence Watts:

(FYI: I still need to do some more research on this myself, so I am not claiming to be an expert on this matter.)

EDIT: another very interesting link… [the Advertising Standards Agency says he breached the “UK code of non-broadcast advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.”](https://www.ns-healthcare.com/news/terence-watts/)

“The Terence Watts BWRT Institute was found guilty of claiming it could treat and/or diagnose several serious health problems including anxiety, infertility and diabetes without substantiating such claims.

In its findings, the ASA also concluded that an advertisement on the website discouraged people from seeking essential treatment and necessary medical supervision for conditions, including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and thyroid problems.

The Advertising Standards Agency told Terence Watts the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding it should not claim or imply that BWRT can be used to treat conditions without demonstrating sufficient evidence.

The ASA also said the website should not reference conditions for which medical supervision is necessary when addressing those seeking treatment in the future.”

61,Is it healthy or is it another FP?,"My friend and I both have quiet BPD, though we are both in therapy and he's on medication while I'm finally getting started into looking for medication. 

Recently I've been finding myself wanting to romantically take him on dates, hold hands etc, do all the things a romantic couple would do but my only fear is that, because my mental health hasn't been the best recently (Due to a really toxic situation I had to escape from with an ex friend), I'm worried that it's just another FP attachment forming. 

I want more than anything to treat him well, and give him the healthiest love that ik he deserves, especially because he's been mistreated in the past, but I'm so scared that this is only going to become another unhealthy attachment and with HIM having bpd, i'm worried that i'm going to make it worse. 

So far all our things have been reciprocated (Wanting to hang out more, our plans for cosplaying with one another, being able to rely on one another and check in with one another emotionally) so I've just been really careful and allowing myself to slowly take in all the good he's brought into my life, rather than taking more and more and more because I'm worried he'll leave, and leaving him with nothing.

62,how to work on attachment,"Hi. I (20F) just got broken up with by my ex (22M) last night and have been NC. It's a very long story, but he ended things because of my behavior in the past few months being toxic and harmful. He said he loved me, he didn't want to do it, was ugly crying with me, but it was done anyway. Over the course of our nearly 8 month relationship, major life events happened, I lost sight, and he ended up becoming my Favorite Person unintentionally. 

I have been in bouts of crying, but I have been talking with many people and have a rocky plan for the foreseeable future. First, I have CBT and DBT in the next two days, and then on Wednesday I'm going to the doctor to switch my medication (cymbalta) to something else that will target mood swings. I am going to join a grief support group to manage the grief I felt these past couple months. I've written out the toxic attachments I developed and boundaries that we had at the beginning that fell away. 

I'm going to stay NC until Friday, wherein I'll reevaluate everything, but I don't know how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? I don't have these issues with anyone else in my life, only my romantic partner(s), and until the shit of life hit the fan, I was navigating my attachment very well. 

He is truly the love of my life, and we had so many things planned together. Everything was mapped out, and I was so secure with him. I believe when things went down that I used him too much for emotional reliance and we became a tad codependent. We are both anxious attachment, I think, and I have BPD whereas he does not. I do still love him, though, and I want to firstly work on my own issues for a while, but I do want to be with him again, if he'd try us out again.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? Or just any advice in general? 

edit: broke no contact. found out he and his sister are leaving town for a while, so I left him a voice-mail last night telling him to stay safe and that I miss him. said I love you. texted his sister a similar sentiment. the lack of response really feels like I just tore my own insides out, but I suppose that's the decision that's been made. I dont want to lose him, and I feel I already have

edit 2: talked to my dr. the medication I was on for my arthritis gave me psychosis, and my rheumatologist didn't check my mental history before prescribing them. I stopped those, started taking prozac instead of cymbalta, and started 3 omega-3 fish oils, 1 vitamin b1, and 2 magnesium glycinate. i had a phone call w his sister a few days ago and she said he isn't ready to talk yet but it was fairly amicable. sending a text tmrw for his birthday but haven't reached out. going to the psychiatrist in a few weeks to get mood stabilizers. ive done a lot of journaling, therapy, and talking and distracting. I know I can thrive without him and I don't NEED him to survive, but I do love him and he enhances my life. I want us to work out, but I'm not going to spam or go crazy w the contact. After the bday text, I'm not going to reach out, which is hard, but if it's meant to be he will come back.",1711942056.0,False,4,4,casineb,None,1bstfxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1bstfxm/how_to_work_on_attachment/
63,Has anyone ever taken the DES assessment while receiving therapy?,"Recently, I’ve experienced a severe mental breakdown - to cut a long story short, the experience resulted in several hospitalisations and taking time off work for 2 and a half month to the present date.   

The aftermath of this was me receiving a care coordinator and psychologist, who have decided that given my recent experiences, they want to do an ‘extended assessment’ to clarify my diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with BPD for close to 3 years now and when initially diagnosed, I did not have to take the DES assessment.  

DES stands for Dissociative Experiences Scale, which is essentially a test of 28 questions relating to dissociative tendencies that you rate between 0-100% based on the regularity of your experience with the posed scenario.   

This is not anything I have ever been asked to do before, and I am unsure if this is a typical part of a BPD diagnosis. I have made peace with my diagnosis and being presented with the DES has sky rocketed my anxiety that it might not have been right all along.   

The last thing I want to do is send myself down the rabbit hole by googling to try and find any form of clarity on this, and I would be immensely grateful if anyone could shed any input on this or if they have any experience (personal or not) with the DES assessment.

64,Toxic shame vs. healthy guilt,"I want to share a concept that I recently learned that has been a game changer for me.

A lot of us with BPD were raised by emotionally immature parents. So when we messed up or did bad things like all kids do - we were punished of course, but mostly in our families - we were SHAMED. We were told that we were BAD KIDS for doing the bad thing. Or perhaps your parent withdrew affection when you were bad, or stayed angry and never talked to you about the incident - and since kids lack the mental ability to depersonalize - you of course would blame yourself. 

“My mom stopped hugging me because I’m bad”.

My mom ignored me because I did something wrong.

This is the natural way for young children to think. It is shame-based personalization. “I must be responsible for everything that happens to me”. But if kids grow up in healthy households, that thinking is replaced with guilt-based thinking. This takes the personalization out of the equation.

I messed up, but that doesn’t mean I’m a bad person. 

My mom stopped hugging me, but that doesn’t mean she stopped loving me, she’s just angry because I did something bad. 

This is the toxic-shame vs. healthy guilt dynamic. 

People with BPD often experience shame-based thinking when we do something “bad”. We think we don’t deserve love anymore, that we should be kicked out of the relationship, that the other person must have stopped loving us, because we are now a “bad person who does bad things”.

Where as healthy people might say: “I am a good person, who went through a hard time and did a bad thing. I feel guilt for that thing, and that guilt is good!”

Do you see the difference?

I think the biggest thing I keep being reminded of by my therapist and my partner is exactly that: you’re a person who struggles with things, and who is going through a hard time. You make mistakes, and it’s good that you feel guilty for them, because you won’t make those mistakes again, or you will work to change them.

In this line of thinking, the core of my identity is not attached to my behaviors. I can still be a good person even if I make mistakes.

I find that we apply the same personalized-based thinking to others when we split too. We lose the ability to attribute a behavior to a situation, and we attribute a behavior to a person’s whole self. “They did a bad thing, are they a bad person?”

Obviously a lot of morality gets called into question with this. There are a lot of people in the world who think themselves as good people who do very hurtful and harmful things. 

But just apply this to the guilt and shame you feel about your own actions and I find that this can disarm a lot of the shame and “unloveable” feelings that crop up inside. The next time you feel that you are completely unloveable for something you did, ask yourself, are you a bad person? Or do you just feel guilty?

If you feel guilty, that’s a really solvable problem. You’re a loveable person who fucked up and who want to do better. Or should you be ashamed of your whole self and you don’t deserve good things because you’re so terrible?

When your partner messes up are they a whole terrible person and have always been? Or did they just make a mistake and an apology and a promise to work on it would make everything better?",1689780120.0,False,35,5,Astrnougat,None,153y0ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/153y0ds/toxic_shame_vs_healthy_guilt/
65,A reflection on my view of my favorite person,"
(I posted this as part of my journal so i explain some stuff that i’m sure y’all know about already. It was before i knew reddit and this subreddit. so I’ll just paste it right away. And i need your opinion)



Female, 19. 

Hi. I think I’ll just get into it right away. I’m never the first choice in anyone’s life. Maybe i got too detached in my last depression episode i pushed away everyone and created that barrier that i grew comfortable with. I feel like nobody truly knows me. 


I took a walk today with myself alone just to reflect and cried so much. I realized I’m really lonely and nothing i can do can fix that. I either have the choice to ignore that feeling and move along like i always did and hopefully find someone who can really connect with me (naïve isn’t it?) or just come to peace with the fact that i have to adapt to my loneliness. 


Through my life cycles i had that one close friend that i painfully realized I’m not as important to them as they are to me, so i get to know another and another and with this one of 8 years is what really broke me. I wish she knew how much she means to me. If she left i’ll never recover. It’s strange but friendship breakups can give me the most severe depression episodes. I can go on and on about how i never leave the bed somedays. 


My parents knew there was something wrong with. Hell i knew that too. And as the therapy sessions went i was diagnosed with BPD (borderline personality disorder) and having an FP (favorite person) is actually one of the symptoms of it. Ironic, right? I didn’t tell my parents about it. I pretended i was fine. It’s not like i can cure it and mom noticed that i was fine so she took me out of therapy. It’s been more than 10 months since my last appointment. It’s not like I don’t want to get better. It’s truly not but i was really doing great i was fine i overcome thar episode and made so much friends in my sophomore year in college went to a lot of activities did so many things. 


Even if i was still doing therapy I wouldn’t have the time to it. That friend of 8 years we had our ups and downs and we became close again or at least i thought we were. I don’t she hold me to the same place i hold her to. Sometimes i feel like she doesn’t care about me at all. And i don’t want to lose her. I CANNOT. We talked fought and went through a lot of things but i still have that feeling that she’s gotten bored with me? She found new friends now and she’s hanging out with them basically spending the whole last week of summer with them and she didn’t even think about me. 


She didn’t invite me. She didn’t care. It feels like she didn’t want me to come and it really kills me that i didn’t even cross her mind. Because i know if i were her i would always chose her first. Think about her first. Invite her first. But she didn’t. And I’m left again to be that last choice. 

I can’t tell her how much this hurt me because I’m afraid I’ll get called childish or my company will be a burden to her later. I know these feelings are not mature but I’m sick and tired of pretending like everything is okay. I can’t get back to therapy so consider this one my journals. Likewise romantically i’ve never had a “relationship” it’s all failed talking stages or weird situationships. I still am holding that barrier , no new friends are allowed, no new lovers are allowed, i’m just so afraid that I’ll get too attached and get hurt when they leave. All my relationships are so hollow. 

I think I’m incapable of making any human connection. It’s all just shallow and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to open up again. Or how to not let my 8yo friendship consume me. Sometimes i think I can’t be fixed. And i know all these kept up emotions will eventually explode and i’ll lose everyone and everything again. I really really really am afraid of loneliness. I don’t want to die alone. I think it’s beyond repair now, my ability to form any human connections. I just really wish that someone can understand how overwhelmed i am right now. Anyone. 


I really don’t know what to do. And I can’t get back to my therapist again as I’m still a student and can’t cover the expenses of it anymore. 
What should i do? Please give me any advice. 
Thanks for reading all the way to the end.

66,book for my partner?,"I am hoping to buy my partner a book so they can understand BPD more. I have asked them to research it on their own and just send me what they find so i can let them know if its accurate or just stigmatizing BS. I think they may just be intimidated by how much bias and misinformation is out there and they have asked me about books. 

What (if any) books exist as a resource for partners of people with BPD that explains what BPD is, how to support us, and how they can hold their own boundaries in this sort of dynamic?

Maybe such a book doesnt exist but I would be happy with any of those 3 things.

EDIT: Anyone who responds to this assuming that im not putting in any work needs to fuck off. I've already sent them all sorts of stuff. I am in therapy. I have a workbook. I journal.

I put in hard work every single day to manage this disorder that was given to me through being abused (reminder, none of us fucking asked to be like this). My partner fails to express external interest in my BPD. IMO if someone knowingly signs up to date someone with BPD they are signing up to do hard shit sometimes. It's not like I surprised them with this disorder, I told them on our 3rd date, well before we entered a comitted exclusive relationship, that I have BPD and that it is something they were going to need to learn about. It is immensely triggering to be in a relationship where half of the time when I am triggered it's at this point avoidable had they just done some research. But instead the labor of that gets put on me because ""im the one whose fucked up"" despite my constant begging for support, constant self work, constant self restraint. I am burnt out, suicidal, and at my limit. IMO reading a few articles on google is the BARE MINIMUM. If I had chronic kidney disease i know for a fact that people would not be telling me that its my responsibility to send people articles. A mental injury is no different then a physical one so take your ableism and shove it up your ass because what we have is a fucking disability. Why is this one of the only disabilities where the disabled person is constantly the one who is 100% responsible for their own recovery? That literally inhuman. IMO thats YOUR trauma speaking and projecting on to me.So fuck off with that because I know that I am worthy of a loving supportive relationship where people take interest in learning about my disability and take interest in how to support me.

My room mate took an entire class on how to have someone with BPD in your life and how to support them. I didn't even ask them to do this, they did it because they love and care about me and wanted to understand where i come from. We are ALL worthy of that kind of love, respect, compassion, empathy, support. Anyone who has been telling you otherwise is not trult interest in your recovery.",1688011252.0,False,3,19,TransGuyKindaFly,None,14luhmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14luhmj/book_for_my_partner/
67,Rant/BSsadstuff,"So
Sorry this is my first post and I’m sorry but holy crap I need to get this off my chest
And trigger warning: S/H and sewerslide mentioned

I’m not sure where to start. I (23F) have dated this guy we shall call Renegade (25M)
He and I met around 3 years ago. We were both single parents and freshly out of a horrible marriage and engagement. When we first dated things were awkward. His ex wife still lived with him and she hated my guts. Used her limited knowledge of my past against me (her go to ammo was the fact I had my daughter under surveillance for accused child neglect by DSS (side note that shit got thrown out the window and I got her back once the investigation was over and the accusations against me were deemed as false) and she would even go as low as the issues with my mental health despite the fact she had “self diagnosed” herself with the same disabilities that I have) 
Freaky right?
Anyway ex wife threatened to take Ren’s daughter away if I wasn’t immediately thrown out of the picture so I was stuck in a game of “how can I get rid of my new girlfriend without getting rid of her?” Until the game got too old to play for ren and he ditched me. 
After not hearing from ren in almost 2 years he reached out to me. Told me he finally moved out of his ex wife’s house and had split custody. For a few weeks I was hesitant on being involved with him again. I even mentioned the fact I can’t trust him because of the abandonment and the drama. But spoiler alert I eventually had no choice but to move in with him and restart our relationship. 
Weeks go by and things are decent. He helped me get back onto my feet financially however the issues still remained and even got worse with my mental health. I was constantly facing relapse after relapse with my self mutilation. He verbally expressed how disgusted and sad he was to see my scars and hated the fact that I was still addicted to the pain. Therapy and medications can only do so much sometimes. 
This was the start of the big downfall. 
Months go by and I’m finally trying to open up. If I could talk about my depression and suicidal thoughts maybe it would lessen to urge to cut?
Only downside is he hated hearing it. He would constantly bring up his dead grandfather and the trauma he had been given due to his death as a way to get me to stop talking. 
It seemed fair. 
And then when I got the memo to literally just shut up about my problems it created a psychological warfare. 
He would say or do something that would hurt me, I would shut down and not talk, and then he would go on a tangent about his problems with my problems. Even go as far as to set up timers for how long I would lay in bed crying and not saying a word to him and even use it against me. And when he realized that the verbal patronize on my issues wasn’t going much of anywhere because I can’t change overnight, he would go back to square one. 
The concept of “I don’t like how your body looks” 
And then cutting began all over again. And he would get angry. So angry as to yell at me, threaten to throw me into a psych ward and cut off all ties to me again. 
It didn’t stop. 
I couldn’t stop. 
I am a young broken hearted person that didn’t want others to fix me. I just want to stop being angry all the damn time. 
He wanted someone to fix; someone who had a happiness to control. 
Yes I did do and say things that were equally hurtful to him. He had insecurities too and I openly used some of them against him whenever I had the chance to walk away from his rant sessions of using my insecurities against me. Cat and mouse. Eye for an eye. A Mental western gun battle. 
And one day I had enough. Enough fights. Enough patronizing. Enough begging. Enough screaming and crying. Enough of asking him to show that he cares the way I want him to care. 
I was too angry to be civil so I went to war. 
I told him the way he talks to me when I’m already down is enough to make me want to die. I told him if he didn’t want to care (because he said it during a fight when it came to my emotions and why I was annoyed with him saying “I don’t care”) then I wasn’t going to ask him to try anymore. I was done for the last time. 
When I got home from work hours after that fight, my last moments with him were just a matter of time. 
I was drowning in guilt and sadness and anger. And I wanted to say I was sorry. 
I can’t remember much of that night. All I remember is him yelling at me for locking the bathroom door and saying I’m just a parasite. 
But sometime after the fight I had decided to take my life through OD. One second I’m sitting on the floor reading my text messages and the next I’m puking on a toilet and trying to allow my body to drift to sleep. The worst part of this was that both of our children were eating dinner. You read that right. I tried to take my life in front of our two 2 year olds. 
Some hours pass and I wake up on the couch. I can’t speak. Breathing is hard. I can’t move. All I feel is nausea and pain in my head. 
Ren wasn’t pleased with my condition and he knew. Eventually he put 2 and 2 together and realized that I was dying right in front of him like I promised I would do earlier that day. 
That was back in early august this year. 
Well I’m not going into the gory details of what happened afterwards other than I got help. Didn’t have a choice but I got it. 
I moved out of Rens house and into my manager’s house- let’s call her Aurora. 
Aurora and I have known and worked with each other for years and she always kept her door open for me. I’ve been with her for 4 months now. Our relationship truly is good and we only ever had 1 serious fight. We did agree on the decision to take things slow given the fact we are both scared and insecure and batshit crazy. 
Anyway onto the “where we are now” for this useless post:
My mental health is still in the trash where it always has been for the past 16 years. And that’s okay. 
My issue is that with time- grief never goes away. So everytime I think of ren or mentally see his face I want to cry and kind of punch it. I wish I could say I’ve moved on and that I’m no longer hurt or sad or angry but 
Well
Grief is difficult. A part of me still loves ren enough to have him tucked away in a tiny corner of my life, another part of me wants him to disappear off the face of the earth, and even a bigger part of me just wishes that attempt didn’t fail just so I wouldn’t have to be dealing with this. 
So as your TLDR: I dated a shallow guy with a kink of verbal humiliation and attempted to take my life in front of him after I saw how much of a bad person I am and months later, grief is weird and never goes away.",1700276763.0,False,1,0,Unanimousbeetle,None,17xwwu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17xwwu1/rantbssadstuff/
68,What Support Groups Have You Found for BPD?,"It sucks to be alone! It also sucks to not be able to afford group therapy! Share your experiences with free support groups from whatever perspective of recovery.

I've been going to two, with a generally positive experience. My experience so far is that it's lovely to have a support group at all; that's about 80% of the benefit. The details of the remaining 20% vary.

1) Emotions Anonymous is a recovery group modified from traditional 12 Step recovery programs like AA or NA. I've been going about once a week for about a year, now. The only requirement to join is a ""desire to become better emotionally."" It's very diagnosis-agnostic, so there are a diversity of psychological geogrpahy. Most of the people I meet there are bipolar, BPD, or suffering from PTSD, with a couple of DID cases. Meetings are supposed to be safe sharing spaces, meaning no unasked advice or commentary on others sharing. I'd say the major benefit other than a sharing space is the anonymity. The structure of the 12 steps might help some people and might frustrate others. The major con, to me, is the higher power stuff. 

https://emotionsanonymous.org/

2) The Icarus Project is a mutual-aid network and support system for people dealing with Mental Health Challenges that normally get called mental illness. I've attended about three meetings in my lifetime. Groups are organized autonomously and non-heriarchically, and groups provide a variety of functions. It is implicitly anarchist, and as such a lot of the literature it offers links mental health policy to repressive political apparati like the prison system. The major thing I like about Icarus is that it is harm reductive and self determinative regarding diagnosis, medication, and treatment options. The hardest part of making the groups happen is that it's hard to get political activists interested in mental health and it's hard to get emotionally debilitated people interested into politics. 

https://theicarusproject.net/

Oh, and Icarus has tons and tons of really good resources though, including a 1 page handout of crisis advice and space to write an advance directive. I highly recommend that anyone with BPD fill out a 1 page sheet on your needs during a crisis rather than let random medical professionals guess at your needs and preferences.

https://theicarusproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IcarusNavigatingCrisisHandoutLarge05-09.pdf

69,Fear of abandonment in a relationship,"I (f24) am  married to a 7 year older man for half a year now and I feel the need to share my feelings with you. My BPD gets in my head every day and my reality testing is by all means blurred but this doesn’t stop me from fearing maybe not being left but maybe feeling less than. I am the more attractive one, I kind of settled for him because I feared (again, a fear-based decision typical for me) that nobody would handle my mental outbursts and sadness. He is handsome, not gonna lie, but I’m in a higher league (my feeling and his words) but he keeps doing the same thing for a couple of years now - saying to me that he is so handsome, well-built, has so nice hair and this kind of stuff that makes me think higher of himself and less of myself. He sometimes told me things lime your teeth is yellow, you look better in dry hair than in wet hair (what the hell?) and generally things that made me feel worse after. I have confronted him about this straight away and also some time after and O got the explanation that he was stupid and that he regrets it but I still feel miserable sometimes thinking that he’s capable of saying things like that. I know that his words are not very painful, he’s not a bad guy, but I’ve experienced men before who only complimented me and never said this kind of things to me, so whenever I experience that I feel extremely sad. I ask for tips on getting out of my head and not taking everything so personally because all of us say sometimes things that are inappropriate, of course me included, in my BPD outbursts.

70,can't get a diagnosis!,"So I am usually not one to self-diagnose. I have been under psychiatric care since I was 13 (now 23) and have been diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, social phobia, OCD, anorexia, ADHD, and PTSD and I typically defer to my doctors/therapists. But it's pretty fucking obvious to me that there is something bigger going on here... how would a person have 7 unrelated mental illnesses?! I have been on a cocktail of psychiatric medications since age 13, tried every type of therapy that I could and I still feel like I'm grasping at straws and trying to treat things that are just symptoms of a larger problem.

I have done A LOT of research (I'm talking hours upon hours) and am reasonably confident that I have Quiet BPD. I think the reason that no practitioner has caught onto it is because I internalize everything and I only lash out at myself. I don't really show any external signs of having BPD, however I have 8/9 BPD characteristics in the DSM (for context, diagnosis is appropriate with 5/9 symptoms). 

When I brought this up with my psychiatrist, she said she doesn't really see typical BPD traits in me (which I think is because I have quiet subtype and it's highly internal) and that she is hesitant to diagnose BPD because of the stigma it carries... okay, but I am confident that I meet the diagnosis standards under the DSM and need to be treated for BPD instead of the other seven issues, as the BPD & PTSD are no doubt what is causing everything else. 

I really don't want to self diagnose. But I have brought this up with multiple therapists, psychiatrists, etc. and my ED recovery coach is the only one to see the truth in what I'm saying. I *know* something deeper is going on. I have felt this way my whole life and only when reading about quiet BPD was I able to understand the chronic emptiness that has caused all of the other issues. Yes, I have an ED, yes I am depressed. But they are not the root issues and I feel like I'm not being listened to.

72,Relationship dilemma,"BPD, CPTSD, Bipolar 2

Sorry for this long rant, trying to make sense of my broken life and needed to share with others who might be more understanding about what I’m going through, with my mental illness.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I’m afraid I’m too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I’d he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me….. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can’t and won’t get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",1688449467.0,False,1,0,Old-Meet-1322,None,14q68cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14q68cv/relationship_dilemma/
73,I’m over me,"I’m not being my best for myself or my partner.

Since the pandemic, I have become extremely codependent with my bf, increasingly stressed with work, lack of self care, and my mental health is deteriorating. I’m broke and can’t afford meds/therapy or I would definitely be on them by now.

I’m realizing that any time my partner leaves to go hangout with friends I get a flood of heavy ass emotions. For example: I’m not good enough, a burden, self hatred, jealous of whoever he is hanging out with, and most importantly suicidal ideations.  It’s like as soon as he makes plans I immediately feel abandoned. I think this is some sort of unresolved trauma/“daddy issues”. I want to stop reacting and obsessing over everything and just be ok if I am alone for a few hours without taking it personally.

When I’m having these episodes I blow my partner up almost immediately after he leaves and tell him I feel _____(insert unhealthy toxic emotion here). He never goes out and at this point is tired of my shit and I’m not delusional I understand- but in the moment when he is placing a boundary I lose it. It turns into a huge panic attack and it’s Extremely unfair to him. I’m going to lose him if I can’t get a hold of my emotions and insecurities. 

I’m not looking for judgements, but I figured venting here is a better outlet than crying :) I’ve looked into BPD and was wondering if anyone has some info on that. 

Everything always ends up with me saying  a “you don’t love me” thing and not just to my bf to anyone I feel hurt by.

74,About to embark on a 32 week DBT/Therapy program - spaces available in the group DBT sessions,"I am about to bite the bullet and begin a course of therapy and DBT training.  It’s going to send me into debt, but I’ve been in debt before and never for anything this valuable.

After searching online, I have found a licensed professional counselor and psychologist who is trained and experienced in working with pwBPD and in facilitating DBT Skills training sessions.

This therapist has a solid track record and (like Linehan) does not suggest medication – and very importantly to me, does not suggest facing or exploring traumas during this program.  This appeals to me.

I am in Asia, so I have been looking all over.  This counselor is based in the UK – and recommends a 32 week program – two sessions a week. One session each week will be group DBT Skills training, and the other will be 1 on 1 sessions exploring and applying the DBT training.

Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 2 (8 weeks) 	emotion regulation
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 3 (8 weeks)	interpersonal effectiveness
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 4 (8 weeks)	distress tolerance
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness

What is really tough for me is the cost – the session cost is 95GBP per session.  However, they would pro-rata this rate for the group DBT sessions – 95 divided by the number of participants.  That appeals to me because I learn very well in a group, and the pwBPD support group I take part in has been very valuable to me.

They are currently reaching out to colleagues to learn if there are others being treated who would like to be part of DBT Skills training and therapy.  So I want to share that opportunity here.

I recognize it is expensive.  I am fortunate enough that a close friend has seen how I suffered in the past 18 months and is lending me the money – it will take me quite a while to pay it back but its so much more important than anything I ever went into debt for.   It is also a solid commitment – they require we sign a contract  to commit to the program.

While it might not be for everyone here, I thought it might be worthwhile to present it to see who in this subreddit is interested.  I am eager to get started, to finally take a step I have never done and commit to 8 months of difficult weekly work.  It would certainly make it easier if the group sessions had 3-5 people, and not only me or me and one other.

IF you are interested, feel you can manage the cost (with a group session reduction as indicated), and want to know more; PM me.  I am happy to share the therapists profile and answer what I can, and connect you with them if you want to know more – they offer a free consultation session to help you decide if its right for you.

75,"After having this med cocktail+not burdening myself, I am better. I was having a huge mental breakdown a year ago.","Forgive me if I have typo, I’m typing on my phone.

I was going crazy. Just crazy. I don’t even want to talk about it because it’s so shameful.
The breakdown was caused by lots of things, but major thing was school stress, alcohol, etc.

I got hospitalized again. 3rd time.
I was having a good calming 72 hours.
Later on I have realized I am an alcoholic. 

So I quit, I think at least 40% of my sanity comes from not drinking. I tried A.A in person and online plus networking, I personally didn’t like it.

Then my psychiatrist prescribed me Librium, I was on over than reg dose for anxiety -(reg dose that ppl take in google) 
I was being a zombie but I think it was worthy, I’m tired of laying down all day.

Since I was a zombie I decreased the dose, switched to klonopin since quantity is not available for some reasons in my area. 
I was on 1 mg, started SNRI -Pristiq. 
25mg once daily didn’t work.
50mg I felt difference after I started taking it for like more than 3 weeks.

As time goes on, I added weed (vaping and consuming medical weed) for tapering benzo+I like the effect. Makes me distracted when I am upset sometimes, when I need a calming time, morning time before my pharma med kicks in, before I go to bed.

I take only 0.25 of klpin twice daily.



So
-Antidepressant reg dose (everyone is different, Pristiq was my match)

-No alcohol (my emotional side gets crazy)

-Benzo(I don’t recommend it because of severe physical withdrawal, but it’s working well for my anxiety. Before I would be walking and looking back v often and thinking someone would attack me. I don’t have those thoughts unless someone gets super x2 close to me. 

-Medical mmj. Since I don’t like how potent flower smells it works. 
 I don’t recommend black market for vaping. Since I have been paying for my therapy out of pocket, I have 2sessions a month now. Used to have 3-4 sessions a month. 
Tbh now albeit I use about 3g of vaping mmj within in a month in a med mmj expensive City(half gram would cost me $65-75), I pay less for my mental health(it’s been 12 years, going to therapy, looking for right medication. I couldn’t handle dbt. I hated group sessions.)



I am far better than who I was exactly a year ago. I dropped out of school, I got a small job, talking to my parents, I don’t feel so miserable like before. I don’t want to kill myself for things that don’t matter. 

I feel like I am gifted. 
Even tho I have some struggles daily, ofc life is not a easy thing. My work place is stressful, min wage. But at least I can kill time with studying.
I’m just gonna get a certification.


I had 100,000 thoughts a day. Now I have 5000 thoughts and those are not suicidal.

76,Perspective Struggles: Yoyo of Hope & Despair,"Hey! Thanks in advance to any readers and/or commenters. I also want to preface this post by noting that I do have bipolar as well as bpd; maybe this is a mental health thing, maybe just me, maybe a mix... 

Ever since I can remember, I've experienced cycles of hope, followed by cycles of despair (oftentimes being let down by whatever I was hopeful about). While I feel like I'm learning to handle this cycle in relation to people/friends, I feel stuck in the cycle when it comes to other elements of life. For instance, I was so excited to move into my apartment, but very quickly became disappointed by the attitudes and actions of surrounding units, as well as the size and cost. 

More pressing, I have long upheld this cycle when it comes to jobs. Retail sucked, so I went into sales; sales sucked, so I worked at a call centre; tech support sucked, so I moved to an admin position at the centre; next I tried working as a debt collector, at the same office as my best friend. At this office, I forced myself to stay around and wound up being an abused workhorse for the last 1.5yrs (of my 4 years there). 

Then the pandemic hit and I full on had a mental break (it was a long time coming), which ultimately lead to my bpd (and bipolar) diagnosis. Working with counselors, my doctor, and my personal expertise, I negotiated a settlement out of this last role and started from zero in a crazy ass job market (Vancouver, Canada). Since then I have struggled finding any job, and the jobs I do get make me hate my existence almost more than ever before.

Especially since this break, I'll get so excited to start a new job - as if it were the answer to everything - before quickly becoming jaded, then angry, then desperate to get out. I have sought community-based career counseling - where they told me I had too much education for them to help me; I appealed to provincial-based career counseling - where they said I just need to apply to anything and everything to see what fits; and I've also looked into private career counseling, but they say they can't help me unless I know what I want to do (which I do not)... 
I have a BA in history, MA in political science; I was heavily involved in organizing (clubs, committees, and conferences) during my time at school, but was not able to break into the non-profit world. I have no idea what I would like to do, but I make a job my whole life. Partially because this is how I want to live my life, but also in part because I literally don't have anything else in my life. 


SO I'm hoping for some advice on how I might change my perspective; any thoughts you have on how you found your enjoyable career/job; or even just your reaction. The cycle of perceived solution followed by despair is exhausting and to the point of negatively impacting my health.

78,Feeling hopeless,"I just got off the phone with my doctor regarding my diagnosis. I have had around 10 years of therapy (of which three years of CBD) and  several diagnoses (attachment disorder, childhood abuse/neglect, ptsd, adhd, ED,  unspecified personality disorder among other smaller stuff). A lot of these have not been taken seriously or disregarded by other specialists because I was too young, too unstable or the diagnoses were clashing. Which is all valid. but i felt like I am in a calmer and more stable environment so I can get properly diagnosed.

Now they told me that I do seem like I have a high functioning personality disorder that seems to be BPD. BUT. i am too high functioning. they literally told me I seem to have ""beaten"" it already. I am 21 years old, which seems kinda unlikely to me as neither myself nor any of my friends or family think I am mentally healthy enough to go without any diagnosis or treatment and now I am stuck with the diagnosis of reoccurring depression - which in no way explains my extreme mood swings, dissociative episodes and occasional psychotic episodes. Feeling depressed is honestly the least of my worries.

BPD is rooted in both sides of my family and several specialists have told me I do check most of the boxes. I don't know what to do, my FP just left me because I am too difficult and too depressed and dysfunctional for him to handle. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this and I don't know how to get a second opinion (I'm in the UK). In the meantime I am unable to do any uni work and am without a job due to the pandemic and I just spend all day in bed trying to get through the day without making things worse, while my mental health gets worse every day.

My symptoms are fucking up my life so much and I am so done feeling this way and being so dysfunctional all the time and not having any stability regarding the people in my life. I just wanna be normal. I don't wanna drink or get high to not feel anymore, I don't wanna keep isolating myself from the people I care about because I'm scared I'll hurt their feelings or do something that'll end up in them leaving me. I don't wanna be this way I wanna work my way to being somewhat normal, and yet I am ""too high functioning"" to be treated. I feel hopeless and like all this is never gonna go away and I don't know how to keep living this life without any proper help or understanding from my surroundings....

What do I do? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

EDIT: I have also been told that they refuse to diagnose me with BPD because then health services will reject treatment. Is this true?",1609853138.0,False,3,4,pieceofurheart,None,kqyf1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/kqyf1z/feeling_hopeless/
79,ex.,"i am struggling so heavy. i’m doing better than i ever have, but god. we’ve only been broken up for 2 months and our relationship was short lived, 4 months. but i’m sure a bulk of you can relate to how intense your feelings for a significant other/relationship is. we started strong off the bat and jumped into things so fast, but it honestly felt so worth it. i’ve done this before in past relationships, but never as intimate/vulnerable/meaningful as this one was. 

i miss everything. i miss showering together, i miss spending so much of our time together, i miss our concerts in the car. our car time was our music time and it was something both of us were so excited for, we were constantly updating our playlists specifically for our car rides together. i miss going grocery shopping together, i miss running errands together. god do i miss our meal times. she focused so heavily about our meals. we typically would go to waffle house for breakfast, or if we slept in we would make breakfast together. we’d go out for lunch or again, make something together. but for dinner we always planned out a meal to make at home. she was the cook, i was just around her for “moral support” i suppose. she would always get so excited for dinner time. i would always be in there while she cooked because she wanted to be around me, she couldn’t do it without me. we ate together and always cleaned up afterwards. i miss taking care of her animals while she was at work, i miss taking care of them together. i miss cleaning the house together or surprising her with a cleaned room when she came home from work. i miss taking her starbucks on occasion while she was at work. i miss picking her up sometimes on her lunch break to spend that time laughing and talking in the car together. i fucking miss laughing with her. we spent so much of our time teasing, joking around, and just genuinely happy with one another. 

when we were together in person at least, when we got into arguments/fights.. she always got me to sit with her, hold her hands or touch in some way, and we would both talk about our side of the problem and then collectively came up with a solution or a compromise. god i fucking miss her. 

we broke up based off of a miscommunication and my actions. i was convinced she had it out for me and didn’t care about me. she tried validating my feelings everyday and communicated to me that she was extremely tired from work and college, but i was CONVINCED that wasn’t the case. so i ended up blowing up and left her. she didn’t want me to leave, i did it based off of imaginary fear of abandonment and basing my actions from my emotions. 
this was our second time being together, our first time was practically the same reasoning. so this time she was basically just really exhausted from me and how i reacted with that. i completely understand.

what i would fucking do to hear her talking about her favorite things. to do everything with her. or even just to lay in bed with her doing nothing. 

how do you overcome these intense feelings? how do you know when you need to keep trying, just with time; or when to completely give up? 

i wore a hoodie of hers that i still have, it smelled like her. i sobbed my eyes out for 3 hours and went through our pictures/videos together and re-read some of our messages. i’m a disaster. 


i am focusing on myself. i’m dieting, im in therapy weekly, im on medication, i paint, i read, i go on walks, i do things for myself. i just miss her with practically every bone in my body",1667448629.0,False,10,3,Fun_Sea_1109,None,ykrums,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ykrums/ex/
80,I've run my relationship to the ground,"this post might be a bit all over the place so tyia to anyone that reads it. and I will preface by saying this is worded as a venting post, but i am open to advice/criticism because I want to accept accountability here and hopefully fix things but please, please be gentle with wording as I'm super sensitive and don't want to spiral more.

my 6 month relationship just ended a few weeks ago. he ended it. however at the same time he ended things, I was already spiralling and very mentally unstable and suicidal. so he has kept in contact with me and tried to support me as much as he can. he even was willing to give me another chance, but I have been so unstable that I haven't been able to do what I told him I would do- truly we should be waiting a bit until I'm more stable before he gives me another chance (and we both acknowledged this a few nights ago). I learned shortly before I met him that I had BPD, and I thought that I recognized all my symptoms- well I was wrong. our whole relationship he has told me that he was unsure if we would work. and I always thought he meant that he wasn't sure he wanted me. since the very first time he said it, it's never left my head and caused my bpd to spiral even more with the thoughts of not being loved and why am I with him if he doesn't want me? ever since then it's only gotten worse, with me picking out every single behavior he does as proof he doesn't want/respect/love me. the fact that his love language didn't match mine made me feel like he didn't love me, and I'd try to share it with him, but I was sharing it over every little behavior. we were having ""conversations"" or ""tiffs"" weekly. it has been exhausting for both of us. I'm constantly splitting. I love him so much for who he is, but every time he does something that I view as proof he doesn't like me, I split, and I see it as completely black. I feel no love for him because I feel like he doesn't have it for me. I get so upset at him. every single time, I think ""this isn't going to work, we can't be together because if this is how he treats me then how can we be together long term? why should I be with someone that doesn't want me?"". I genuinely thought he was the reason we weren't thriving and I wasn't feeling loved.

the past few weeks, ive been looking more into BPD and resonating with SO much of it. almost every single thing. it explains almost all of my behaviors. I didn't realize what I was doing was splitting, and seeing it as black and white. when he does the tiniest thing, I literally can't feel the whole of the relationship and I focus solely on that one thing. 5 minutes after we fight, I'm totally in love with him again and fine, and then I get upset because he doesn't bounce back the same. well duh, of course he's not going to. he's a normal person that was just yelled at for his normal human actions. he's confused and hurt and probably wondering why I love him one second and hate him the next? I'm wondering the same thing. I always thought we just weren't compatible. but I'm realizing more that I'm the reason we're not doing well. I'm so fucking sensitive. I read last night the quote about how people with BPD are like burn victims, and I was like holy shit that's what it feels like.

I pre-imagine what I think his reactions or actions will be, and when it's not that, I get upset. why am I not able to let him be a fucking human being? why do I need him to act exactly how I expect him to act? and why do I have expectations in the first place? 

I don't want to lose him. he is the first person I've ever truly loved, not someone I've been infatuated with as my FP. I don't feel like I need him to survive, which is another first, I WANT him. I love and value our time together. when I'm not making him feel like a terrible fucking human being, things go so well. I want to stop treating him like this, but it's not intentional. im not intentionally degrading him. it's a deeply rooted feeling that he doesn't love me, and I bring it to his attention when he does things that remind me of it. he's never treated me bad. there is only one specific instance where I can remember him treating me ""poorly"", but in reality he was just so fucking done and defeated and didn't know what to say or do and just wanted to go to sleep. but from that specific night, my mental health and our relationship has just completely declined. he tried to break up with me the next day. we've had so many instances of almost breaking up. I was thinking it was because he didn't want me. but in reality it was because he couldn't handle me always pulling out the worst in him and ragging on him.

is there any hope of saving this? after everything we've been through, he's literally still here. he has stayed this whole time. even after we broke up, were still hanging out and texting every day. he clearly has love for me. he clearly cares. but why can't I see it? why can I only focus on the things he does ""wrong""? last week he brought me flowers and an activity book for us to do together, and then this weekend I got upset with him twice over literally nothing but in the moment it felt like everything. when it happens, the feelings are so intense and I there's nothing I can do to pull myself out of it. 


and on the flip side, I'm the most understanding and caring person to him. he has a lot of his own issues he's deal with himself, and I've supported him through all of it. I tell him frequently how much I care for him and I try to help with his grief and his mental health and try to tell him to give himself grace. how can I say that in one breath and then in the next be mad at him every other day for literally nothing? his mental health has deteriorated from this as well just from me flip flopping on him so frequently and calling him out on everything. 


how do I fix my thought process? any sane person would've blocked me a long time ago. he said last night that he sees I'm trying based on how much research I'm doing and me apologizing and taking the accountability, and I'm looking into therapists that specialize in PTSD or BPD, and other treatments. but I don't want to lose him. even though he deserves to not be in this rollercoaster anymore. he deserves to be loved, and I want to be the one to love him. he's willing to give me a chance, and I so badly don't want to fuck it up again. it's hard to say officially because of everything weve been through, but part of me feels like he could be the one. I have never been able to picture a future with someone before. I've never wanted kids with someone before. I've never wanted a life with someone. until I met him. about 3/4 months into dating, I felt like this might be it. I want him.

I've found that I have a physiological reaction to high carb/sweet foods.   When I stick with a low carb diet, my mind is clearer and I just feel better!    Intermittent fasting also has helped.

Removing all alcohol helps as well.   I hadn't drank anything for almost six months and was really surprised at how quickly my emotion regulation was affected by even small amounts of alcohol.

82,DAE split with their therapist?,"i split for a lot of people and i guess it’s understandable that a therapist won’t be excluded. pretty much any professional i’m getting help from i split pretty easily based on the care i receive. i know that with any mental illness you have to go through therapists to find a good match, but i’ve been thinking and i think i just discarded a lot of them because they told me what i didn’t wanna hear.

this is a complicated thing because on one hand, i wasn’t diagnosed until 2019. so any therapist before then i wasn’t recovered let alone aware of my toxic behaviors and i’m sure i threw away a good therapist or two. on the other hand, if they didn’t know i had bpd there’s a good chance they just weren’t giving me the care i needed.

i have a good view on my new therapist but i struggle with accepting that there’ll be things with every therapist that they might not do well on because of how complex bpd is, there is room for mistakes. now that i’m aware i’m trying to remain positive about my therapist. luckily she’s really good so it’s not too hard.",1613757214.0,False,6,5,callisharpe03,None,lnm1es,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/lnm1es/dae_split_with_their_therapist/
83,Trying to recover while in a new relationship,"Hey everybody ! I have recently been on the journey to start recovery right now after going through a really rough and challenging time after starting a new medication that brought out the worst parts of myself and a new relationship that i realized heightens my bpd symptoms (even just having the context of being in a relationship had me triggered). I want to further my growth as much as possible so I want to make sure I work towards my growth instead of against it. So I share this in hopes of getting feedback or really any response! I want to know what other ppl think from an objective POV ! This is a long post so be prepared for that ! 

I am currently tapering off this medication and working through dbt workbooks and in the process of getting started at an outpatient dbt program ! We both have mental illness and they have gotten treatment/ are going to therapy and taking meds however unfortunately things started turning toxic unknowingly and there was a dynamic created where I started burdening my partner and they felt like they always had to be there for me even if they didn’t have the capacity to otherwise in their mind who else would and over time started revolving their whole life around me (even isolating themselves from others just to b around me and try to be there for me in crisis). They took me expressing some of my intrusive thoughts and fear of abandonment to heart and made themselves suffer to make me feel “better” or not to abandon or leave me.

 I would word vomit and over share a lot of things I definitely should’ve kept to myself but that I never knew was making them feel like this. Our communication was off because they thought it would make me feel even worse and I would in turn internalize any feedback or criticism and also sometimes they didn’t even know how they felt never mind to then tell me. We got into a habit of them reassuring me no matter what and a routine of seeing each other all the time. After a major meltdown from me and a long day of work, we got to the point where we both got triggered and had an emotional night which lead me to initiate conversation about the issues that are there. 

As we uncovered more, it was disturbing to see how something that we both thought was going pretty well to see how actually unhealthy our start was.  

We have granted each other space as we definitely need to think, reflect and let ourselves read the situation/our feelings more. Last night, we talked about it and took accountability and shared feelings that were scary to say and admit but were needed to be said. We decided instead of breaking up we both are going to put forth the effort and time and patience to try and care for ourselves more and in turn make it so that we rebuild and unlearn all the misconceptions that we had in our relationship by creating and actively writing down different solutions to our issues and putting in a plan to how to achieve it to give us another go but I wonder if even this is a way of being toxic. 

My worst nightmare of burdening someone else’s mental state bc of me came true and while it was on them for the lack and dishonest sense of communication within themselves and with me I just don’t want to make more toxic decisions and hurt us both in the end :,( 

Any feedback would be appreciated and I guess if anyone relates to this it would be nice to know I’m not alone in this position. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed that I let myself get to the point where I was hindering the growth of my partner and weighing their life down but I’m trying to accept that there’s nothing I can do about the past and just to take accountability and change however if anyone has suggestions on how not to feel so guilty/bad/ashamed please lmk !!",1625235134.0,False,4,4,lotus-pea,None,ocawyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ocawyx/trying_to_recover_while_in_a_new_relationship/
84,I have kids and I don't regret it,"I see a lot of people who suffer from BPD saying they never want to have children and don't get me wrong this is PERFECTLY fine.

It is their choice and I'm happy for them that they are aware that it is not for them.

I also see a lot of people who's parent(s) was diagnosed with BPD and they suffered from their parent's disorder, their mood swings and unstable relationships. 

I just want to say that first off, having BPD does not always mean having narcissist personality disorder, and while they can occur together, they're not synonyms (it seems like a common misconception).

It also seems like a lot of people think that those with BPD should never have kids. I personally disagree. 

I was diagnosed with BPD a few months ago, after thinking I might have it for about 7 years. When I got the diagnosis, I got worried for my two kids.

But you know what? After talking with the mental health counselor (who put me on the waiting list for BPD group therapy), I realized that I am extremely aware of my symptoms, and because of that, I can offer a good environment for my kids to grow up in. 

Per example, yes, I tend to act recklessly, but I never ever put my children in danger or even expose them to what I do. 

I have crazy spending habits, but I found people who I trust to not be judgy, to mentor me financially.

I am just way too aware of my symptoms to let them affect my kids. I am not saying it NEVER happened or it never will, but I feel like I am getting better at controlling my mood swings (let's say putting them in the corner of my brain, and then letting the emotions out once the kids are at daycare). Let me also say that anger is not that much of a problem for me (I am very good at repressing this one).

I would not say I am recovered, since I just got the diagnosis recently, but if you consider how far I came from, then I am definetly on my way and optimistic for the future.

Right now, I am working on my relationship with food (hello going from binge-eating to restricting wildly every few months) and productivity, self-discipline when it comes to getting a degree.

Anyways. I just hope that this post helps someone in some way, maybe someone who hopes to recover and one day have children.

85,Some help here.,"

Can anybody help me. I am all alone. I am 31 yo Indian man.I feel stagnant in life. I have never been in a relationship and never will be. 
I have a family that has mental health issues. I got them from age 16. I know no one cares for this too but atleast some might gaze through.
I have no talent. I lived my life fighting what was diagnosed OCD and anxiety in the beginning and now after 15 years passing through psychotic diagnoses, has reached dependent traits hyper vigilant and now I conclude based on years long suffering and self redirections, and recent counseling that involved a psychometric test as a form of bpd known as quiet bpd. Now, before seeing my worthlessness right away for a relationship, I am not harmful like the other bpd types( even though they suffer much more and get no help from society), mine is not evident and hence took so long to find. 
Now, I have no purpose in life no self image, dependent, people pleasing( I hate myself for that, because world is so selfish when I look it through my bpd glasses.)I worked in different domains in a job I got and now I am a jack of all.
I hate myself.
I don't want this life. But I am not suicidal. I just want to walk away. Just avoid the trauma altogether. You know what on top of all this I took an snri a few years ago along with the high dose ssri(prescribed) without asking anyone or consulting, because I felt ( rn I am sure nobody will read it but there is a very small hope a little light, a fantasy rather. It's very painful to recollect it in a way that conveys my situation here).
So I took that snri because I felt so down and afraid of myself and my future as I stayed alone in the apartment and thought atleast I overcome that fear, because somehow I had to complete the integrated mtech that was the only way forward for me. I did all the work I could and somehow got out with some experience and the degree sponsored by the company.
In the end, here is the funny part, the snri complicated my condition. I have this frozen feeling with no emotions. I was in a constant fight or fright mode and it even affected my health. I started feeling zero hope in life. All I could do was sit on a bed and being I don't know just felt empty all the time. Actually I stopped feeling anything, let alone fear. No docs could help. Because I don't know how to relax. I am processing that stressed state in some other way
that I can't let go. I just start to panic when I feel stressed. I tried many relaxation techniques like emdr and eft and all that. I am now using CBD daily and it is helping my psychotic mind as well as slowly I am able to process the stuck energy.

87,First few days...,"It  has been an exhausting 5 years. I escaped my abusers, got married to my soulmate (yikes), started therapy for PTSD, got diagnosed with ADHD, and tried medication this year. There’s one huge problem: I’m on dialysis and Adderall XR is __undializable__ meaning it’s has no way to exit my body. I went full psychotic you guys. So I stopped taking the Adderall and it finally has broken down to its components and filtered out. 

But then I was still getting angry. Just like I used to. I still couldn’t sleep, just like I used to. My inner critic used me as a whipping girl, just like she did when I was mentally hallucinating that she was gonna eat my face off. 

I got a Generalized Personality Disorder diagnosis from a resident marriage therapist about a year ago. 

It’s been a long ass fucking year. I’ve touched on DBT, and fought tooth and nail with my behaviors to “prove” I didn’t have BPD. But I was bent until I was broken and I had to pick up the pieces. And the BPD was still there. 

Y’all, I’ve never got a 9/9 on anything. I finally watched a few videos. My flip-switch, ends-quick rage, my self hate, my suicidal but not really tendencies, it was all in there. Even the parts where I was more prone to stressed-based psychosis. (Previously I had been diagnosed as “depression with psychosis”) 

So over the weekend I’ve been trying to hard. I’ve been messaging my therapist instead of my husband. When I do tell my husband stuff it’s consise and not 15 pages. I isolated myself today while I was mad, and “rode the wave” and was able to figure out almost everything behind that particular shitfit. I also didn’t escalate my anger at something my husband was doing, into anger at him, and I avoided a good bit of verbal abuse. 

But all of this is so tiring. And I’m barely scratching the surface. The conversations my husband and I are having are deep and scary and I haven’t been this honest with anybody about this stuff. I have new fears, and new ways to practice old fears. 

I just wanna be better. I wanna stop abusing my husband. I wanna not feel like shit all the time. I wanna stop fighting because I have a hairline trigger and he accidentally makes it worse somehow. 

The road has been long, and the road will be long ahead. But I am recognizing how sneaky (In a good way) my therapists have been and how I actually have a few DBT skills already, I just have to learn how to apply them. Radical acceptance a few months ago helped us stop fighting about the dishes. Riding the Wave has helped me isolate and quickly manage breakdowns before they affect my husband. 

He just is so afraid of me now. He’s so jumpy. And I am heartbroken. I can’t believe I’ve done this to the man I love. Except this time instead of my inner critic taking hold, I’m using it to be better every time in cognizant enough to S T O P. 

On the one hand, this is such a tall mountain. An Everest perhaps. But I have told him that he is my Foreverest Love, because I would climb Everest for him. Well now I’m being called to task, and I just gotta pick up my ropes and start climbing, no matter how hard it is.

I’m posting this cause I’m anxious I can’t do it. I’m so early in my journey I still have most of my disordered thoughts and behaviors. I’ve been looking for the evidence to calm my anxiety, but even so, my critic pesters me “you’ll never be good enough and he’ll leave” even though he knows I’m afraid of that and had literally guaranteed the opposite.

88,Do you relate?,"I have different moments where I feel fine and others where they seem to be hard to explain. I have moments where I am happy and feel I have things together for the most part. I have BPD, BED, OCD & Misophonia. As well as health issues like being overweight, thyroid issues, PCOS, Severe Depression, high anxiety and that's all I can think of atm. I can't stand for too long or sit for too long without being in pain. I feel so overwhelmed. I'm also a mom of 3. I have missed my last 2 therapy appointments because I felt as if I didn't need them. I chose sleep before work instead. My schedule feels really crazy almost all the time. I feel as if I need a brea again. I took a month off of work due to being sick, having to have a colposcopy and just mentally needed a break. Does anyone deal with this? Do you ever feel like you are okay one minute and then things start to happen and you feel you don't know how to get things under control? I try to be as logical as I can. I'm better at being mindful..but I still get upset and I still get angry. My anger gets set off so easily..I really hate that about myself. Even if it's just like an initial angry moment I think logically and calm down. If I can't handle it I do smoke. I smoke at night mostly but I've had times where I needed to a little beforehand.

89,having bpd is the equivalent to having third degree burns all over your body,"long ass vent for myself tbh

""Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement""

Marsha linehan who developed the therapy method DBT said that about people who suffer from borderline.

It quite literally produces the most intense emotional pain of any mental illness, it has a fatality rate of 10% 45 times more than the general population. 

According to Linehan we lose all cognitive functioning during periods of extreme emotional distress which unfortunately for BPD can happen at the drop of a feather. 

Personally for me it used to be a raging burning feeling in my head. Where I couldnt hear the rational part of my brain telling me you love this person, this isn't you, you don't want to do this, it's not a big deal. The voice in the back of my head that shuts that shit down immediately now was practically silenced. I couldnt hear them no matter how much I tried. Or if I actually managed to hear them and gripped onto it to bring myself back; I would just spiral and fall right back into the pit anyways. Because I had never even started the true healing process. And because the person I was with fed the worst parts of my fears and insecurities. My brain was completely consumed with so much of that hurt/fear/insecurity/humilation and it turned to a unceasing completely blinding rage. I would fall back in again and again desperately clawing to get out but succumbing each time to the borderline insanity that involuntarily manifested in my brain. 

My most painful moments of BPD haunt me every day. The absolute loss of control I used to feel over the smallest most stupid things. Scream crying alone in my room again and again, feeling the extreme grief equivalent to all my loved ones being murdered in front of me repeatedly over a simple relationship ending, its literally hell on fucking earth. Right now my dog who I love more than anything (outside of my FP) even more than myself, could be murdered right in front of me and I still know it wouldn't even compare to what I felt in every moment of the nightmare that was my existence at the time. 

I remember thinking in those moments of absolute mania and panic that this was anguish beyond belief, nothing had ever compared or ever could. Not even the extreme torture and abuse from my childhood. And I got brushed off and told it wasn't nearly THAT bad and it just feels that way because I'm still so close to it. No way could the emotional pain ever match the insanity of what my step mum put me through. As if I wasn't the one who had to deal with and then overcome the unceasing years and years of nightmares, flashbacks and constant panic attacks. As if I don't remember how acute that particular pain is. 

Well it's been over a year now and my extreme physical pain experiences will never ever fucking compare to the absolute torture of those moments. I would go through the worst of the worst all again than feel even a moment of that. When I tell people that they really can't believe me. They hear what happened to me in childhood and then what my ex did to me and it's not even comparable to them. How could I even for a second say she hurt me more? 

People without BPD literally cannot even comprehend how painful and intense our emotions can get. How everything is dialled up to a billion and we have NO control over it. I truly believe the vast vast majority of them (even ones who have been seriously hurt) have never felt the amount of agony that BPD people (involuntarily) create in their own heads. I believe that, because I've been through extreme verbal sexual and physical abuse and it was nothing to how my brain blindsided and ambushed me when I got my first FP. I understand why it doesn't make sense to them they will never understand what we have to live with and go through every day just by existing. But for me personally no amount of my sexual trauma or physical torture will ever compare to the pain of just being with a favourite person who showed me my first experiences of ""love"", made me feel joy for the first time in my life and then had to leave me, moved on and no longer cared for me at all anymore. (Actually was actively out for my blood in my situation 😐) Especially when you only live for the people you love in the first place. They are your entire centre of existence. In your head it's absolutely inconceivable you could ever not dedicate every part of yourself to them. What do you do then...

Fortunately for me I healed. Back then, with the person I was with, my body did really feel like an exposed wound at all times. Any little thing could set it off and cause me extreme pain. She couldn't understand how much pain I was in because I was cursed to manifest it as anger. Of course that makes it hard to empathise with especially when you become a victim of abuse as a result. I truly couldn't control it, I didn't realise this at the time but she constantly unintentionally kept me in a state of fear of abandonment and continuously enforced insecurities surrounding my body and who I even am as a person. Every little thing would set me off subconsciously, it would effect my emotions and actions in ways I couldn't control or many times even notice. Because my feelings were constantly being hurt by her, constantly felt devestation bubbling under the surace because no one meant more to me, no one's effect on my emotions even came close. So sometimes it was overt and drastic. I truly could not understand my extreme reaction to something so stupid after. That wasn't me. No part of that was me I know now deep down to my core my need for control completely came from fear. I was 100x more sensitive, everything was so agonising all the time without me even realising. And unfortunately that led me to take it out on them which kept me in a constant state of shame and regret that I had to push down as well.

Throughout my childhood my brain learned that fight, not flight would save me. The only time the torture stopped was when I hurt them back. So when I feel pain or hurt or anything that destabilizes me; especially from the person who had grounded me the most and had once made me feel the safest and most loved when no one else has before. I became theirs. I quite literally belonged to them, I didn't even realise how miserable I was. Once they showed me that side to life I couldn't let go. I relied on them entirely for any sense of safety and comfort or happiness so subconsciously when they took that away from me my brain ""defends"" itself without my fucking permission. It haunts me that the people I loved the most I used to hurt the most. I wish it could have been anyone else than the people I care for so deeply. As much as I wish I internalized that pain...I couldn't, I really really fucking couldnt at the time. So I lashed out, again and again and again uncontrollably until she thankfully left me and I got to find someone I could actually have my skin and a true sense of safety with for the first time in my life. 

Immense healing happened so rapidly. She immediately made me feel secure in my body, and satisfied in general within the first few weeks, which gave me a huge boost of self esteem and motivation to actually practice self care and improve myself. I mean if she could find me beautiful this fucking girl then I gotta try. I had to actually be worthy of her. I will never let myself be unworthy again. I needed to stop being a depressed potato and actually be my best self. Be Bucky in a sense. Also she seemed so attracted to me, so into me and even my body. She saw something I never could I wanted to see myself for the first time through her eyes. See myself as beautiful. 

She gave me hope, actually hope I could be better and change everything. Undo all the excessive damage that was done to my brain. Figure out all the different personalities rattling around in there and learn to listen and focus on the ones that are actually me. Not manifested from the darkest, traumatised, survival mode parts of myself. I realised I had so many layers, so many different thought processes going on at once. Of course it led to instability. I needed to silence them... I started DBT. I grinded in therapy twice a week. I consistently took my Lamictal and started Vyvanse to help with the head buzzing. Worked full time while in school to afford the insurance. Let out my emotions through working with animals and working out. I felt satisfication with myself every day, not even exhausted cause atleast now I was trying. I was accomplishing something. Every day learning new things about myself and taking steps forward. I discovered crazy things about myself in therapy (not necessarily always fun stuff) but it opened my mind so much to hopefully bring out the best version of me. 



One of my most intense triggers was retroactive jealousy. It tormented me constantly in my last relationship it was one of the first big leaps to destroying it and continued to break it down further throughout. Every tiny thing used to set me off and make me feel incredibly insecure. It's hard to describe what it felt like it's been so long since I felt anything even similar and it wasn't quite as overwhelming as the black out split rages. So not as potent a memory for me. But it was a mix of masochism and deep deep insecurity and hatred of myself compared to CIS men, which led to rages and spiralling. I would make her confirm my worst fears again and again maybe just to hurt myself, maybe in desperate attempt to make it okay in my head. It was mental self harm and I didn't realise that. RAJ was completely new to me (in fact I didn't even know every through out what was really going on) and it absolutely blindsided me. After that I didn't even know how to deal with it, I didn't know where to begin. I don't think I even possibly could have with the person I was with. I could never have gotten to a point with them where I believed in myself, or didn't constantly hate myself, and wasnt stuck in perpetual loop of survival mode with.

I thought I experienced RAJ with her because she was my first FP but with my current FP I could prod myself all day and feel absolutely nothing. Not a shred of hurt or insecurity. She healed me so much by just making me feel unconditionally loved for the first time in my life. Physically being with her is incredibly important it's my #1 love language and she has built up my view of my body to heights I would have never imagined. We are so fucking intensely intimate all the time it's crazy (it's the bpd in us) Who else could fucking matter we are each other's universes. I know that I'm her world and no one else, even a CIS man could compare. (Seriously though retroactive jealousy as a transman dating a straight girl is the worst and made me act like a completely different person Jesus Christ) I know I don't have to feel jealous because every fucking day she shows me that. I don't feel completely disconnected and isolated from her. I'm so god damn lucky, she gives me such a sense of peace and fullfillment. I tricked myself into thinking my last relationship was anything close to love or feeling real love...when I don't feel that constant turmoil and instability, when I actually feel like enough, when I'm grounded in who I am and feel safe and secure with who I'm with; it's so so so much easier. Everything felt so out of control when my head was constantly scared and in defence mode with them. Constantly needing to win arguments because admitting I'm wrong takes vulnerability which I could not show to her. So easy to admit I'm wrong to my current partner and to just drop any disagreement because I feel subconsciously safe enough to give up all power to her anytime. Plus my current partner having BPD unlike my ex; she actually can understand the insane amount of pain we can feel over the smallest things. How it compares to nothing else. How out of that pain we can say and do things that aren't any part of us at all. She doesn't just write it off because its so extreme and irrational. We both can have so much empathy and understanding for each other and it's so peaceful. Never taking an us VS them mentality. Feeling like you're always on the same team with your partner. Constantly growing, learning and healing together. We don't argue at all because before it can even escalate we have already focused on listening and validating the other person in their concern and come to a conclusion together that works.

Along those lines she also helped me discover my severe sexual abuse, healed my ""partners family hating me trauma"" that I've experienced throughout the years for many different reasons, affirmed me constantly in every aspect of my body that used to destroy me, rekindled my relationship with my mum an old shame of mine. Basically pushed the kind, strong, grounded side of me to the surface with her unceasing support, and given me a first look at a stable normal happy healthy life. (god damn the way she went all out at Christmas for me, healed something deep to my little kid core) She was my first hope. Hope that we can actually achieve the dream future I've always pictured; become the person I always dreamed of. First real reason to have any ambition or to give a shit in life where my brain before was just in a dead end slump of hopelessness.

BPD is a fucking curse. But with the right support system and enough effort/ dedication it can actually be manageable. Life is so much easier when I can practice emotional regulation and actually grow my emotional skin for the first time. It may have been stripped from me as a kid but I know love, time, dedication and resources can heal me fully one day. I may always be a loaded gun because of what happened to me, and I've always struggled before to keep my finger off the trigger. But not anymore with the right toolset I'm going to destroy that trigger entirely.

90,There is hope.,"I have no formal diagnosis but I firmly believe that I once had BPD. I used fit the criteria to a T. I'm writing this in hope that I can help others, give others hope and maybe inspire some of you. 

First, background, as it's all relevant. 

I had an unstable childhood, lots of trauma and abuse. I was thrown out at 15 and had to pretty much fend for myself. From the ages of 15 to 27 I lived a hugely chaotic life, moving from place to place and unable to hold down a job, relationship or anything meaningful. 
I was abusive in all my previous relationships, never physical, but emotional. I would lash out at the most minor inconvenience, I was angry and aggressive and I create an environment whereby all those around me felt as though they were walking on eggshells. I had the most poisonous tongue known to man and I'd hit people exactly where I knew it would hurt. I was never satisfied. I always wanted and expected far too much from those around me and when I felt I hadn't gotten what I deserve, I would attack with words and empty threats. I would threaten partners with leaving them. I would tell partners they were meaningless to me, I'd tell them I didn't love them, nor did I want them around. I would cause arguments with people literally every day of my life. I would ruin outings and social events. I used suicide as a threat and as a means of control. I don't believe, during these years, I had the mental capacity, or genuine desire to better my behaviour. Luckily for me I have a fantastic group of friends who have stood by me, regardless of all my faults, and regardless of pain I have caused them. 

Fast forward to my 26th year and I decided I needed to change. For me, there was no big event that led to this, it was a decision I made based on how I felt my life and relationships would turn out if I continued as I was. I wanted to be a better person and rectify my wrongdoings as much as is possible. I began reading self-help books and researched BPD. I was later diagnosed with ADHD, severe depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Eventually, after months of trying medicines, I was put on Venlafaxine. This was both a blessing and a curse. My moods became stable, I had better emotional regulation and I had no desire to hurt those around me, no matter how upset I became. Alas, this came with conditions: My sex drive is constantly low and I have to actively work on this, although able to understand emotion, I feel very little emotion and my passion for life and my previous interests has dissipated. It's a sacrifice I choose to make because I want to be a good person.
Since taking meds I have invested countless hours reading and educating myself on neuropsychology, BPD, trauma, neuroplasticity, anything I felt may help me to better understand my behaviours, and various literature, both academic and otherwise, regarding changing responses and behaviours. 

It's been a long road and it isn't over. I still slip up every now and again but I am so much healthier and better able to handle emotional situations. I am emotionally available, discussing feelings and thoughts with those in my life. I take my meds as I am supposed to. I rarely react with anger. I ask others opinions before I respond, so as to guage whether or not my feelings/reactions are in line with the situation. I NEVER call anyone names in malice. I listen before I jump to conclusions and I try to think with logic and reason at all times. I am now an asset to the people around me. 

I attribute my progress to a few things; education and understanding my conditions, discussing, with everyone in my life, all the negative things I had done and taking ownership of the damage I caused... This was paramount; taking Venlafaxine, for me this is a wonder drug, although please bear in mind that what works for one of us may not work for you; and taking LSD in a therapeutic environment, engineered for self reflection. 

I wanted to change so very much that I actively make it happen. It was my decisions alone that have led me to recovery and I cannot stress enough that recovery is only accessible to those who see the damage they cause, see the hurt and chaos, and then act alone (without need for encouragement from others) to better themselves. 

I still need therapy and I will continue to work on my flaws. I may have to do this for the duration of my life. I still suffer with the invasive thoughts. The evil remarks and hurtful comments still enter my head, but now I can observe these thoughts and I choose to act with compassion and understanding over anger and frustration. There is a better way. 

TL;DR Was an ar*sehole, sought meds and education. Now much better for it. LSD for a mind reset and discussions with everyone in my life led me to take ownership of my behaviours. Not an ar*sehole anymore.",1583850127.0,False,10,13,kitamajita,None,fgek26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fgek26/there_is_hope/
91,"I love my GP (it got long, sorry)","So I've been having a bad BPD style relapse over the last month or so. But now that I'm more of a quiet borderline girl it's a slow spiral into hell.

So I went and saw my GP last week (yay me, waited until crisis point) and she stuck my back on Seroquel for a month just to stop my head racing all the damn time. Seriously, my anxiety was so out of control that my brain was almost turning itself off. I was convinced I was losing my mind because I just became so fucking dumb. Losing words, getting lost, forgetting things the second I heard them.

I voiced the fact that after being off Seroquel for 3 years it felt like I was failing by going back on them. She made me stop and listen. She said that it's no different to someone with asthma who's had it under control for years. Sometimes there will be some trigger that nobody can predict or see coming, so they add in extra help (medication) until it's passed and then go back to their usual routine.

She heard me, validated me and reassured me.

I went back yesterday for a follow up (I'm 100 times better than I was, love Seroquel) and we got to talking about the nature of BPD. I'm her most managed borderline patient so she can often get a different perspective from me. 

I told her my theory that we don't necessarily grow out of the BPD traits and behaviours, that I think we just learn to turn them inwards instead. I know I'd rather take it out on myself than others like I used to. I told her that even with all the therapy my thinking patterns are the same, I just have that filter between thoughts and actions that usually works really well.

I also told her how I've learnt the biggest reason behind BPD behaviours is control. Lack of, needing. I've always been at my worst when my emotions (and therefore my life) were out of control. So I'd do ANYTHING to feel like I had some kind of control. So, manipulation, SH, disordered eating, risky behaviours, impulsive behaviours. All of it, for me, was about control. That obsessive need for control.

She took notes. She's going to talk to her colleagues about it and see if they've had other patients voice the same kind of thing. And I know she's not patronising me.

She heard me. She validated my point of view. She thanked me for adding my insight and changing how she looks at BPD recovery.

Yes she's only a GP, but she specialises in mental health and is always learning about things like BPD because they're so misunderstood.

92,Job Rejection - Avoidance Coping and Anxiety," Hi,

Any skills for coping with job rejection? Would appreciate any advice or recommendation! Just received the rejection from the job I was eagerly looking forward to joining. It was the best match for me based on my educational background and interest. I really wanted to join that place!

A bit of background: I have lost confidence to apply at other places and am already facing extreme anxiety when I do job searches or prepare for interviews and do online courses. I am absolutely avoiding everything for the past 10 months and can't bring up myself to do job preparation or even check websites for job openings. My anxiety is very high and this was the only job I was looking forward to joining and had a positive interview experience. Now I'm completely bummed again. I am hopeless as I fear I have no choices left for myself because of my self-sabotaging behaviours related to job search. I am extremely fearful to even open my laptop and continue the online courses I had paid for in the past 8-10 months. I'm absolutely terrified to look for jobs again. I have left many tasks incomplete: discontinued online courses, stopped getting back at potential interviewers, stopped checking LinkedIn, dropped exercise regime, gave up on my diet, stopped socializing and now I can not even step outside my room. I feel there is no future for me.

I am badly struggling and I want to break this cycle.

My therapist will do DBT with me but we have not yet properly started and still going very slow. I am helpless and I can't spend more weeks or months staying in this helpless state.

Any skill that will help me at least pick up my pace again after long 10-month break? Please help me. I feel mentally stuck for the past 10 months and have lost many opportunities and discontinued my progress and tasks to this neverending anxiety.

93,Issues with my Husband and Parents,"Anyone here with a mom who worries about your problems more than you & that makes you worry more about her because you are guilty that you are responsible for these problems - now that she is worrying, you have to worry about the problem & also about her (more)? Thus, trapped in an anxious cycle.

I have come from a country where mental health is not taken seriously. So, when my Mom used to be extremely angry and frustrated, I was her source of venting out bearing the brunt as the elder child. When I was 3, she even suffered from Sinus Tachychardia that she visited a hospital and took anti depressants for a while. But she brushed all that aside without diagnosing properly. This happened back in 1990s.

Post her menopause, she became a better version of her self but even today she keeps getting anxious. She has fear of abandonment as well and therefore, I observed she only stays close to family and noone else. However, I had to fight with her for almost 3 years to get approval from her for my Inter-religion marriage. Being a BPD person, my fp was my lover. However, he has an avoidant attachment style and through the period, he made me feel unwanted.

After 5 years of relationship and 6 months of marriage, where he started blaming me everyday and saying that he has married me out of pity and that he is not happy with me, I acted on my impulse and developed a sexual relationship (for 2 months) that complicated my marriage. My husband came to know about it and now he claims that he trusted me with all his heart (immense gaslighting) and wants a divorce (sometimes I think its just an excluse to leave me - Because I have accepted his 10 year old affair when we were in relationship and he cheated on me thrice even after coming clean to me). I am not saying its tit for tat, but he didn't even listen to me once.

That being said, he is not living with me currently. While I am trying to make peace with my fp leaving me after a suicide attempt and 2 months of crippling anxiety, I have to now worry about my Mom because marriage is a big thing here and my parents will definitely not take my divorce concept well. On top of that, they will only keep blaming me for making a wrong decision. My mother being a perfectionist, always made me feel that I am not enough no matter how much I tried.

So, the abandonment by fp and the fear of confronting my parents as they negativiely criticise me (which is not the same for a BPD person as it spirals us into self-loathe), I am currently clueless. However, I am going through therapy and it is helping me a bit. I don't know if I should only think about myself now and focus on my own happiness as an individual and be called as a selfish human or instead give into the expectations of my parents and again fall in the cycle of borderline disability.

I also would like to mention that I talked about BPD to my husband and tried explaining him about what made me cheat on him (which is not right, I agree but I was feeling so emotionally unsafe at that point post my miscarriage with my husband), but all he did is tell everyone in my social circle that I am manipulating them into my perspective. I even got a professional assessment done and it confirmed that I am on the extreme range of BPD with a lot of depression, anxiety, petulance, impulsive and self-destruction. Not only that he said some very hurtful things to me like he is creeped to even look at me and that I am dead for him. All of these things stemmed out of his angst and his fear that I might not divorce him but it is always me reasoning out to his abuse (sometimes physical as well).

Not to mention, my husband has been jobless for many years now and I used to take care of him in the past 5 years. I beared all of his expenses and gave money for him to spend as well. I know it can be an act of selfishness but more than that he was my purpose. He was thing that kept me going through the day. Now, he says that I manipulated him into liking me by giving gifts and spending money on him which honestly wasn't the case. It was a mere act of showing affection. So, I am right now feeling very unloved and scared of both my parents and my husband.

Any word of advice/encouragement or discussion can be of great help.

94,"Looking for any advice about support in the UK, please help","So sorry for this being so long but I've got a lot to ask and get off my chest. For about a year I've known of BPD and from the start I've felt the symptoms explained really well the problems I'd had through childhood and teen years. I've never been good at identifying my feelings (some types of thought feel hard to reach, like theres a push back and everything gets more jumbled when i try) so it felt really validating. But I can't help worrying that I've always just wanted to feel special and now I'm assuming I have symptoms of a real disorder as an excuse for being a pathetic lazy person. As a result, I've avoided seeing a GP until now because I didn't know what I'd do if they didn't then validate me. But i got a couple counseling sessions from uni last summer (they can't diagnose). They helped me to realise how hurtful my parents attitudes had been (growing up lots of ""you're selfish/ungreatful"" ""you're lazy"" ""you're manipulative/spoiled"", "" why can't you be more like X"" ""or else"" ""don't say you're afraid of me or I'll...!"" recently I get "" you're naïve "") and that I drag myself down with self hate and that with my mam being suicidal for most of my childhood I felt like my needs weren't being met and I always had to prove my love to her or she'd die. For about a day after the sessions I was floating on a warm pillow of self love that helped motivate me. But it dissolved away, my GF broke up with me and I couldn't stand being around my parents back home for the summer (they pressured me to get a summer job, I didn't feel like I could handle it but couldn't refuse or I'm just taking their money). So I very suddenly moved back down to uni and isolated myself. This year has been a shit show. Impulsive drug taking has gone up, I go through patches of day drinking and feeling nothing and boredom to feeling so sad and isolated (life feels like a realistic film) to having narcissistic waves of mania, mainly when on a substance. I regularly can't stand to look at my reflection when I'm alone (looks like someone else scary looking back) and I do stupid shit like taking drinks from strangers in clubs fully aware that I'm probably being spiked or going to random music venues in areas of the city that I don't know with my weedguy. I haven't been able to keep up with uni, putting all work off until it was late and I'd have to take a 10% hit to any grade I got on them. I don't care. With about a day left to finish my dissertation I had nothing started and broke down. My mam picked me up the next day, that was last Monday and I now can't graduate with honors (as if I give a shit). Since then I've been having mood swings out the wazoo, apprehensive about doing anything and getting these sessions where my hate and distrust for my parents (who are loving and hurtful but not malicious) gets overwhelming. But its more like, I get angry at the world and everything is bad and then I feed my relationships through this hate machine and the only things I can remember about my family are the negatives (delusions as a child that my parents were plotting to murder me/read my thoughts, strangers were plotting to murder me, etc). Then I snap out of it, like when you splash a bath it gets crazy but quickly settles down and goes flat. After these episodes I can't remember what it felt like, I just know it was bad. For the past year having suspected BPD, I often check in on this sub but dont post and almost self medicate with the advice here and online which often helps (trying to remind myself that the average me doesn't agree with the extreme views and given some time I'll go back to baseline). I don't have a sense of identity past my name, body and memories which is maybe all we have but I feel so hollow most of the time. The part that resonated the most with me though is splitting which I think I've observed happening over and over during my life (I never knew why I suddenly hated people or stopped and started loving partners) and even this year I've gone from idolising a uni colleague for her prowess to hating her for her judmentality just because she rightly pointed out that I have been underperforming as a group. However she did confront me in front of the whole group which was the trigger that made me no longer trust her, now she's an outsider, probably working against me and I can only remember the events previous to the trigger that support this, not all the impressive and likeable memories of her. Anyway, I finally decided enough was enough and got an appointment at my GP, thinking that I could get some kind of mental health referral to a professional who could diagnose me (or worst case say I'm faking it but at least give some closure).  I told her everything here and more, including the fact I was sexually experimenting as a child with other children (when I was~4-6 yr old) which up until recently I thought was all consensual until I remembered a very old fuzzy memory of dodgy stuff with some older relatives of the kids my age. I told her how my suicidal thoughts have gone from intrusive at Christmas, to a consideration of a way out, to being afraid of the platform edge, to now knowing how I'd do it. I thought it was going well and she tried to reasure me that my delusions of her invalidating me would be unfounded, until we got to the end and she asked if I'd tried church, I was taken aback and said no, that its not my thing. She said ""that's a shame, not many young people in this area are willing to give it a go but it can be a good place to talk and find God"". Then she asked what I hoped to get out of this. I said I didn't understand the mental health service but I hoped I could get a diagnosis as I didn't feel general talking therapy worked and I'd like to have a target/explanation of why I feel these things. I was told she can't diagnose as a non specialist and when I asked if I could then see a specialist she just said no. So I asked what was wrong, to which I got "" well something deep is obviously wrong and it looks  you've got some depression in there too"". She also said that 'we' avoid giving diagnosises because there can be stigma, but in my experience here in the UK there is more stigma towards the undiagnosed as rhey seem less valid. Then she gave me a number to a public over the phone therapy service (Talking Change) and a website with general mental health self help leaflets. She also said back to me that I was clearly coping, a low suicide risk and that my family relationships were obvious still functional. I didn't know what to say so I just quietly left and got so angry on my bike ride home I didn't even feel going uphill. I feel let down, I'm no further in regards to improving and I have no more resources than what I was already using falsely to self medicate. In fact, I've now exhausted my last hope. I don't know where to go next and I feel so alone despite once again having a support network that claims to love me, so I'm posting here to ask for advice in the UK, what the process is, what I should think. I dunno. Please just help.",1558708792.0,False,5,4,Throwawaysawayohhek,None,bshpx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/bshpx4/looking_for_any_advice_about_support_in_the_uk/
95,Question about a skill,"I have a question about a skill!

It's actually one of my main skills. It's extremely effective.. But I can't figure out a way to use it in a healthy way long-term! Maybe someone has an idea?

My skill is venting. I can be in the deepest, darkest depression. If I just write everything down that comes to my mind and hit send somewhere I feel almost immediately better. I then also enjoy seeing people relate and sometimes people give nice advice or make a funny joke or whatever. It's just really nice! It's 1) attention 2) venting and 3) community/social. Perfect skill for me!

But now to the issues. It can be quite extreme whenever I vent. And I know it's not that serious and that 30 minutes later I'll feel better. Others don't.

So there are places like this subreddit. Fine, right? Yea. And it works pretty well here. But the more people I reach, the more places I vent at, the more effective the skill is. And that is where it can become toxic and I just can't figure out a healthy base.

As an example my private Instagram account. My real life friends are there and food bloggers folllow me. Not a mental health crowd. But I reach a lot of people. I have over 1000 Followers. So if I vent there the 1) attention and 2) venting and 3) community/social aspect works wonderful, but then it gets weird. People take it so serious, they don't get it. I also feel a bit embarassed and ashamed and over-dramatic. I feel triggering.

I've made pure venting Instagram accounts, but there I don't reach many people (yet?).

I don't know.

Back in the days when online forums were a thing it was perfect. They were popular and huge. I was able to post kinda anonymously, yet my name was recognizable.

My main issue tbh is about my main account. I LOVE venting there. But at the same time it's so awkward and embarassing and weird, because my FACE is attached to it. My identity.

96,(BPD) Does anyone else REALLY intensely struggle internally with being alone having bpd?,"(There is 1 use of the F bomb in here and I do apologize I’m just trying to get the point across.) Hi guys i am a 24 year old woman who was Diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and a few others in 2018 I never use my disorders as a crutch or an excuse but I enlighten the people around me about the disorders to help them better understand ME. I use to be on many medications but about a year ago I stopped all mental health meds because I felt they weren’t working right for me but just the last two years I have found it EXTREMELY hard to almost be by myself without the in person company of my “favorite person”…text drives me crazy because it’s so slow and the texts are usually short and boring and they won’t ever call me because they are shy behind the phone. as toxic as this may sound I will open up in hopes of someone out there finding relatability in this or someone that may give me advice on how to help myself. I have been recommended DBT but just with my insane schedule already and not having a car or license, being a full time stay at home mom at my parents with a 3 month old baby, baby sitting my siblings everyday, and occasionally my niece and nephew, therapy, and helping take care of my grandma. I just haven’t found a way around to it yet. I’m not making any excuses by no means my mom is the one that takes me to all of my therapist and psychiatrist appointments and her schedule is insane with work, taking care of my grandma (her mom) being a mom to 6 kids (myself included) and many other things herself. I would LOVE the help of a DBT therapist but right now I can’t fit that into my already hectic schedule. But when my S/O can’t come see me or wants to stay at home it’s like my mind inadvertently takes it as a threat almost, like punishment. In my mind I know they know how much I love and crave to be with them but there’s a part of me that actually truly understands and respects that they need time to themselves also. The world can’t revolve around ME. but the other part of me when I find out they aren’t going to be with me that night or for a few days shatters me me. Its like this never ending game of tug of war that never ends. It’s like a heavy blow to the chest and gut that leaves me in tears and angry and frantic. Cussing at myself, hyperventilating My heart races and I think all sorts of scenarios. I will admit that I do have trust issues due to past experiences with this person so that at times can intensify that thinking also into who are they texting? What are they really doing? Are they on a phone call with someone else? Do they have someone secretly over and are they ignoring me? I’m not thinking or feeling this way INTENTIONALLY I want you guys to try to understand that as best as you can is all that I ask. I understand if some of you just can’t agree with this or see how I could think or feel this way. That’s okay I accept that and am willing to put myself out here in need of guidance. But it’s the way that I can’t help but end up JUST FEELING. I love this person with every ounce of my heart that I have with every breath that I take. I do NOT want to be like this or continue to be like this. Can anyone give me any pointers? Distractions only help for so long until it just immediately comes on again sometimes more intensified than before. I understand that with BPD it is characterized with abandonment issues. And it’s not even the whole trust issue thing that always makes me feel this way so much as it is the whole hearted pain of them not being beside me and me being alone. In my head it just doesn’t even feel like abandonment issues really it feels more like I just understand what I’m feeling and I want to fix it NOW. To some, including myself. MY way of thinking is and can be considered “selfish” not all people with BPD is like THIS. So please I do encourage you to try be understanding to others with this disorder it’s a fucking nightmare that we never asked for But I also ask please try to understand that it’s not to gain “control” or to “manipulate” this person with the way I feel and act. I am in absolute love with this person and I’ve been with them since 2016 I just can’t control all of my emotions and thought process and hurt when it’s “so much so quickly at one time” the emotions and feelings just flood in when I can’t be with them, and it’s a somber feeling that words could never describe. I’m sorry for the paragraph and for any possible typos. I just wanted to see if someone else experiences it in a way sort of like mine or has any pointers on what I can do this to help control myself during the time being until I can get DBT.

97,How to find your sense of self with BPD,"As a daughter of someone who has severe BPD, and someone with moderate BPD, i have done a lot of reflection and implemented grand changes in my life that have brought me to this point of self-awareness. I have realized that if you are someone with a personality disorder or any mental illness in fact, it is best to cut out any stimulating substances, coffee included to find your real sense of self. I have been drinking since I was 15, (I am now 22) and I have been deliberately and perpetually drunk for almost every weekend of my life since I was 18. When I turned 19, I was drunk 3-4 days a week while still enrolled in full time university, holding two jobs. I would also regularly smoke cigarettes and weed  drink coffee since 15. I also began dabbling in hard drugs between 20-22 years old, cocaine being my preferred choice. I never realized how much alcohol was a part of my life and something that I depended on, even if I was still very highly functioning. I was so stubborn, I thought I wasn't impressionable at all. The thing is, nobody tells you in your youth you should stop drinking, especially those you surround yourself with. It has become so normalized to ingest toxins for ""fun"" that people don't even develop a proper personality or know who they truly are because they are consistently taking substances that drive them farther away from reality. These substances also rewire our brain and make us think and do things our sober self wouldn't say. But we don't know that because we aren't ever truly sober. Our brain is constantly being attacked by substances, media, LED lights, and information overload. We keep ingesting them and think it is a part of our personality, thinking there is something so severely wrong with us, when really we have accumulated years of stress (high cortisol levels) in our minds, bodies and veins.

One thing I realized is that I am a completely different person without alcohol, because without it I am truly an introvert. Many people know me to be confident, outgoing and a social butterfly, fearless and free of anyone's judgement. Although this is true, I genuinely don't care what anyone thinks, I did realize (after therapy, moving out, being physically active and cutting back on substances) that I am truly introverted rather than extroverted. I would always wonder why I am so drained after a party, a social interaction, or after many meetings or conversations with people I never cared about. Now that I go to parties with people my age, everyone is concerned with drinking and smoking and listening to most conversations as someone who is sober or is hyperaware of the social, philosophical and psychological state of themselves and the party, it is genuinely a very uninteresting and nerve wrecking and anxiety inducing experience. Alcohol really does bind people and create a mutual sense of ""we're all fucked together"", making is easier for people to tolerate each other. I realized how much I don't have in common with anyone my age. I realize how much I would rather be at home reading or going on a hike or just being in my own company, rather than being around people who I may never see again, or hope I never do. Alcohol makes us do things we wouldn't or are normally too scared to do. I have many so many friends and connections and experiences just from being DRUNK. Not because of my interests or desires or ambitions.I am not saying these experiences were useless or a waste of time, or haven't taught me anything. I had a lot of fun and have learned a great deal just from being in these situations. But they aren't permanent, they never last and they aren't as fulfilling as they are when you're drunk. 

When you're perpetually drunk, you do a lot of things you don't care about and you don't know why. I drove myself into such a deep depression that I don't have words or feelings to express how lost I was, or still am in this ocean of nothingness. However, things only get better once you increase your self-awareness. Some people have an inclination do that, others never get there. But this can also be a curse because I have also thunk myself into a very neurotic, delusional, dissociative and hallucinogenic state while being so self-aware of this condition. All you can do is get yourself to a point of being so self-aware that realizing that ingesting any toxin in an attempt to numb or kill something inside you means you truly don't love yourself. But beware, self-awareness can also drive us to such a paralyzing state of apathy that it becomes difficult to show anyone your true self.  Everything is a double-edged sword.

If you have BPD, or are just emotionally disregulated, or are just a human bean in the 21st century, please take this post as a sign to cut back on everything that overstimulates your brain because this is the only way you can find your true self, and what you do after that determines your true character.",1620004928.0,False,22,6,PsychologicalLog4022,None,n3kqcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/n3kqcy/how_to_find_your_sense_of_self_with_bpd/
98,The victim in me,"
I’m writing this because I often avoid the pending anxieties that ding at the top of my nose. That’s where I feel it. Thoughts clouding my vision. I can no longer see myself. My stomach saturates with guilt. Panic like protein for my insecurity. Bone on bone. I have been shedding layers. It’s been nearly two years of this. I’m writing this because my brain is in constant fight or flight. I’m left with a very weak will to live. I am in survival mode at all times. There is a victim inside of me. She screams for my help. For my attention. I often ignore her. Tonight I will not only listen to her, hear her, comfort her. But I will let her speak. The person I want to be and the person that I was and the person I am all sit inside of my body. They each have different dreams, personalities, fears, insecurities. I am none of them and all of them. I am nothing and everything. I don’t know who I am. I am lost. And I’ll admit that. The way other people see me, the way they feel about me, the way they treat me and the way they don’t is something I obsess over. I have an urgency to gain the acceptance and love of others. I have a frequency to prove I can gain it. So I can love myself. I set limits on my own self love contingent on the love I receive from others. This is because I have a deeply routed fear of being abandoned. Being forgotten. Being replaced. Watching energy shift. Watching people grow out of me. Fall out of love with me. Out of friendship with me. I would do anything to reverse this fear. To be self sufficient and self loving. I often attract careless people. I often attract intentionally harmful people. I often attract specifically harmful people. I am sensitive to others. I am hurt easily. I attach easily. I detach easily. It is painful. It is exhausting. It is harmful. I have spent the last two years running from hard truths. My life has changed forever. I am incapable of returning to the way I felt and the way I saw the world before these events. I tried to heal on my own. I made a mess. I trusted everyone I knew. It was a mistake. I shared my deepest painful secret with my closest friends. It was a mistake. I confused friendship for therapy and I thought my transparency with my trauma would grant me some kind of rain check on life. Life kept moving. I did not. I lost myself entirely. I could not look myself in the eyes. My relationships with people I loved very deeply changed. My relationship with simple things like food and sleep changed. I could feel myself going crazy. Misdiagnosed. Drugged. Lost. And losing it. I became dependent on things. People. Drugs. Alcohol. Spending money. I thought if I could just stay manic. I could stay sane. I could be happy. The more I would open up, the heavier I would feel. I started to feel lonely. I became complacent. I started praying that God himself would wipe my existence from this earth. I prayed that I could run very away and become a new person. I still pray for this. I had a very hard year. Mental illness is not a small thing. I am the captain of a very large ship and I do not know the first thing about the sea. I’ve never driven a boat. The water is aggressive. I have several diagnoses and several pending. I have not been transparent with many people about my experiences with mental health. I think it’s because I care so deeply to be accepted by others and it is defining me. Taking me from my truths. I have had to remove people from my life. I have had to fully detach myself to grasp at what peace would feel like in my head. I am consumed by the idea and the fear that the people I love the deepest will eventually leave me. That they hate me. That they have never loved me. So I fulfill this and prove my fear correct by detaching. By running. When I see that no one has chased me, it is now not peace I feel from knowing I was right all along. It is my fight or flight. It is overwhelming anxiety. It is insecurity that now my deepest darkest painful secrets are now public record. That whatever hate I feared before is amplified. I often attract people with a specific trait. People who know everyone’s business, tell everyone’s business to everyone, talk horribly about the people that love them. Make others believe they would never do this to them because they are somehow immune. Lack empathy. Create a chaotic and mutually symbiotic environment that is in no way beneficial to either party. Create abusive cycles in which they with hold their love and support. This invents a competitive Olympic codependent gymnastics where I reinforce their ego and lack of empathy by falling to my knees and discarding whatever healthy pride I have preserved in order to service them. I remember being moments away from killing myself but instead responding to a text about a hookup crisis. My pain was never valid. My family member passed away. I was devastated. The day of the funeral I was having an anxiety attack because I needed to be of service to someone. The clock had started. I was afraid if I didn’t reach out and prove my service, they would have no reason to comfort me while i grieved. I was afraid I would altogether lose them. I have been so afraid of losing people that I have gripped on to them. Gone out of my way to check on them. Take care of them. Listen to them. I became a service industry. Still unhealed. Exhausted. People I had made permanent places for in my life had been revealing their true colors to me. I found out one of my friends had developed a deep routed hate for me during this transitional and life altering period in my life. Saying terrible things about me to others and plotting their exit. This person ghosted me. Can I blame them? I am suffering from the residuals of deeply routed sexual traumas. The PTSD infiltrates my brain in many forms. I also suffer from borderline personality disorder. Body dysmorphia. Disordered eating. Major depression. Anxiety. Panic Disorder. ADHD. I fight myself daily to accomplish any goals. Sometimes I’m lucky if I brush my teeth. My exhaustion is defeating. I have dreams. Big dreams. Sometimes I think maybe I should kill myself before I have to live to see them never come true. I compare myself to everyone I see on the internet. I have low self esteem. I have a college degree. I cannot hold a job. I cannot find a job to hold. Everything feels like it was all for nothing. But still I have hope. Despite spending all of my energy on the worry of what others think of me. I have hope. I have friends. I have family. I am not hopeless. Not anymore. But I am lost. And I feel like a victim to my own life. I’m trying to take control of the way I feel and push myself into the wings I’m expecting to grow in. I am being to forceful. Too impatient. I am harming myself. Stunting my growth. Haulting my healing. People want explanations from me. I don’t have one to give. I am in pain. I am suffering from my own mind. I am trapped inside my body. I am trying to find my way out. I am trying to find my peace. Pray for me. Please someone pray for me. Tell me my feelings are valid. Tell me to stop blaming myself for the things I can’t change. Give me a shortcut to healing. Show me a cheat sheet. Hand me the blueprint. This came with no instructions. I’m exhausted. I’m trying to keep my momentum. I’m trying to push myself farther but not harder. The added stress will only make me shut down and turn off. I am in need of kind words and encouragement. I am in desperate need of love.",1604740418.0,False,6,2,sadbutveryhotbutsad,None,jpnslz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/jpnslz/the_victim_in_me/
99,the eventual decline of chris and maud,"I'm unsure why I'm writing this out.  I suppose part of me believes it could be cathartic but a bigger part of me believes someone else might benefit from reading it & relating.  
I tried a NoContact subreddit first thinking it was where I wanted to write this but I backed out of there pretty quick, that was some scary obsessive shit. I'm not convinced this is the right subreddit for it either but there's so many subreddits that it's a wee bit daunting to find the right fit sometimes.  Having said that, if this isn't the right place please don't tear me apart over it, I'm getting really tired of the hostility online.  Just refer me to a better sub.  


I broke up with my significant other (I'll call him Chris, that's a common enough name) a few days ago but yesterday I asked him to refrain from contacting me.  We had been together for about a year, maybe almost two now?  I'm inept at tracking time.  At first he was interesting and quiet and as we got to know each other it was a lovely time in my life.  We brought out the best in each other.  Several months into the relationship I had a phone issue and he let me borrow his for the day while he was at work.  A message popped up that was clearly about me.  I felt myself flood with anger and I opened it.  I'm sure there will be people who decide to be angry in my decision to do so and I honestly don't care.  If a gross text about you popped up on your SO's phone I wonder if you'd be so inclined to ignore it.  Anyway, I opened it and read it.  What I read indicated there was more elsewhere too so I opened up all his texts and facebook messages.  He was talking about me to several people.  Before I continue, he doesn't keep close friendships with anyone so all of these people were people he barely had relationships with.  One was an ex girlfriend, one was a gamer friend he barely knew, one was an older gay gentleman who had a crush on him, it was so weird that he would choose to indulge such information to any one of them.  The texts were interesting.  He would discuss my mental health diagnoses, my finances, my family, and other deeply personal topics with these people... and what's worse is a lot of what he said was dishonest and one sided.  I used my Kindle to take pics of all of the texts and facebook messages.  There were so many.  When I gave him back his phone I confronted him by asking him if he ever talks to people about our relationship and he said no.  He said no but I could see his fear spreading across his face so I asked him again.  He started acting like a cornered animal and finally said yes but then lied about how many people he told.  He said one.  There were four, I think.  I clearly remember three but there were four.  In the end he said he understood that what he did was wrong and he was sorry but I suppose truthfully I never got past it.  I tried to be a bigger person and forgive it and move past it but I didn't.  It lingered and finally I broke up with him.  There were three of us living in the house together and we would all meet up in the living room to watch Twin Peaks in the evenings.  After the breakup he would be on his phone constantly and suddenly began acting secretive.  Our other housemate had to go out of town for a weekend or something and during his absence Chris said he was going away for the weekend as well- to the ex girlfriend's house a few hours away.  This triggered something in me.  I mentioned previously that I have Borderline Personality Disorder.  Borderlines will do almost anything to avoid real or perceived abandonment, logic be damned.  It was no different for me, I suddenly felt like it was essential to have him back.  I sat down and thought about everything, tried to sort the emotion and logic.  Chris was texting me the whole first day of that weekend and that was making it harder.  He said he was walking around some store and everything reminded him of me and he was starting to think he made a mistake.  At the time I didn't see the forest for the trees and I blocked Chris that Friday until Sunday afternoon.  On Sunday I unblocked him and shared what I had been going through mentally and we agreed that we still had feelings for one another and wanted to keep at this.  He admit he did sleep with his ex but that good ol' BPD brain of mine excused it.  I'll take this moment to encourage you to seek therapy for any mental health issues.  If you're fortunate enough not to have one I'll thank you for not insulting me over what I couldn't work through properly.  


We stayed together for quite some time and then in October of last year he got deployed.  There were minor issues in that time but nothing like the great text ordeal at the beginning.  We had actually talked about getting married and I had planned out a whole engagement thing with his mom, who I was (am?) close to.  He had made it sounds like he wasn't traditional and wanted something different and meaningful like I did so I thought that he would love the idea of me proposing to him with socks instead of a ring.  There's a story there (for those of you who raised a brow) but it's not worth sharing.  It was something between myself and Chris.  A couple days before Christmas we were watching a movie using the Netflix Party chrome extension and there was a scene where a girl proposed to her boyfriend.  Chris commented and said the idea of that was awful.  I asked why and he gave me a few reasons.  I sighed and told him what I had planned.  Although he had been telling me for months prior to this that he was ready to get married and he wanted to marry me and blah blah fucking blah, all of a sudden he wasn't.  He said he wasn't ready, he had all these questions to figure out first and all this stuff that was news to me.  At this point I started seeing Chris as a liar.  This wasn't the first lie, it was one of several, but it was a massive lie.  He had led me on for months about MARRIAGE.  I was clearly upset and I had to tell his mom that the time wasn't right after all and she needed to cancel the plans we'd made to surprise Chris.  She wasn't happy with Chris for his lies and she was worried that we would break up over this.  Yes, we should have but stupidly we didn't.  After December things went pretty easy and we tried working through stuff.  At that point the communication issues started becoming more prevalent.  We hadn't had communication issues except for his lying prior to that.  Over time it felt like communication got worse.  I started catching more lies and they were stupid too, stupid things to lie about.  Excuses for every little thing started coming up.  Looking back I'm not sure how we got to summer of this year but we did.   


The plan for summer was I would go visit Chris for a couple months.  I was looking forward to working on communication in person and just being with him.  I especially missed holding his hand, it was a powerful tool in alleviating anxiety.  Chris drove to pick me up so I could bring more of my own stuff with me.  The trip back to where he was deployed went ok, more or less.  Communication was basically breaking down but it wasn't garbage yet.  Chris would tell me we were going to do this and we were going to do that and I was excited about the summer.  Long story short my summer basically consisted of me sitting alone most of the time while he was at work.  There was NOTHING to do there except watch Netflix and I gained some weight because the food there was... different, we'll say.  It was quite interesting to me how the things I consistently ate at home weren't available where Chris was.  Of all the promises Chris had made, he did follow through on one.  We visited his parents that summer.  It's even harder to eat my diet where they live and that ended up being a real problem.  Just little issues peppering the trip, how Chris dealt with anything or didn't, stuff like that.  I started noticing more negative things about Chris.  He would not only lie to me but to his family as well.  He would pretend, for lack of better word. I feel like lie is too extreme for his behavior around his family.  Pretend works better.  He would make promises and not follow through, he was dishonest often, he would behave more like a child as the summer carried on, he was doing things almost regularly that were inconsiderate.  With having so much free time I sat and thought about the relationship often.  At some point it just clicked.  I realized that I was forcing myself to stay in a relationship that should have been over after the texting thing happened.  I realized that Chris was a liar and the whole relationship was a lie built on a lie painted over with lies and decorated with lies.  I cared so much for Chris that even then, even after that realization, I still didn't want to leave him.    


I've been home for about a month now and I've taken the time to tell Chris how I feel, using specific examples from our relationship.  I've clearly laid out where our communication issues are and why they happen.  I have taken the time to find solutions that require his involvement on his own time for his own self if this relationship will have any hope at all.  Three days ago he said something to me, I don't remember what it was now.  It wasn't a big thing, it wasn't an important thing, but it happened to be the last straw.  I told him that his behavior was affecting me in a negative way, triggering my BPD, holding me back from going forward in my recovery (which otherwise had been a steady path forward for years).  I told him how I felt around his family (the pros and the cons), I told him how certain things had certain outcomes and I provided suggestions for ways to avoid finding ourselves in a bad place again.  I told him I wanted some space from him, I wanted to end our relationship until he had done the legwork to fix the bigger issues that fell on him.  I was carrying Chris through our relationship and I couldn't continue to do so.  He agreed and over the next day he would text me these stupid little remarks about progress he was making except it wasn't progress at all.  It was more of the typical Chris lies and trying to manipulate the situation.  I called him out on it instead of ignoring it.  He continued to do it, I continued to call him out.  The next day he said I was making him feel terrible when he was trying to ""get better"" and I called him out on that too.  I told him that his ""plans"" to see a therapist in two more months and to ""be more mindful"" of how he communicates were just more lies and there was no evidence.  He said he couldn't change in a week.  I told him I didn't expect him to but I did expect more than trying to hoover me back in with falsehoods.  I told him that his attempts to persuade me that he was actually taking real initiatives were making the problems worse and that everything still felt like lies.  I told him that no contact might be the best thing for us right now.  He texted me yesterday morning, just a normal hello how do you do type thing.  The way he phrased his text felt a little off so I pushed a bit and of course broke open the festering communication issue.  On my end I broke down crying.  I suppose that's when I really knew that it was hopeless.  Every communication issue we had would get discussed and then immediately happen again, over and over, and I was broken from it.  The stress from trying to sort it out had reached the apex.  By that afternoon I had responded to all his attempts at excuses with calling him out until finally he said he needed space from me because I wasn't helping him.  The facade shattered.  I'd told him twice in the last couple days to give me space and he had a way of worming back in with his lies.  I told him that I believed that we were fundamentally different and we no longer brought out the best in one another.  I told him that his behavior had become a major trigger for my BPD and I wasn't going to undo years of progress for a toxic relationship. I told him he'd be better suited with someone who didn't mind being lied to because that wasn't going to change.  I told him I wish him well and I hope he finds happiness in himself.  He wrote back that he wishes the same for me and I haven't heard from him since yesterday afternoon.    


Normally the BPD would have me raging and seething and crying and hysterical.  This is what I mean about progress.  I'd been going forward for years, making steady progress, growing into a functional and healthy person.  I'm actually proud of myself for identifying the behaviors in a toxic relationship and (although it took a year too long I got there eventually) breaking it off with a no contact request.  I don't know what I would do if Chris tried to text me.  I doubt very much he will.  I think he will revert back to talking to people with whom he had very superficial relationships with, being dishonest with them in order to validate himself.  It's not for me to worry about, I figure if it does happen I'll just block the number.  I have my own life to live without Chris and the childish drama that took up so much of my time for so long.  I can only go forward.",1567008897.0,False,6,2,MaudlinEdges,None,cwmysb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/cwmysb/the_eventual_decline_of_chris_and_maud/

UPDATED 3 FEB: Well, my big issue in organizing this is that there's no time that suits everyone globally.  Yet I need this and several of you are clearly interested. 

So I'm going to schedule this based on my time (GMT +7)  but trying my best to take others into consideration. I'M GOING TO GET IT SET UP BY FRIDAY 5 FEBRUARY. 

For those still following/interested- this will be a weekly 1.5 to 2 hour Zoom meeting focused on the group working through a DBT skills training workbook together (I'm leaning towards the DBT skills Workbook by Brantley, McKay, and wood, or the DBT Skills Manual by Linehan) I will commit to every week so I'm looking for similar commitment.

Our first meeting will involve selecting the workbook, getting comfortable and creating a safe space, and adjusting anything. I'm an experienced and certified learning facilitator and arts teacher, so I can get us started process-wise but otherwise i want us all equal and collaborative. 

On Friday morning Feb 5 (remember I live in Asia) I'll send info to those interested who have responded with the following in my Direct Messages (not a comment to this post, and I'll take those who provide ALL the following info (I'm a Virgo, possibly some level of OCD- But those who do DM me with this will have at least read and understand the intention here)

- reddit handle (no real names please)
-your home GMT time (not US time zone, Google your GMT)
-your age 
-preferred pronouns 
-date of BPD diagnosis by a licensed
 professional 

So for me it would be
be
-Ira Johnson 
-GMT+7
-53
-he/him
-mid 1995

I apologize because there will be no way to fit everyone who expressed interest. However for those that don't fit (time zone, inability to commit, preference for different workbook or style etc); I'll advise you if you like on setting something up... but let me get this one off the ground first.  I really need help, and I think others may too. 

Thank you so much. That's a lot to read. Please DM me with the 5 pieces of information I mentioned. 

Uncle Ira

19 JAN:  Thanks to those who have PMed me.  I'm currently working on a big project for work that will take place in less than a week - after 26 January I will have a lot more free time as we enter the Chinese New Year/Winter holiday season.  So after 26th if you have PMed me, watch for an update.

UPDATED:  Thanks for the responses!  Some have PMed me- if you're seriously interested and willing to commit, please PM me. 

Here's what's gelling at the moment:
-group of 8-12
-weekly commitment 
-DBT workbook/skills training 
-safe space (we will define that together)
-meet via Zoom 

Ideally I'll set something up next week, not to get right to work but to create the group collaboratively.

The key for me will be commitment of those involved. Let's approach this with empathy, authenticity, vulnerability,  trust, and integrity. 

Uncle Ira


Anyone have any suggestions on the best way to keep this safe?  I want to make sure that committed people in need can take part.

Serious interested people who read this and are willing to commit to a weekly Zoom meeting, please PM me.  It will be hard to find a time that suits all time zones but we can try.  I have organized online events for global audiences and usually only one or two folks has to get up super early.

Please DM me with your preferred name or handle, your time zone, and any other thoughts or information.

I hope this can become active with ideas and thoughts:

Has anyone any experience with online support groups for BPD?  This subreddit is thankfully helpful and non-toxic, yet just go a few r/ over to some others... some can really hurt.  That's the thing for me, I want to be open and share, and talk to others, but I am frankly very scared of miscommunication causing hurt, and of trolls bombing the experience.

Miscommunication because we are each different in our struggle.  I am 50+, White, American (from the south, at that!), cisgender, hetero, agnostic, and not living in my home culture.  As you can imagine, some of the results of that combination result in my thinking not being as progressive in some areas.  I am very open-minded but not always quick on the uptake.  For example, I appreciate those in the LGBTQIA/BIPOC community who have helped me understand and change some of my behaviors and programming that are otherwise rooted in white western patriarchal bullshit.

Support groups require a lot of trust because we need the space to be vulnerable.  You do not know my real name or details, but in other parts of the redditsphere people are eager to do detective work and share others personal details.

I really have come to appreciate this subreddit, and would be really interested in participating in or setting up some kind of online support group.  In my career I am an experienced and respected facilitator of learning and development workshops, so I can easily design and help facilitate a simple format based on [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) \- I love this system because its co-designing the workshop with all the learners.  My company has a pro Zoom account that could be used as well.

I hope I can be a part of a weekly live-call support group, where the numbers are kept at a manageable level for sharing yet enough people are present to provide different perspectives - max 10 maybe? But then I do not want those in need to be excluded...  Perhaps there can be some demonstration of commitment, those who want to be part of such a thing for a period of time rather than just dropping in to try it out...  I'd love to share and hear tips and strategies and serve as a sounding board and have the accountability and support of such a group.  I'd especially love a situation where a group of us could work together towards DBT skills, but without prohibitive cost (I imagine, especially in times like these, that there are others of you who simply cannot afford typical DBT training costs - I cannot).

If the idea of such a group interests you, please share here - what would you want to see?  How would such a thing be useful to you?  What fears or concerns do you have?

It's something I want to be a part of, not necessarily something I want to organize.  I'd happily defer to an existing support group, or to a licensed counselor or therapist.   However if what we/I are looking for does not exist, then maybe we can create it.",1610685255.0,False,17,16,IraJohnson,None,kxn2hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/kxn2hk/online_bpd_support_group/

2,THERAPY SCAM ALERT!! BWRT (BrainWorking Recursive Therapy) - Terence Watts,"This is a super important post so pls don’t delete mods! I’m trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help aren’t lied to. 

Terence Watts’s “BrainWorking Recursive Therapy” or, “BWRT” is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a “full proof” solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!!

Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, it’s giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes. 

I was so amazed at first, and truly believed I’d finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be true… so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it. 

The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesn’t want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldn’t be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I don’t respond or you don’t see this post anymore… well I guess you know why. 

Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproduct… but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions. 


Here are some links about BWRT to get you started:

- https://www.clinpsy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=21339

 - https://www.nomorepanic.co.uk/showthread.php?209740-Brain-working-recursive-Therapy

- https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ts8qya/does_anyone_have_experience_with_bwrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Watts gets his inspiration from [Benjamin Libet](https://www.bwrtuk.co.uk/bwrt/), whose theory about conscious and unconscious behaviour forms the basis of his theory. He talks about it a lot on his website and in his youtube videos. 


Also, I found some interesting posts about Charles Linden - another “expert” who displays similar behaviours of secrecy, denial and harassment to Terence Watts:

- https://www.clinpsy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2057


(FYI: I still need to do some more research on this myself, so I am not claiming to be an expert on this matter.)

————————————————————————

EDIT: another very interesting link… [the Advertising Standards Agency says he breached the “UK code of non-broadcast advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.”](https://www.ns-healthcare.com/news/terence-watts/)

“The Terence Watts BWRT Institute was found guilty of claiming it could treat and/or diagnose several serious health problems including anxiety, infertility and diabetes without substantiating such claims.

In its findings, the ASA also concluded that an advertisement on the website discouraged people from seeking essential treatment and necessary medical supervision for conditions, including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and thyroid problems.

The Advertising Standards Agency told Terence Watts the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding it should not claim or imply that BWRT can be used to treat conditions without demonstrating sufficient evidence.

The ASA also said the website should not reference conditions for which medical supervision is necessary when addressing those seeking treatment in the future.”

for context, we’ve only been together for about a month and this weekend i was in the er for multiple overdoses. it wasn’t a suicide attempt, i just wanted to get high. i didn’t find out until sunday, but apparently we are on a break now until i can get sober. it’s understandable because he has struggled with sobriety himself and he didn’t want to risk his sobriety for mine, so i get it. he said give it a month and if i’m still sober we can start dating again. this has taken such a huge toll on my mental health, though. i can stay sober, that’s not a problem, i’d do anything for him. the problem is going without him for a month. it hasn’t even been a week without him and i feel so alone. it driving me to have unsafe thoughts and actions and i’m really scared i’m going to impulsively kill myself. another thing, if this whole thing doesn’t work out and he officially breaks things off with me, i will kill myself. i can’t live without him, or rather, i can’t live without someone to attach myself to. when my last boyfriend broke things off with me, it landed me in the hospital before i could even attempt suicide and this time around, i have a whole plan for if he decides to leave. this has made me really anxious because i don’t want to accidentally pray on our downfall. that’s what happened last time, i was so worried about my last relationship failing, that it did. since i’ve been back from the er i’ve relapsed with self harm and had a mental breakdown last night that resulted in me head banging. if he knows what this “break” has done to me, i’m afraid it’ll scare him off. he knows i struggle with different things, and i actually met him at a php, but i’m more on the severe side and i just got out of a long psych ward+residential stay. i don’t want to go back over a boy. i already find myself being really clingy with him and he says it’s cute but i don’t thing he understands the extent of my emotions for him. if he breaks up with me, which he will eventually because we are only teenagers, i’m going to kill myself, and i know i’m going to succeed this time. i don’t even know if this is the right subreddit to be posting this, but i’m just really stuck and scared.",1664910698.0,False,7,8,julia_is_confused,None,xvnsqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/xvnsqy/my_boyfriend_and_i_are_on_a_break_until_im_sober/

2,Going to start treatment tomorrow,"I (M23) was diagnosed with BPD last month after I went to the hospital for suicidal and homicidal ideation. I also scored super high on antisocial and narcissistic traits, and I'm not sure how to feel about that, even though I know it's true. I know that having this disorder doesn't make me evil, but it felt like the psychiatrist was calling me that. The hospital people put me on Latuda (I'm on 3 other things too, and one doesn't work so I'm tapering off) and told me that I have to get a DBT therapist instead of the psychodynamic one I've been seeing for 6 years and love very much. They also referred me to a partial program, which I start tomorrow.

I'm really nervous. I'm in a lot of pain. I have rage episodes when I'm alone, and panic attacks, and I drink and cut myself. My mood swings are intense, and I go between being tired, and just hating everyone and wanting to hurt them. I'm also bipolar and am having a depressive episode right now. I know I have to stop these behaviors, but I don't know much about DBT or the coping skills that are part of it, and I'm afraid that it won't help me. I want it to, but part of me is scared to get better. I know I have to talk about the negative ways I think about people and myself, and the violent impulses, but I have so much shame. I'm also autistic and have meltdowns from overstimulation and social situations, and I struggle with communication and talking, so it's hard to gauge what is BPD and needs to be fixed with DBT, and what is autism and would be harder/unethical to try to change. I don't want my therapist to mix up the two and hurt me.

The doctors also want me to go back on lithium. I was on it for 7 years and it really helped me, but the side effects ended up being sooo bad. I think it might be best to go back on it, though, because I feel like my mind has been punishing me since I went off.

5,Passed the Bar Exam Today,"At the risk of seeming egotistical, I (29M) wanted to post this for anybody really going through it as proof that you can do that thing people say you can’t do because you’re borderline.

I’ve had a lifelong struggle with what I know now to be Borderline Personality Disorder. In highschool, I was bullied so aggressively I had multiple near death experiences and my family’s home was repeatedly vandalized. My dad was repeatedly battling advanced stage cancer and I had to take care of my brother through the end of highschool while struggling with what I know to be CPTSD now. I was (mistakenly) diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety when I was 18 and told I would need to live a low-stress, safe, low pressure lifestyle. I hated this. 

For years, through college I struggled with both being over-medicated while also being inadequately helped. I hungout with dangerous, aggressive people through college because that level of dysfunction felt normal. I graduated college with a double major, but struggled to function well in the workplace. Bad relationships with toxic people was all I knew.

I spent 5 years in a majorly abusive relationship with a toxic narcissist that resulted in multiple hospital trips for stitches and broken glass removal. When that ended, I was a law student and the stress of the breakup led to lots of psychiatric problems, the vast majority of my friends abandoning me, isolation, suicide attempts, and self harm. I had to drop out of law school twice. My CPTSD and providers’ mismanagement of meds was so extreme that I lost the ability to read for almost 18 months. But I graduated.

I wasn’t even able to take the bar exam when I wanted to- my law school made me join a disciplinary program designed for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems because of my mental health problems through law school due to the extreme stigma against mental illness in law. I had to delay taking the bar exam after graduating because my mental illness was regarded as “a danger to the public.” Joining that punitive program was the only way to convince my state licensure board I could be trusted.

Finally, I was diagnosed BPD and started to get better through DBT. DBT saved my life. I gained the skills to put myself back together. Today I have an amazing girlfriend, a nice small house, rescue pitbull, new friends (through my girlfriend) and a couple old friends that stood by me, and now a new career in law as an attorney in a mid size American city as of finding out I passed the bar just this morning. 

Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn’t a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it’s an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don’t deserve it. Do that thing everybody says you can’t do and tell anyone who tries to stop you to eat shit.

Moved from Chicago to Albuquerque with my partner in September in a very fast and dramatic nature. We broke up Oct/Nov, and have continued to live together as chosen family. I worked and supported us when we first got here, and then I was unemployed from the end of November until a week ago, and the roles reversed. 

In December, I was in the psych hospital and while I was in there got a very angry text outlying some of my behavior that hurt them with the boundaries to ""not ask them for shit"" and that they were no longer the default for anything. Rides, weed, money, etc. Things that have been shared. It really hurt and was triggering. 

I've been trying, what is my current best, to maintain the boundaries, but still find myself asking for things and for help. Never really had anyone be so strict about boundaries before, and I share a lot of things with them, whenever they ask. The biggest thing is that they have had had access to is my laptop, which they have unlimited access to because they use it for work. My laptop is also the only way we are able to watch tv or movies. 

They are moving to a different city in another state at the end of March, and it's brought up a lot, on top of the whirlwind of our relationship and breakup that I haven't even remotely processed. And I have no idea what I am doing. Whether I'm staying in this city or moving on somewhere else, and if I stay in the same house or move out to another place. 

On Friday I lost one of my new jobs after 2 days of training, while I was in the middle of working my other job, and this week/weekend has been the anniversary of some very traumatic experiences and losses. I have been at the bottom of the well and in so much pain for a very, very long time and all of that turned into a lot of anger. That anger hasn't been excised in any sort of way. 

I had let them know what had happened and asked them if they could share some weed because I had worked a 15 hour day and everything was closed so I was unable to procure it myself. They have a car, and I don't. Not having a car in this city is incredibly unreliable and unsustainable, btw. The next morning before work they said they wanted to talk about boundaries when I got home. 

On the way to work, I decided to go full destruction and sent them a very nasty text saying things like how I jump when they say how high because I owe them, they didn't ask me about anything relating to losing my job, but fuck me, right? cancelling our Valentine's plans, telling them to not use my laptop anymore, and that we can stop pretending like we're going to talk or see each other once they move away. 

It went as well as we know it did. Told me that was all baseless and fucked up. They called me some names, fragile princess and fucking foul for getting in the way of their ability to work and make money. Saying if I wanna be done, we're done and that there's nothing for us to talk about unless it's about the house. I was immediately regretful and apologetic and took accountability for how I've treated them, that I hope they find someone who treats them better and can show up for them in a way that I haven't been able to, and in a way they deserve. Said that they could continue to use the laptop. They never responded to any of that. We did text today about the lease.

We haven't had any interaction as I've been at work and I'm not trying to impose myself. When I came home last night, I cleaned the kitchen, did dishes took out trash, and straighted up the living room. The vibe was a lot better than I thought it would be when I got home,  which was a surprise. 

Today I've started to cry off and on at work. I'm weirdly calm. Maybe because I'm accepting of my bed, and because I know I have to repair through action, which is getting back into program and all of the therapy and additional work. 

I'm sharing all this, because I really need to hear or know about others experiences that are similar to this. I really don't know what to do. I'm incredibly sad. All they wanted was for the rest of out time living together to be joyous, and I ruined everything. Don't even know if I should try and do any repair. I feel like it would be kinder to let them go.

1,Doing DBT through an intensive program for BPD and it's incredible,"I acknowledge how fortunate I am to have free access to this, I was on a waitlist in Canada for almost 2 years. I was so shaken up when I started..it felt like preemptively mourning parts of myself, if that makes sense. But I stuck with it and 3 months in I'm seeing a tremendous amount of progress.

 I have an hour with a one on one and 2.5 hours of skills group every week in addition to phone coaching during business hours. The appointments with my one on one have shown me so much about how and why I developed the patterns I have. Getting to the root of... everything...is helping me cultivate self compassion which I have never had previously and learning to use skills and consequently reducing destructive behaviours is helping me gain a level of confidence I didn't think possible. It feels like every week I'm having a breakthrough...it's wild. Mind you I'm 38 and have been ""doing the work"" for 4 years now, (I didn't receive the BPD diagnosis until 2 years ago, I just thought all my symptoms were from bipolar disorder, which I also have).

 It's just so wild to me to feel like recovery is actually possible. Not like I expect BPD to ever fully recede but I do believe it's possible to experience long periods of remission. I want to siphon every drop of this 6 month program. I know I'm lucky and not everyone can access treatment and that is enraging because we all deserve it..but yeah...if you can access DBT I can't recommend it enough, if you're ready to do the work. And no judgment if you're not, it took me 34 years to get there so I get it.",1628067554.0,False,17,3,molotovpussytail,None,oxom04,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/oxom04/doing_dbt_through_an_intensive_program_for_bpd/
2,intensive DBT program without any processing work is destabilizing me to the point I'm terrified,"I have bipolar 1 as well. I was seeing a one on one for years doing processing work for trauma but once I was accepted to the BPD DBT program my other services were no longer covered (in Canada, while some services are govt covered, there are often stipulations). 

I see a psychologist who specializes in DBT for an hour every Tuesday and have group every Thursday for 2.5 hours. I also have access to phone coaching. While I'm beyond grateful for this support, I'm realizing how vital the processing piece is for me. Like many of us, I have C-PTSD and multiple events of PTSD. 

My mood is really destabilized, not just emotional dysregulation, but the bipolar component too is being deeply affected. I feel like I have no time to recover between sessions so I'm just always feeling unstable these days. I can't afford therapy that isn't covered. I don't know what to do. 

Group yesterday triggered me so hard, a particular group member, and I slept on and off for 16 hours since. I had to disconnect twice because I was about to lash out at her. 

Now I'm just sitting here shaking feeling like I'm in a mixed state.

I haven't seen much about TMS for BPD and was hoping to hear from folks who have BPD and tried TMS.

6,Some advice from someone who is finally starting to have less intense symptoms,"I was in a non-intensive outpatient DBT program for 8-9 months and I only started really using the skills around 3 months ago, which was around 3 months after discontinuing the program. My biggest piece of advise is REVIEW the skills on a regular basis, trying to use the skills is difficult if you can't remember the skills, which is the biggest issue I've been running into. And like I mentioned in the post and you've probably heard from others, skills are something you have to use on a regular basis for them to be useful, it's a mindful choice you have to make every time a symptom arises: should I continue my impulsive behaviors based on emotion mind, or should I get into wise mind and use my skills? Another piece of advice, you can EXPLAIN that you have BPD and how the symptoms effect you, don't use it as an excuse tho, because that lacks accepting responsibility and limits your chance to learn to be more effective. I'd say validating yourself, wise mind, mindfullness, DEAR MAN, check the facts, and FAST are probably the most important skills, in my opinion. The usual process I go through when dysregulated is: ask myself how I'm feeling, what are my thoughts, ""it makes sense I'm feeling this way because..."", check the FACTS(not opinions), what can I do in this moment to get back to being regulated/maintain this relationship/deescalate the situation/keep myself safe, how can I get grounded if I'm currently dissiociating,having a panic attack, rage episode, or breakdown. That way you let yourself feel what you're feeling instead of amplifying it or shutting down, just gently noticing your thoughts and feelings can help you start to feel better. By checking the facts, it helps you get closer to wise mind, by checking other points of view of the situation instead of just what you're perceiving it as. Explaining why you feel this can help you understand your emotions better and help you become quicker at identifying triggers/knowing when you need to use skills. Becoming grounded can also help you calm down as well, sometimes ""getting out of your head"" and into the world around you/an activity can really help regulate your emotions and help you to have a more meaningful life by actually noticing the things going on around you.

8,is there hope to recover?,"hi all,
unfortunately I’ve found myself in a whirlwind of bpdlovedones posts, trying to listen to podcasts about bpd (drs are saying the cruel, stereotype type things about bpd), and im wondering if anyone’s actually recovered? How? How did your relationships change? am I stuck in this forever?


I (23f) have been diagnosed for 3 years, and reflecting, recognize how and where my bpd has come up, where it’s been prevelant and caused issues in relationships.


Here’s the thing. I’m currently with a new(ish) (5 months) partner (23m), and it seems like it is a safe place. He knows about my bpd, he tries to understand, he sets boundaries, he asks questions, he knows im in therapy yaddayaddayadda.


Normally, I have pretty quiet bpd, I don’t lash out (I did when I was a teen), I bite my tongue when I split, I realize when im devaluing someone and don’t make rash decisions I know I’ll regret. However it obviously still comes out sometimes. It looks like it not seeing the other side, taking accountability, seeing im wrong, stuff along that nature.


But, when I do come around and realize maybe I was wrong, I feel so much shame and saying “im sorry here’s why I was wrong” feels… vulnerable?? I don’t know what my issue is haha. I’m not sure how to describe the feeling of 


Nonetheless, I have been trying to slowly recover, I have started a new intensive therapy program, im trying. But I feel like im messing my bf up along the way. I know every relationship has shit to hurdle over in the beginning but I feel like it’s more aggressive for me because there’s a name to the reason for some issues (bpd).

11,Sashbear training saved my relationship with my loved one (teenage daughter with BPD),"I have a loved one with emotional dysregulation and Sashbear (Canada) provides DBT training  (free of cost and self referral) to family members, partners, people who have a loved one with BPD.

Their webpage ([Sashbear.org](https://Sashbear.org)) states ""Empowering family members and communities with life transforming skills and hope, through workshops and evidence-based programs at no charge"" 

Their 12 week (2.5 hours/week plus homework) program teaches emotional regulation and problem solving skills so that family members can get off the emotional roller coaster that often takes over daily life.  

I completed the course 2 years ago.  After the first meeting I had hope, real genuine hope. After the second meeting, I realized, that I was going to have to change my personality and it was not going to happen overnight.  

For the first time, I am able to respond to my daughter's outbursts with a genuine calm state of mind and I am able to help her manage her emotional dysregulation rather than making the situation worse. Instead of focusing on her dysregulated behavior in the moment, I focus on understanding why the behavior happened in the first place. Our relationship or overall family connections has improved such that we say ""Love you"" multiple times a day and that especially helps to defuse blow-ups. 

In the past year, there was an emotional dysregulation event that resulted in my daughter saying ""I hate you!"" with an intensity that was unmatched to previous versions. I felt like I was struck with a load of bricks. Rather than responding immediately, I left the supper table and excused myself for 3-5 minutes. After a few deep breaths, I came back to the table, sat down and told my loved ""You said that you hate me, but I love you. I told it too you yesterday, I am telling you now and I will tell you again tomorrow. I know that you love me because you said it yesterday and the day before that. I understand that you are frustrated with XYZ but you are in a dysregulated state of mind and when you are there you are going to say things that you do not intend to say. It's okay, we will talk about this later when you are calmed the fuck down. okay?""

After I said this, there was a fearful expression on my daughters face as she realized what happened. Her hateful words were not true and she had no power over my emotions. She has not said it since, although she tells me to F-off a couple of times a week (when dysregulated), but I ignore it.

My daughter's upcoming BPD life challenges are not going to disappear, however at least I can support her in a meaningful way and protect my own mental health.

For those with BPD in Canada, please recommend Sashbear to your loved ones so they can help you to manage your BPD in a loving and supportive manner that protects and enhances their own mental health. 

The Sashbear training modules are the same or a slightly modified version of DBT training skills. This can be very helpful for those doing DBT training for the first time,  as other family members can also put the DBT skill set into practice. The more you practice, the more it sticks.

Sashbear also has an expert series of youtube videos covering many different topics.

14,Going to start treatment tomorrow,"I (M23) was diagnosed with BPD last month after I went to the hospital for suicidal and homicidal ideation. I also scored super high on antisocial and narcissistic traits, and I'm not sure how to feel about that, even though I know it's true. I know that having this disorder doesn't make me evil, but it felt like the psychiatrist was calling me that. The hospital people put me on Latuda (I'm on 3 other things too, and one doesn't work so I'm tapering off) and told me that I have to get a DBT therapist instead of the psychodynamic one I've been seeing for 6 years and love very much. They also referred me to a partial program, which I start tomorrow.

I'm really nervous. I'm in a lot of pain. I have rage episodes when I'm alone, and panic attacks, and I drink and cut myself. My mood swings are intense, and I go between being tired, and just hating everyone and wanting to hurt them. I'm also bipolar and am having a depressive episode right now. I know I have to stop these behaviors, but I don't know much about DBT or the coping skills that are part of it, and I'm afraid that it won't help me. I want it to, but part of me is scared to get better. I know I have to talk about the negative ways I think about people and myself, and the violent impulses, but I have so much shame. I'm also autistic and have meltdowns from overstimulation and social situations, and I struggle with communication and talking, so it's hard to gauge what is BPD and needs to be fixed with DBT, and what is autism and would be harder/unethical to try to change. I don't want my therapist to mix up the two and hurt me.

The doctors also want me to go back on lithium. I was on it for 7 years and it really helped me, but the side effects ended up being sooo bad. I think it might be best to go back on it, though, because I feel like my mind has been punishing me since I went off.

I'm not asking for advice, just maybe responses from people who can relate, especially if they've been in a similar situation and been successful with treatment.",1686707295.0,False,2,1,Simple_Blueberry276,None,148vf5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/148vf5c/going_to_start_treatment_tomorrow/
15,I’m surviving the worst part of my life. Recovery IS possible and I’m proof of it.,"Long post ahead. Tl;dr at the bottom.

For some background, I’m 29, just got diagnosed BPD last September. Despite that I struggled my entire life (suicidal thoughts, self harm, toxic relationships, MULTIPLE trips to the ER and I still was never properly diagnosed). I started DBT in October and just finished the program in April. I also started lamictal last year but just got on a dose that worked for me around February.

A little over three weeks ago, my husband got physically violent with me. He had “only” been verbally abusive in the past, which I let happen because I believed he would get better, even though he never even promised he would. 

And I LEFT. I just LEFT. I’ve never really felt the FP thing, but I definitely let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to me in the past. And I know if this happened a year ago…I would have stayed. I would have let him tell me he only hit me because my behavior made him. I would have let him make me believe I was the one who was getting the second chance to not fuck up. 

But after a year of intense therapy and meds (less than a year actually) I had the ability to leave him. And when he tried to control me, I still left. And when it meant I’d have to live alone, I still left. And even when I had a full emotional breakdown on our first wedding anniversary, one week after he hit me, I still left.

Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am for keeping myself safe, something I never have done in the past. This is the hardest and worst thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. But I know I’ll survive, and honestly, I owe that to DBT and all the work I put into it.

Please don’t give up hope. Keep trying, keep putting in the work. It’s worth it and so are you.

Tl;dr my husband got physically violent and thanks to DBT and meds I was able to leave him, something my BPD would never let me do before recovery.",1657591858.0,False,48,7,devourtheunborn69,None,vwzpxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/vwzpxv/im_surviving_the_worst_part_of_my_life_recovery/
16,Trying to recover while in a new relationship,"Hey everybody ! I have recently been on the journey to start recovery right now after going through a really rough and challenging time after starting a new medication that brought out the worst parts of myself and a new relationship that i realized heightens my bpd symptoms (even just having the context of being in a relationship had me triggered). I want to further my growth as much as possible so I want to make sure I work towards my growth instead of against it. So I share this in hopes of getting feedback or really any response! I want to know what other ppl think from an objective POV ! This is a long post so be prepared for that ! 

I am currently tapering off this medication and working through dbt workbooks and in the process of getting started at an outpatient dbt program ! We both have mental illness and they have gotten treatment/ are going to therapy and taking meds however unfortunately things started turning toxic unknowingly and there was a dynamic created where I started burdening my partner and they felt like they always had to be there for me even if they didn’t have the capacity to otherwise in their mind who else would and over time started revolving their whole life around me (even isolating themselves from others just to b around me and try to be there for me in crisis). They took me expressing some of my intrusive thoughts and fear of abandonment to heart and made themselves suffer to make me feel “better” or not to abandon or leave me.

 I would word vomit and over share a lot of things I definitely should’ve kept to myself but that I never knew was making them feel like this. Our communication was off because they thought it would make me feel even worse and I would in turn internalize any feedback or criticism and also sometimes they didn’t even know how they felt never mind to then tell me. We got into a habit of them reassuring me no matter what and a routine of seeing each other all the time. After a major meltdown from me and a long day of work, we got to the point where we both got triggered and had an emotional night which lead me to initiate conversation about the issues that are there. 

As we uncovered more, it was disturbing to see how something that we both thought was going pretty well to see how actually unhealthy our start was.  

We have granted each other space as we definitely need to think, reflect and let ourselves read the situation/our feelings more. Last night, we talked about it and took accountability and shared feelings that were scary to say and admit but were needed to be said. We decided instead of breaking up we both are going to put forth the effort and time and patience to try and care for ourselves more and in turn make it so that we rebuild and unlearn all the misconceptions that we had in our relationship by creating and actively writing down different solutions to our issues and putting in a plan to how to achieve it to give us another go but I wonder if even this is a way of being toxic. 

My worst nightmare of burdening someone else’s mental state bc of me came true and while it was on them for the lack and dishonest sense of communication within themselves and with me I just don’t want to make more toxic decisions and hurt us both in the end :,( 

Any feedback would be appreciated and I guess if anyone relates to this it would be nice to know I’m not alone in this position. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed that I let myself get to the point where I was hindering the growth of my partner and weighing their life down but I’m trying to accept that there’s nothing I can do about the past and just to take accountability and change however if anyone has suggestions on how not to feel so guilty/bad/ashamed please lmk !!",1625235134.0,False,5,4,lotus-pea,None,ocawyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ocawyx/trying_to_recover_while_in_a_new_relationship/
17,Skills for dealing with intense emotion,"I posted this in the regular BPD sub but had zero responses and I'm feeling desperate and alone. I'm hoping that I'll have more luck here. The situation: I'm in my second week of inpatient ED treatment and I've never felt so emotionally disregulated IN. MY. LIFE.

I have (quiet) BPD, and my emotions are UNBEARABLE lately, especially since I don't have access to my unhealthy coping mechanisms (food restriction, substance abuse and self-harm) OR a one-on-one therapist. I just feel like I'm going to go nuts if I don't figure out skills that actually help. They're not teaching us formal DBT (the handouts are ""inspired by"" Linehan's DBT sheets) and this isn't going to change so I need to find some alternatives. My biggest struggle rn is whether I'm ""sick enough"" or that things were ""serious enough"" to warrant me being here, and I've been looking up narrative therapy because I'm a writer and feel like this could help give me perspective. Does anyone have experience with this? Or can link me to some reliable resources? Are there any other skills other than TIP and accepts?

On top of all this my mum's been sending me nasty texts about how I'm not trying hard enough, that taking PRNs like Ativan and Seroquel are a cop out and that I have skills and that I'm ""choosing"" not to use them. I just feel so invalidated by her and the psychiatrist I deal with here is gaslighting. I won't even go in to what he's said to me but ultimately I need to learn how to validate myself and not depend on others for that validation. Any tips on how I can learn this? I'm so desperate, I'm ready to drop out of this program if things don't get better... they won't take my intense emotions seriously and I suspect they're stigmatizing due to the BPD diagnosis, but I have no proof of that and I don't want to play the victim so take that with a grain of salt.

Last friday I was at my psychiatrist appointment. A week before it I had a really bad episode and almost unalived myself because of it. Therefore my psychiatrist decided to raise my medication. Before that, I was on 300 mg lamotrigine, 250 mg venlaflaxine with prolonged release and 100 mg of normal venlaflaxine, 75 mg trazodone and occasionally if things got bad I had 10 mg oxazepam. 

But last friday I got raised trazodone to 150 mg and was told to start taking oxazepam daily. The thing is, I am scared of taking oxazepam daily because it really drains my energy and I am currently at uni. Meaning I wouldn't probably be able to study as well as I do now.

6,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

8,"Medication (lamptrigine, CBD, THC)","Hey everyone, I (F25) am struggling with medication at the moment and would appreciate some insight from those with personal experience 

DISCLAIMER: I have a fab team of doctors monitoring all my conditions, but I would like some real-life advice. 

TLDR: Does lamotrigine make it *impossible* for you to get out of bed in the morning? Has it increased your libido? Do these side effects eventually wear off? Changing from cannabis to CBD oil, thoughts? 

Bit of a long one here. 

I have chronic pain from Endometriosis as well as BPD and Bipolar 2. 

I was on a cocktail of medication, and I impulsively stopped all of my medication (except 1) in December 2022. I was taking nortiptiline (for pain) for a while until we realized it stimulated manic episodes (bipolar 2), so we switched to pregabalin, but that made me severely depressed, and I experienced some neurological symptoms (inability to speak/form sentences, brain fog etc). This is mainly what led to my impulsive decision to stop all my meds. 

I am now re-introducing my medication, one at a time, so I can pinpoint which side effects come from which medication. So far I have reintroduced tramadol (pain) lamotrigine (BPD + Bipolar 2), celecoxib (pain), and occassional SR tramadol (pain flares). 

Due to my pain, my sex life is pretty much non-existent, and my partner (M30) has been so patient with me through all of this. I recently started lamotrigine again (2 weeks ago) on a 50mg dose. My libido has increased significantly! We are talking every day, when prior to this, it may have been once or twice a month. However, I find it *impossible* to get out of bed in the mornings. 

- has anyone experienced the changes to sleep and libido when starting lamotrigine? Does it get better over time? I want to keep the increased libido, but I'm not sure if it is worth the struggle in the morning. Am I taking the medication too late (10 pm normally)?

I also use cannabis to help with my pain, anxiety, and erratic mood swings. I know that cannabis isn't the best for us with BPD. 

- has anyone switched from using cannabis to CBD oil (minimal THC content)? I recently had a consult at a cannabis clinic and am considering using the CBD oil instead, but I'm not sure if this will give me the same relief from pain and anxiety.

22,BPD & ADHD,"Hi guys :)

I (27f) was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 9. My parents didn't really believe in therapy so they kinda forgot about it, never did anything with it, and haven't told me about this diagnosis until a few years back. I've been diagnosed with BPD for 10 years. I mentioned the ADHD thing to my psychiatrist but never really focused on those symptoms as I've always been more preoccupied with the BPD symptoms.

Now, I know that ADHD could be mistaken for BPD and the other way around, but I definitely have BPD, so let's not get into that.

**I wanna ask those of you who have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD if you're taking** (or were in the past) **any medication for it? How did it work with the medication prescribed for BPD** (yes, I know BPD can't be treated with medication alone, but again - let's not go there)**? Did it make your life easier on the BPD side of things too? And in general, did it make your life easier?**

I'm tired of having to work/study twice as hard as people around me to achieve the same results. Among other things. But this is my main issue atm.

If that makes any difference, I take Effexor (venlafaxine) and trazodone.

23,Any bpd explosive types?,"Please help.

I have the bpd explosive type and its getting me into trouble, im blowing up at everyone I cant control myself.

Today I blew up at the doctor as I asked her for medication or therapy or something to help me as im overwhelmed AF and she was like ""this something you must get over from within"". And so I snapped at her. Then my partner snapped at me about how embarrassing I am always causing scenes in public and also at home ""for all the neighbours to hear"".

So no medication, no therapy, .... ive already done workbooks, meditation, yoga, breathing, journaling, tracking, reseaching core wounds and how to heal them, i even turned to witchcraft lol but NOTHING is helping me.

All of that has led to a lot of self awareness and recovery, and lately I made a casual comment to a friend that when I'm not medicated I'm overall just a garbage human and she got a little upset with me.

25,What works best for you?,"Hi all!

I have been on the long and exhausting journey of finding the right medication combo for the side effects of my BPD. I am also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder w/ Agoraphobia, and PTSD. But, I believe my Borderline is the biggest disruption, as it triggers all of my other disorders.

I have huge abandonment issues, causing me to feel like it's next to impossible to let go of people, ideas, irrational thoughts, etc.). My irritability is moderate. My depression is severe, it comes with suicidal ideations. Lastly, my anxiety is on and off, but when it's bad, it is debilitating.

I am currently on Prozac 20mg x1, Hydroxyzine 50mg x3, Clonidine .02mg x3, Trazodone 100mg x1, Zofran 4mg xAs needed, and Adderall 30mg XR x1.

I have tried numerous other medications, but my med management has been a mess since August 2020. I have been put on and taken off so many medications, I am not sure what has made things worse or helped out (even though, I don't feel like I have been stable since March 2020).

Currently we have been together for about 2 years. We have started to have really big issues now and it's mainly because of my episodes. I'm super reactive and in tuned to his needs and body language. It's gotting so intense for me that I can't even focus on what he's actually saying. This has lead to multiple intense episodes. The other issues I have is with spending or communicating clearly. 
I'm at a loss of how to cope and have the support I need from my partner. Due to my episodes they are traumatized because I've been abusive. I hate it. This makes me hate myself so much and resent myself for it all. I almost dont want to put in the effort to be better because I don't feel like I deserve it.

31,Help Navigating Help,"Howdy! Last year around October, I started counseling and medication again. I was in the tail end of a bad relationship and hadn’t had a job in months. Now, I’m single, live with super supportive friends, and have a job I’m extremely passionate about.

Unfortunately, I can’t really muster any of that passion. Since I began taking antidepressants in October, I have documented a severe decrease in my overall quality of life. This has also been documented on the app by both myself and my care team. I am on my 4th course of antidepressants this episode with only an increase in depression symptoms. I expressed this to my psychiatrist as well as my suggestion that I stop this course of meds, just to see if some of my symptoms decrease. There was some back and forth, and she called me aggressive (which was annoying because I’m just asserting myself, it’s my brain after all and no shit I’m irritable when I haven’t felt a positive emotion to my core in months). But I also understood because I was definitely channeling my anger to help me blow past my fawn response of compliance. Eventually, I explain that I had done some independent research and knew that other types of medications (anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics) could potentially be more useful. After that she backed off and was like, oh well if you need an anticonvulsant then we need to refer you to someone irl. To which I replied, I would rather be on the right course of meds than be on an online platform. In the end, we are trying new anxiety and sleep meds with no antidepressant (against the doc’s recommendation) for two months. If there’s no change, then she’ll recommend an antidepressant again. Ugh, the whole thing was really hard and I was shaking for most of it. I feel like my doc made it harder than it had to be though. Especially since I didn’t want to even begin the 4th course, at the end of the 3rd I said I wanted to stop antidepressants completely and was told to try again. 

Sorry, that was a lot, but I want to know how y’all go about recommending changes in your medications to your doctors and what you do when you meet resistance.

33,Looking for resources,"I started seeing a psychiatrist, who specializes in TFP, 2 months ago. She diagnosed me with BPD. When I questioned the severity she said I’m “on the healthy side”. She explained that now that the assessment portion is over, the sessions would now be twice a week ($80 a week with my insurance). That was going to be a lot financially, as I dropped to working part time this year to help care for my baby. My husband supported my therapy and we agreed I would proceed with therapy and take a financial hit for one year for my well-being. I started to get a bad feeling about the psychiatrist when she prescribed me a sleeping medication and my insurance charged me $100 for the medication management code that she billed bc the insurance company said two codes were billed so it appears that 2 separate visits were completed when the medication management was discussed during our visit. I emailed her and told her I can’t afford $80 a week plus $100 every time she mentions medication to me so I would have my PCP take over this sleeping medication bc I don’t get charged when he writes me prescriptions. The psychiatrist then proceeds to send in a new prescription for a higher dose, which I didn’t ask for, after I was clear that I didn’t want to discuss medications with her again. This resulted in another $100 charge. She then took a 2 week vacation and we picked back up last night for our first real treatment session. She started the session by saying she needs to charge my credit card for the second medication charge. I let this go because I’m working on not cutting ppl off after a bad feeling. Then she says she has two requirements for me: 1) I need to “start a weight management program like weight watchers”. I gained a significant amount of weight during my pregnancy and can’t get it off. My PCP started me on Ozempic which has already helped me lose 40 lbs. I told the psychiatrist that I’m already taking steps to help with my weight (which was discussed in previously sessions) she replied “ya but you’re really not” and implied she didn’t trust my PCP of doing enough to manage my weight 2) since I couldn’t have her manage my meds due to insurance, she wanted me to have a regular psychiatrist manage my meds (vyvanse for ADHD and have been on for nearly 10 years and trazodone for sleeping which she put me on last month) bc she didn’t trust my PCP to manage them. 
All that was going through my head was this is more money I have to spend for things my PCP is doing for free. When I pushed back she said these two requirements were necessary for us to start therapy. She said it would be irresponsible of her to not have me do weight watchers and said it was the same as if I was an alcoholic and she required me to go to AA. 

She told me to cut my mom off and “have a hotel on speed dial” when I visit her but then later apologized and said she shouldn’t be giving me advice. She also made numerous little digs about my husband. Again, I brushed those comments aside bc I’m working on not being impulsive when it comes to cutting ppl off. But I’m really uncomfortable with her giving me an ultimatum and now  talking poorly of a third person on my life, my PCP. 

I emailed her and said I’m not comfortable with her two requirements and I understand this means we can’t move forward with therapy. I feel like the past two months of assessment and building trust with her was just a waste. I’m not ready to start with another therapist so I’m looking for other resources like books, videos, workbooks, etc that you feel helped you.

35,I don't feel much lust/love due to meds,"I've tried different meds over the span of ten years and I finally found a antidepressant and mood stabilizer that works great for my anger. But unfortunately I can't pick and choose what emotions medications choose to suppress and all have just surpressed everything at once. Meaning the intense anger and depression is gone but so is my hyper dorky intense self that other people miss too. And I can't feel much in the way of emotions in general. It's pretty mild. I don't feel much love or lust anymore ether. The person I'm seeing thinks I'm not interested because as much as I want to feel as if I'm into him, (which I am btw and I was most definitely until the medication) I just feel numb. I feel unphased about alot of things. And it's really nice to have a break from constantly worrying and stressing over intense emotions, but I miss having those parts of my life were I felt intense in other ways. I feel like part of who I am has been taken from me. 

In saying this, I've tried every medication on the market under the list that I can afford for bpd. None as good as this one for my anger. And my anger really really needed to be under control before someone got hurt. Threapy does not work for me no matter the type. My brain was beyond a high level of reactive that could be treated with just threapy.

We have 2 Kids together and over the years what we thought was “normal” marital issues turned out to be some deep rooted issues I had from my childhood. We both struggle with depression and for a while I was reluctant to engage in therapy and medication but once I realized how serious my condition was and accepted what I had, I started medication about 4 months ago. I still have triggers and coping struggles I’m having to work through but I feel like weekly therapy and medication have helped me come a long way. Unfortunately, over the last month I’ve had a ton of issues that have compounded and resulted in a couple episodes between me and my partner. Financial struggles combined with issues at work including a recent mass layoff (I survived) and then struggles with my side business put me in a place of extreme stress and I did not do a good job at coping with this stress and let small things at home cause me to lash out emotionally. I feel like my ability to regulate my emotions has improved a lot and then when I do have moments of poor coping I am much quicker to respond and accept what I’ve done wrong and talk through how I could be better in the future. This has all come to a head though to where now my Partner has said they now feel hopeless and do not know if they want to keep going while I continue working on this.

44,New to BPD,"So I guess this is sort of my introduction, as im new and just exploringmy support options. I'm a 28F and married with 3 kids. I know the all the hate I'll get for this, but I haven't been clinically diagnosed yet, atm I'm still learning about bpd and collecting all the evidence to bring to my doctor so I can start the process of being diagnosed. 


Now that that's outta the way, let's start from the beginning. My mental issues, as it pertains to bpd, started manifesting when I was 9 after my parents split up. My parents were both abusive in different ways, mom is a narcissist and dad liked to beat us, but my siblings and I didn't know that our lives were all that bad because we didn't know any better. That was until the divorce... it was still pretty taboo to have divorced parents back then, so the schools put us in group counciling and that's when we started realizing everything. 


The divorce didn't make anything better tho, and as the years went on, everything compounded until I finally had a melt down. At 14 I was caught with razor blades on school campus, but the felt I was more of a threat to others than myself and I was sent to an alternative school for 3mos. When I got bk I basically told the school therapist I was going to keep mutilating myself bc no one cared enough to stop me. That's when I was finally hospitalized and diagnosed with ""severe depression with anxiety"". 3yrs later, that diagnosis changed to ""manic depression with severe anxiety"". I was on every medication you could think of, but nothing helped or lasted very long... my emotions have always been a daily rollercoaster for me and it was difficult to control.


At 19 I got pregnant with my first kid, I took preemptive steps on ppd. But all that did was delay the inevitable, and that was the last time I took any medication for my issues and started self medicating. I was doing pretty good until at 23, I lost what would have been my second kid. I spiraled for months after that, but even after it stopped I was still never as good as I was b4. Then at 25 I got pregnant again, and that's where things started getting really bad again. I didn't try to take meds during that time and the ppd hit me harder than the first time, even still as bad as I was, I still felt like I was handling it all very well... but 9mos later I was pregnant again and tht just turbo charged the spiral.


I knew my issues weren't normal and that I was worse than I had ever been b4 in my life, so I started doing research. Instead of focusing on past diagnosis, I researched all of my symptoms which I'll list off now.

☆ constant daily rollercoaster of emotions
☆various manifestations of paranoia
☆having different ""personalities"" for different people I interact with
☆hopelessness
☆self hate 
☆unstable relationships
☆inability to hold a job for more than 9mos
☆feeling like I'm not in control of my self or actions
☆impulsive habits
☆blackout rages
☆hyper fixation with new relationships 
☆saying things I don't mean
☆feeling lost
☆terrified of abandonment
☆feeling out of place or time
☆disassociating 
☆hearing/seeing things that aren't there
☆seething jealousy 
☆acute distrust, even with people close to me


Really I could go on and on, the point is that I came across bpd and everything just clicked. So I along with all of my research, I started listening to other people's stories and their struggles and it just solidified it all for me.

I feel like it’s been so much easier for me to take a step back and think before I respond which felt almost completely impossible for me a few months ago. my lows, even though they’re very very low, have felt a lot less frequent. I feel like i’m able to be a lot more understanding and empathetic which was a big struggle for me. i’ve tried so many different medications and they’ve always either numbed me out or made things worse, but I finally feel like i’ve found something that works for me.

47,how to work on attachment,"Hi. I (20F) just got broken up with by my ex (22M) last night and have been NC. It's a very long story, but he ended things because of my behavior in the past few months being toxic and harmful. He said he loved me, he didn't want to do it, was ugly crying with me, but it was done anyway. Over the course of our nearly 8 month relationship, major life events happened, I lost sight, and he ended up becoming my Favorite Person unintentionally. 

I have been in bouts of crying, but I have been talking with many people and have a rocky plan for the foreseeable future. First, I have CBT and DBT in the next two days, and then on Wednesday I'm going to the doctor to switch my medication (cymbalta) to something else that will target mood swings. I am going to join a grief support group to manage the grief I felt these past couple months. I've written out the toxic attachments I developed and boundaries that we had at the beginning that fell away. 

I'm going to stay NC until Friday, wherein I'll reevaluate everything, but I don't know how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? I don't have these issues with anyone else in my life, only my romantic partner(s), and until the shit of life hit the fan, I was navigating my attachment very well. 

He is truly the love of my life, and we had so many things planned together. Everything was mapped out, and I was so secure with him. I believe when things went down that I used him too much for emotional reliance and we became a tad codependent. We are both anxious attachment, I think, and I have BPD whereas he does not. I do still love him, though, and I want to firstly work on my own issues for a while, but I do want to be with him again, if he'd try us out again.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? Or just any advice in general? 

edit: broke no contact. found out he and his sister are leaving town for a while, so I left him a voice-mail last night telling him to stay safe and that I miss him. said I love you. texted his sister a similar sentiment. the lack of response really feels like I just tore my own insides out, but I suppose that's the decision that's been made. I dont want to lose him, and I feel I already have

edit 2: talked to my dr. the medication I was on for my arthritis gave me psychosis, and my rheumatologist didn't check my mental history before prescribing them. I stopped those, started taking prozac instead of cymbalta, and started 3 omega-3 fish oils, 1 vitamin b1, and 2 magnesium glycinate. i had a phone call w his sister a few days ago and she said he isn't ready to talk yet but it was fairly amicable. sending a text tmrw for his birthday but haven't reached out. going to the psychiatrist in a few weeks to get mood stabilizers. ive done a lot of journaling, therapy, and talking and distracting. I know I can thrive without him and I don't NEED him to survive, but I do love him and he enhances my life. I want us to work out, but I'm not going to spam or go crazy w the contact. After the bday text, I'm not going to reach out, which is hard, but if it's meant to be he will come back.",1711942056.0,False,5,4,casineb,None,1bstfxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1bstfxm/how_to_work_on_attachment/

49,"Trying to heal by yourself, an unavoidable failure?","I, (31F) escape a 10 years relationship of physical and mental abuse. Almost 3 years ago. At 28 years old, that the only thing I knew. He was my first boyfriend ever. It’s exactly how it sound. Getting beating up, manipulate, cheating on, denigrate and ect. All my twenties I was miserable. Severe anxiety and depression. Binge eating which had me come up until 320 pounds. Isolation from friends and family. I really had come to conclusion that this was I meant to live. The worst in all this is, everyone around us always was always telling us we were the dream couple. When the pandemic strike, I was stuck at home and the violence became more and more unbearable. I am not a big drinker but one day, I decide to drank wine to ease my pain a bit. It actually save me because I had the drinker courage. He had beaten me again. I decide to call his mom (who already knew) to ask her to come get him. I was in a panic. I also decide to call my sister and tell her. My drunk logic was, if someone knew, I would be too embarrass to go back into this toxic and manipulative piece of shit of a man. I was right, I never went back. My mom took me back at home and it felt good to be around family. Two of my sisters lived there too. But we were never a emotionally open family. So I never really talked about this. Even if I escape I was fucked up. And I actually loved him (or I thought). Now I was stuck with all this pain by myself. I couldn’t really afford to have private psychologist. At one point, I got a family doctor after 20 years without one. At first I just wanted medication for my ADHD but my diagnostic was too old, he send me for an evaluation with a psychiatrist but by the public system. When they called me to evaluate the case, they asked me other question not in link with my ADHD, and I told them everything about what happened. They put me in a priority list. I saw a psychiatrist very fast, she was not worry about my lack of concentration, but with all the rest. I got diagnosed with BDP and severe PTSD from this relationship. The BDP part was really shocking to me. I never thought about it. Maybe I had preconceived idea about it. But it make a lot of sens. My behaviour and lack of self love since I was a teenager should had been worrying for me parents. Again, I don’t have a family that talk about theses things. I always was in pain alone. And very ashamed of this pain. I am still on a list to see a psychiatrist. I can’t afford one even with my private insurance. My psychiatrist had put me in A LOT of medications. I was a really zombie. And it never helped me. Every time I told her, she didn’t want me to stop or change. I didn’t felt listening by her so at one point I stop seeing her. I stopped all theses medications too. The things was, as soon as I left my ex, my life became amazing. Even with all this pain and fucked up brain. I lost over 100 pounds very fast (not in the healthiest way, I’m sick remember). I was always pretty but of course way more attractive without this weight. in two years, I got 2 promotions and a new super cool dream job. Even without education, got this very well paid job with hard work and experience. I also met my now husband. Which is, freaking amazing men. He had teach me what a real relationship should look like. He his handsome, gentleman, a successful artist, generous and fun. For the first time of my life, I was going out tasting every restaurant in town, seeing every exposition, going to weekend trips and just living the best life. He is also my safe place. I told him everything that happened to me and he is helping me a lot to deal with my pain, anxiety and depression. We moved downtown in a super luxurious tower. I travel a lot. I connect back with all those friends I had isolated from. I really do have everything I ever wished for. People envy my lifestyle. But even with this dream life, every night, I look in the mirror, into this pretty girl, with nice things, with a amazing husband, in her cool appartement and I am in pain. I cry almost every night. I am scare to lose all of this. I am scare my husband will become suddenly like my ex. I think I suck at my job. I am still miserable.

I’ve been in EMDR ever since then and while it’s worked for some things, I still find myself completely destroying relationships in ways that feel so out of my control. Im very new to accepting my diagnosis and ready to look toward BPD focused treatment including any medication that might help.

Should I start by explaining to my EMDR therapist my interest in refocusing my care/finding a BPD focused therapist? I feel really overwhelmed on how to seek help.

It doesn’t help that I’ve just been given the “fix your shit” convo with my partner who is actively abandoning now but “open to revisiting” the idea of us once I’ve worked on things.

Afterwards I burst into tears and I feel like unaliving myself because everything is just to much. The day before I was up with seizures due to stress (I have epilepsy which is managed, but the stress was so bad, the medication was not helping much). I tried to talk to my partner and he told me to calm down and that he had to go to church and seemed very dismissive and distant. In which he has been lately. I then broke down and said I felt like I was going to unalive myself and I needed to talk to him right now because I didn't feel safe on what I may do in my headspace. He told me ""what would my family think of you acting like this ?! I can't tell them you are like this! Calm down!!"" Then told me to stop crying multiple times and getting angry. When I told him to stop blaming me, he just told me he wasn't. Even though he was. He kept saying ""why are you doing this?!?"" ""Stop this now"" ""stop crying!!!"". I ended up crying harder and he hung up on me. Afterwards he ignored all my calls all day and night and I was a mess! He knows how much that would completely break me... I know I'm not easy to deal with... I know I'm a emotional rollercoaster... happy one day and crying the next... but I really do try... therapy for 12 yrs now and on medication.

But instead he read my messages and saw the amount of pain I was in and ignored it. He then told me it's my fault for now saying all these things  (me repeating what he did to me) and not doing as I was told when he said to calm down and stop crying. He believes it is my fault. Multiple times when I have cried in the past he has not acted like this. Infact he has never acted like this before, well alittle, but never to this extent. but lately he has been. And I am now considering leaving him. For good. I don't think I can forgive him. I can't even look at him the same anymore. And he feels no remorse whatsoever.

She still takes everything, but that overwhelming level of anxiety/pit has come back to her and she just now had another self isolating eps. Tbh I don't know if we'll recover from this or not. Idk if it'll stop working for every person but To all who I gave hope, I'm sorry 😞. I thot I found a solution to at least enjoy my time together with her but it seems it was likely short lived. If we get out of this postively somehow long term, I'll update.

This exact stack: bought from vitamin shoppe.

Solgar omega 3 950mg

Vitaminshoppe brand L theanine 100mg

Vitaminshoppe Nac 600mg

has pretty much saved my relationship and now I'm happily married.

For us, it has made her no longer explosive/randomly angry or self isolating anymore. It's legit 99% a normal relationship now . There's only been some small things were we communicated within under an hour each time like a normal understanding convo with one another. Sometimes even in 5 mins we good after small thing. That B4 trying this supplement stack, normaly wouldve made her give up on us and self isolate for days and or she'd get mad about it, if i was able to get her to try to tell me wat she was feeling. We are super happy to say we haven't had a meltdown in 27 days! B4 it was literally everry 2-3 days. We are still meltdown free since Dec 19 (x and we are both super happy to be with each other ❤️💗. !!! ((: She's felt so much happier, she's told me and I've noticed it. it's been easier to talk to one another too. We've committed to a future together and are starting a semi life in the same home soon cx. This stack is a ship saver!! It really balanced out her intense feels to practically nothing!. She does still have small sad type moments here and there from things that remind her of childhood trauma alittle or things that she gets mad at herself internally abit for forgetting. But when they do happen and I notice she's looking down a little, I ask her about it in a supportive way, and she opens up and within about 10 mins and we are past it and up again. That's it(:. it's very occasional too. Like once a week. Very manageable, easy to recover, communicating is easier and is much more possible now.

This is wat she takes and when:

1pm everyday, she takes the stack, 2 of each listed.

10pm she takes her lamotrigine and 1 vitaminne shop brand magnesium glycinate 400mg tablet form

No idea if she still needs her lamo subscription med but didn't want to chance us melting down again. So still on it. Might maybe try it without later in the future, now that the stack and magnesium seems to help alot. For now tho we are super happy together (:. Anyone else that sees this, it takes the edge off very noticably! Try it. 😁. Do you and or your special person a huge favor and start the stack ASAP, you won't regret it. Worth every penny.

Also she's not in DBT. We do our best for each other and love care n support one another. We are incredibly happy with this stack and mag. CX 💞 hoping this will help others who have SOs that want to give up in a loop and or themselves and struggling to find help. Not a cure, but really dam close! Cross posting to help others live a hopefully better life😊.

I will occasionally update the number of days we've made it, if we are still together happily and to let everyone know that this supplement stack is still working for her/us <3.",1704053956.0,False,0,6,Best-Difference-1946,None,18vg691,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18vg691/the_sup_stack_that_saved_my_ship_read_if_you_have/

I have ADHD and BPD, and ive been in treatment for a year (schema group and individual therapy). Its been real hard and slow work, but it has been very beneficial. 

However since ive been put on the appropriate ADHD meds (dexamphetamine) that actually work for me and dont make me feel horrible, ive been making progress wayyy faster than before. I can think clearer, i dont dissasociate as badly so i can actually work through emotions better. Im more present in the group, and its easier to connect.

Overall its a whole new world for me. I had never experienced actually being calm in my head, without also feeling numb (used to be on ritalin, which had very negative side effects in my case). And it feels like i can finally profit from all the hard work id been doing in therapy.

57,can't get a diagnosis!,"So I am usually not one to self-diagnose. I have been under psychiatric care since I was 13 (now 23) and have been diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, social phobia, OCD, anorexia, ADHD, and PTSD and I typically defer to my doctors/therapists. But it's pretty fucking obvious to me that there is something bigger going on here... how would a person have 7 unrelated mental illnesses?! I have been on a cocktail of psychiatric medications since age 13, tried every type of therapy that I could and I still feel like I'm grasping at straws and trying to treat things that are just symptoms of a larger problem.

I have done A LOT of research (I'm talking hours upon hours) and am reasonably confident that I have Quiet BPD. I think the reason that no practitioner has caught onto it is because I internalize everything and I only lash out at myself. I don't really show any external signs of having BPD, however I have 8/9 BPD characteristics in the DSM (for context, diagnosis is appropriate with 5/9 symptoms). 

When I brought this up with my psychiatrist, she said she doesn't really see typical BPD traits in me (which I think is because I have quiet subtype and it's highly internal) and that she is hesitant to diagnose BPD because of the stigma it carries... okay, but I am confident that I meet the diagnosis standards under the DSM and need to be treated for BPD instead of the other seven issues, as the BPD & PTSD are no doubt what is causing everything else. 

I really don't want to self diagnose. But I have brought this up with multiple therapists, psychiatrists, etc. and my ED recovery coach is the only one to see the truth in what I'm saying. I *know* something deeper is going on. I have felt this way my whole life and only when reading about quiet BPD was I able to understand the chronic emptiness that has caused all of the other issues. Yes, I have an ED, yes I am depressed. But they are not the root issues and I feel like I'm not being listened to.

58,"Giving up hope= peace? (TW: suicidal ideation, overlong post)","I’m currently in Pokhara, Nepal on a work trip (teaching and performing theater) and stuck in he hotel with a rough sinus infection.  I found this in a bookstore here and those four questions made me think about living with BPD. 

Context about me: diagnosed in 1993, many years of many medications with intermittent success. Moved overseas and built a new life and business in 2007, married the love of my life and enjoyed a decade of life but was unmindful of my emotional volatility and how it impacted others. After moving to yet another country to grow the business in 2019, the pandemic led to bankruptcy and my wife leaving me and beginning a clear plan to end it all. Fortunately I was introduced to DBT and IT WORKS WHEN I DO THE WORK… but when things get extremely difficult it can be overwhelming to do the work. 

I’ve lost most of my close friends due either to distance or them being overwhelmed by me being ‘too much.’  I have been living alone now in the second country for a while, and over-working to fill the emptiness (and to try to pay debts and build some sort of financial stability). My DBT therapist declared I’d mastered the skills and was changing his business model, so that relationship ended two months ago. I wished him well and lied that I don’t fantasize about suicide any longer. I enjoyed the healthiest living relationship of my life for 6 months; yet we began knowing it would end when she relocated to the other side of the world. Although I was a much better partner to her- even so, at the end, she shared that I left her very little emotional space because I took up most of it. Now I’m in a third country for another week; much less developed than I’ve encountered, and managing this sudden illness alone. 

I used to think happiness was found in relationships. Yet, my emotional BPD mind (and to a large extent my personal experience) reminds me that everyone will leave my life at some point. Obviously with BPD Abandonment issues, this is a challenging thought to embrace. 

I’ve known all emotions are transitory and impermanent and that DBT isn’t a method to happiness but a way to manage and tolerate our pain and behaviors. 

I crave connection; I want to talk to someone who loves me and wishes to understand me. Yet when I’ve had these people I always eventually burn them out. 

I take things very literally. When my ex wife insisted we would remain close friends I believed her and of course that didn’t happen.  When my ex said she wanted to remain close and always talk, of course that did not happen. It’s hard for me to parse that someone can say something they don’t mean, or that later will be untrue.

Now I’m sick in a strange land.  And I crave conversation and validation and affirmation and love.  There are those that would say they’re there for me but history has shown most aren’t interested in my drama. Even my best friend is dismissive and too busy to talk. 

Then I find this book. 

I now theorize that interpersonal connections inevitably bring pain and suffering to one or both. No interpersonal relationships will last. The idea of joy and love and affirmation from others is illusory.  And ‘hope’ is the most destructive and hurtful concept. 

I’ve built a double career based on interpersonal connections - both in theater and corporate consulting. I’m more consistently unhappy than I was pre COVID. I’ve invested so much, and I’m still struggling so hard…. I’m debating retiring from the theater side (although I have a strong international reputation) and focusing on consulting and training and money.   This is something I’d prefer to talk through with a loved one… but my best mate said I’m ‘just spiraling’ and a person I’ve begun dating told me to ‘calm down.’

I don’t expect others to make concessions for me. And although my diagnosis isn’t my fault; it’s my responsibility to manage how I impact others. 

Maybe it’s time for radical acceptance- give up hope and understand life for me will be continued pain.

59,slowly but surely I'm making it,"It's been a while since i posted on this reddit but so much has changed and grown. I grew a lot, got help, made new friends, found lovers along the way and with each passing day, I began to heal despite the new pain coming in. 

I don't really know where I am on my BPD remission journey... But it's possible. 

It's possible to have healthy relationships in both friends and romance without splitting so bad. It's even easier when they all understand that you're a human and need a chance to process and hold you accountable for the the things that hurt them. 

They gave me a chance to grow, believed in my potential to heal and be better, they aided me with peer review and accountability and of course with every friend and romantic partner i lost, I begin to realize, newer, better ones come in and offer new perspectives and different ways to cope and grow. 

I sit here now, writing this as I do my Relationship DBT questions on two new friends i've met, and reading through it, reflecting back on it, makes me remember how far I've genuinely have come. 

Abandonment is a horrible thing to heal from. It's hard it sucks and it's painful and sometimes healing isn't for everyone. But the friends I have now, the ones I make, and the ones who stay with me, they make me feel less alone. And yes while I'll rehash old traumas and deal with the symptoms as they come, 

I can honestly say that life has been a lot better the more i continue my healing journey from bpd. 

And BPD is terminal. It can't be cured with anything. Therapy and medications and learning ways to make things easier and healthier for yourself through coping strategies may be the closest thing to a ""cure"" but it's a lot of hard work. 

it's hard work that I actively continue in order to keep healthy relationships, strong boundaries and honest communications with, because I deserve a chance to be happy and live a healthy life while living with BPD. 

So I guess if you're reading this, It's possible. It's possible to heal and to grow from the severity of it all. While it'll always be with you, You can find comfort in knowing that it's at least possible to ease the symptoms, to live a normal and healthy life style as Someone wBPD. So to whoever needed a sign to not give up and to see if it was possible, 

It is. 

Here's to the long progression of my own recovery, and all the beautiful places and people it will lead me to. 

And Here's to you, the reader. 

Everyone's journey is different, it's scary and it can be hard. But peace is just right around the corner.

60,"Lonely, clingy, emotionally promiscuous, hopeless case","TW: domestic violence

Not sure why I am writing this. I am 21. And I am losing hope. My borderline patterns started at 12. And they keep getting worse and more complicated with time. Never been in proper therapy. I was not compliant. Never found a good therapist. Was just heavily medicated with antipsychotics. But my patterns? Worse and worse with time. Dad died at 18. No financial stability and abuse at home of all kinds. Writing this post outside of my family house where my brother broke my nose. 

Just following with a convenient psychiatrist for the time. But no real change. Just staying afloat. CBT doesn’t work.

I am lonely. I do not fit in. People mostly bullied me for being autistic. In teen years and adulthood, I was sometimes repulsive. I lost my elementary school friends. I traveled and didn’t contact them for a decade. I don’t make real friends . I just act like a clown and mask. Or trauma dump.

Was stuck in a toxic FP situation for 3 years. Took my emotions and energy and complicated things. Much older person (3 times my age) and was pretty much groomed at 18. Finally left him . I was clingy desperate for a toxic person.

But I am always emotionally promiscuous anyway. Any guy shows the slightest bit of attention, I run into his arms regardless of red flags.

Epileptic and chronically ill. Health not stable.

Senior in uni and trying to push through to graduate.

61,Struggling with nightmares from the past.,"Throwaway account here.
So first a bit about us. You can skip to the question if you want.

My wife with BPD and i are together since 2008. We were at the tim 16 and 19 and did go through alm rough times together.
She got diagnosed at first with depression during our relationship and at the age of 18 with BPD and ADD. We did go to different therapist over the years. Some more usefull than others. She had for around one year a really creative one, who brought some ideas for her sleeping problems, but dropped out of the profession due pregnancy. She has now a therapist specialized on DBT. And she did some hughe improvements.


Question;

Now that she made hughe improvements in the last half of this year, but still struggles a lot with nightmares, where she falls back in her childhood, mixed with her current life.
We're now hoping to find something, that might her help with this. It really bothers her, since she feels like every progress she made, isn't there. In addition, she's not well rested.
Anyone had similar problems? If so, what helped you?

63,Is it healthy or is it another FP?,"My friend and I both have quiet BPD, though we are both in therapy and he's on medication while I'm finally getting started into looking for medication. 

Recently I've been finding myself wanting to romantically take him on dates, hold hands etc, do all the things a romantic couple would do but my only fear is that, because my mental health hasn't been the best recently (Due to a really toxic situation I had to escape from with an ex friend), I'm worried that it's just another FP attachment forming. 

I want more than anything to treat him well, and give him the healthiest love that ik he deserves, especially because he's been mistreated in the past, but I'm so scared that this is only going to become another unhealthy attachment and with HIM having bpd, i'm worried that i'm going to make it worse. 

So far all our things have been reciprocated (Wanting to hang out more, our plans for cosplaying with one another, being able to rely on one another and check in with one another emotionally) so I've just been really careful and allowing myself to slowly take in all the good he's brought into my life, rather than taking more and more and more because I'm worried he'll leave, and leaving him with nothing.

64,So I’m building a website...,"

Hey guys, I need some help. Keeping it short and simple, I’m building a blog/resource site for BPD. It’s borderlinehell.com

The website isn’t live yet, but I need ideas. Originally I just wanted to make a blog for myself and the long, fucked up road this has been. I feel like I’m finally on the “good” side of this and I might be able to help people with what I’ve been through. However now that I’ve actually gotten this thing off the ground, there’s SO MUCH MORE I could do with this. 

There really aren’t any resource sites made BY borderline people. All the information out there is clinical and written by the neuro typical or people who are bitching about us. I want to make a resource FOR borderline made BY a borderline. I want to include information on therapies, medications, history, depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicide (and ideation). I want to provide information for teens and veterans and parents. There’s places for the families of BPD to go to, I want to provide a place with everything that affects BPD and the PEOPLE who actually HAVE it. 

So help me, please, with ideas. I’ve gotten a few really good ones from some folks in the chat, but I want to keep asking around. 

-What did you need when you were diagnosed?
-What resources did you wish were available then?
-What resources do you wish are available now?
-What helps you through a split or any swing currently or past?
-What is the hardest part of BPD for you?
-What therapy has helped you the most and why?
-What medication has helped you the most?
-What do you wish neuro typical people knew/understood about BPD?

There’s much I’m sure I’m forgetting to ask, so please fill in any blanks. You don’t have to respond here, I can be reached at:

65,I chose to be I choose to be codependent.,"

Ok this is going to be a long story on why I made this choice and how me and my husband of 2 and a half years are making it work. 
I'm multiple diagnosed with ASD, BPD, Bipolar type 1, Schizoaffective Bipolar type, OCD, ODD, ADHD, CPTSD and a lot of other mental health issues as well as some medical ones but those are the main reasons.

Before I met my husband I was extremely unstable constant splitting, at one point I od'd on my blood pressure meds, I have a nasty scar on my thigh from a bad relationship[self inflicted] I was an absolute mess. Let's add onto this I had recently had a therapist that was constantly instilling into my head that I was a burden by saying what are you going to do when your parents die. My parents had also been known to bring me to look at group homes without telling me before hand the first time this happened I had a full meltdown in front of the woman who ran it and she said if I did that in front of the other girls they would beat me up.

After the relationship that resulted in both the scar and the od I finally decided enough was enough and took matters into my own hands because I knew where my life was headed. It was on a dead end path to a group home. So I started looking for someone. Now here's how I found someone that changed my life completely. I chose the bdsm subreddits. I already knew I was a little with a codependent personality so I actively looked for a daddy-dom. Someone who knew how to take a caretaker role and help when I got out of control and acted like a child. That's how I found my husband.  He knew from day one about my illnesses, and also knew quite a bit about psychology so he has been extremely understanding from day one and we hit it right off. Within 2 weeks of connecting online I moved in with him we married 6 months later. Since meeting him I have gone into remission I'm also semi-indepentant in small.. or well for me big ways... for the first time in my life I can truly be left alone in the house for long periods of time. I haven't had a split in 3 years and most of my insecurities have faded and when they do show their ugly little demon heads he immediately squashes them and builds me back up. I've also been able to go off almost all my medications and im now on only one. And weve also been talking about having children of our own. For me personally, it's the best decision I ever could have made.

EDIT: Just be careful. A lot of people online are looking for an abuse victim and know nothing about aftercare. At first we were all about the sex but we quickly moved on and grew as a couple. It became about the future and how we didn't know what we wanted to do but we knew we wanted to do it together. He keeps me sane and I keep him happy. Even now he is telling me to be careful what I say to you all. He is and subsequently our relationship is  unique. I asked him what he would say to you about looking for someone online and he said, ""Don't tell them what you want outside of general things. Tell them you want rough sex but don't tell them you want aftercare. Let them tell you that they want to care for you after. Let them say thing about themselves without knowing that you like it. Then if what they say without knowing matches what you want, be safe and go for it. If you say you like getting ice cream after a doctor visit then they say I always get ice cream after the doctors, he is probably lying.",1703997537.0,False,3,5,Diligent-Sense-5689,None,18uzhr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18uzhr1/i_chose_to_be_i_choose_to_be_codependent/

Overwhelmed with the truth of just how bad my mental health is.

Was in tears at the simple fact I'm not the only one like me, other people DO struggle with these things. I have been working so hard on my mental health, therapists, my anxiety and ADHD diagnosed and correct medications.

However, almost 1 year in now I thought I was getting so much better and this past month I just feel like everything has been hitting me.

I still feel unheard, misunderstood, ashamed, and all stuck in my head of feeling just like a complete failure the more I learn about my mental health.

67,Dating app advice,"I recently came across a guy on a dating app whom I went on a couple dates with in 2015. (I'm very good with remembering faces!) At that time in my life, I was incredibly dysregulated and undiagnosed/untreated, and was using sex and substances as coping/connection.

Out of curiosity, I looked back at our texts. Apparently, we sexted A LOT and, also apparently, had sex once or twice. (I have very poor recall of this time.) We ended things after he stopped responding and I got prickly and confronted him. He apologized and told me I was ""amazing and beautiful,"" and that I deserve honesty. He said he gotten sick, and during that time he realized that he wants a relationship, which at the time I said I did not want. I got mad and texted something snide, and he did not respond. I totally get it. Again, dysregulation. 

Now in 2023, I am looking for a relationship. I'm medicated, in therapy, and actively working on getting my life together.  I remember liking him, and would be interested in seeing him again. 

Part of my BPD means that I get SO excited about someone, and then do Too Much. 

My question is, would it be weird if I texted him again, after 8 years, to say that I saw him on the app and would be down to reconnect if he is? Is that Too Much?

Constantly saying his going to leave me or that his cheating on me when he wasn't. Always taking up alot of his time etc. 
Being basically a bitch due to my own insecurities and trumua. 


I was also very loving but when I found out he still kept photos of his ex on his phone and had them on facebook I went crazy. I demanded he give me his phone in which he became mad because I accused him and he refused to give me his phone. Then I found out he still had a dating app downloaded because he told me he uses it to look at our old messages of when we first met. He then deleted it like I said and sent me screenshots of the deleted app. Because I continued to accouse him of cheating which in turn triggered him alot and he sent me articles saying his in a controlling relationship and refuses to give his phone over or show me because it's his right. Then sent me more articles saying why it's controlling behavior. I went over to his place to try and sort things out and he still would not let me see his phone so I smacked him twice. 

His now extremely defensive when he talks to me and he said he is to scared to meet with me to talk because of the assualt. He has been gaslighting and manipulative and super angry since all this. And I feel it's a response to trumua because I've obviously put him through alot. He is not the person I originally met at the moment. And that's completely understandable what he is probably going through right now. I have alot of sympathy for him after taking time to cool off. None of my behavior was ever okay. I should also be able to trust people without snooping and I should not be assulting anyone. I feel ashamed and I am going to be starting on a new medication because threapy is just not enough anymore for me. My trumua is beyond that now. I want to save this relationship I really do.

>I love you but I’m not in love with you. Because the person you met before was not me. Because in the moment I was completely out of it and the person you met was a crazy f****** b**** who was 20 something. Like I can remember everything we were saying. People switch (split?), I switched (split?) myself. When I don’t want to feel pain or whatever I run away and I start doing stupid shit. And that’s the reason I’m hiding and it’s coming out this other person. The therapist said it happened because of everything you went through in your life. 
My therapist told me, “Do you know that what are you doing right is not correct, it’s not you? That you’re just toxic right now and damaging that person.” And I think it’s the best, it’s much better because when she starts working on when I was abused, and it’s going to be very soon, believe me I don’t wanna go through that pain. I don’t want to be with nobody. I don’t wanna have a boyfriend that’s the problem you don’t understand. I don’t want a boyfriend. I don’t want a man touch me. I don’t want anything. I don’t want to future with a man. want to be alone. 
Because when I met you, I was escaping from my ex-boyfriend. and I was just escaping. that’s the reason you met the person. it wasn’t me because I was lost. I’m still lost but in the moment I was completely out of control without the correct medication. 

Some questions I have,

1. Is this common for a BPD episode or a manic episode?

2. Do borderlines ever want to reconcile with their healthy/supportive ex partners after going through medication, intensive DBT and CBT? Even if this is a matter of years into recovery? We are friends now, and my ex borderline is extremely sorry and feeling beyond guilty for hurting me. She cares about me **immensely** and is still extremely sweet to me. She does not want a relationship but does not want one in general. The mention of wanting to be with nobody, not wanting a husband, and a future alone sounds like borderline black-and-white thinking. 

Also she mentioned in the past while we were still together and her BPD was triggered,

>I am not able to have a relationship with you or nobody else because It **never** going to work 
out because of my condition.

It sounds like very dichotomous thinking that you’d
see with BPD.

This woman felt **destroyed** when she knew she hurt me and broke down crying to tell me she was sorry for pushing me away, that she just wants the best for me.

It helped me tremendously, It meant i wasn't crazy and the things I've always felt were legitimate and had an explanation. From there I started treatment with medication and therapy and DBT skills and my life got more balanced. 

So now I've been in a serious relationship for 3 years. We got married and had a baby and I'm currently pregnant. We both work from home and he is a very present father and husband, he is always with us. He is not secretive with his phone and gives me no reason to think he is cheating. 

However my BPD brain thinks something is happening. I downloaded an app yesterday for school (telegram) and saw he had an account and was last seen online last month. I freaked out and accused him of using it for cheating and he got extremely mad I and began to react saying he was making his bed and that this was the beginning of the end. I calmed down a bit and asked him to explain why he had downloaded it but he got defensive and said he doesn't need to justify himself. I began spiring, that hadn't happened to me in a while, this is the first relationship I have that I didn't cheat and we built a family so I feel super vulnerable.

I've been struggling with an undiagnosed chronic illness for 12 months. I had to give up my much loved job because of it, the thing that gave me my own identity.

I feel like the person I was has died.

And all my partner of 8 years can do is remind me the reasons why she resents me right now. Of all the reasons I'm the issue in our relationship. Of how frustrated she is that I'm not working. I get a disability allowance, I have for 15 years so I am contributing financially to this family. But it's not enough.

77,A ruined life,"Some updates based on the replies follow..


TL;DR After abandoning my BPD diagnosis I coped well, until I once again began thinking about it. Embracing my diagnosis and the medication led to ruin, and now I fear for my sanity and existence.

TRIGGER WARNING- abandonment,  suicidal ideation, stopping all medications 

I'm 53, Male from USA, diagnosed nearly 30 years ago. Early on there were 3 instances of institutionalization and many doctors and medications. I was classified as disabled and received SSA benefits for a few years then stopped that when my wife and I separated. She was tired of the rollercoaster. My very southern Christian family disowned me for years. 

I moved to China to experience a year of teaching there and never returned. 2 months in, I stopped taking all meds. I moved to a Chinese megalopolis and gradually built a company around art and collaboration and that led to a career in corporate training.   I married a woman from central China who became my partner and collaborator in work too.

For 7 years I coped without medication.  But things began to be too much, my emotions were overtaking me, and I sought help - medication- once again.  The psychiatrist gave me Similar stuff to years before. There were tears of joy in my wife's eyes- 'Honey you're not crazy! The doctor says its chemicals!'

She tried to understand. She tried to support me emotionally- but she's a very different person from a culture that deals with emotions differently. It wore her down. She became profoundly unhappy,  exploding at me with really hurtful words and behaviors. I continued to let myself be defined by BPD. She began to withdraw and ignore me- and ignoring me is a huge trigger. 

Our business became successful. I'd had a few run ins with the police in China, scary stuff. Sometimes it was my explosive emotions (I punched and dented the hood of a BMW for blocking the entrance to our home), then it was weed. My wife lived with embarrassment and fear. 

Opportunity appeared in Southeast Asia for us to spread our work. I was motivated and we planned to relocate to another country- I was excited and motivated,  she just followed as she felt a wife should, fearing further issues with embarrassment or police in China. 

She never felt comfortable and I was now the only friend she had. Living and working together took its toll. The doctors here changed my medication to what was available- Depakote. 

In March she'd had enough and announced she would leave me. She saw herself as a victim of my psychological abuse. She needed to discover herself.  She felt I should know better, behave better, make better choices; and stop blaming bpd. COVID stopped everything and she lived with me until August. In that time she still often behaved as my loving wife, even discovering the joy of playing Animal crossing as a couple. She called me honey, laogong, hugged me, told me she loved me. Income plummeted and our savings drained. 

After she left, she returned to our city in China.  She explicitly said to give her up, reminding me shes the victim. But she wanted to be collaborators still and she cared about me, she said. 

Communication has been hard. She would suddenly not answer any messages, and phone calls became hostile 

I've had to borrow money to survive. She's living with friends- others from our organization,  so my relationship with them is affected. 

I'm unable to move on. My confidence is shot, I dwell on suicide daily. I stopped the depakote very gradually because it was making me feel worse, and now I take no meds. I'm managing. 

Last week she called me and got emotional about something and shouted at me for 10 min straight. It fucked my head up so bad that it took me days to get my productivity back up. 

Yesterday she called again. We'd agreed t speak as though we are only separated physically,  geographically, to avoid discussing the real issues with others. Yesterday a mutual friend had said something that apparently she was offended and insulted by, that was about our separation. She stated that now she sees shes much too good for me and that I'm ruining my reputation by saying things about us to others. She won't tell me what was said or who said it but completely buys in that I said it.

I am still trying to survive,  eating instant noodles and getting fatter as I desperately scramble for income. I think about suicide constantly. I believe her when she says shes the victim and I'm the abuser. I don't know what's real anymore. 

I know COVID affected a lot but now I wish I'd never left China. I was happy with her... but knowing that for years she felt psychologically abused and depressed because of me... that's kept me awake most nights for a year now. I question reality, am I the abuser? The monster? Is bpd real? Maybe I'm just a shitty person and trying to rationalize my shittiness. 

I don't know what I expect from posting here but hopefully at least the posting itself will help.

UPDATES. 
°I have obtained a DBT workbook and a recommendation of a reasonably priced online counselor. 
°I'm applying for a TESOL certificate for backup English teaching, and a training company is launching a demo of my Empathic Leadership Communication executive coaching system. I have two solid clients now, I believe if I can add only 4 more clients I'll be comfortable. 
°since the borders here are still closed to outside tourists,  domestic tourism is very inexpensive. For <$175 I have booked 11 nights in an Island bungalow about 6 hours from the city. I am concerned about being alone here in the house during Christmas and NY so I will have a yoga/DBT retreat.  
°I still love her so much. I need to change for myself,  not another. But I want to be with her so much. 
°spoke to someone in our China team who is her roommate now in China. He's of the opinion she's also struggling but not in a place to hear me. I had to hide all photos of her and us, and still keep uncovering memories. 
°while I may have stopped the depakote (and things are ok without it) I still smoke marijuana to cope, and occasionally dip into my stash of prescription Ativan if it's too hard. 
°working on myself comes with many failures and it's hard to be motivated. Intermittent fasting,  shifting to a fish and plant based diet, trying to meditate (how the fk do you meditate when your brain won't stfu), add daily exercise,  track my sleep, daily journaling- and while all that's good it's also too much. 
°I'm really really afraid that if I have another interaction like that with her, I will hurt myself. I spent a half hour staring down from my 4th floor balcony trying to gauge if the impact would be fatal... conclusion: fatal or not such an instance would hurt others so I can't give anyone that burden.
°How do I let go of the love of my life?

I've had the healthiest year and despite all that, my doctor is convinced that I still need to be on meds because according to her I'm sick.

79,A question about bpd and favorite person,"I have a question about favorite persons, more specifically my therapist

So I have not been medically diagnosed with BPD but I have GAD, OCD, autism, and depression and all of which have made things very hard. 

Recently I’ve been struggling with some very complex emotions and mental struggle including obsessive thoughts about my therapist. How every it feels slightly different to ocd. I get these thoughts where I over analyze and find a problem with the things she does (wears, behaviors, etc.) it has caused me to feel like a horrible person. And no matter how much cognitive reframing I do it won’t stop. My brain won’t listen to any logic or rationale. I end up checking her Facebook and pretty much every other thing online of her multiple times a day. I feel as if I NEED to know more about her. Sometimes I just have this feeling like somethings off and I relate it to her. And over all it makes me feel like a creep and a horrible person. Especially since she is basically the sweetest person I know, and has helped me so much, and always been there for me

I though originally this may have been more tied to my OCD, but after doing some research I think I may need to ask my psychiatrist about bpd. I thought I would come to this sub and maybe seek some help. Does this sound like what a favorite person is like.

For the last year I’ve been doing much better than I was before hospital. I’ve landed my dream job and my career is going exactly how I’ve always wanted. I’ve moved forward tremendously with being able to sustain professional relationships which was a problem for me in the past. I also have had a close group of female friends for the first time in many years, for the last year or two. However that has imploded a few times, due to my interpersonal issues and those of another girl in the group also. Most recently (a few days ago) it imploded again due to my closest friend saying she’d been talking to a guy I had liked and asking if she could date him. I was intensely hurt and expressed that. I didn’t completely explode the way I have in the past but I most definitely expressed I felt very hurt and it resulted in a massive rift and her wanting space. I feel caught between validating my feelings and wanting to keep people around (which means denying my feelings, often). 
I keep seeing people post on fb “happy birthday to my best friend of 20 years” or similar and it makes me incredibly sad. I’ve had many close friendships but they’ve all crashed and burned.

86,"After having this med cocktail+not burdening myself, I am better. I was having a huge mental breakdown a year ago.","Forgive me if I have typo, I’m typing on my phone.

I was going crazy. Just crazy. I don’t even want to talk about it because it’s so shameful.
The breakdown was caused by lots of things, but major thing was school stress, alcohol, etc.

I got hospitalized again. 3rd time.
I was having a good calming 72 hours.
Later on I have realized I am an alcoholic. 

So I quit, I think at least 40% of my sanity comes from not drinking. I tried A.A in person and online plus networking, I personally didn’t like it.

Then my psychiatrist prescribed me Librium, I was on over than reg dose for anxiety -(reg dose that ppl take in google) 
I was being a zombie but I think it was worthy, I’m tired of laying down all day.

Since I was a zombie I decreased the dose, switched to klonopin since quantity is not available for some reasons in my area. 
I was on 1 mg, started SNRI -Pristiq. 
25mg once daily didn’t work.
50mg I felt difference after I started taking it for like more than 3 weeks.

As time goes on, I added weed (vaping and consuming medical weed) for tapering benzo+I like the effect. Makes me distracted when I am upset sometimes, when I need a calming time, morning time before my pharma med kicks in, before I go to bed.

I take only 0.25 of klpin twice daily.



So
-Antidepressant reg dose (everyone is different, Pristiq was my match)

-No alcohol (my emotional side gets crazy)

-Benzo(I don’t recommend it because of severe physical withdrawal, but it’s working well for my anxiety. Before I would be walking and looking back v often and thinking someone would attack me. I don’t have those thoughts unless someone gets super x2 close to me. 

-Medical mmj. Since I don’t like how potent flower smells it works. 
 I don’t recommend black market for vaping. Since I have been paying for my therapy out of pocket, I have 2sessions a month now. Used to have 3-4 sessions a month. 
Tbh now albeit I use about 3g of vaping mmj within in a month in a med mmj expensive City(half gram would cost me $65-75), I pay less for my mental health(it’s been 12 years, going to therapy, looking for right medication. I couldn’t handle dbt. I hated group sessions.)



I am far better than who I was exactly a year ago. I dropped out of school, I got a small job, talking to my parents, I don’t feel so miserable like before. I don’t want to kill myself for things that don’t matter. 

I feel like I am gifted. 
Even tho I have some struggles daily, ofc life is not a easy thing. My work place is stressful, min wage. But at least I can kill time with studying.
I’m just gonna get a certification.


I had 100,000 thoughts a day. Now I have 5000 thoughts and those are not suicidal.

87,Advice on shame/anxiety when plans go wrong/differently,"hey, I’m diagnosed with BPD with a family history of OCD and autism, so generally as a unit things not going according to plan can be very upsetting and frustrating. I was wondering if anyone has advice on how they worked to overcome this?


Example of what happened tonight leading me to reach out:
Because of my procrastination anxiety I didn’t start my homework until later in the day, that is my fault I’m usually better bout it; It was harder to focus today. I finally start, and only get 15 minutes in to what is planned to be an all nighter to prep for a Chem exam I have to make up. I’m already behind because of other mental health stuff and the prof was gracious enough to give me extensions. So, as I’m beginning chemistry after finishing English; the Wi-Fi goes out. I’ve reset it a few times and nothing; we are also currently having a really bad wind/rainstorm so I believe it’s an outside issue. It’s closed a road near me and has knocked power somewhere else. 


I’m proud with how I handled it tonight mostly,
I got really upset, and cursed quietly to myself out loud instead of raising a massive fuss. I’m not great with tech stuff and I’m also too short to see over the router, so I had to wake my brother up to ask him where the button was & how to flip it. He knows it finals for me so he was understanding, just sleepy. When i realized there was nothing I could do, I started to cry. I let myself cry as much as I could, with my own issues I tend to not cry much at a time, but a little is better than nothing. After that, I did something I usually don’t do in the past out of shame/fear; I emailed my professor. I let him know what was going on, and to let me know what he believes the best course of action should be first today. 
Since, I’ve been trying to take care of myself before bed. I’m bout to shower and I just smoked and took an edible.


 My problem is I’m still dealing with immense anger, shame, stress, anxiety, and fear over not getting to do my plan. I have whatever the “quiet” form of bpd is referred to, I forget the name; but I internalize things rather than externalize mostly. 
So I’m moving and functioning but inside I am heavily beating myself up over something currently out of my control, and for something I’ve already put myself accountable to.

My mom passed when I was 13 and I have since lived with my dad. He had been truly supportive after I got admitted and diagnosed. Recently I didn't get medication at our clinic and became depressed and sensitive. Because he has been my pillar, he has seen me in all kinds of vulnerabilities. So he knows how my mind works. I've recently been suspecting that he is gslighting me (that's if I am even understanding gaslighting well). Because I didn't get meds, I yelled at him once and told him I wish I was aborted and hope he kills me. I was wrong and later apologized to him. He has been hurt since and I believe he has withdrew all efforts of being supportive of my mental health. It hurt like hell for the first few weeks, then I got a grasp but now I feel like he is purposely trying to mess with my head.

93,Is it valid that I worry about my ex seeing other people?,"**TLDR; my ex left the door open for us to get back together while we both heal, but I can't cope with the possibility that he will meet other women and hook up with them. Is it valid for this to be a dealbreaker if we got back together, or would someone with a healthier attachment style be understanding of our status (broken up) and not hold it against him?**

I was in a relationship for 1.5 years, and we very recently broke up. This was mainly because of my uncontrolled BPD (which I am just now seeking intensive professional help for + medication) and his own struggles. I caused a lot of pain for the both of us.

Today I reached out, and he told me that he didn't want things between us to be permanently over, but that he sincerely needs time and space. However, I've been going crazy the rest of the day because what happens if we ever got back together? Last time this year we broke up and within a week he had hooked up with someone else. When we got back together he admitted he felt bad for doing so, but he never told me upfront that it happened --- I had to find out on my own and it caused me to be very suspicious of him and it hurt me for a long time.

The ""healthy"" part of my brain is telling me that we are exes. He has every right to meet women and make connections and hook up with people. I know I do too. But the ""unhealthy"" part of me knows that I would feel abandoned the second he did that, and I'm trying so hard to restrain myself from checking his IG followers to see if he's followed any new women recently. I did this last year and it ruined me. I would constantly shit on him and grill him on new followers when we got back together because it hurt me so bad. It's ripping me apart at the seams because I know that if we got back together and if I found out he hooked up with other people, I wouldn't be ok.

Are my feelings valid? Should I just totally let him go to save myself the trouble? Or is it healthier to accept his possible actions as perfectly valid if we got back together?

My psychiatrist in his infinite wisdom turned round and said I really need to learn to deal with these things on my own and discharged me!?

100,Cutting people off after healing,"Last year my partner and I broke up for many, many reasons, most of which stemmed from my untreated (at the time) BPD and his avoidant behavior and overall hyper independent nature. A classic combo. Our breakup broke me in many ways, but 2023 ended up being the best year of my life because I started going therapy every week, taking medication, learning how to be alone, and forming positive relationships in my life. I still struggle deeply with my BPD, but I've gotten better at identifying my emotions as they arise. This does not mean I have completely changed my behaviors or emotions themselves.

About a month ago, my ex and I reconnected. For some reasons, a relationship isn't feasible for us however the love and friendship is still there. He is still a solitary person and has his own mental health struggles that he hasn't really addressed. He hinted at us being in an ""open relationship,"" since when we are together now, we are loving and affectionate and to him I am the first person he wants to see. But because of our time constraints we both know that we can't fully devote ourselves to each other.

Very quickly into our reconnection, I've noticed that many of my old thought patterns, triggers, and behaviors have arisen. It honestly scares me; I've been really good this year when dating other people to mitigate toxic patterns and I've overall worked really hard to be different. At this point I don't know if it's just him who causes me this pain (because of our history, our love, and his avoidant tendencies) or if I am simply not healed. It is probably both. But he wants us to remain in each other's lives and honestly I do too. But there is a chasm of distance between us and it breaks me. And feeling shitty all the time has taken such a toll on me, because after our falling out last year I vowed to never feel this way again.

I feel sad at the idea of cutting him out completely but I honestly don't know how to feel okay with him in my life or if it is even worth it. I feel so conflicted and I wish I didn't feel anything.

Hi! I’ve been struggling with bpd for 3/4 years now and I have made a lot of progress. I’m on medication, a dbt program and last time i attempted was in june. Ive been feeling quite proud of my accomplishments.
A couple of days ago I went to see my therapist and we were talking about sh. Last time I did it was about a month ago, it was quite dramatic, needed stitches and I got very scared because I had never gone so deep. Since then I mad the decision to go off alcohol (which makes me super impulsive) and I am just so mad at sh that I swore to myself never doing it again. And I feel like this time I am really ditching the mentality. 
I told my therapist I am very ashamed of the big scar i have and wondering how I should deal with it. I showed it to her and she said it wasn’t that bad, that she had seen bigger and worse.
And I am aware I shouldn’t care for that remark she made, but ever since then I cant stop thinking about it. And picture myself doing it. Even though I was so determined to ditch this shitty habit forever, now it doesn’t leave my head and I think about it non stop. How I should just fill my arm with scars.

I was on 25mg, then 50 for a couple-few months but dropped back to 25mg as I don't think my body could handle it as I always felt sick. I was previously on sertraline which worsened my bpd mood swings but it also made me feel sick everyday so I don't know if medication is just a bit detrimental to me.

108,THERAPY SCAM ALERT!! BWRT (BrainWorking Recursive Therapy) - Terence Watts,"This is a super important post so pls don’t delete mods! I’m trying to get the word out about this so people in desperate help aren’t lied to. 

Terence Watts’s “BrainWorking Recursive Therapy” or, “BWRT” is a scam. This man is preying on vulnerable people by marketing this as a “full proof” solution to most mental health issues, without the (ACTUAL) evidence to back it up!!

Many have deleted their original opinions voicing their doubts, or are too afraid to speak up, due to the threat of legal action and/or harassment. Honestly, it’s giving MLM / pyramid scheme / scientology vibes. 

I was so amazed at first, and truly believed I’d finally stumbled across a great solution to my problems, until I pondered how it really DID sound too good to be true… so I looked around to see what others had been saying about it. 

The man has blocked me / deleted my comments on his Youtube videos, as he doesn’t want anyone to criticise his scheme and warn others. I wouldn’t be surprised if this post / my account got taken down too. So if I don’t respond or you don’t see this post anymore… well I guess you know why. 

Maybe some aspects of it can help for you as a byproduct… but I at least URGE everyone to apply critical thinking and do your own extensive research on it first before you come to any conclusions. 


Here are some links about BWRT to get you started:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ts8qya/does_anyone_have_experience_with_bwrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Watts gets his inspiration from [Benjamin Libet](https://www.bwrtuk.co.uk/bwrt/), whose theory about conscious and unconscious behaviour forms the basis of his theory. He talks about it a lot on his website and in his youtube videos. 


Also, I found some interesting posts about Charles Linden - another “expert” who displays similar behaviours of secrecy, denial and harassment to Terence Watts:

(FYI: I still need to do some more research on this myself, so I am not claiming to be an expert on this matter.)

EDIT: another very interesting link… [the Advertising Standards Agency says he breached the “UK code of non-broadcast advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.”](https://www.ns-healthcare.com/news/terence-watts/)

“The Terence Watts BWRT Institute was found guilty of claiming it could treat and/or diagnose several serious health problems including anxiety, infertility and diabetes without substantiating such claims.

In its findings, the ASA also concluded that an advertisement on the website discouraged people from seeking essential treatment and necessary medical supervision for conditions, including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and thyroid problems.

The Advertising Standards Agency told Terence Watts the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding it should not claim or imply that BWRT can be used to treat conditions without demonstrating sufficient evidence.

The ASA also said the website should not reference conditions for which medical supervision is necessary when addressing those seeking treatment in the future.”

109,Seeking advice or experiences on how to cope with a very painful break up 🤐,"TW: breakup, being cheated on

Hey!

Does anyone have any experience or recommendations on how to cope after a very painful relationship ending?

 How not to drown in self-hatred when I contributed to this painful outcome?

Also on how to not slide into the next toxic relationship right away? 

It's been over for nearly 3 months. 

And I'm just not coping well.

And I want him back even if I should realise that we are obviously not good for each other.

End here if that's too long :3

We had a lot of ups and downs, started as an unlucky affair in a polygam setting, ended up monogamous, which manifested a lot of mistrust and fear on my side throughout the relationship. Nevertheless, we were incredibly close and I have rarely felt so connected. 

I was in a really bad shape mentally due to depression and life circumstances, in therapy yes but it did not help that much and he wasn't fine either. I always pushed him away bc I felt not worth it, felt too dependent and pulled him in if our distance intensified and he gave too much into it, nearly gave himself up for me without setting healthy boundaries. Which we would have both needed. 

Of course he cheated on me trough online sex dates when we were at our lowest. And he immediately replaced me when he was inpatient himself with someone he seeked relationship advice from and never mentioned towards me, telling me we both need to work on ourselves and need time.

My main fear of people leaving because I am too much for them when I am at my worst is confirmed and it hurts so incredibly because it was the first time I loved someone so intensely and felt safe in some way. 

I think we had a very explosive relationship because it was mutual love but at one point also trauma bonding on both ends (both being emotionally dependent on each other, me being PwBPD and him being mainly anxiously attached) 

I try to move on, live my life, continuing therapy, find myself again, start to depend on myself, being and enduring being single for the first time in over 8 years without jumping from one to another relationship, hobbies, seeing people, discovering new things.

But still I feel broken and scared to death to get close to someone again bc all of this is so painful.

110,How do I fall in love with life again?,"TLDR: How do I approach recovery? Life doesn't excite me anymore. How do I fall in love with living again?

I am finally taking the jump to go all in on recovery. But I am not sure where to start. I have a therapist, I have DBT and BPD workbooks that I am working through. I have been a lot better at taking my medication, and I am being more honest with myself and those around me. But apart from that, I am not sure what else to do. 

Nothing is exciting anymore. I don't look forward to anything. When I wake up in the morning, unless I have some form of external commitment (appointment, meeting with friends, etc.), I have no problem staying in bed all day. 

I want to enjoy living. I want to get excited about being alive for another day. I want to be motivated to be better. I want to fall in love with living again. I know how precious life is, and I am so grateful for waking up each day and being able to live another day. But unless I am in a manic episode (bipolar 2 as well as BPD), I have 0 motivation to do anything, even the things I used to love. 

The advice I have so far is:

- plan things that I look forward to (I.e. date nights, holidays/vacations, etc). The problem here is that I am fresh out of uni (biomedical science) and have just started a new job, so i am broke and can't afford to make exciting plans. 

- romanticise my life - how do I actually do this in practice? 

- the Seinfeld method - possibly to track exercise? I'm thinking of a 10-minute walk each day?

- routine - starting small with one habit (I.e. morning or night routine) and adding onto it as I master each habit.

This gave me a relief as I thought me having BPD in the wrong gender made things worse (I know, that sounds stupid). I have never met a male with BPD myself, but I would like to ask these questions to the guys here. 

\- How do you deal with hiding your emotions in public/group settings when you get triggered? Men have stigma to show any extreme emotions after all, so I bet its more difficult than it is for women. 

\- Are you on any medication to treat BPD?

\- How do you deal with being alone for too long? Do you try to talk to absolutely anyone you can reach to avoid the feeling of being invisible? I know I do, it is very common for me to lose touch with reality and feel like Im vanishing from existence if I stay alone for more than a day.

114,What Support Groups Have You Found for BPD?,"It sucks to be alone! It also sucks to not be able to afford group therapy! Share your experiences with free support groups from whatever perspective of recovery.

I've been going to two, with a generally positive experience. My experience so far is that it's lovely to have a support group at all; that's about 80% of the benefit. The details of the remaining 20% vary.

1) Emotions Anonymous is a recovery group modified from traditional 12 Step recovery programs like AA or NA. I've been going about once a week for about a year, now. The only requirement to join is a ""desire to become better emotionally."" It's very diagnosis-agnostic, so there are a diversity of psychological geogrpahy. Most of the people I meet there are bipolar, BPD, or suffering from PTSD, with a couple of DID cases. Meetings are supposed to be safe sharing spaces, meaning no unasked advice or commentary on others sharing. I'd say the major benefit other than a sharing space is the anonymity. The structure of the 12 steps might help some people and might frustrate others. The major con, to me, is the higher power stuff. 

https://emotionsanonymous.org/

2) The Icarus Project is a mutual-aid network and support system for people dealing with Mental Health Challenges that normally get called mental illness. I've attended about three meetings in my lifetime. Groups are organized autonomously and non-heriarchically, and groups provide a variety of functions. It is implicitly anarchist, and as such a lot of the literature it offers links mental health policy to repressive political apparati like the prison system. The major thing I like about Icarus is that it is harm reductive and self determinative regarding diagnosis, medication, and treatment options. The hardest part of making the groups happen is that it's hard to get political activists interested in mental health and it's hard to get emotionally debilitated people interested into politics. 

https://theicarusproject.net/

Oh, and Icarus has tons and tons of really good resources though, including a 1 page handout of crisis advice and space to write an advance directive. I highly recommend that anyone with BPD fill out a 1 page sheet on your needs during a crisis rather than let random medical professionals guess at your needs and preferences.

I've moved three times to try to reboot myself. But it's the same pain every day and it occupies my mind most of the day. I don't know how anyone cries this much. 

2 good friends who know of my diagnosis try to be encouraging. They push me saying things are better, don't think about it, focus on other things. Fellow pwBPD who I respect are understanding and (like my friends) tell me I'm not alone. All these people live in other countries. 

I am alone. I live alone in a small town in a country not my own where I don't speak the language. When these well meaning folks say helpful things; they will shortly put down their phone and live their own lives. 

I don't have and can't afford insurance. Because I'm American, insurance is more expensive for me than any other nationality; and therapists and psychiatrists who are from the English speaking world are exorbitantly expensive.  I no longer take medication because I had to make the choice between rent/food and the hit-or-miss prescription-happy behavior of the medical school psychiatrists I could once afford. 

I want to end my life. I'm told things will get better but they haven't for over 8 months and I see no relief ahead. I'm over 50, I had a great life for several years with her, so I've gotten more than many people do. Now my life is just crying, having the same sad conversations with the same 5 people who must be sick and tired of my same song over and over. 

I want to end my life and this pain.  I'm not allowed to talk about this and neither are you. Forums like this require trigger warnings, reddit has ONE subreddit called 'suicidewatch' which basically represents the entire fucking world's programmed reaction to anyone voicing any thoughts of suicide- stop listening, get that person safe at all costs. Great intentions; but for a person like me it means people share hotlines or videos or articles then go back to their day and forget it all. 

There's only one reason I don't just end my life- the mess that leaves behind. Someone (likely someones who have no idea of my actual situation) would have to deal with my body, the cleanup, Communication with authorities and those few who care about me- and the trauma they would endure. 

But every day it gets harder and harder. Reading books like REASONS TO STAY ALIVE or the hokey elementary condescension of DBT workbooks turn me off and make it worse.  

There's a growing open minded conversation regarding self euthanasia and 'right to die,' but these are centered around people with cancer, terminal physiological illnesses, chronic pain, etc. But hey not me, not pwBPD, we can chin up and buck up and think of other things because our pain is not only less valid- to many it's not even real!! 

I don't know what I want from this post. All I know is I'm focusing a lot of energy on researching painless, inexpensive, and low impact suicide methods. I even looked into ways that would leave no mess, no body- for all intents and purposes I'd just have 'disappeared.' 

And we all know the truth- a few people would be hurt by my disappearance but not many and not for long, because they're loved by people who are physically present. They'll move on and I'll be just a memory. I don't really matter that much. 

My ex is not a good person, I've come to learn; or has drastically changed. Yet I still make sure enough of my income is routed to a bank in her city under her name so she can be ok. I love her still and I know I'd she wanted to be together again I'd crumble and submit to anything she asked. Even though that's a fantasy I know it wouldn't work out. 

But if I died- lets say in a true accident- there's loads of benefits for her and others. She'd inherit our small company and my reputation, I'd become a mascot for our company and organization, she would get the support and sympathy of a widow and be truly free of me so she can be with her new someone freely, and my close friends wouldn't have to bear my daily sadness-by-text. 

I'm so tired. The idea of this as my future is not something I can face anymore. I see no brightness ahead- the only thing I see for sure is another 6-8 months of this life and I do not see any light at the end of that tunnel. 

I once had a life I thought I was dissatisfied with. But now I see it was ambition and drive for more that blinded me to the happiness i had before me. 

I have moments when I think ok, I feel a bit stable- but so far these periods of time are never longer than a few hours. 

Today I won't try to take my life. But it's harder every day and suicide is tempting. 

I hope society can normalize talking about death, suicide, and mental/emotional challenges without judgment (and knee jerk reactions of medication, institutionalization etc ARE judgmental).  Maybe if there was a way to openly discuss these feelings without fear of being treated like that, and without fear of the conversation hurting others who suffer, then maybe people like me could find some answer. 

I think that answer is normalizing suicide. A structure that provides non judgmental realistic exploration of the potential reasons to die or not die; allowing the suicidal person the opportunity to make a truly informed choice. 

I know I'm posting this in reddit. I know there are no safe subreddits. I'm preparing myself for the trolls... or maybe I'm hoping their cruelty will motivate me to stop being a fucking coward and just end it. 

I wish I didn't feel this way and instead could offer genuine support to others suffering here. Instead I'm just taking up too much space- look at how much I've written now already, demanding attention. I'm disgusted with myself. 

I guess that's my rant. If you read this far thank you, and I'm sorry if it was hurtful or unpleasant in any way.",1615514627.0,False,27,11,IraJohnson,None,m36wo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/m36wo2/tw_suicidal_thoughts/
116,My partner splits very easily and becomes enraged," We both suffer a condition called borderline personality disorder.  However, the difference between me and him is I have had years of threapy  and balanced medication. I now talk very calmly and my emotions are very level. I never yell, cuss, or insult. I'm very calm. Sometimes to calm for my own good. But when he splits...he splits very quickly. Its rage when triggered. He will yell and blame me for things that are not my fault when he ""splits"". But otherwise he is a great partner.. Today we had a argument. I let him have a hour or two space and then came to talk to him.. he started disrespecting me and getting very mad again and treating me badly. He said he was being triggered by me and needed more time. I should have just walked away, but i didn't. I stayed and calmly tried to explain myself while he was yelling over me and blaming me. He then got up and pushed the door closed while I was behind and still talking to him while it was half open. He did it so fast and hard on me that it bumped my head and now I have a lump on it. I told him off for it. But since he was already triggered, he just lost it completely and said it is my fault and then slammed the front door and said it was over. I haven't seen him since. He said not to contact him. I told him not to come back until he goes to the mental health ward in the hospital and talk things through with them. I told him I don't feel comfortable with him coming back until then. He  replied a few hours later saying his at the hospital.  He just started seeing a therapist too, to help him with his anger. But I also understand that he has poor impulse control of his emotions and I should have walked away when he told me to. Though this doesn't excuse his behavior. None of it does. I just don't know what to do. His had a really bad childhood and his last relationship was really abusive too, so he often gets triggered. But he wants to change. And knows it's a problem when he is clear headed and not feeling mad or fustrated.  He is also withdrawaling off weed which his been smoking for years and years. I don't know who's at wrong here or if it's both of us to some degree. I should have walked away when he said he needed the space. And he shouldn't have done it regardless. It's not black and white. Sometimes relationships are much more complex and shades of grey then most are quick to assume. Do you think this is something we can overcome with continued threapy and hard work ? So far we have been together over a year and we are very determined. We have gone through everything together.

117,New to BPD,"Hey loves, 


I was diagnosed with BPD fairly recently. I’ve been dealing with rocky mental health for about 10+ years. I was always told it was just depression and anxiety. I was taking regular medication and while it took the edge off my symptoms they didn’t ever go away. So I went back to my GP to get some more help. I saw a specialist and was immediately diagnosed with BPD (albeit “high functioning- not sure what that means). I’ve been trying to do my own research to better understand this, but I’m not sure where to go. Everywhere seems full of symptoms and how to get help and not how to live with it or manage symptoms. 

Are there any online resources available? Any helpful information you’ve found out? Good coping strategies etc 

I’m on a waitlist to talk to someone but given current global events and all the other people who need mental health services at the moment it’s probably going to be a while before I can see someone regularly and I’d like to start doing/ learning things to better cope in the mean time",1614462441.0,False,3,3,peony27,None,lty49p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/lty49p/new_to_bpd/

(long post, sry)","so i’ve been doing really well with my bpd ever since i started taking my medication regularly. but lately, ever since i’ve started talking to someone romantically, i’ve been extremely explosive and angry. not towards them, because they are very attentive to my triggers and understanding of them. i’m finding that almost daily, i have to stop talking to them for hours because i can’t calm myself down from something small they did. for example, when we’re talking and they’re playing video games (a simple game that doesn’t require their full attention), it sets me off. i get really short with them and eventually realize i’m unable to have a conversation with them without lashing out or completely withdrawing altogether. or when they’re unable to check their phone and don’t tell me, things that are just really controlling and i know are wrong but i just can’t help it. i try to distract myself with activity, but it’s hard when i get triggered late at night and end up having to go to sleep angry and have dramatized nightmares about it. i’ve tried coloring, writing, everything, and i’m much better at not lashing out and being able to talk about it later. but i can’t talk about certain things because he knows how much i struggle and will feel at fault for something that’s completely normal. it’s not his responsibility to walk on eggshells around me. i’m self-aware enough to not let it affect US, but i’m fucking miserable every time this happens because i love spending time with him but i can’t when i’m upset or else it’ll get explosive and toxic. i’ve tried the facts over feelings dbt wise mind shit and it only works sometimes. does anyone who struggles with this have any advice on how to stop being triggered by these things??? i know it’s a process but my whole life i’ve felt this way and i’m just tired of feeling like he’s my opponent, instead of my partner.",1652329895.0,False,5,13,glutenfreepusssy,None,unsscb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/unsscb/getting_triggered_over_extremely_trivial_things/
119,Recovery is possible and I might have done it,"Hi!

I hope all of you are having a good day. I'm just checking in to tell you that during our last appointment, my therapist of 3 years told me that she thinks I no longer meet the criteria for BPD and am what she calls ""a therapeutic success"". We went over how I got there over the course of my treatment and how some things will stay–""borderline traits"" that are part of my personality but no longer a handicap to my day-to-day life; and dissociative episodes that are now few and far between but not entirely gone. I know that setbacks are possible and even likely, but it does not scare me nearly as much as it used to! I have grown more confident in my skills and myself as a person despite previous therapists and medical professionals telling me there was no hope for me.

I wanted to share this feel-good news because I know that ""recovering"" from a personality disorder is so often seen as impossible that it really feels like there's no point in trying to get better. But there is!! I will be borderline my whole life but it doesn't have to be pathologic forever. I want to tell you that it does happen, changing is possible and work pays off. There's no way I could have imagined this just a couple years ago. You deserve care and your life is worth living, in and of itself, but also because it can and will get better. I also wanna thank this sub because you guys have been a really positive influence during my treatment and I hope this post contributes to give back a little.

120,i want to change myself for the better but i don’t know where to start,"i am a 16 yr old girl who feels like i am pretty self aware especially for my age and the problems i have, i have noticed that i really am not that good of a person. i was diagnosed with bpd at 15 and after i got diagnosed and learned more about the way i am or the way i may act i saw this as a perfect excuse to be as horrible as i want to the people i love because now i have a “problem” that can never be fixed or cured until the day i die. i have done so many disgusting and damaging things to people for no reason, i don’t know if it was my bpd is causing me to act like this or if it is my corrupt brain telling myself i can never be held accountable for my actions because it is “unfix able”. i have caused my own parents to be afraid of me my friends to become distant and uninterested with me as i have told them “i can never change”. i am sick of having this mindset and ruining every relationship just so i can sit back and laugh at how stupid these people have to be to believe my actions are untreatable. yes maybe there will never be a cure or a pill i can take to take this pain away that i will go through for the rest of my life but that doesn’t mean i can’t become even more self aware and be able to control my outbursts and mania. when i become manic i feel amazing but the people around me don’t, i act self centred and entitled i get so clingy and tbh really annoying. and when i don’t feel so great i believe everyone around me would be so much better off without me or i feel so overwhelming guilty about the things i have done or said i can’t even think about it without genuinely throwing up. but i have to still seem powerful and strong so i don’t apologize or even do so little as think about what i could say to mend friendships. i believe no matter how im feeling i will always be a narcissist and think i am deserving of something higher, better, bigger than these people i apparently “love”. sometimes i dont even think i know the real me or my own personally or my interests and sometimes i think i am the most self aware person on the planet. being a teenage girl dealing with such a big issue and problem is torture. no one understands me or can relate to what i go through its so hard being face to face with the person who birthed you and them not know you anymore. i have been trying for the past few weeks to take baby steps in the right direction i am taking my medication and seeing someone. i am truly going to try this time. i hate myself and everyone around me does too, i want to build impossible to break relationships with people but my brain won’t let me because i get jealous of anyone who’s prettier than me or looks like they have a better life than me or even just random people my friends talk to, seeing my friends even just laughing with another person makes me want to die. i am toxic. i shouldn’t “claim” my friends like this. why does my brain make me think so little of myself but then think so incredibly high of myself. i need serious professional help and im promising myself this is the last time im trying to better myself before i end it because if this try doesn’t work, it’s hopeless and i have no purpose if all i do on this planet is make people despise me.

121,Social anxiety tips?,"Hi, I have struggled with BPD for most of my life. I have also had interlinked difficulties with intense social anxiety/general anxiety. At points it is extremely difficult to leave my house or talk to anyone at all, other than my partner who I live with. 

Recently my social anxiety has become really bad again, partly because of spending way less time outside (pandemic/lockdown etc), and partly cuz of other factors. 

I can't take the bus anymore without having sudden intense panic attacks. I also have to talk to people on the phone for my work, and have had difficulties with that. Yesterday I had to reschedule a call because I just couldn't overcome my anxiety enough to get on the phone. 

What are your tips for overcoming this anxiety? It makes me feel really awful about myself and it's making my everyday life very difficult.

I don't like therapy at all because of this social anxiety, I always feel so uncomfortable in front of a therapist. I'm already on medication (cymbalta), and I don't think I can take benzos (I'm a drug addict).

Edit: tried to take a long trip outside today, transferred buses, was in public for a while, etc. All went great! Then an aggressive, leery dude mumbled to me about my genitals and followed me swiftly for many blocks. I was terrified he was going to attack me because that was his vibe, and it's happened to me before where some random guy tried to murder me out of nowhere.

However, I don't actually feel like this is changing anything. If anything, the last week or so I've been worse. When people say they've spent time ""working on myself"", I don't really understand what they've been doing that is showing real improvements, if that makes sense?

123,Passed the Bar Exam Today,"At the risk of seeming egotistical, I (29M) wanted to post this for anybody really going through it as proof that you can do that thing people say you can’t do because you’re borderline.

I’ve had a lifelong struggle with what I know now to be Borderline Personality Disorder. In highschool, I was bullied so aggressively I had multiple near death experiences and my family’s home was repeatedly vandalized. My dad was repeatedly battling advanced stage cancer and I had to take care of my brother through the end of highschool while struggling with what I know to be CPTSD now. I was (mistakenly) diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety when I was 18 and told I would need to live a low-stress, safe, low pressure lifestyle. I hated this. 

For years, through college I struggled with both being over-medicated while also being inadequately helped. I hungout with dangerous, aggressive people through college because that level of dysfunction felt normal. I graduated college with a double major, but struggled to function well in the workplace. Bad relationships with toxic people was all I knew.

I spent 5 years in a majorly abusive relationship with a toxic narcissist that resulted in multiple hospital trips for stitches and broken glass removal. When that ended, I was a law student and the stress of the breakup led to lots of psychiatric problems, the vast majority of my friends abandoning me, isolation, suicide attempts, and self harm. I had to drop out of law school twice. My CPTSD and providers’ mismanagement of meds was so extreme that I lost the ability to read for almost 18 months. But I graduated.

I wasn’t even able to take the bar exam when I wanted to- my law school made me join a disciplinary program designed for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems because of my mental health problems through law school due to the extreme stigma against mental illness in law. I had to delay taking the bar exam after graduating because my mental illness was regarded as “a danger to the public.” Joining that punitive program was the only way to convince my state licensure board I could be trusted.

Finally, I was diagnosed BPD and started to get better through DBT. DBT saved my life. I gained the skills to put myself back together. Today I have an amazing girlfriend, a nice small house, rescue pitbull, new friends (through my girlfriend) and a couple old friends that stood by me, and now a new career in law as an attorney in a mid size American city as of finding out I passed the bar just this morning. 

Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn’t a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it’s an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don’t deserve it. Do that thing everybody says you can’t do and tell anyone who tries to stop you to eat shit.

His honestly the first person in my life who has cared for me so deeply and takes care of me immensely. He puts up with all my psyical and mental problems and we always are able to communicate and problem solve. Like the other day I fainted due to a medical condition I have and he carried me back to my car and stayed with me the intire time to make sure I was okay and then layed me in bed and ordered foods.

I see no other solution but ending the relationship to find a partner who doesn't have the same history with me bc my partner seems incapable of seeing me as I really am now, and just sees what he expects to see - which feels like, no matter what I'm upset about, it must be splitting or attachment issues and couldn't possibly be valid. That's the message I get, and I don't know how to have a healthy relationship with someone who believes this. Not to mention it makes me much less likely to catch when I am making assumptions or have an unnecessarily negative read of a situation because I'm distracted by pain and frustration of his Invalidation as a default position.

127,Seeking diagnosis,"Hi, 37F, just coming here to vent.
Currently seeing a psychologist and seeking diagnosis for BPD or cPTSD alongside my current social anxiety/phobia...

Fighting a constant hate and exhaustion of living.
Trying to take control.
Trying to stop self medicating with alcohol and food.

My behavior has been getting more extreme to the point where I am embarrassed and ashamed and my marriage of 6 years is a mess.
Alcoholism, self harm, suicide attempts, plain desperation.
Emotionally abusing as well as physical retaliation to my partner.
Wishing I could just be gone, not exist.
Not inflict myself on others.
Feeling outside of myself and my life or feeling it too much.
Dissociation constantly.

I want to come out the other side of this and find ways to cope and deal with my day to day life as well as strengthen rather than lose my marriage.

But at the moment despite seeking help and admitting my problems I find myself constantly in a destructive cycle.

Every time I 'genuinely' take steps in the right direction and want to change, days later I am at the other extreme.
Constant anger, mood swings, idealisation followed by self loathing and seeing the worst in myself and my partner.

Worse than that is the emptiness.
When I should be happy...
Lacking certain things I feel and it hurts.
When those needs are met... nothing.
It is hollow.

I didn't expect my life to be like this at this age.
Hoping to heal, and learn to help myself without hurting myself and those around me.

Hoping a diagnosis gives me solutions to help my current problems and struggles.

If you have read this far, thank you.

Here is to finding a way to thrive.
Here is to beating what life has thrown at us.

128,Trying to recover while in a new relationship,"Hey everybody ! I have recently been on the journey to start recovery right now after going through a really rough and challenging time after starting a new medication that brought out the worst parts of myself and a new relationship that i realized heightens my bpd symptoms (even just having the context of being in a relationship had me triggered). I want to further my growth as much as possible so I want to make sure I work towards my growth instead of against it. So I share this in hopes of getting feedback or really any response! I want to know what other ppl think from an objective POV ! This is a long post so be prepared for that ! 

I am currently tapering off this medication and working through dbt workbooks and in the process of getting started at an outpatient dbt program ! We both have mental illness and they have gotten treatment/ are going to therapy and taking meds however unfortunately things started turning toxic unknowingly and there was a dynamic created where I started burdening my partner and they felt like they always had to be there for me even if they didn’t have the capacity to otherwise in their mind who else would and over time started revolving their whole life around me (even isolating themselves from others just to b around me and try to be there for me in crisis). They took me expressing some of my intrusive thoughts and fear of abandonment to heart and made themselves suffer to make me feel “better” or not to abandon or leave me.

 I would word vomit and over share a lot of things I definitely should’ve kept to myself but that I never knew was making them feel like this. Our communication was off because they thought it would make me feel even worse and I would in turn internalize any feedback or criticism and also sometimes they didn’t even know how they felt never mind to then tell me. We got into a habit of them reassuring me no matter what and a routine of seeing each other all the time. After a major meltdown from me and a long day of work, we got to the point where we both got triggered and had an emotional night which lead me to initiate conversation about the issues that are there. 

As we uncovered more, it was disturbing to see how something that we both thought was going pretty well to see how actually unhealthy our start was.  

We have granted each other space as we definitely need to think, reflect and let ourselves read the situation/our feelings more. Last night, we talked about it and took accountability and shared feelings that were scary to say and admit but were needed to be said. We decided instead of breaking up we both are going to put forth the effort and time and patience to try and care for ourselves more and in turn make it so that we rebuild and unlearn all the misconceptions that we had in our relationship by creating and actively writing down different solutions to our issues and putting in a plan to how to achieve it to give us another go but I wonder if even this is a way of being toxic. 

My worst nightmare of burdening someone else’s mental state bc of me came true and while it was on them for the lack and dishonest sense of communication within themselves and with me I just don’t want to make more toxic decisions and hurt us both in the end :,( 

Any feedback would be appreciated and I guess if anyone relates to this it would be nice to know I’m not alone in this position. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed that I let myself get to the point where I was hindering the growth of my partner and weighing their life down but I’m trying to accept that there’s nothing I can do about the past and just to take accountability and change however if anyone has suggestions on how not to feel so guilty/bad/ashamed please lmk !!",1625235134.0,False,6,4,lotus-pea,None,ocawyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ocawyx/trying_to_recover_while_in_a_new_relationship/
129,Relationship dilemma,"BPD, CPTSD, Bipolar 2

Sorry for this long rant, trying to make sense of my broken life and needed to share with others who might be more understanding about what I’m going through, with my mental illness.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I’m afraid I’m too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I’d he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me….. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can’t and won’t get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",1688449467.0,False,1,0,Old-Meet-1322,None,14q68cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14q68cv/relationship_dilemma/
130,(BPD) Does anyone else REALLY intensely struggle internally with being alone having bpd?,"(There is 1 use of the F bomb in here and I do apologize I’m just trying to get the point across.) Hi guys i am a 24 year old woman who was Diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and a few others in 2018 I never use my disorders as a crutch or an excuse but I enlighten the people around me about the disorders to help them better understand ME. I use to be on many medications but about a year ago I stopped all mental health meds because I felt they weren’t working right for me but just the last two years I have found it EXTREMELY hard to almost be by myself without the in person company of my “favorite person”…text drives me crazy because it’s so slow and the texts are usually short and boring and they won’t ever call me because they are shy behind the phone. as toxic as this may sound I will open up in hopes of someone out there finding relatability in this or someone that may give me advice on how to help myself. I have been recommended DBT but just with my insane schedule already and not having a car or license, being a full time stay at home mom at my parents with a 3 month old baby, baby sitting my siblings everyday, and occasionally my niece and nephew, therapy, and helping take care of my grandma. I just haven’t found a way around to it yet. I’m not making any excuses by no means my mom is the one that takes me to all of my therapist and psychiatrist appointments and her schedule is insane with work, taking care of my grandma (her mom) being a mom to 6 kids (myself included) and many other things herself. I would LOVE the help of a DBT therapist but right now I can’t fit that into my already hectic schedule. But when my S/O can’t come see me or wants to stay at home it’s like my mind inadvertently takes it as a threat almost, like punishment. In my mind I know they know how much I love and crave to be with them but there’s a part of me that actually truly understands and respects that they need time to themselves also. The world can’t revolve around ME. but the other part of me when I find out they aren’t going to be with me that night or for a few days shatters me me. Its like this never ending game of tug of war that never ends. It’s like a heavy blow to the chest and gut that leaves me in tears and angry and frantic. Cussing at myself, hyperventilating My heart races and I think all sorts of scenarios. I will admit that I do have trust issues due to past experiences with this person so that at times can intensify that thinking also into who are they texting? What are they really doing? Are they on a phone call with someone else? Do they have someone secretly over and are they ignoring me? I’m not thinking or feeling this way INTENTIONALLY I want you guys to try to understand that as best as you can is all that I ask. I understand if some of you just can’t agree with this or see how I could think or feel this way. That’s okay I accept that and am willing to put myself out here in need of guidance. But it’s the way that I can’t help but end up JUST FEELING. I love this person with every ounce of my heart that I have with every breath that I take. I do NOT want to be like this or continue to be like this. Can anyone give me any pointers? Distractions only help for so long until it just immediately comes on again sometimes more intensified than before. I understand that with BPD it is characterized with abandonment issues. And it’s not even the whole trust issue thing that always makes me feel this way so much as it is the whole hearted pain of them not being beside me and me being alone. In my head it just doesn’t even feel like abandonment issues really it feels more like I just understand what I’m feeling and I want to fix it NOW. To some, including myself. MY way of thinking is and can be considered “selfish” not all people with BPD is like THIS. So please I do encourage you to try be understanding to others with this disorder it’s a fucking nightmare that we never asked for But I also ask please try to understand that it’s not to gain “control” or to “manipulate” this person with the way I feel and act. I am in absolute love with this person and I’ve been with them since 2016 I just can’t control all of my emotions and thought process and hurt when it’s “so much so quickly at one time” the emotions and feelings just flood in when I can’t be with them, and it’s a somber feeling that words could never describe. I’m sorry for the paragraph and for any possible typos. I just wanted to see if someone else experiences it in a way sort of like mine or has any pointers on what I can do this to help control myself during the time being until I can get DBT.

131,Lamotrigine for BPD?,"Hey, so I started for the first time medication a little over a year ago (relearn/mirtizipine) and I was noticing at first it worked and made me gain a lot of weight which I didn’t mind cause I’m 5’8 and was 122-139 fluctuating. Sticks and bones. And the weight gain made me gain good weight; got a butt etc got thick lol. I looked good w the weight gain.

But it started giving me suicidal thoughts and my typical 2 week depression that I’d experience here and there put me in a 6-9 month depression that I couldn’t beat. Getting off the meds I felt better for 2 months and still feel better but I’m noticing I’m developing instead of depression, rage and anger problems. Like 0-100 anger problems and I also can’t take minor inconvenience. Like a dr appt being rescheduled makes me feel angry, I feel impatient and I can’t go to work or focus at work and I’m afraid I’ll push my boyfriend away again. (I understand ppl need to protect their peace BPD IS DRAINING) so I have to do my part to ensure I’m ensuring a good environment for not only myself but my kid and the ones who support me. My dr recommended lamotrigine and it seems scary certainly when I’m just tryna stabilize my mood fr, and mute my emotions. I have goals to uphold and I quit jobs easily but can’t this time. I realized I called off work twice (I’m still in my 90 days) and didn’t care to lose my job… which is an effect of my unstablized mood, the inability to think about the cause an effects of decisions I make when I’m angry. Who I snap out on, and I’m tryna avoid an episode from happening cause I can feel it. Is this medicine doing too much? I’m not tryna make things worse as I’ve been doing pretty ok minus the 6-9 month depression and the newly developed anger problems. What’s your thoughts??? I know ppl say DBT but I can’t afford that and those resources aren’t that available I also have a BPD work book that helps but I can’t focus AT ALL enough to even read or follow my music/go outside crisis plan.

132,Perceived vs real betrayal/abandonment - advice for me and my SO please 🙏 (tweet for reference),"TLDR; with reference to this Tweet that I showed my bf, he asked when I am triggered and experience this, how can he deal it in the best way possible to avoid as much conflict possible? I honestly don't know the answer to this so would appreciate some advice please.

More context: I (29F) showed my boyfriend (33M) of 4 years this Tweet as it applies to me and I try to educate him about my trauma and how it affects me and how my brain operates so he can understand me better. We are trying to work through and improve our relationship which is heavily affected by my BPD and mental health issues. Sometimes he will do or say things that trigger me to feel/think he is betraying or abandoning me and my brain fully convinces me that this is the case (and I never know if it is real or imagined), I guess subconsciously to protect myself from getting hurt which inevitably does the opposite and leads us to break into massive blowout fights, which ruin all of our progress up to that point, even when things have been going super well for a while and then before I know it we're suddenly on the brink of splitting up and he starts questioning if there is any hope for our future at all. All because of my fucking triggers, disassociations, neurosis when my mind perceives the threat of betrayal or abandonment.

He always claims he is not doing what I think he is and I have no way of knowing if he is telling the truth or lying. For me trust doesn't even matter at this point because after experiencing so many REAL betrayals and abandonments from people close to me who I never would have ever expected to do so, my brain is so hypervigilant and on alert to suspect anyone could do that to me, it doesn't matter who they are anymore. Nobody is safe, no one can be trusted. Whenever I let my guard down and allow myself to trust and be vulnerable, people take advantage of it and then stab me in the back. The pain that occurs inside of me is gut wrenching and makes me withdraw and feel suspicious of people even more.

I am nothing like the person I used to be. I used to be a social butterfly and musician, I could not go a week without seeing friends, going to gigs and performing and ocializing, but since I've been so ill and debilitated the past few years as well as other factors, I've become an empty shell of who I used to be, severely isolated and living a hermit lifestyle. I have not seen any friends in 4 months, back in active addiction, anxiety, depression, BPD at its worst. This is my rock bottom.

I have a plethora of personal and family crises going on constantly piling up (the list just never ends, my whole adult life has been in survival mode), causing me so much inner turmoil, pain, grief, distress, depression, anxiety. I have become disabled by my multiple incurable chronic illnesses, my social life has become non existent, I fucking dread waking upon every next day miserably existing and nightmares at night. It's unbearable to be awake and be not awake. There's no escape, no peace, no way out. My illnesses have stolen my life away and everything I ever enjoyed and loved doing. I have lost all purpose in life, my sense of identity, motivation and any hope of ever being happy. I'm constantly overwhelmed, started self harming for the first time in my life, relapsed on drugs a few months ago (landed me up in the ER one night in Dec) and I'm admitting myself into a mental health clinic for 3 weeks on Thursday before I finish my degree online (there is no way I can study like this so it has to be before). 

I am in therapy, medicated (although I need to adjust/change my meds), but we just had our end of year summer holidays and my psychologist was away for a month, my psychiatrist has become absolutely useless and unreliable and has ignored me since mid December and other times last year when I needed his help (actual abandonment). I've been seeing my psychiatrist since 2020 and he has let me down so badly and become impossible to get hold of, I genuinely don't think this man has any interest in helping me anymore and may have to find another one, starting new after 4 years will be so fucking exhausting.",1707169567.0,False,6,0,tabasco_kat,None,1ajskqw,https://i.redd.it/lyqzryvl7ugc1.jpeg
133,Rant/BSsadstuff,"So
Sorry this is my first post and I’m sorry but holy crap I need to get this off my chest
And trigger warning: S/H and sewerslide mentioned

I’m not sure where to start. I (23F) have dated this guy we shall call Renegade (25M)
He and I met around 3 years ago. We were both single parents and freshly out of a horrible marriage and engagement. When we first dated things were awkward. His ex wife still lived with him and she hated my guts. Used her limited knowledge of my past against me (her go to ammo was the fact I had my daughter under surveillance for accused child neglect by DSS (side note that shit got thrown out the window and I got her back once the investigation was over and the accusations against me were deemed as false) and she would even go as low as the issues with my mental health despite the fact she had “self diagnosed” herself with the same disabilities that I have) 
Freaky right?
Anyway ex wife threatened to take Ren’s daughter away if I wasn’t immediately thrown out of the picture so I was stuck in a game of “how can I get rid of my new girlfriend without getting rid of her?” Until the game got too old to play for ren and he ditched me. 
After not hearing from ren in almost 2 years he reached out to me. Told me he finally moved out of his ex wife’s house and had split custody. For a few weeks I was hesitant on being involved with him again. I even mentioned the fact I can’t trust him because of the abandonment and the drama. But spoiler alert I eventually had no choice but to move in with him and restart our relationship. 
Weeks go by and things are decent. He helped me get back onto my feet financially however the issues still remained and even got worse with my mental health. I was constantly facing relapse after relapse with my self mutilation. He verbally expressed how disgusted and sad he was to see my scars and hated the fact that I was still addicted to the pain. Therapy and medications can only do so much sometimes. 
This was the start of the big downfall. 
Months go by and I’m finally trying to open up. If I could talk about my depression and suicidal thoughts maybe it would lessen to urge to cut?
Only downside is he hated hearing it. He would constantly bring up his dead grandfather and the trauma he had been given due to his death as a way to get me to stop talking. 
It seemed fair. 
And then when I got the memo to literally just shut up about my problems it created a psychological warfare. 
He would say or do something that would hurt me, I would shut down and not talk, and then he would go on a tangent about his problems with my problems. Even go as far as to set up timers for how long I would lay in bed crying and not saying a word to him and even use it against me. And when he realized that the verbal patronize on my issues wasn’t going much of anywhere because I can’t change overnight, he would go back to square one. 
The concept of “I don’t like how your body looks” 
And then cutting began all over again. And he would get angry. So angry as to yell at me, threaten to throw me into a psych ward and cut off all ties to me again. 
It didn’t stop. 
I couldn’t stop. 
I am a young broken hearted person that didn’t want others to fix me. I just want to stop being angry all the damn time. 
He wanted someone to fix; someone who had a happiness to control. 
Yes I did do and say things that were equally hurtful to him. He had insecurities too and I openly used some of them against him whenever I had the chance to walk away from his rant sessions of using my insecurities against me. Cat and mouse. Eye for an eye. A Mental western gun battle. 
And one day I had enough. Enough fights. Enough patronizing. Enough begging. Enough screaming and crying. Enough of asking him to show that he cares the way I want him to care. 
I was too angry to be civil so I went to war. 
I told him the way he talks to me when I’m already down is enough to make me want to die. I told him if he didn’t want to care (because he said it during a fight when it came to my emotions and why I was annoyed with him saying “I don’t care”) then I wasn’t going to ask him to try anymore. I was done for the last time. 
When I got home from work hours after that fight, my last moments with him were just a matter of time. 
I was drowning in guilt and sadness and anger. And I wanted to say I was sorry. 
I can’t remember much of that night. All I remember is him yelling at me for locking the bathroom door and saying I’m just a parasite. 
But sometime after the fight I had decided to take my life through OD. One second I’m sitting on the floor reading my text messages and the next I’m puking on a toilet and trying to allow my body to drift to sleep. The worst part of this was that both of our children were eating dinner. You read that right. I tried to take my life in front of our two 2 year olds. 
Some hours pass and I wake up on the couch. I can’t speak. Breathing is hard. I can’t move. All I feel is nausea and pain in my head. 
Ren wasn’t pleased with my condition and he knew. Eventually he put 2 and 2 together and realized that I was dying right in front of him like I promised I would do earlier that day. 
That was back in early august this year. 
Well I’m not going into the gory details of what happened afterwards other than I got help. Didn’t have a choice but I got it. 
I moved out of Rens house and into my manager’s house- let’s call her Aurora. 
Aurora and I have known and worked with each other for years and she always kept her door open for me. I’ve been with her for 4 months now. Our relationship truly is good and we only ever had 1 serious fight. We did agree on the decision to take things slow given the fact we are both scared and insecure and batshit crazy. 
Anyway onto the “where we are now” for this useless post:
My mental health is still in the trash where it always has been for the past 16 years. And that’s okay. 
My issue is that with time- grief never goes away. So everytime I think of ren or mentally see his face I want to cry and kind of punch it. I wish I could say I’ve moved on and that I’m no longer hurt or sad or angry but 
Well
Grief is difficult. A part of me still loves ren enough to have him tucked away in a tiny corner of my life, another part of me wants him to disappear off the face of the earth, and even a bigger part of me just wishes that attempt didn’t fail just so I wouldn’t have to be dealing with this. 
So as your TLDR: I dated a shallow guy with a kink of verbal humiliation and attempted to take my life in front of him after I saw how much of a bad person I am and months later, grief is weird and never goes away.",1700276763.0,False,1,0,Unanimousbeetle,None,17xwwu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17xwwu1/rantbssadstuff/
134,"Worry that I'm abusing, want to recover","Hi all! I'm so glad to have found this sub and I hope my contributions can be positive. I am writing because I feel like I have cyclically encountered the same obstacles and instigated the same disputes in my relationship with a stable, patient, loving partner who I am currently long-distance from. I have never physically hurt him in any way, but I recurrently get into the same argument, which he has begun to vocalize more freely is really hurting him. Obviously, both because I love him and don't want him to leave me, I would do anything to stop hurting him. But I need help figuring my way out of this self-contained paradox that is plaguing me. 

In an argument we had today, which started from a facetime call when I began to rant about some interpersonal troubles I was having with friends and then became embarrassed / felt like he didn't understand me and ended the call, he asked me whether I was trying to hurt him on purpose. I said no, I am trying to understand why someone so stable would stay with me(this is a continual issue I face, embedded in the fact that I don't see myself as healed yet and thus convince myself I'm undeserving of secure attachment). He has heard this before, and undoubtedly he will hear it again.

I asked him why he thought I was trying to hurt him, and how I could stop. 

He responded with the following, which I think pegged the issue pretty well.

We agreed we can both take space, as every phone call with him runs me into emotional overdrive and I'm left alone without any present comfort, but I really want to use this opportunity to explore my cognitive dysfunctions / dissonance so I can at least get a little bit better. I know recovery doesn't happen overnight, but I've been on this healing journey for long enough that regression makes me lose hope in the endgoal altogether.

I am seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow. I just took the whole summer to taper off of cymbalta and detox from adderall and really don't want to go back on antidepressants, but as I am about to enter my last year of university and work two jobs I know I need some medication; my current plan is to ask for adderall xr and rely on TM and yoga to cope with emotional instability, but I don't know if it will be enough. I also am no longer to see my last/only therapist, and am really hesitant to look for and begin with a new one as I've had such disheartening experiences in the past.

I would really, really appreciate any input or advice from anyone who has felt this way, dealt with similar issues, or just has some support or criticism to share.

135,i have a feeling i got misdiagnosed but i don’t want to self diagnose either,"hi! i’m 17, i got admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 2018. it’s been two years since i was admitted n it really opened my eyes in way. anyways, i was put on medication, zoloft and aripiprazole. they haven’t really worked in my opinion. i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety because i used to self harm in middle school n attempted suicide. i have a feeling there’s more to that, you know? i experience mood swings most of the time but they don’t last long. my family always refers to me being “bipolar” but the symptoms don’t match what i feel. i was doing research on things i was feeling, etc. i came across BPD, now like i’ve mentioned before, i’m not trying to self diagnose but i happen to meet with all the criteria symptoms for BPD. i do have a therapist and i’ve met mentioned to her my fear of being abandoned. being abandoned by my own mother as a kid, i guess it really affected me. i have a history of “roller coaster” like relationships, not only with partners but friendships as well, along with family relationships. the therapist i currently have is not going to continue working with the agency i’m at so she’s referring me to another therapist. i was wondering if i should bring up BPD with her? or at least ask if i can talk to a psychiatrist about it? i’m just very scared because i’ve been shut down about how i felt before, my old therapist would just brush away my feelings and say it was because “i was depressed” but i always knew there was more to it.. especially because i was young going into the psychiatric hospital and all i wanted to do was leave there, so of course i lied and made them think i was perfectly fine when deep down i knew i was struggling with more.. opinions?",1588463570.0,False,3,6,ffunkadelick,None,gcgm1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/gcgm1j/i_have_a_feeling_i_got_misdiagnosed_but_i_dont/
136,Fear of abandonment so bad that I would just rather be alone. Anyone have some good coping skills?,"I have one single friend and if it weren't for her family issues and mine occurring at the same time we probably never would have become so close. It's been a nice 3 years of being around a healthy person and observing what is and is not 'normal' behavior. I love my friend but I just can't feel her love or anyone else's and maybe that is the whole problem.

We went on vacation together back in September and ever since I have had this feeling like I'm losing her. These episodes are increasing in severity and I am aware that I am coping by splitting. Until this time she was 'an angel' and now I am looking at the faults and wondering, am I making this up or were they there all along? 

I had an extreme episode a few weeks ago and in a desperate attempt to curb my reaction I finally reached out to her, explained that I feel like I'm losing her and could we get together soon. I don't share much of my disorder, I play normal whenever I can because 1, who wants to hear about it and 2, who really understands anyway

Her reaction was to downplay what I was feeling, which isn't a surprise, she doesn't get it, and that's ok.

On my birthday I was kinda blown off, no big deal just another day. When we finally did get together she was less than attentive to me and our friendship. So I've kinda eased back, but I send her a good morning text telling her I love her, hoping she will understand I need to hear that I am loved too. I got a response but no ""I Love you too""

At this point I feel like she's pulling away from our friendship, but I don't know if that's my insecurity screaming or if it's real. The stress of being aware that this may all be in my head is what makes me want to shut out the whole world so I don't have to deal with this uncertainty.

Anyone have suggestions on how to deal with this kind of insecurity? I am taking an anti anxiety medication now and it is helping, but it's a PRN and I need to be careful of addiction. It would help to know that someone out there can identify with this.

Maybe this is unwelcome since I have BPD but I’m so profoundly aware of it and my symptoms, I’m in Therapy, I take medication, I’m trying with all my might to be normal and it’s working for the most part. I’m in a happy relationship, I’ve had my outbursts (never mean or aggressive, they look more like seeking reassurance and sobbing out of nowhere), but I have strategies to temper them 


HOWEVER. 
My best friend of 11 years and I had a falling out last weekend and idk what to do. I was at her engagement party when my boyfriend called me. He found texts in my iPad (ironically, with her) of me complaining in the past about things he did that hurt me (when he would ignore me or little things like that, things I didn’t want to bother him with. I know better now). He found texts of me saying I think a guy friend of ours is hot, even though my bf is the love of my life. He found texts of me ruminating to my best friend about my bf’s ex and how I went through his iPad back in April and deleted all pics of her in a fit of sadness. Anyway, the call was very intense and I thought he was breaking up with me so I left her party to talk things through with him. After an hour, I felt bad for leaving and came back. I told her what happened and gave her a hug and tried to dance (we were at the club). But I was constantly about to cry so I didn’t wanna cause a scene and left. The next few days were shit, convincing my bf to not take a break over what he saw, fixing things with him. I gave her space and she was so kind, saying she loves me and hopes I’m ok, I told her the same. Then after I resolve things with my boyfriend, she texts me saying she’s so hurt, she’d never do this to me, etc etc. I text her back a little angry and impulsively, saying it’s not like I asked for this to happen. I then calmed down and said bottom line - I’m sorry for even answering his call  at your party. The next week i was in jersey for Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his family. I told her I’d see her when I’m back and call when she had time. I suppose I should’ve just called myself but truthfully she can be very pointed and I’m extremely sensitive and HATE confrontation, and hoped my texts were enough. It’s now over a week later, I haven’t found the space to call her and apologize. I also posted on IG an hour ago of a November photo dump and didn’t include pics from her party. I deleted the post because I felt bad but that’s not before I notice she commented saying “glad I made the cut” in a petty way. 

I sent a text apologizing to her saying I’m tired and I didn’t mean to exclude her. She told me she expected an apology phone call from me a long time ago and she’s shocked and sad and hurt and she thinks I don’t care about her. I’m exhausted and it scares me that I have thoughts of so coldly just throwing her away because the effort involved in confronting and apologizing to her (not even sure how at this point) is so draining and I’d rather just not deal with it. It also scares me that a reaction I have to potentially losing her is what my boyfriend would think and my family and other few friends. I will discuss these toxic thoughts in therapy.  But if I ever want to get better I have to face my fear of her and of confrontation and just call and apologize. I feel like a horrible person and tbh I probably am. I’m posting here because as someone who doesn’t have BPD but deals with someone who does, if you were in this situation and hurt like she is, what kind of apology would make things right ?

MONDAY EVENING: FP (co-leader of my China organization, now roommate with my ex) finally calls me after a long time trying to schedule a call- says she just needs a friend

MONDAY EVENING 20 min later: FP apologizes, says she was unreasonably angry because her BF (also part of leadership team and was a confidante) got blackout drunk after his last call with me and mumbled ""I could have hung up, I should have, I wish I had."" so she blamed me for her BF's drinking issues.

139,I don't know if I should breakup,"I have been dating someone for a month now. And it's just small things that are starting to make me resent them and make me nit want to be near them. 

I was meant to see him the other day and I slept in alot of the day until 2pm in the afternoon because my medication makes me extremely tired. I never have any enegry. He texts me ""are you coming or am I going to sit here all day waiting for you doing nothing? I thought you would be here already"" I got quite upset. In the end he came to see me after a argument about it because he was worried about me. 

Then he said ""your watching the show catfish?  Now I know why your so insecure, because your always watching these shows about false insecurities""  his brought up that I'm insecure afew times now. I know I am. I make it known. I get jealous and I do think he will find someone else. Someone better. 

And then the same night I felt unloved and I don't know why. So I left the bed he was sleeping in and stayed in anther room sleeping. He woke up and told me he was leaving because he can't sleep and what's the point being at my place when I'm not there when he can sleep alone at his by himself. He did tell me that he was triggered though afterwards. he also suffers BPD and alot of trumua from childhood. 

I don't like how he raises his voice at my dog because she doesn't like him alone with me. She is a guard dog and always comes to check on me near the bed. I get tired of him getting angry at her and raising his voice at her. She does this with everyone btw. She's just trying to keep me safe

This is all new to me btw. This all happened within 1 day. I had not seen this side to him prioir to this. Normally his extremely caring, giving, understanding, and communicates really well. But it's sending me into a trumua state. It's making me scared of him and cry and not want to be near him. I have been in abusive relationships before so I don't know if it's a trumua response or not or if it's him. But I feel scared. I have done many years of threapy and I'm on so many meds all I want to do is sleep all the time because I'm so tired. I can barely get out of bed because I am a zombie at this point with the amount of meds I'm on just to make me act more ""normal"". 

Please don't say to work on yourself and just be single. I've been told that my whole life. It doesn't solve anything.. and im almost infertile at this stage. I'm even to infertile for IVF. I want a family. I've done years of threapy. I've tried so hard. I just don't know what to do. And this guy actually trys to understand me. Even when I get upset or have my stupid tantrums. But these things I pick apart about him I can't let go. He may do 100 things right , but the few things he does wrong makes me want to crawl into a ball and not see the light of day again and just breakup with him. And idk if the internet is really the best place for advice because it has ruined other relationships before by taking the wrong advice . But I feel out of my depths with this. I feel so depressed and in a rut like my depression has dipped again due to my PTSD. I have no enegry or anything.

140,My partner accused me of stealing his emotions (cross-post),"My partner (m38) is also extremely mentally ill. He's erratic, mercurial and has bouts of explosive anger. It's typically not towards me specifically but he screams and stammers in this high pitch voice and when I (m30) get upset or freaked out and say anything, he tells me that I'm stealing his thunder and that I keep him from expressing his emotions because I make everything about me. He even suggested that he could prove it by manipulating me by faking emotions to see if I copy him. It's gotten worse since he learned that pwBPD have the potential for elevated emotional mirroring.

This is not my intention. I try to stay quiet and keep a cool head but sometimes I cannot keep from saying something or being physically affected (i.e. crying or having an angry expression) He is currently in the middle of an ongoing breakdown and as a result, literally anything that upsets me is considered paltry. He constantly asks me, ""what are you so sad about?"" As though I don't have a personality disorder, cPTSD, GAD, depression and a myriad of other fucked up shit from both genetics and a shitload of trauma. Our relationship is toxic but hey, unstable relationships are part of the game, I guess.

I have no job because my brain is fucking fried and he's under an absurd amount of pressure to work a job he hates and so I try to minimize what I can because he has so much responsibility. If he puts me down or accuses me of only caring about myself, like he often does, and I begin telling him that he is obviously better off without a burden like me, I get the routine, ""ope, here we going. Swinging the pendulum."" Or again, accusing me of trying to make everything about myself. He also gets angry if I don't say anything to him and will start asking, ""are you not talking to me?"" I have extremely bad days too and I can't express them without him claiming that I'm one upping him. I'm so exhausted.

I can't leave him because I have literally nothing. No money, no car, no family to rely on. My family essentially cut ties because I'm trans. (Today he also guilted me about not getting along with the rest of my estranged, bigoted family because both of his parents have passed away, whereas my mom is still alive and I have 4 siblings) I'm also fairly certain that if I leave, he might cease to exist. That's not even an exaggeration. I can't have him committed because he'd lose his job and everything he has. I can't commit myself because I'd be seen as attention-seeking.

As the child of an alcoholic, I guess it's no surprise that my partner of eight years would end up being one too. He's been sober for 9 months and constantly reminds me that it wasn't his choice. (He had become increasingly emotionally abusive over a period of a couple years and I was trying to make plans to leave him.) I'm not sure two people with these levels of mental illness can be together without destroying each other. I can't fall apart because he's falling apart. I can't feel joy because he can't feel joy. I can't be upset because he is upset.

There's nothing left. I want to not be in existence anymore so so often but I'm trying. I'm in therapy and on medication that doesn't fucking help, I've done workbooks, done things affirm important parts of my life, I've set and achieved goals and in the end, everything in my life is a fucking wreck and so much of it feels like it's my fault. Maybe I really am an emotional vacuum.

I'm trying hard to keep it together. I'm trying hard to be the strong one. I am exhausted every day of my life, physically and mentally and it all just gets worse. Everyone leaves. My family, my friends, my other partners and my partner has emotionally checked out of our relationship. Every circumstance is fucked, the climate, the government, my family, my past, my relationships, my brain and even my pets. I don't know who I am from day to day. Apparently I am a selfish, attention seeking, spotlight thief.

Even now, I've made this whole post about myself, my needs and my emotions. I hate myself so much. I don't want this life or this body or mind. I hate me.

I know no one will read all of this and that it's filled with a thousand different directions of problems. I just needed to spill my guts somewhere where I can't hurt anyone else.

141,Any advice for me? I could use a hand,"Hi everyone, 

This is the first time I've really out myself out there and spoken about my mental health in depth. 
I was emotionally and physically abused as a child by my step father and mother over several years. I was raised in a military family in Germany and because of that I didn't really have any support. I left home when I was 15 and although there were periods where I tried to go back to live with my family, it would always end the same way. In the end I was diagnosed with BDP (EUPD) and the therapists that I have spoken to think there is a correlation between my childhood and my diagnosis.

I have tried so hard to rekindle a relationship with my parents but I can't let go of what happened to me. They consistently called me a liar and berated me whenever I spoke about my childhood. I couldn't live that way and so I chose to change my surname and try to move on with my life. I can't live with the weight of that burden, not when I'm being forced to bare it alone. I just think that I couldn't trust them with my own children (in the future) if they can't even be honest about my upbringing. 

It's hard though. I just wish they would admit that it happened. I don't even want an apology, just vindication for the fact that there actually was a lot that went on that shouldnt have. 

Lately I have night terrors where I see flashbacks. It's debilitating, especially when I'm sleeping next to my partner. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, I take everything personally. I was berated all my life and now when I feel any negativity coming my way, I shut down.

I tend to find myself in pursuit of little highs, whether that's by smoking weed or buying frivolous things that I can't afford. I feel like I'm out of control when it comes to my impulses. I'm not as bad as I used to be. A year or two ago I was sinking x16 tablets of cocodamol at a time to feel numb. It made me really sick. I don't mess with that anymore and I have regular medication for my BPD, but I don't mess around with them.

I can't live this way, it's exhausting. Does anybody have any advice?

142,I don't know what to do...,"After hearing about this place from a friend of my boyfriend I decided to give it a go. I was diagnosed with Bpd two years ago, I had been battling major depressive disorder since I was 12, when I started self harming. About 5 months ago when I met my boyfriend I was going through a difficult time with my mental illness, thinking of suicide every day, fighting the urge to cut with every tear that fell. I was in a dark place. When he entered my life, I started to want a future, I wanted to enjoy life again... and I did! Up until about a month ago. I was offered a job somewhere I always wanted to work, but the catch was I needed transportation. So after a stressful 2 weeks of trying to acquire a certain car, I was finally able to accept the job offer. Meanwhile I quit my job, lost a few ""friends"" in the making, and started cutting again to relieve the plethora of emotions I was feeling. Lately I've been thinking about suicide again.. and today I even contemplated it. My boyfriend is my best friend, my only real friend, the only person I can talk to. But I can't talk to him about this. I don't want him to worry and/or leave me. Please help.. I don't know if I need to talk to someone about this or if I need to find some different coping mechanisms. I currently don't have medical insurance and can't afford professional help without it, so I can't seek that help at the moment.

143,About to embark on a 32 week DBT/Therapy program - spaces available in the group DBT sessions,"I am about to bite the bullet and begin a course of therapy and DBT training.  It’s going to send me into debt, but I’ve been in debt before and never for anything this valuable.

After searching online, I have found a licensed professional counselor and psychologist who is trained and experienced in working with pwBPD and in facilitating DBT Skills training sessions.

This therapist has a solid track record and (like Linehan) does not suggest medication – and very importantly to me, does not suggest facing or exploring traumas during this program.  This appeals to me.

I am in Asia, so I have been looking all over.  This counselor is based in the UK – and recommends a 32 week program – two sessions a week. One session each week will be group DBT Skills training, and the other will be 1 on 1 sessions exploring and applying the DBT training.

Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 2 (8 weeks) 	emotion regulation
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 3 (8 weeks)	interpersonal effectiveness
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 4 (8 weeks)	distress tolerance
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness

What is really tough for me is the cost – the session cost is 95GBP per session.  However, they would pro-rata this rate for the group DBT sessions – 95 divided by the number of participants.  That appeals to me because I learn very well in a group, and the pwBPD support group I take part in has been very valuable to me.

They are currently reaching out to colleagues to learn if there are others being treated who would like to be part of DBT Skills training and therapy.  So I want to share that opportunity here.

I recognize it is expensive.  I am fortunate enough that a close friend has seen how I suffered in the past 18 months and is lending me the money – it will take me quite a while to pay it back but its so much more important than anything I ever went into debt for.   It is also a solid commitment – they require we sign a contract  to commit to the program.

While it might not be for everyone here, I thought it might be worthwhile to present it to see who in this subreddit is interested.  I am eager to get started, to finally take a step I have never done and commit to 8 months of difficult weekly work.  It would certainly make it easier if the group sessions had 3-5 people, and not only me or me and one other.

IF you are interested, feel you can manage the cost (with a group session reduction as indicated), and want to know more; PM me.  I am happy to share the therapists profile and answer what I can, and connect you with them if you want to know more – they offer a free consultation session to help you decide if its right for you.

144,ex.,"i am struggling so heavy. i’m doing better than i ever have, but god. we’ve only been broken up for 2 months and our relationship was short lived, 4 months. but i’m sure a bulk of you can relate to how intense your feelings for a significant other/relationship is. we started strong off the bat and jumped into things so fast, but it honestly felt so worth it. i’ve done this before in past relationships, but never as intimate/vulnerable/meaningful as this one was. 

i miss everything. i miss showering together, i miss spending so much of our time together, i miss our concerts in the car. our car time was our music time and it was something both of us were so excited for, we were constantly updating our playlists specifically for our car rides together. i miss going grocery shopping together, i miss running errands together. god do i miss our meal times. she focused so heavily about our meals. we typically would go to waffle house for breakfast, or if we slept in we would make breakfast together. we’d go out for lunch or again, make something together. but for dinner we always planned out a meal to make at home. she was the cook, i was just around her for “moral support” i suppose. she would always get so excited for dinner time. i would always be in there while she cooked because she wanted to be around me, she couldn’t do it without me. we ate together and always cleaned up afterwards. i miss taking care of her animals while she was at work, i miss taking care of them together. i miss cleaning the house together or surprising her with a cleaned room when she came home from work. i miss taking her starbucks on occasion while she was at work. i miss picking her up sometimes on her lunch break to spend that time laughing and talking in the car together. i fucking miss laughing with her. we spent so much of our time teasing, joking around, and just genuinely happy with one another. 

when we were together in person at least, when we got into arguments/fights.. she always got me to sit with her, hold her hands or touch in some way, and we would both talk about our side of the problem and then collectively came up with a solution or a compromise. god i fucking miss her. 

we broke up based off of a miscommunication and my actions. i was convinced she had it out for me and didn’t care about me. she tried validating my feelings everyday and communicated to me that she was extremely tired from work and college, but i was CONVINCED that wasn’t the case. so i ended up blowing up and left her. she didn’t want me to leave, i did it based off of imaginary fear of abandonment and basing my actions from my emotions. 
this was our second time being together, our first time was practically the same reasoning. so this time she was basically just really exhausted from me and how i reacted with that. i completely understand.

what i would fucking do to hear her talking about her favorite things. to do everything with her. or even just to lay in bed with her doing nothing. 

how do you overcome these intense feelings? how do you know when you need to keep trying, just with time; or when to completely give up? 

i wore a hoodie of hers that i still have, it smelled like her. i sobbed my eyes out for 3 hours and went through our pictures/videos together and re-read some of our messages. i’m a disaster. 


i am focusing on myself. i’m dieting, im in therapy weekly, im on medication, i paint, i read, i go on walks, i do things for myself. i just miss her with practically every bone in my body",1667448629.0,False,10,3,Fun_Sea_1109,None,ykrums,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ykrums/ex/
145,need some insight,"TW some ED and SH and S**cide mentions

So basically rn I'm 16. About 3 years ago I started having problems with depression and anxiety due to many factors including a huge move overseas and some serious cyber bullying from people close to me. With lockdown happening not much later everything because worst especially with the isolation and all that. I also did start having social media and pretty quickly got into the ""quirky depression"" side of tiktok but soon removed the app because I realised how stupid it was. 

Then the depression got pretty bad and it got to the point where I would sleep at 5 am everyday after spending hours in my bed doing nothing bit literally just crying. Sorry if I'm skipping things or not explaining properly I'm not very good with explaining. Also later on the suicidal thoughts were very frequent and for a few months they were very hard to get out of my head. 

I also started developing ED symptoms. It started with just running outdoors during lockdown which was allowed. After a while I would run up to 2hours a day. Then I switched to cycling which progressed to 4 hours a day. And finally I started obsessing over calories and the worst it got was 500 cals a day plus hours of cycling. I had a lot of free time as It was the summer holiday during the first lock down. My parents didn't mind me going out and stuff too. Just what was allowed.

After around 2 months of this I travelled for a while to go on holiday and slowly let go of most of the extreme ed behaviours. The depression didn't get better tho. 

Then a few months later I started have problems with severe anxiety. I got anxiety tics, unexplainable panic attacks and even a couple of short attacks that were later labelled as anxiety induced mania attacks. That was likely triggered due to the return of school and exams and all that. Also during that time my dad got diagnosed with cancer. At first they thought it was terminal and he had a few months but the diagnosis changed and thankfully he got treated and became cancer free about 8 months later. That period was pretty hard tho especially due to the caution we had to take as my dad didn't have any immunity and he because quite aggressive due to the effects of chemo and other medication. He still had problems with it but I can't say it's his fault. 

During that time I also struggles with SH and have problems with skin picking and some intrusive thoughts which I think is related to anxiety. 

Anyway lately the depression hasn't been too bad but I still have problems with anxiety and now the worst thing is anger problems. I would be fine but out of no where have a rage episode about stupid things. In the last 2 weeks I had like 3 extreme episodes leading to big family fights and I got to levels of crazy anger. I literally couldn't calm down except for when I started punching myself really hard. That left me with a few bruises. Also I started going to the gym a few weeks ago to help release that anger but idk it didn't help stop those anger episodes. This is really starting to bother me because idk how to stop them and i later I realise how stupid the trigger was and honestly I don't want to be another thing my parents have to add to their list Of worries. 

Anyway sorry this ended up being kind of a vent. But I wanted to ask for tips on how to manage the anger. 
Also I went into a great depth because I wanted to ask if it's worth looking into me possibly having BPD. I've been researching for around 2 years now because I just relate with a lot of the symptoms. I'm not diagnosing myself obv I just want to find the right help. Ik I'm under 18 so it's not easy to diagnose it but is it worth asking to be checked for it ? Also my grandad has it.

146,"I love my GP (it got long, sorry)","So I've been having a bad BPD style relapse over the last month or so. But now that I'm more of a quiet borderline girl it's a slow spiral into hell.

So I went and saw my GP last week (yay me, waited until crisis point) and she stuck my back on Seroquel for a month just to stop my head racing all the damn time. Seriously, my anxiety was so out of control that my brain was almost turning itself off. I was convinced I was losing my mind because I just became so fucking dumb. Losing words, getting lost, forgetting things the second I heard them.

I voiced the fact that after being off Seroquel for 3 years it felt like I was failing by going back on them. She made me stop and listen. She said that it's no different to someone with asthma who's had it under control for years. Sometimes there will be some trigger that nobody can predict or see coming, so they add in extra help (medication) until it's passed and then go back to their usual routine.

She heard me, validated me and reassured me.

I went back yesterday for a follow up (I'm 100 times better than I was, love Seroquel) and we got to talking about the nature of BPD. I'm her most managed borderline patient so she can often get a different perspective from me. 

I told her my theory that we don't necessarily grow out of the BPD traits and behaviours, that I think we just learn to turn them inwards instead. I know I'd rather take it out on myself than others like I used to. I told her that even with all the therapy my thinking patterns are the same, I just have that filter between thoughts and actions that usually works really well.

I also told her how I've learnt the biggest reason behind BPD behaviours is control. Lack of, needing. I've always been at my worst when my emotions (and therefore my life) were out of control. So I'd do ANYTHING to feel like I had some kind of control. So, manipulation, SH, disordered eating, risky behaviours, impulsive behaviours. All of it, for me, was about control. That obsessive need for control.

She took notes. She's going to talk to her colleagues about it and see if they've had other patients voice the same kind of thing. And I know she's not patronising me.

She heard me. She validated my point of view. She thanked me for adding my insight and changing how she looks at BPD recovery.

Yes she's only a GP, but she specialises in mental health and is always learning about things like BPD because they're so misunderstood.

147,"Looking for any advice about support in the UK, please help","So sorry for this being so long but I've got a lot to ask and get off my chest. For about a year I've known of BPD and from the start I've felt the symptoms explained really well the problems I'd had through childhood and teen years. I've never been good at identifying my feelings (some types of thought feel hard to reach, like theres a push back and everything gets more jumbled when i try) so it felt really validating. But I can't help worrying that I've always just wanted to feel special and now I'm assuming I have symptoms of a real disorder as an excuse for being a pathetic lazy person. As a result, I've avoided seeing a GP until now because I didn't know what I'd do if they didn't then validate me. But i got a couple counseling sessions from uni last summer (they can't diagnose). They helped me to realise how hurtful my parents attitudes had been (growing up lots of ""you're selfish/ungreatful"" ""you're lazy"" ""you're manipulative/spoiled"", "" why can't you be more like X"" ""or else"" ""don't say you're afraid of me or I'll...!"" recently I get "" you're naïve "") and that I drag myself down with self hate and that with my mam being suicidal for most of my childhood I felt like my needs weren't being met and I always had to prove my love to her or she'd die. For about a day after the sessions I was floating on a warm pillow of self love that helped motivate me. But it dissolved away, my GF broke up with me and I couldn't stand being around my parents back home for the summer (they pressured me to get a summer job, I didn't feel like I could handle it but couldn't refuse or I'm just taking their money). So I very suddenly moved back down to uni and isolated myself. This year has been a shit show. Impulsive drug taking has gone up, I go through patches of day drinking and feeling nothing and boredom to feeling so sad and isolated (life feels like a realistic film) to having narcissistic waves of mania, mainly when on a substance. I regularly can't stand to look at my reflection when I'm alone (looks like someone else scary looking back) and I do stupid shit like taking drinks from strangers in clubs fully aware that I'm probably being spiked or going to random music venues in areas of the city that I don't know with my weedguy. I haven't been able to keep up with uni, putting all work off until it was late and I'd have to take a 10% hit to any grade I got on them. I don't care. With about a day left to finish my dissertation I had nothing started and broke down. My mam picked me up the next day, that was last Monday and I now can't graduate with honors (as if I give a shit). Since then I've been having mood swings out the wazoo, apprehensive about doing anything and getting these sessions where my hate and distrust for my parents (who are loving and hurtful but not malicious) gets overwhelming. But its more like, I get angry at the world and everything is bad and then I feed my relationships through this hate machine and the only things I can remember about my family are the negatives (delusions as a child that my parents were plotting to murder me/read my thoughts, strangers were plotting to murder me, etc). Then I snap out of it, like when you splash a bath it gets crazy but quickly settles down and goes flat. After these episodes I can't remember what it felt like, I just know it was bad. For the past year having suspected BPD, I often check in on this sub but dont post and almost self medicate with the advice here and online which often helps (trying to remind myself that the average me doesn't agree with the extreme views and given some time I'll go back to baseline). I don't have a sense of identity past my name, body and memories which is maybe all we have but I feel so hollow most of the time. The part that resonated the most with me though is splitting which I think I've observed happening over and over during my life (I never knew why I suddenly hated people or stopped and started loving partners) and even this year I've gone from idolising a uni colleague for her prowess to hating her for her judmentality just because she rightly pointed out that I have been underperforming as a group. However she did confront me in front of the whole group which was the trigger that made me no longer trust her, now she's an outsider, probably working against me and I can only remember the events previous to the trigger that support this, not all the impressive and likeable memories of her. Anyway, I finally decided enough was enough and got an appointment at my GP, thinking that I could get some kind of mental health referral to a professional who could diagnose me (or worst case say I'm faking it but at least give some closure).  I told her everything here and more, including the fact I was sexually experimenting as a child with other children (when I was~4-6 yr old) which up until recently I thought was all consensual until I remembered a very old fuzzy memory of dodgy stuff with some older relatives of the kids my age. I told her how my suicidal thoughts have gone from intrusive at Christmas, to a consideration of a way out, to being afraid of the platform edge, to now knowing how I'd do it. I thought it was going well and she tried to reasure me that my delusions of her invalidating me would be unfounded, until we got to the end and she asked if I'd tried church, I was taken aback and said no, that its not my thing. She said ""that's a shame, not many young people in this area are willing to give it a go but it can be a good place to talk and find God"". Then she asked what I hoped to get out of this. I said I didn't understand the mental health service but I hoped I could get a diagnosis as I didn't feel general talking therapy worked and I'd like to have a target/explanation of why I feel these things. I was told she can't diagnose as a non specialist and when I asked if I could then see a specialist she just said no. So I asked what was wrong, to which I got "" well something deep is obviously wrong and it looks  you've got some depression in there too"". She also said that 'we' avoid giving diagnosises because there can be stigma, but in my experience here in the UK there is more stigma towards the undiagnosed as rhey seem less valid. Then she gave me a number to a public over the phone therapy service (Talking Change) and a website with general mental health self help leaflets. She also said back to me that I was clearly coping, a low suicide risk and that my family relationships were obvious still functional. I didn't know what to say so I just quietly left and got so angry on my bike ride home I didn't even feel going uphill. I feel let down, I'm no further in regards to improving and I have no more resources than what I was already using falsely to self medicate. In fact, I've now exhausted my last hope. I don't know where to go next and I feel so alone despite once again having a support network that claims to love me, so I'm posting here to ask for advice in the UK, what the process is, what I should think.

148,First few days...,"It  has been an exhausting 5 years. I escaped my abusers, got married to my soulmate (yikes), started therapy for PTSD, got diagnosed with ADHD, and tried medication this year. There’s one huge problem: I’m on dialysis and Adderall XR is __undializable__ meaning it’s has no way to exit my body. I went full psychotic you guys. So I stopped taking the Adderall and it finally has broken down to its components and filtered out. 

But then I was still getting angry. Just like I used to. I still couldn’t sleep, just like I used to. My inner critic used me as a whipping girl, just like she did when I was mentally hallucinating that she was gonna eat my face off. 

I got a Generalized Personality Disorder diagnosis from a resident marriage therapist about a year ago. 

It’s been a long ass fucking year. I’ve touched on DBT, and fought tooth and nail with my behaviors to “prove” I didn’t have BPD. But I was bent until I was broken and I had to pick up the pieces. And the BPD was still there. 

Y’all, I’ve never got a 9/9 on anything. I finally watched a few videos. My flip-switch, ends-quick rage, my self hate, my suicidal but not really tendencies, it was all in there. Even the parts where I was more prone to stressed-based psychosis. (Previously I had been diagnosed as “depression with psychosis”) 

So over the weekend I’ve been trying to hard. I’ve been messaging my therapist instead of my husband. When I do tell my husband stuff it’s consise and not 15 pages. I isolated myself today while I was mad, and “rode the wave” and was able to figure out almost everything behind that particular shitfit. I also didn’t escalate my anger at something my husband was doing, into anger at him, and I avoided a good bit of verbal abuse. 

But all of this is so tiring. And I’m barely scratching the surface. The conversations my husband and I are having are deep and scary and I haven’t been this honest with anybody about this stuff. I have new fears, and new ways to practice old fears. 

I just wanna be better. I wanna stop abusing my husband. I wanna not feel like shit all the time. I wanna stop fighting because I have a hairline trigger and he accidentally makes it worse somehow. 

The road has been long, and the road will be long ahead. But I am recognizing how sneaky (In a good way) my therapists have been and how I actually have a few DBT skills already, I just have to learn how to apply them. Radical acceptance a few months ago helped us stop fighting about the dishes. Riding the Wave has helped me isolate and quickly manage breakdowns before they affect my husband. 

He just is so afraid of me now. He’s so jumpy. And I am heartbroken. I can’t believe I’ve done this to the man I love. Except this time instead of my inner critic taking hold, I’m using it to be better every time in cognizant enough to S T O P. 

On the one hand, this is such a tall mountain. An Everest perhaps. But I have told him that he is my Foreverest Love, because I would climb Everest for him. Well now I’m being called to task, and I just gotta pick up my ropes and start climbing, no matter how hard it is.

I’m posting this cause I’m anxious I can’t do it. I’m so early in my journey I still have most of my disordered thoughts and behaviors. I’ve been looking for the evidence to calm my anxiety, but even so, my critic pesters me “you’ll never be good enough and he’ll leave” even though he knows I’m afraid of that and had literally guaranteed the opposite. 

I just want to be good for him. Will I ever be good for him?",1593992654.0,False,11,0,TarnishedTeal,None,hlwvnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/hlwvnh/first_few_days/
149,The same thing every morning. (TW: Suicidal thoughts),"What will happen when I die: 

A few people will be really sad, for several weeks or months. 
Several more will be genuinely sad as well, but will note it as another sad day. 
Many will openly post and share lovely things. Some will be sincere, many will be performative. 

I won't feel any positive benefits or love from this. I'll be dead. 

After a few months life will return to normal- on my birthday or when memories pop up on social media, many will comment with likes or hearts or memories- then go back to their day. 

I'll become a story and a footnote that will, in time, be forgotten. Eventually I won't have mattered. 

The love and attention I'll get as a dead man is something I crave now. But asking for these isn't ok. If I do this I'll be love bombed by a few who want to do/say something but feel awkward so a lot of it will be empty positivity.  More than a few would respond derisively- usually folks from my generation/home region. They will shame me. 

It's harder and harder to push back the darkness. And my friends who can bear me when I'm like this are growing fewer, and I feel their weariness.  There's no clear light at the end of the tunnel and everyone is burned out- as I'm reminded by burned out people when I try to ask for help. 

I spent years of happiness surrounded by loving people. I failed to fully appreciate it because I was always focused on the future, and I neglected the presence that could have brought me peace and joy... and I hurt those I loved most and did not see it. 

I'm alone, in physical and emotional pain, cut off from my career and income, and there seems to be no return to my old life- and no image of a positive future. Looking back, I see shame and guilt and regret. Looking forward, I see years of harder work than I've ever encountered and no clear positive goal. Looking at the present, I see nothing but pain and sadness and fear as I scramble to make it through each day with dwindling resources and energy. 

No help is coming. I can reach out for attention, but as soon as the call is disconnected I'm out of their life again and once again alone in the pain. 

I'm currently making plans and getting ready for more life changes as I seek an environment to get professional help, make friends, and begin the long journey back to me. But as I make these plans it's daunting, overwhelming- and I'm utterly alone. 

I'm doubting my neurodivergence. I don't fully believe in BPD. A big part of me is shouting shame in my head, that I have the will and the methods to love myself and become the cliches and platitudes. 

Why keep going?  I stared at a package of pain medication for a long time, calculating what painless yet fatal dosage would be. I've spent hours on the internet researching effective low pain suicide methods that would have the lowest impact on those few who still speak to me. 

What's stopping me? Conditioning. Maybe my amygdala. And fear of doing it 'wrong' and remaining alive but broken, and a bigger burden than ever. 

It doesn't seem worth it. There's no happy ending ahead.  So I cry, I scream, and I mark the hours and minutes and seconds that pass until the day is done... then begin it all again the next morning. Every day, little change except that the people who would support me get farther away, or lose energy to deal with the constant hunger of the black void inside me. 

Now as I write this I feel more shame. There are so many who hurt, in more legitimate ways than me. I see myself as a drama queen, a whining child, the Boy Who Cried 'Suicidal.'  

I want someone to read this and respond somehow. I know posting this in most social media platforms will not go well or be received well- it's too much for people to take on.  Even posting this in this one subreddit- strangely the only place on the internet I feel relatively safe- makes me feel guilt and shame. I have not balanced my cries of pain posts with helpfulness or support. Plus others in this subreddit could be triggered and I don't want people to hurt. I'll put a Trigger Warning on the title... which will cause readers to have a preconceived mindset as they read it. 

I don't know what to do. But I do know every day is harder, every morning is exhausting, and psychiatric help is over a month away and I'll have to go deeper in debt for mental health care. 

I'm afraid. I'm scared that one morning like today, facing the same situation with no end in sight, I'll finally take the steps to take my life... and I really fear that I'll fuck that up and make things worse for others. 

Its 8am. 14 hours more of this then I can sleep, and start the process again. I will likely use weed or alcohol or food to comfort myself or avoid the pain- but everything will be here tomorrow morning for me to face again. 

I've been alone for 4 months, but for my cat.  Living as a hermit, interacting online, no one in real everyday life that isn't a transactional relationship. 

It's been 7 months since I felt the physical touch of someone who cared. 

It's been over a year since my partner expressed finality and ended their love. 

We've all suffered for more than a year. And no one knows what anyone really has suffered inside. There are certainly wealthy people with families and people around who still suffer the pain I do and feel hopeless. There are certainly many more much worse off than me- unable to even type thoughts and post them. 

I can't even manage my own pain. And I'm so tired and tired of being tired. I'm so exhausted by emotional and physical pain, compounded by THINKING about the emotional and physical pain, further compounded by FEELINGS about THINKING about emotional and physical pain. 

I'm sorry if this triggered you or if you read all this way to see I actually don't have a point.   But if you did get this far, and you have people in your life, reach out and just talk. Maybe not everyone has to live like this.

150,"REALIZED I HAVE BPD....SUPPLEMENTS? 5HTP, GABA?","ill try to make this brief,even though we all know  BPD Struggle is far from...

i think i have been dealing with BPD all my life but i never quite knew it..

in hindsight i can see where BPD played a role in a lot of situations throughout my life..

2 years ago on my birthday i had a huge panic attack i thought i was going to die, i was smoking weed,drinking and i took some pills..i still dont know wtf they were...then my heart started beating..my vision started getting blurry..i was seeing white...it was like i was dieing...i was taken to the ER...i left the ER and was experiencing depersonalization and derealization for the first time ever...my gf left the next day and i was left by myself with this horrible fuckin feeling...

i stayed in that house for months...i couldnt even leave the house..i would go buy food at 2 or 3 in the morning..i was smoking weed even though the weed instantly gave me panic attacks..i was just hoping that it would fix me somehow...i stayed in this horrible state for months..non stop panic attacks..no sleep...barely eating...shut off from the world..having to fake like i was okay when i spoke with my mother...i cant worry her..i couldn't tell her that i wanted to kill myself and that looking in the mirror i did not recognize myself..

 time goes by...cant work...cant function..im just in hell all day 24/7

its been a while and i dont really feel depersonalized anymore but my emotions are out of control...like on a severe level...

for the longest i was so focused on the DP/DR that i never took the time to look at the cause of the anxiety..i was so focused on treating anxiety and dp/dr but this last month my girlfriend broke up with me because i had an instance of ""splitting"" i guess they call it and for the very first time i actually noticed that my way of thinking is waaay screwed up.....i finally see alot of the BPD symptoms...i now know that i don't think like everyone else...im always thinking negative...typical bpd things like the black and white..the favorite person...the splitting..and the shame...guilt...all these things i had been feeling my whole life...but before it was manageable...i was able to function...i didnt ever think about suicide..but after that huge panic attack and dp/dr/depression/ it seems my BPD is just fuckin exploded full force and all those symptoms are flaring all day....im sensitive as hell..on edge

i cant function...the only thing keeping me calm is a benzo..klonapin...that takes the anxiety away but without it...i feel like ill fall back into the pitts of dp/dr...i have been taking it for a while..maybe 2 years?

My  ex gf broke up with me after i had an instance where i ""split"" because she didnt answer my phone call it was scary.......fear of abandonement kicked in and everything else aswell..but thanks to her breaking up with me...i came to the realization that im not just dealing with extreme anxiety...but that i have deeper problems like bpd...

my thoughts are suicidal and negative all the time but now i am aware of the thoughts and i am aware that i am thinking incorrectly..i know can see and observe...where as before i didnt...i just felt the emotions and  rolled with them unknowingly...

ive done my due diligence on several other disorders...bipolar..bipolar 2..schizophrenia..etc but BPD describes me down to a T..it finally makes sense..any thoughts?opinions??questions??

theres more to the story such as im not in the U.S which is where i was raised till the age of 19, i was deported for buying alcohol with a fake id.

i was sent  to a 3rd world country..people dont speak the language and i cant relate,ive been here for 8 years and all that stress was probably building till the mind just couldn't handle it anymore? causing me to dissociate..?

but why the severe BPD?

i am always on the brink of tears..i am agitated and sad...suicidal thoughts are most of my day..i remember my ex gf and i feel guilty because i put her through alot of bad moments in life...from her witnessing me having to go to the ER to a lot of emotional abuse,she is a sweetheart.. truly beautiful..she not once disrespected me ever..so when i think of those times...my anxiety instantly revs up..and i start thinking suicidal thoughts due to the guilt and negative self talk..racing thoughts etc... its like its happening all over again...i feel pathetic because i fucked up bad and put her through hell..

i know i shouldnt feel that way beacause i really dont think im too much at fault,the bpd was fucking my life up for the longest and i had no clue..now i challenge my thoughts,meditate,supplement,trying to do CBT...wish there was DBT here but there is not...im really down and out..i feel alone...im isolated...i think im what is considered a quiet borderline...why? because no one here speaks english..i have no family here in this country.. gf left me..no medical help...i cant even express my thoughts concerns or anything...if only someone here spoke some english..that would be helpful i feel...situation sucks...i've begun to kind of tip my family off to the fact that suicide is something i consider alot...its horrible i don't want to make them sad but this sucks...i cant go on this way...they are in the U.S. and i cant see them..they cant come here and i cant go back to the U.S. im kind of trying to ease the idea of me not being here but at the same time i feel horrible doing so..

I HAVE 2 SISTERS,AND MY MOTHER..I AM THE ONLY MALE..FATHER IS OUT THE PICTURE..

Help anyone?  
sometimes a kind word works wonders for me

SUPPLEMENTS TAKEN..OMEGA 3,POTASSIUM,VITAMIN B COMPLEX,VITAMIN D,MAGNESIUM,VITAMIN A,CENTRUM DAILY VITAMIN FOR MEN,MELATONIN EVERY OTHER MONTH...

THINKING OF TRYING 5HTP AND GABA....THEY JUST CAME IN THE MAIL.

i can elaborate more but im going to try and sleep now...just thought id post something quickly about supplements but it turned into this...  


i find comfort in youtube channels such as BIGNOKNOW,DR DANIEL FOX,NOAH ELKRIEF AND DIVING DEEP INFINITE WATERS,RALPH SMART..

151,Does anyone see BPD/Bipolar as one massive cyclical entity? (Trigger Warning),"Im new to the sub reddit, relatively new to reddit and definitely not a massive one for writing (especially about such personal topics). I just kinda needed to get this out i think and i do wonder if people feel the same, or is it just me. The road of self discovery i suppose (with the help of you lovely people).

Bit of background; Male, just turned 30, have had 'problems since age of 11', addict, mum has Bipolar etc, I'm on valium, codeine & pregabalin each day. Got wrongly diagnosed at 23 w/ Mixed Personality Disorder w/ Narcissistic Tendencies (wtf) , 'corrected' at 25 to BPD, sort of 'corrected' again at 27/28 BPD/Bipolar.

To the fucking point... Over the last few years, id say from 27 to 30, every year seemed to be like one big cyclical event, repeating itself but speeding up and getting harder and harder. Careless, worthless, suicidal, isolated, so much more self destruction. I've always had those thoughts since the age of 13, i think they started. But when you get used to them, they are always there. When you're happy, socialising, walking, trying to sleep, depressed, MANIC. My cycle feels like it speeds up every year, the thoughts can become like an entity that takes over. It plans, puts pieces in place, thinks for you about the ramifications, enabler, instigator. The only thing i can liken it to is when you are not of sound mind through some sort of intoxicant, but more like a disassociated state. It's like i have two me's. And i'm a believer of the ego driven self and the true inner self. But this is like a split of ego as it's still ego driven but when i get into a self destructive cycle it is raging till it ends badly.

So just this year:

* I overdosed on Heroin in a blacked out state after drinking two bottles of shitty wine in half hour (oh yeah my Dad was there for half of it, watched me prep my gear). I would really give a shit about that, entity didn't give a shit
* I made an attempt on my life.
* I ended up in hospital in Portugal with 7 stitches in my head because of some bullshit Hostel
* Recently nearly got hospitalised because i was semi conscious on a park bench 5 minutes away from my house after consuming a lot of different things and then decided i was gonna drink Buckfast for the first time cos i knew a garage sold it in my city. Downed a bottle in 5 minutes, remember buying the second bottle and then just snapshots. Till police and medical found me on the bench, persuaded them to do one basically (but got a lift home lol)

So this is one as well, and its weighing down on me, crushing me. I've been a recovering addict for quite a while and then very recently i started getting back into the tricks of the trade on the internet - then comes out the addict again. So this week addict mode is engaged, fully. Stayed up all night before a ACT group meeting id been waiting a year for, i was actually fine but fucked up thing is i find me to be more like me the day after i've had no sleep, even without any drugs. It's kinda like i lose my inhibitions when i'm over tired. Any way i should get to the fucking point - Addict mode engaged, also just hit Manic stage as well (not good combo). Yesterday i lterally spent 12-14 hours on my laptop looking for drugs, researching about drugs, trying to find out if Noootropics would help me. Was so frustrated because i just wanted something NOW! Late, late hours are bad for me. Around 3am finally decided to try a new marketplace, end up buying half g of Crystal Meth & half g of H, next day delivery. (I've only told one person that). I've never done crystal meth and i the heroin, well i haven't done that since a week after my overdose (for obvious reasons). When i woke up the next day i just had this feeling of dread, a blanket of 'what have i done!?'. And i'm not stupid,i know i don't have to do them, i could throw them away - but i know i wont. They will turn up tomorrow and i will be taken over by this fucking thing that just wants to destroy. It sounds like i have no will power and this is what i mean by the circle it seems with every year that passes my will power decreases and this entity gains it. So this thing that is still me he has my fucking will power, destructive will power. And when the other part of me is down to like 30% left its not a fair fight. I cant blame it on something else becaue it is me, its not separate it just feels that way. They are still my actions and i am accountable for them. I just worry because with every year it gets harder and harder.... And believe me i try to change, i try to engage with anything that is available (when i can). I know baby steps and all that and i was actually doing well for ages and then your head or life just changes the context and you are back there again. It's got to the point where i feel like i just want to let it take over. Im tired. Really fucking tired. Of all the bullshit in the world and the ignorance of people that can't see the bigger picture. I know to change the world you start one person at a time and that begins with your self.... But all of this i understand, but i can't seem keep consistency, or any sort of routine. I can't engage in any of my hobbies anymore, i haven't worked in 6/7 years, a lot of the time i cant leave the house, my phone is a massive trigger and because of that ive lost a lot of loved ones... I've said it a few times recently, i feel like a waste of air. Theres so much more but im just having a self pitiful rant at a screen atm lol...

I just needed to write it down, get it out. I haven't told bits of this stuff to anyone, and the rest is definitely not common knowledge. For some reason id rather it be here, rather than anyone else know  🤷🏻‍♂️

Summary: I'm trying but every year gets harder, cycles seem to speed up and last for longer, self destruction goes up stupid amounts, and i get magnetised into more fucked up situations... And it get pretty much unbearable. I don't know if to post this... I'm not really looking for responses. I know a lot of it would be you're a fucking idiot for giving in to the drugs, (that aren't even here yet). But i know i will. And i except people may not understand, i dont fucking understand... I know im an addict, but its not for the effect of the drug, its for self destruction... Thats the condition in me, buried so deep, like its weaved into me and impossible to separate

152,BPD Podcast,"Hey all!

This is my first reddit experience (bum bum baaaahhhh!)! I was diagnosed with BPD about two years ago, underwent DBT therapy for about a year and have been working very, very hard to work the skills-- to find that ""life worth living"" they're talking about. The transformation has been amazing to my day-to-day life, by no means is life perfect, or am I recovered. But holy shit, I can mostly functional again, and taking these little steps is giving me hope through the challenges for the first time in a long time. 

I'm a fortunate lady, not everybody is lucky enough to get diagnosed, much less, to wrack up their credit debt to get to go to therapy. I want to share my personal experiences because what I found in group-therapy was people didn't understand the skills in a real-life scenario. It all made sense in group but the practical application piece was missing. Our dear leader had examples that frankly were a little soft while we were all living the extreme version of it- which felt invalidating in itself. So I'd really like to share my stories, share the skills, and help others feel better-- if only it helps to hear they're not alone.

I've come up with a few episodes that are ready to record-- being based off what I've struggled with most and the skills that have most impacted my life. BUT I'd really like to hear what you all struggle with the most and hear your success stories of how skills have helped you! If you care to comment, I'd really like to hear where you're at.

4,Struggling to cope,"Hi everybody, I’m going to preface this by saying trigger warning as I’m really struggling right now. Sorry if this is long. 



So last night I had to call the crisis team as I was very close to rock bottom and I know if I reach rock bottom I’m likely to attempt unhealthy coping mechanisms to release the pain. The crisis team were great they have referred me to penumbra in the mean time. But I feel I’m going to need long term formal support to help. 

Here is the kicker though, I asked for help three months ago from my psychiatrist and psychotherapist as I knew I was headed in a downward trajectory. The Psychotherapist said I couldn’t keep using them when things got tough (I hadn’t spoken with psychotherapy in over a year and in that time I had used mentalization to help me cope with the bad periods). My psychiatrist in his infinite wisdom turned round and said I really need to learn to deal with these things on my own and discharged me!? 

Here’s my question should I contact my GP for re-referral to psychiatry or is it a lost cause because quite frankly I don’t know what to do any more.

8,Remission/Recovery Resources for the Sticky Temperamental Traits of BPD,"Thanks to a year of DBT, my BPD symptoms are in remission, and I've been below the diagnostic criteria threshold for about a year and a half. 

I continue to practice DBT. I consider myself to be really rigorous and recovery-oriented, much like someone in substance abuse recovery might. 

I know that people like us have functional deficits, even in recovery, that are linked to temperamental traits (irritability, mood lability, negativity bias, impulsivity, etc). These deficits are the reason that only half of us go on to achieve normal interpersonal and vocational functioning after our BPD symptoms have gone into remission.

Here's the question: Does anyone have any post-treatment resources for those of us whose BPD symptoms are in remission but who want to maximize our functionality at work and in our relationships? Any resources that deal with temperamental problems as opposed to just behavior/thoughts?

13,What is wise mind in DBT?,"Have you ever snapped at someone and surprised yourself with how harsh you sounded?

You may have thought, *whoa… where did that come from?!*

You were probably acting from what’s called “Emotion Mind” in DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy). DBT is a therapy methodology developed by Marsha Linehan which helps people feel more in control of their thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

When in emotion mind, people react based on their mood, without taking logic into account.

**You May Be in Emotion Mind If:**

* You’re reacting quickly, without thinking things through
* You’re acting on urges without taking into account your long-term goals
* You’re behaving impulsively and aren’t considering potential consequences of your actions
* You want to hurt who hurt you, even if you’re not typically a vengeful person
* You’re not considering anyone else’s feelings or additional context of the situation

On the other end of the spectrum is Reasonable Mind, which is rational, logical and steady.

You might be thinking, *okay, reasonable and rational, that sounds good! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time must be the goal, right?*

Actually, no! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time isn’t ideal, either. 

**You May Be in Reasonable Mind If:**

* You feel cut off from, or “numb” to your emotions
* You minimize or shrug off your feelings
* You rationalize your own or others’ behavior, even behavior that is unacceptable
* You are avoiding or in denial about something that is happening
* You are completely focused on a task

When we’re in Reasonable Mind, we’re cut off from our emotions. It’s important to be aware of and feel our emotions. First, because it’s an essential part of the human experience. More importantly, emotions contain very important information we need to understand our needs and boundaries.

Here’s an example of why awareness of emotions is important. Let’s say you feel angry and irritable every time you see your friend. Reasonable mind might say you’re being irrational and dismiss the feelings. But chances are there’s a good reason why you’re feeling angry at them, especially since it keeps happening.

Maybe they’re putting you down a lot, or not listening to what you’re saying. Or maybe you feel jealous of them. Finding the answer to why you’re angry is important to figuring out how to resolve your anger, whether you do so on your own or with the other person.

There are a number of potential reasons why people have difficulty being in Wise Mind. Maybe they haven’t had many people in their life model what it looks like to be in Wise Mind. Maybe staying in Reasonable Mind has protected them from extreme traumatic reactions. Maybe acting from Emotion Mind has gotten their needs met, for better or worse.

When you’re able to acknowledge your feelings without acting impulsively on them, you’re in Wise Mind.

**You May Be in Wise Mind If:**

* You’re taking both your emotions and logic into account
* You can name and feel your emotions
* You’re considering different ways to proceed before acting
* You can see the situation from multiple perspectives
* It feels like *you* are in control, not your mood

If you’re rarely in Wise Mind, don’t worry! You can increase your Wise Mind skills with practice.

**Ways to Cultivate Wise Mind Skills**

* Pause throughout the day and ask yourself which state of mind you are in.
* If you are in Emotion Mind, label which emotions you’re feeling.
* Using coping skills before acting on your feelings (for instance, journal, go on a walk, or take a hot shower).
* If you want to engage in a behavior that’s impulsive or mood-based (for example, emotional eating, texting your ex, substance abuse, etc.)
   * Delay the behavior by 1 hour
   * Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or peer before engaging in the behavior
   * Consider the negative consequences of the behavior
   * Replace the behavior with something less harmful (for example, drawing on your arms with a Sharpie instead of self-harming)
* Participate in a DBT program in your area. It can help you develop not only Wise Mind skills, but also, a wide variety of other skills related to Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Relationships.
* Practice yoga, Tai-Chi, or other physical activities that help you get in touch with your body. These can also help you develop more awareness of yourself and your emotions.
* Talk to a therapist! A therapist can help you stay accountable as you work towards strengthening your Wise Mind.

14,Holy wow DBT is amazing,"Wow dudes. It seriously is.

I’ve been in CBT with some DBT features for like a year and a half and I made huge strides! But now I moved, and am starting DBT group and a one on one CBT therapist in my new city in two weeks.

I haven’t started the new therapies yet - but my friend who is a psychologist sent me a packet of DBT worksheets for my time off therapy and holy WOW - they are effective.

Personally, they take a long ass time for me to fill out, and I only feel like they work for me because a.) I already have experience with doing logs like this and with cognitive distortions and schemas through my time in CBT, and b.) I already have worked on emotional awareness a lot for several years with several therapists.

But like - this morning my partner said something innocuous of course which scared the shit out of me and immediately felt anxious and scared and angry and confused and I wanted to ask him all these questions and interrogate him and do all my impulsive behaviors…

But then I filled out “check the facts” and wow. It just wild. It took probably an hour for me to really work through it, but I can see SO clearly exactly the route my mind took, and why, and I feel empathetic with myself, and I feel like I understand my partner, and I feel safe and happy and understood and I took no actions that I regret and just…wow.

15,Best DBT resources/ workbooks?,"Hello. I am a pwBPD and I have had very bad splitting recently which resulted in lashing out at my boyfriend and feeling impossibly terrible afterwards.
I know I am the problem, and I want to fix it because I feel so bad and resentful towards how I treat him, I sometimes think it would be better if he just let go of me. But even though he is visibly hurt, he said we can find a solution.
I am just afraid that if I don't do anything now this is just a preview of how our relationship will be always, if it continues.

Some quick context: we were in a long-distance until we moved in together last june, in a completely new country where neither of us know the language.
So I have seeked help, but since I cannot speak the language at an advanced level, there are not enough resources, meaning English-speaking therapists here. And where there are, in a different city and can do video-sessions, they are extremely expensive for me to be able to afford now.

Now, I know DBT is the main treatment for BPD, but since I have no way of going to therapy right now, I was wondering if there is any way to self-teach?

19,Struggling with some things in regard to DBT treatment.,"Hi guys. Thanks for your time. I'm living in the UK, and have had CBT and counselling. I found that neither of those were helpful. DBT is, but my only option to self administer. I've already noticed that distress is much easier to tolerate, I'm more mindful, etc. It's nice.

However - there are certain things I'm struggling with, and dont know what skills to apply to combat. These are two things.

The first of which is the awareness of futility, and fear of the future. I am painfully aware of the fact that tomorrow, my entire family could die, or I could face brutal abuse, and no amount of therapy skills could help me. Frankly, the world can be a horrible and cruel place, and it makes any amount of self improvement feel almost counterintuitive, and as though as the smart solution is to...Off yourself. I won't, I'm just aware of this thought pattern, and I think it impacts my commitment to the treatment.

The second is my struggle in identifying which of my interpersonal needs are valid, and which may be unfair. For example - my boyfriend and I had a fight last night because I felt as though he never listens to me (I was showing him YouTube videos, and he rolled over and groaned). Objectively very rude - but what degree of response is warranted? Or the time I got upset with him over something I completely made up in my head, and was quite unpleasant about?

25,Progress from episode to DBT skills,"please read, especially if you have intense emotions/BPD. healing is possible it just takes a lot of time and effort, it's about making that choice every time to either stay in your old harmful habits or to try the healthy strategies you've learned. also, I HIGHLY recommend DBT for anyone, especially people with trauma and or people who need help getting their life in order in general.  


yk you've made progress(BPD edition) when you go from this: getting so upset that I cry for 5 hours straight, repeatedly texting a certain person any way I can to the point it's an issue, SHing from being so upset, wanting to unalive, blaming myself for all of it, and losing all self respect/self esteem.  


to this: setting a boundary and sticking to it, maintaining self respect, not apologizing for something I didn't do, taking responsibility for anything I actually did do wrong without excuses, validating myself, checking the facts, giving the person space, not escalating the situation, staying in wise mind instead of emotion mind, letting myself feel what I'm feeling without judgement/amplifying it/blocking it out, maintaining safety, gently noticing and pushing away harmful thoughts, and distracting myself instead of completely losing my shit like I used to.  


the first one was always embarrassing, made me feel significantly worse, ruined my friendships/relationships, destroyed all self respect/self esteem I had, coming out of it with ALOT of regrets and damage to everyone involved.  


the second one feels ALOT better, I felt proud of how I handled things, I didn't hit the extremes of depression/anger like I used to, I felt like I had my own back for once while still being respectful, I looked back over what had happened and was able to recognize a couple places where I could've handled the situation better and thought about how much progress that was and how I can do better next time, and overall felt I did a good job not making things worse. I was able to maintain the friendship and have little to no regrets about how I handled things.

38,Reflections After 1 Year of DBT,"  Hey there Reddit, so I wanted to do this for myself, but I know that I found these sorts of posts helpful when I was just starting my recovery journey. I post this here in the hopes that it helps one person, because having been through this shit, I know how difficult it is, and how much better things CAN get, with a combination of luck, effort, and the right therapist. None of that shit is easy to find, and I feel extremely fortunate to no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for BPD. It was the hardest thing I’ve done in my life to point – harder than college, harder than working 80 hours per week in a job I hated, harder than the nights I laid in bed crying with emotional pain. There’s a dialectic between “it’s worth the effort” and “the effort takes a LOT out of you” that I want to strike right up top here, because I know this shit doesn’t go quite so smoothly for everyone. Just know that I’m wishing all of you luck, better days, and skillful means <3

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So today marks the one year anniversary of my first visit with \[my therapist\]. I don’t honestly know if that truly “counts” as a year in DBT, since there were a few sessions we had before I formally committed, but I’m finished with group and scaling back to one-on-ones every other week, and hopefully once a month by the end of the year. So it does feel like an important date to both mark and celebrate, and a good opportunity to reflect in a bigger-picture way than I tend to do. 

It’s honestly a bit difficult to remember my mindset back then. Not to say I don’t remember the struggles and the pain of searching for the right therapist, but in a very real way I feel like a fundamentally different person now compared to when I started. So it’s both tricky and a bit painful to recall that time, because I was truly adrift. I’d quit my job with no notice after a full-on breakdown, had flown out to see my family and barely survived the trip. I knew my older brother, who I was staying with, had a gun in his house, and I remember needing to tell him NOT to let me know where it was, or how to access it. There have been some low points since then, but that trip stands out as the last truly difficult thing I went through before getting started with DBT, so I do think that’s noteworthy. 

I do remember having quite a bit of shame that I even “needed” DBT, or any sort of therapy, to start with. I was raised to believe that your problems are self-created, and I felt like if I had caused myself all of this emotional distress, there MUST be some way I could fix it by myself. I tried that for a few months, and it was a spectacular failure. I tried reaching out to non-DBT therapists, tried BetterHelp (should be called BetterNotHopeForHelp), tried just looking up resources online – I was aware of DBT, and that it was considered quite effective at treating what I was dealing with, but I was also aware it was a major commitment, and part of me still held out hope that I could salvage the burning building that was my internal reality without having to accept that there wasn’t much worth saving, and that the right move was to let it burn down to the foundations and start rebuilding. I’ve always been a bit jealous of those who got ID’d at a younger age, I think that process would have been less intimidating in my 20s, but the idea of essentially starting my life over at 34 just seemed too daunting. 

There was also a lot of shame at the beginning that I didn’t know any of the shit that DBT was teaching me – in a lot of ways, it felt like needing to take remedial classes in being human. It wouldn’t be until I was around six months in that I read through the DBT workbook cover to cover, and came across Marsha’s quote that “’Aren’t these skills your mother was supposed to teach you?’ I always say yes, but for many people their mother just did not or was not able to get around to it.” That was a big perspective shift for me - I don’t know why I expected myself to know things I was never taught, but that alone went a long way for me.

While the past year has been extremely difficult, it’s also not an exaggeration to say it’s the best year I’ve ever had as an adult. I managed to find a fairly validating environment in college, which I think went a long way to heading off the worst of my symptoms (though there are a few breakdowns that I glossed over at the time that stand out with the clarity of hindsight), but honestly I don’t know that I was ever happy after college. 12 full fucking years of misery before I could swallow my pride to reach out for help – I wish I’d done it sooner, but I also don’t know if I would have been ready for it then. Everyone has their own path, and maybe mine needed to go through a long and undeniable valley of torment to get me there. Maybe it didn’t, but no amount of regret can change the past, and I do think knowing just how deep that well went helped me stay committed during the tough times, of which there were many.

I also can’t help but reflect on how incredibly lucky I’ve been throughout this process.  When I first reached out to \[my therapist\], she wasn’t taking on new patients, but I guess I sounded desperate enough on the phone that she squeezed me in. Given how well a fit we ended up being, I can’t help but wonder if I would have gotten to where I am with another therapist. I don’t know how I would have felt about being “rejected” by the first DBT therapist I had the courage to reach out. Despite how badly I was struggling, I was very much in the “I’m sure I’m actually faking all of this shit” vortex that many of us on the quieter end of the spectrum struggle with. I might have taken that as evidence that, actually, I wasn’t even struggling that bad, that so many people had it worse than I did, that I didn’t deserve help, and that I was a true piece of shit for thinking that I did, even for a moment. I’d like to think I would have found my way to DBT sooner or later, but knowing how I was at the time, I’m very unsure and it’s scary to think what my life would look like now if I didn’t. I also can’t overstate how much having a great match with my therapist helped – I didn’t trust her right off the bat, but by a few months in I trusted her pretty much unconditionally. I don’t know that I’ve EVER trusted another person as much as I trust her, and I don’t know that this whole thing would have stuck without that trust. 

So I’ve talked about this idea of “changing” quite a bit in these journals, and it is that, but it’s maybe closer to reclaiming (or just plain claiming) an authentic self. My self-hatred went so deep. I knew all of the worst parts of myself, and I fucking detested them, was disgusted by them, couldn’t even stand to look at myself in the mirror or reflect on what I was feeling because it was so much easier to just deny and numb with an insane workload to keep me occupied during the day, and enough weed to drown out my own internal monologue at night. I’m still not sure that I love myself – that self-loathing was such a prominent feature of my existence for so long that it’s fair to say that only a year of work, even if it was incredibly hard work, wasn’t enough to completely undo that. But, I accept myself, and I think I even like myself. I wouldn’t have thought either of those things were possible at the start of the process (at least not the self that I actually ended up embracing – I was more interested in becoming a different person than I accepting the person I was). And, to be fair, despite my optimism about DBT, I didn’t have a whole lot of confidence in what was actually possible at the start of the program. When \[my therapist\] asked for long-term goals, I REALLY struggled to come up with them, because I thought that what I wanted wasn’t possible, at least not for me.

And I guess that leads me to the now, and my worries about what comes next. I’ve been a bit depressed since I got my results that I no longer meet the diagnostic criteria – I knew it was coming, but I think a part of me was holding out hope that there was some secret trick that would be revealed to me once I got to that point. And maybe I’m discounting the extent to which that did happen, but not in the “fit it on a bumper sticker” sort of simplicity I wanted. DBT has provided me with a path, the tools to stay on it, and the tools to come back to it when I wander off it (and I expect I will continue to wander off it. I tend to think success is measured more by your ability to come back rather than your ability to never stray). I suppose it’s a bit more muddled than that – there wasn’t a day when I suddenly woke up and knew the way, no more than there was a day when I woke up and realized I was no longer a child but an adult. That liminal space between the two is more massive than I think I anticipated, and only now towards the end of the process am I able to look back over my life and really appreciate and feel just how far I’ve come.

Among the many things that DBT has brought into my life, I think one of the most lasting will be end up an appreciation of Buddhist philosophies. I don’t think I realized just how baked in those practices are until after reaching Marsha’s autobiography and seeking them out myself. But, this passage still makes me happy-cry every time I read it. The author uses the word “awakening”, but I think you can just as easily substitute “recovery” or “building a life worth living” or whatever else you want. It really gets that the “two steps forward, one step back” nature of the process, and what I anticipate the next steps will look like for me. 

“But no sooner is (awakening) glimpsed than it is gone. Cessation of craving is like a momentary gap in the clouds. The sun shines brilliantly for a few moments, only to be covered over again. We find ourselves back in the humbling fog of anguish, craving, habit, restlessness, distraction. But with a difference: now we know where this track goes…

Henceforth, the resolve to cultivate this path becomes unwavering yet entirely natural. It is simply what we do…Awakening is no longer seen as something to attain in the distant future, for it is not a thing but a process – and this process is the path itself. But neither does this render us in any way perfect or infallible. We are quite capable of subverting this process to the interests of our far-from-extinct desires, ambitions, hatreds, jealousies, and fears. We have not been elevated to the lofty heights of awakening; awakening has been knocked off its pedestal into the turmoil and ambiguity of everyday life.”

44,About to embark on a 32 week DBT/Therapy program - spaces available in the group DBT sessions,"I am about to bite the bullet and begin a course of therapy and DBT training.  It’s going to send me into debt, but I’ve been in debt before and never for anything this valuable.

After searching online, I have found a licensed professional counselor and psychologist who is trained and experienced in working with pwBPD and in facilitating DBT Skills training sessions.

This therapist has a solid track record and (like Linehan) does not suggest medication – and very importantly to me, does not suggest facing or exploring traumas during this program.  This appeals to me.

I am in Asia, so I have been looking all over.  This counselor is based in the UK – and recommends a 32 week program – two sessions a week. One session each week will be group DBT Skills training, and the other will be 1 on 1 sessions exploring and applying the DBT training.

Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 2 (8 weeks) 	emotion regulation
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 3 (8 weeks)	interpersonal effectiveness
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 4 (8 weeks)	distress tolerance
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness

What is really tough for me is the cost – the session cost is 95GBP per session.  However, they would pro-rata this rate for the group DBT sessions – 95 divided by the number of participants.  That appeals to me because I learn very well in a group, and the pwBPD support group I take part in has been very valuable to me.

They are currently reaching out to colleagues to learn if there are others being treated who would like to be part of DBT Skills training and therapy.  So I want to share that opportunity here.

I recognize it is expensive.  I am fortunate enough that a close friend has seen how I suffered in the past 18 months and is lending me the money – it will take me quite a while to pay it back but its so much more important than anything I ever went into debt for.   It is also a solid commitment – they require we sign a contract  to commit to the program.

While it might not be for everyone here, I thought it might be worthwhile to present it to see who in this subreddit is interested.  I am eager to get started, to finally take a step I have never done and commit to 8 months of difficult weekly work.  It would certainly make it easier if the group sessions had 3-5 people, and not only me or me and one other.

IF you are interested, feel you can manage the cost (with a group session reduction as indicated), and want to know more; PM me.  I am happy to share the therapists profile and answer what I can, and connect you with them if you want to know more – they offer a free consultation session to help you decide if its right for you.

I just recently got married (for the third time) and I'm really trying hard to communicate better with my husband, be more forgiving of myself, and be mindful.

I am organizing (not leading, mind you) a Zoom based WEEKLY DBT work/study group, taking place at 7:00am here where I am in Asia, 7pm on the US East Coast, 4pm on the US West Coast, and Midnight (ouch) in the UK.  (I think we all know there is no common time that suits us all).  I'd like to get started this coming weekend (12-14 Feb)

This will be a weekly 1.5 to 2 hour Zoom meeting focused on the group working through a DBT skills training workbook together (I'm leaning towards the DBT skills Workbook by Brantley, McKay, and wood) I will commit to every week so I'm looking for similar commitment.

This would NOT be a social group, although certainly we will seek to create empathy and support.  I prefer we all use Reddit handles and strongly discourage outside-group communication between fellow group members.  We will discuss some guidelines to help us make sure all involved have a voice, and that the group is safe from monopolization, redirecting, or harassment.

If you have been diagnosed with BPD and are interested in a serious, committed work/study group for DBT Skills training, then please PRIVATE MESSAGE ME\* with the following information:

* reddit handle (no real names please)
* your home GMT time (not US time zone, Google your GMT)
* Day preference
* your age
* preferred pronouns
* date of BPD diagnosis by a licensed professional

(So for me it would be be: Ira Johnson, GMT+7, Saturday or Sunday, 53, he/him, mid 1995)

I am a learning and development professional, and I will be happy to set up a safe space for the initial conversation and structure.  I want to work with those who are committed to DBT work and study (and not folx that are 'interested' or want to 'try it out')

If this does not fit you, or you are uncertain about committing, or have not been diagnosed by a professional; I hope that you can reach out and organize something that fits you better.

Finally please **do not share or repost this** in other subreddits, even BPD related.  I trust this group, and participate in a few others; but there are those that contain toxicity (or at least lack empathy)

&#x200B;

Thank you all very much.  I'm looking forward to getting help by learning DBT skills and supporting others to do the same.

64,I’m trying DBT skills but I’m still being irrational,"I wrote my therapist an email yesterday and asked her a couple of questions. She responded today and told me the questions are hard and she’s not sure when she’ll have time to get to them. I’m really struggling with this and feeling like she’s just not going to answer them at all. I have no reason to believe this. She’s always made the effort to answer my questions honestly and I know these ones were hard and it could take her a while to process them and write something that isn’t upsetting. 

It’s a bad pms week for me and I’m overwhelmed with sadness and anxiety. I don’t even know if DBT skills will help because hormones makes thinking rationally difficult. 

So far I have tried:
- Checking the facts - I know my thoughts and feelings aren’t at a logical intensity
- Eating something because I’m always upset when I don’t 
- Spending time with my cats 
- Watching my favourite TV shows
- Sitting in the cold
- Journaling 
- Writing about why it’s irrational and why she’s not going to ignore me. Also reading the notes she gave me reminding me she does care and just doesn’t always have the time I need 

Are there any other skills I could use to be a bit calmer about this? I don’t want to get angry with her over something she hasn’t done wrong.

I was so shaken up when I started..it felt like preemptively mourning parts of myself, if that makes sense. But I stuck with it and 3 months in I'm seeing a tremendous amount of progress.

 I have an hour with a one on one and 2.5 hours of skills group every week in addition to phone coaching during business hours. The appointments with my one on one have shown me so much about how and why I developed the patterns I have. Getting to the root of... everything...is helping me cultivate self compassion which I have never had previously and learning to use skills and consequently reducing destructive behaviours is helping me gain a level of confidence I didn't think possible. It feels like every week I'm having a breakthrough...it's wild. Mind you I'm 38 and have been ""doing the work"" for 4 years now, (I didn't receive the BPD diagnosis until 2 years ago, I just thought all my symptoms were from bipolar disorder, which I also have).

 It's just so wild to me to feel like recovery is actually possible. Not like I expect BPD to ever fully recede but I do believe it's possible to experience long periods of remission. I want to siphon every drop of this 6 month program. I know I'm lucky and not everyone can access treatment and that is enraging because we all deserve it..but yeah...if you can access DBT I can't recommend it enough, if you're ready to do the work.

I see a psychologist who specializes in DBT for an hour every Tuesday and have group every Thursday for 2.5 hours. I also have access to phone coaching. While I'm beyond grateful for this support, I'm realizing how vital the processing piece is for me. Like many of us, I have C-PTSD and multiple events of PTSD. 

My mood is really destabilized, not just emotional dysregulation, but the bipolar component too is being deeply affected. I feel like I have no time to recover between sessions so I'm just always feeling unstable these days. I can't afford therapy that isn't covered. I don't know what to do. 

Group yesterday triggered me so hard, a particular group member, and I slept on and off for 16 hours since. I had to disconnect twice because I was about to lash out at her.

69,Has anyone talked to their DBT therapist about repressed memories of childhood trauma that have suddenly resurfaced?,"I’ve been reading The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk (an excellent book, but one I’d recommend with hesitation), and it’s caused fragments of repressed memories of severe childhood trauma to come to the surface. 

I used to think I didn’t even *have* any trauma, so this has been very unsettling for me. I’ve just been trying to accept that it happened and grieve for myself as the little girl it happened to.

I know I need to talk to my therapist about all of it, but I’ve been putting it off for weeks because my job was so stressful. I wanted to wait until summer break when I had as much time to myself as possible to have a breakdown if it came to that. 

But now it’s summer break, my appointment is tomorrow, and I’m absolutely terrified. I don’t want to talk about it at all with anyone ever. I know that I need to, but the thought is excruciating.

Part of this stems from the fact that I don’t know what will happen. Do DBT therapists usually work with trauma?

(To be clear, I have a wonderful therapist who has never said anything like this to me and has *always* validated how I’m feeling.)

72,My DBT therapist gave me the greatest compliment I could ever ask for.,"A little background: I started DBT in February of 2018. I completed the year long course and decided I wanted to do another 6 months of DBT. I started the other 6 months in October of 2019. I am schedule for my final session of the group portion of DBT on Monday.  

Even though the world is in chaos, I am fortunate to still be able to meet with my therapist via video appointments. At my individual appointment today, she mentioned that if I want to, I can attend Monday’s video appointment as my last DBT group session. 

We where talking about the use of DBT skills in everyday life. She told me that she is 100% comfortable with me graduating DBT. She said if she wasn’t, she would suggest I do another month. She said that where I am now in my life compared to where I was 2 years ago is a huge improvement. She said that everything that has happened in my life this last year and all the decisions I’ve made shows how truly far I have come. 

She talked about how I’ve become mindful of things in my life which has lead me to become more self-aware (the main thing that I became self-aware of was how bad my drinking had become), that I no longer use mind alternating substances, I’m repairing/handling my interpersonal relationships in a different way, I’m actively involved in my sons life, I’ve gone back to school and I’m actively using the skills in my every day life not just talking about using them. She told me to be proud of everything I’ve accomplished.

73,Used DBT skills to avoid acting like a c*nt and ostracizing myself from my support system,"I’m actually really proud of myself for this, even though it’s just...something that’s common sense to normal people? 

As I’m sure a lot of you can relate, I tend to hold grudges over small, stupid things that everyone has forgotten about. A **literal** year ago, my friends and I had a heated debate/argument (not even a fight) about the use of social media in activism. My stance was basically that people shouldn’t be judged/pressured into reposting about every bad thing in the world or else be thought of as a bad person or a bad activist. I think social media is, for the most part, fake and people weren’t reposting about Social Justice to actually make change or help anything, but to get “points” for saying the right things. 

My friends disagreed in a way that made me believe that they thought less of me for using my instagram as just a way to post about my daily life (I’m not sure if they actually do believe that, but that’s my interpretation). I haven’t used instagram much this year from the stress of that conversation, and because of not wanting to come off as a bad person for not reposting. My friend group and I haven’t talked about the topic since, and they’ve given no inclination that they’ve thought about it either. 

When I go on instagram, their stories are all filled with various causes and petitions (some of them with blatantly false info lol), and I still feel like if you repost so many “SHARE THIS OR ELSE” posts, each one loses a lot of genuine emotion. When I’m overloaded with a seemingly endless amount of information, I just shut *all* of it out. 

Anyways, I came across this meme and I had such a strong urge to repost it. 

https://i.imgur.com/BzthqHN.jpg

And I a year ago I would have just reposted it and felt smug, but I actually thought about the consequences of my actions instead of acting emotionally? 

Posting the meme...wouldn’t suddenly make my friends change their worldview and take my side. They would **know** it was an obviously petty dig at them (because it would be), they’re not stupid. It might make me feel better in the minute that I posted it, but it would only make my friends think less of me and/or hurt their feelings. 

And I guess it’s sort of a personal radical thing for me to realize I don’t actually want to hurt my friends’ feelings? I just don’t want them to think less of me. But again, posting that meme would not accomplish that lol it would do the opposite. 

I care a lot about my friends, and I always unconsciously try to downplay it because I don’t want them to be put off by/overwhelmed with the intensity that I love them. And I don’t think that’s serving me as much as I want it to. 

They’ve really been there for me the past year, and show and say that they care about me all the time. They helped me move apartments when I was too depressed and anxious to get out of bed. They make healthy home-cooked meals when I come over because they know I mostly reheat frozen dinners. For Christmas they all got together and got me a bike so I could join them on bike rides. Every time we first see each other, we all hug. And every time we leave we hug again and tell each person we love them and to text the group chat that we got home safe. 

Anyways, usually I never think before I do anything and it bites me in the ass, so I’m happy I prevented myself from just acting like a huge bitch out of nowhere. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",1618675166.0,False,46,5,Raunchey,None,mstc1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/mstc1z/used_dbt_skills_to_avoid_acting_like_a_cnt_and/
74,"Another example of me using DBT skills to try to regulate my emotions, thought it might be helpful","Hey! So awhile ago I posted my journaling process on how I coped with emotions (I deleted it because I was paranoid about having too much identifying information on my profile) and people seemed to find it helpful, so I thought I would post about how I dealt with something upsetting that happened last night. 

**Backstory**: Downloaded Hinge and matched with a guy I thought was really attractive. We immediately planned a socially distant date that night and after seeing him in person he was STILL attractive, which is kind of rare for me because usually when I meet up with them in person, I’m kind of disappointed. 

The date wasn’t amazing, but I thought he was really cool. When we left the outdoor dining place we were at and started walking towards his place, I let him know as an FYI that I wasn’t going to sleep with him on the first date (because that hasn’t been working well for me lmfao), but we could make-out or something. I even said that after a couple more dates/hangs I’d most likely sleep with him because I thought he was hot. He made a pained sound and said, “Ahhhgggg, sorry raunchey, ahhhhg. I mean.....” 

I knew where this was going, so I just said, “Ouch...” and asked if he’d at least walk me home? He went half a block and said, “you can manage from here, right?” and I said “ouch...” again and went home. 

Texted my quarantine pod/DND group and asked if anyone wanted to watch a movie, and here’s what followed: 

***(GC NAME: fuck freaks)***

**ME**: does anyone wanna watch a movie tonight ;-; 
okay if nah! 

**S**: im workin all night sorry bubbin!

**ME**: all good -_- 

**Z**: I got dnd b group :[

**ME**: :'-( all good!!! 

**T:** I can't tn either bb 

**ME**: i get ya! 
if anyone wants to today or tomorrow i am free.. 

**T**: I'd be down to get a video chat goin tomorrow if folks are interested 
But I don't think I'll be hangin out irl outside of our testing window. Id be down to like stack a Monday hang or something?
Also -  I should be clear that I'm not trying to impose that on anybody else, I just have the most roommates and they both work in congregate settings. So I am tryna be extra careful for mine and everybody's sake 

**C**: I will also not be hanging out beyond our sunday sessions despite the fact that I wanna hump yall all the time. 

/end 

Two other people in the group chat didn’t respond, but they usually don’t unless they’re agreeing to meet up. 

(TW: self harm mention below) 

I was really, really upset and tried to watch a movie with my roommate and her boyfriend (attempt at DBT crisis survival skills) but my emotions were too much. To be completely honest, I ended up self-harming and then dealing with the cleanup and fallout of that for the rest of the night. I made some vent tweets, but nothing too passive aggressive. I unmatched with the guy I met up with, but didn’t angrily message him. 

In the morning I was still upset, but I used some Emotional Regulation skills so today isn’t totally ruined as well!

Here’s what I wrote in the notes of my phone, and honestly...it worked. I feel better. I’m not gonna act psycho? 

— 

okay......alright 

situation 1: the bad date 

**emotion mind** - hurt!!!!! i feel ugly and unlovable!!!!!!!!!! and annoying and weird!!!!!!!!! why wasn’t i good enough to keep seeing?? i didn’t want to fuck, so i’m useless? wtf!!! angry!!!!!! 

**reasonable mind** - i know nothing about this man. i have no reason to be emotionally attached to him besides the fact that he was attractive and a little charming 

**wise mind** - if he’s the type of person to send someone home if they don’t sleep with him, he’s probably not someone i wanted to get emotionally invested in anyways. i would have been a LOT more hurt if i slept with him and THEN he was a dick. i stood my ground by saying upfront that i wasn’t gonna sleep with him on the first date 

—

situation 2: annoyed with the fuck freaks 

**emotion mind** - no one cares about me!!!!! i’m annoying and manipulative and they’re mad at me for crying during the last dnd session so they’re punishing me by withholding comfort and affection! i wanna pull away and punish them (for not being there for me) by withholding MY affection

**reasonable mind** - they are worried that covid cases have spiked again. even though we were being lax before, they are anxious (for valid reason). they have shown time and time again that they care for me. they offered up alternatives that didn’t involve physically meeting. i didn’t tell them i was upset, i just used vague emojis. s and z were legitimately busy as well. 

**wise mind** - i miss my friends and i got used to physical comfort in times of distress. just because they didn’t cuddle and watch a movie with me last night doesn’t mean they don’t love me. they didn’t do that to hurt me. i will see them sunday. i’m seeing [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] on friday, maybe also saturday. i am loved, we are just in a PANDEMIC.

81,hitting rock-bottom,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""
-Panic! At the Disco.

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439573.0,False,1,7,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1ad08qo/hitting_rockbottom/

I am so overwhelmed with my all of my baby's needs that I feel like I don't have the mental capacity or presence of mind to use any of my skills. I'm having trouble staying mindful of my thoughts and my emotions and it's led to panic attacks and angry outbursts. 

My fiance and I have argued more in the last 2 weeks than we have for the last 2 years. He said I've been emotionally abusive and gaslighting him.

88,Sashbear training saved my relationship with my loved one (teenage daughter with BPD),"I have a loved one with emotional dysregulation and Sashbear (Canada) provides DBT training  (free of cost and self referral) to family members, partners, people who have a loved one with BPD.

Their webpage ([Sashbear.org](https://Sashbear.org)) states ""Empowering family members and communities with life transforming skills and hope, through workshops and evidence-based programs at no charge"" 

Their 12 week (2.5 hours/week plus homework) program teaches emotional regulation and problem solving skills so that family members can get off the emotional roller coaster that often takes over daily life.  

I completed the course 2 years ago.  After the first meeting I had hope, real genuine hope. After the second meeting, I realized, that I was going to have to change my personality and it was not going to happen overnight.  

For the first time, I am able to respond to my daughter's outbursts with a genuine calm state of mind and I am able to help her manage her emotional dysregulation rather than making the situation worse. Instead of focusing on her dysregulated behavior in the moment, I focus on understanding why the behavior happened in the first place. Our relationship or overall family connections has improved such that we say ""Love you"" multiple times a day and that especially helps to defuse blow-ups. 

In the past year, there was an emotional dysregulation event that resulted in my daughter saying ""I hate you!"" with an intensity that was unmatched to previous versions. I felt like I was struck with a load of bricks. Rather than responding immediately, I left the supper table and excused myself for 3-5 minutes. After a few deep breaths, I came back to the table, sat down and told my loved ""You said that you hate me, but I love you. I told it too you yesterday, I am telling you now and I will tell you again tomorrow. I know that you love me because you said it yesterday and the day before that. I understand that you are frustrated with XYZ but you are in a dysregulated state of mind and when you are there you are going to say things that you do not intend to say. It's okay, we will talk about this later when you are calmed the fuck down. okay?""

After I said this, there was a fearful expression on my daughters face as she realized what happened. Her hateful words were not true and she had no power over my emotions. She has not said it since, although she tells me to F-off a couple of times a week (when dysregulated), but I ignore it.

My daughter's upcoming BPD life challenges are not going to disappear, however at least I can support her in a meaningful way and protect my own mental health.

For those with BPD in Canada, please recommend Sashbear to your loved ones so they can help you to manage your BPD in a loving and supportive manner that protects and enhances their own mental health. 

The Sashbear training modules are the same or a slightly modified version of DBT training skills. This can be very helpful for those doing DBT training for the first time,  as other family members can also put the DBT skill set into practice. The more you practice, the more it sticks.

Sashbear also has an expert series of youtube videos covering many different topics.

Before finding out about BPD I felt like I was just crazy I knew there was something more than just anxiety and depression and when I finally found out what BPD was it legitimately saved my life. 

I finally had a word to describe what I was going through I knew it wasn’t just me I found communities that helped me and told me I’m not a horrible monster because of my BPD. 

I fought tooth and nail to get the diagnosis of “emerging BPD” and now that I’m recovering and getting better I’m scared that if my symptoms do go into remission it’ll be dismissed as “teenage hormones” 

I’ve been out of therapy since May 2023. I’m living a good life I have two amazing partners that I adore (I’m polyamorous) and I’m getting so much better. I still experience the same symptoms I did before but now I have the skills to manage them. 

I’m scared that if my symptoms go into remission and I no longer meet the criteria for BPD then that means that all the fighting and begging to figure out what was wrong was for nothing. I’m scared I’ll be dismissed as just a “moody teenager” in future years. But I’m not going to let that stop me from recovering. I know a diagnosis isn’t the be all and end all but my BPD diagnosis genuinely saved my life and I don’t want to let go of that ",1710335537.0,False,4,3,Tanno8490,None,1bdr418,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1bdr418/im_doing_really_well_but_im_scared/
102,Wanting to support others,"Hello beautiful people,

I am a therapist based in Australia who received a BPD diagnosis a few years ago (although I believe I no longer meet criteria) and has been facilitating DBT groups for the past year. 

Through my work, own research and lived experiences, I have learnt a lot, and I have reached a point in my journey where I feel the next step for me is to share what I know and help those who don’t have access to or can’t afford DBT or treatment for BPD/complex trauma. 

I am not exactly sure what this would look like, it would not be traditional/formal therapy - but I am thinking about starting a structured online DBT group or offer one-on-one online meetings where I could offer support.

109,"Giving up hope= peace? (TW: suicidal ideation, overlong post)","I’m currently in Pokhara, Nepal on a work trip (teaching and performing theater) and stuck in he hotel with a rough sinus infection.  I found this in a bookstore here and those four questions made me think about living with BPD. 

Context about me: diagnosed in 1993, many years of many medications with intermittent success. Moved overseas and built a new life and business in 2007, married the love of my life and enjoyed a decade of life but was unmindful of my emotional volatility and how it impacted others. After moving to yet another country to grow the business in 2019, the pandemic led to bankruptcy and my wife leaving me and beginning a clear plan to end it all. Fortunately I was introduced to DBT and IT WORKS WHEN I DO THE WORK… but when things get extremely difficult it can be overwhelming to do the work. 

I’ve lost most of my close friends due either to distance or them being overwhelmed by me being ‘too much.’  I have been living alone now in the second country for a while, and over-working to fill the emptiness (and to try to pay debts and build some sort of financial stability). My DBT therapist declared I’d mastered the skills and was changing his business model, so that relationship ended two months ago. I wished him well and lied that I don’t fantasize about suicide any longer. I enjoyed the healthiest living relationship of my life for 6 months; yet we began knowing it would end when she relocated to the other side of the world. Although I was a much better partner to her- even so, at the end, she shared that I left her very little emotional space because I took up most of it. Now I’m in a third country for another week; much less developed than I’ve encountered, and managing this sudden illness alone. 

I used to think happiness was found in relationships. Yet, my emotional BPD mind (and to a large extent my personal experience) reminds me that everyone will leave my life at some point. Obviously with BPD Abandonment issues, this is a challenging thought to embrace. 

I’ve known all emotions are transitory and impermanent and that DBT isn’t a method to happiness but a way to manage and tolerate our pain and behaviors. 

I crave connection; I want to talk to someone who loves me and wishes to understand me. Yet when I’ve had these people I always eventually burn them out. 

I take things very literally. When my ex wife insisted we would remain close friends I believed her and of course that didn’t happen.  When my ex said she wanted to remain close and always talk, of course that did not happen. It’s hard for me to parse that someone can say something they don’t mean, or that later will be untrue.

Now I’m sick in a strange land.  And I crave conversation and validation and affirmation and love.  There are those that would say they’re there for me but history has shown most aren’t interested in my drama. Even my best friend is dismissive and too busy to talk. 

Then I find this book. 

I now theorize that interpersonal connections inevitably bring pain and suffering to one or both. No interpersonal relationships will last. The idea of joy and love and affirmation from others is illusory.  And ‘hope’ is the most destructive and hurtful concept. 

I’ve built a double career based on interpersonal connections - both in theater and corporate consulting. I’m more consistently unhappy than I was pre COVID. I’ve invested so much, and I’m still struggling so hard…. I’m debating retiring from the theater side (although I have a strong international reputation) and focusing on consulting and training and money.   This is something I’d prefer to talk through with a loved one… but my best mate said I’m ‘just spiraling’ and a person I’ve begun dating told me to ‘calm down.’

I don’t expect others to make concessions for me. And although my diagnosis isn’t my fault; it’s my responsibility to manage how I impact others. 

Maybe it’s time for radical acceptance- give up hope and understand life for me will be continued pain.

116,Going to start treatment tomorrow,"I (M23) was diagnosed with BPD last month after I went to the hospital for suicidal and homicidal ideation. I also scored super high on antisocial and narcissistic traits, and I'm not sure how to feel about that, even though I know it's true. I know that having this disorder doesn't make me evil, but it felt like the psychiatrist was calling me that. The hospital people put me on Latuda (I'm on 3 other things too, and one doesn't work so I'm tapering off) and told me that I have to get a DBT therapist instead of the psychodynamic one I've been seeing for 6 years and love very much. They also referred me to a partial program, which I start tomorrow.

I'm really nervous. I'm in a lot of pain. I have rage episodes when I'm alone, and panic attacks, and I drink and cut myself. My mood swings are intense, and I go between being tired, and just hating everyone and wanting to hurt them. I'm also bipolar and am having a depressive episode right now. I know I have to stop these behaviors, but I don't know much about DBT or the coping skills that are part of it, and I'm afraid that it won't help me. I want it to, but part of me is scared to get better. I know I have to talk about the negative ways I think about people and myself, and the violent impulses, but I have so much shame. I'm also autistic and have meltdowns from overstimulation and social situations, and I struggle with communication and talking, so it's hard to gauge what is BPD and needs to be fixed with DBT, and what is autism and would be harder/unethical to try to change. I don't want my therapist to mix up the two and hurt me.

The doctors also want me to go back on lithium. I was on it for 7 years and it really helped me, but the side effects ended up being sooo bad. I think it might be best to go back on it, though, because I feel like my mind has been punishing me since I went off.

127,I’m surviving the worst part of my life. Recovery IS possible and I’m proof of it.,"Long post ahead. Tl;dr at the bottom.

For some background, I’m 29, just got diagnosed BPD last September. Despite that I struggled my entire life (suicidal thoughts, self harm, toxic relationships, MULTIPLE trips to the ER and I still was never properly diagnosed). I started DBT in October and just finished the program in April. I also started lamictal last year but just got on a dose that worked for me around February.

A little over three weeks ago, my husband got physically violent with me. He had “only” been verbally abusive in the past, which I let happen because I believed he would get better, even though he never even promised he would. 

And I LEFT. I just LEFT. I’ve never really felt the FP thing, but I definitely let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to me in the past. And I know if this happened a year ago…I would have stayed. I would have let him tell me he only hit me because my behavior made him. I would have let him make me believe I was the one who was getting the second chance to not fuck up. 

But after a year of intense therapy and meds (less than a year actually) I had the ability to leave him. And when he tried to control me, I still left. And when it meant I’d have to live alone, I still left. And even when I had a full emotional breakdown on our first wedding anniversary, one week after he hit me, I still left.

Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am for keeping myself safe, something I never have done in the past. This is the hardest and worst thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. But I know I’ll survive, and honestly, I owe that to DBT and all the work I put into it.

Please don’t give up hope. Keep trying, keep putting in the work. It’s worth it and so are you.

I've had depression for years, and I put it down to unresolved childhood trauma, but I didn't make the connection between emotional dysregulation and my depression.

I've been in a psychiatric hospital programme for the past few weeks, and I've been finding the process really overwhelming.

It was suggested I take on DBT and Schema therapy. After also realising how many holistic aspects I need to integrate into my life from what has been covered in the programme, I'm now completely emotionally burnt out.

I'm lying here feeling like a heavy bag of cement, a metal band around my head and an empty hole in my chest. I feel like there's so much I need to do. 

The 'all or nothing' and catatrophizing thinking is in full swing.

But after my last hospitalization I told myself I was going to change my life and was no longer gonna let my life be ruled by my BPD. It’s almost exactly a year since I was hospitalized and I don’t recognized the person I used to be. I used to be so skeptical of DBT or any therapy/therapists because I thought I was smarter than them/it. It seriously seemed so dumb to me for so long which is why I never received treatment when I was younger. I can’t attribute all of my recovery to DBT but I did find it more helpful than anything else. Anyway the point of this is that YOU CAN CHANGE NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT SEEMS LIKE YOU CANNOT. I realized I’m too smart to be blaming my mental illnesses and instead dedicated months of my life to researching how to heal myself and change my life. At this point I no longer fit the criteria for BPD diagnosis. There is this indescribable sadness or emptiness that came with recovery though- after realizing how much of my life I missed out of, how much my identity was tied to bpd, how many of my life decisions came out of my inability to regulate my emotions, etc. but there is hope in this emptiness … I can create the person I want to become and u can too",1675293186.0,False,19,2,pinklilies27,None,10r9fw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/10r9fw1/i_think_im_recovered/

We’ve been broken up for almost a year now. I idealized them so much and they felt like a god to me at times. I’m demisexual so they were the first person I felt comfortably sexual with (all online, we never met in person thankfully) and I really felt like I gave myself to them and I would tell them that. They had a porn addiction and would cheat on me online and hide it from me, which led to huge suicidal breakdowns. I felt really violated and degraded from it but I couldn’t leave them. I have bad jealousy and passiveness issues to begin with and this fueled them, causing intrusive thoughts (I have a lot of pure ocd symptoms) and worsened my sex repulsion so much. They broke up with me but wanted to stay in contact as friends but they led me on that we’d get back together again (not on purpose). Months later I find out they are in their first in person relationship with someone and was hiding it from me bc they were scared of how I’d react bc of my bpd. I blocked them on everything after this. I now have this repulsion/phobia of romantic relationships. It makes me not want to see/talk to people in relationships. It’s just so triggering and causes jealousy and intrusive thoughts of my ex with their current partner. I feel so ashamed and pathetic from this. I feel scared and uncomfortable with people who have sex. I can’t even talk to my current DBT therapist about this partly bc she’s married. I’ve told her about my sex repulsion a bit. I don’t know how to fix this but I hate it and want to think normally. I’m on Prozac and am slowly increasing to 80mg which is the dosage for OCD. I want to try EMDR when I graduate DBT.

140,A Twist on Radical Acceptance,"&#x200B;

My personal favorite distress tolerance skill is probably the least popular skill in all of DBT: Radical Acceptance. 

I know I need radical acceptance when I have the sensation of clinging to the side of a volcanic crater, scrambling madly for a foothold to keep me from plummeting into the boiling lava.  

Radical acceptance is not saying 'I accept that there is no foothold beneath me, I will hang here calmly and accept the situation until my arms give out and I inevitably die.'

Radical acceptance is saying 'Okay. I am dangling by my fingertips above a pool of lava. There is no foothold directly underneath me.' 

Once I've radically accepted whatever circumstance I'm in, options begin to appear. A ledge I hadn't noticed before. The rope my climbing partner threw down. My radio. Before I know it, I'm on the rim of the volcano, shaking and exhausted, but safe. 

Before DBT I didn't know how to accept it. I'd just keep scrabbling and scrambling, desperate to survive, looking for a foothold that doesn't exist. In my panic and resistance, I'd miss the ledge entirely, drop my radio, pull my partner down with me, all the time insisting that the foothold HAS to be there.   


It HAS to be.   


No, love, I tell myself. It doesn't. The foothold doesn't have to be there. Your lover doesn't have to want you back. Your boss doesn't have to praise you. Those things would be nice, but they aren't your only options.

I know that people like us have functional deficits, even in recovery, that are linked to temperamental traits (irritability, mood lability, negativity bias, impulsivity, etc). These deficits are the reason that only half of us go on to achieve normal interpersonal and vocational functioning after our BPD symptoms have gone into remission.

Here's the question: Does anyone have any post-treatment resources for those of us whose BPD symptoms are in remission but who want to maximize our functionality at work and in our relationships? Any resources that deal with temperamental problems as opposed to just behavior/thoughts?

147,Passed the Bar Exam Today,"At the risk of seeming egotistical, I (29M) wanted to post this for anybody really going through it as proof that you can do that thing people say you can’t do because you’re borderline.

I’ve had a lifelong struggle with what I know now to be Borderline Personality Disorder. In highschool, I was bullied so aggressively I had multiple near death experiences and my family’s home was repeatedly vandalized. My dad was repeatedly battling advanced stage cancer and I had to take care of my brother through the end of highschool while struggling with what I know to be CPTSD now. I was (mistakenly) diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety when I was 18 and told I would need to live a low-stress, safe, low pressure lifestyle. I hated this. 

For years, through college I struggled with both being over-medicated while also being inadequately helped. I hungout with dangerous, aggressive people through college because that level of dysfunction felt normal. I graduated college with a double major, but struggled to function well in the workplace. Bad relationships with toxic people was all I knew.

I spent 5 years in a majorly abusive relationship with a toxic narcissist that resulted in multiple hospital trips for stitches and broken glass removal. When that ended, I was a law student and the stress of the breakup led to lots of psychiatric problems, the vast majority of my friends abandoning me, isolation, suicide attempts, and self harm. I had to drop out of law school twice. My CPTSD and providers’ mismanagement of meds was so extreme that I lost the ability to read for almost 18 months. But I graduated.

I wasn’t even able to take the bar exam when I wanted to- my law school made me join a disciplinary program designed for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems because of my mental health problems through law school due to the extreme stigma against mental illness in law. I had to delay taking the bar exam after graduating because my mental illness was regarded as “a danger to the public.” Joining that punitive program was the only way to convince my state licensure board I could be trusted.

Finally, I was diagnosed BPD and started to get better through DBT. DBT saved my life. I gained the skills to put myself back together. Today I have an amazing girlfriend, a nice small house, rescue pitbull, new friends (through my girlfriend) and a couple old friends that stood by me, and now a new career in law as an attorney in a mid size American city as of finding out I passed the bar just this morning. 

Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn’t a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it’s an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don’t deserve it. Do that thing everybody says you can’t do and tell anyone who tries to stop you to eat shit.

148,Advice: Dealing with Physical Symptoms of Emotional distress,"Hello, as the title suggests I am looking for some advice on how to deal with the physical symptoms of emotional distress. 


Maybe 2 weeks ago the low had hit - crying all the time,  having to fight my body so I can get dressed and go to work, struggling with getting house work done, showering, brushing teeth etc. 


Now recently, I had to face great emotional distress and hurt, and on top of that it has triggered everything that happens within an episode physically - I can't eat, I sleep only few hours per day, cannot stop moving, find myself purposefully almost dehydrating myself (where I feel thirsty but just don't act on it for hours etc), feel sick to my stomach and have issues with having an upset stomach, etc. 


The issue is living alone, having a full time job and not really having much of a support system. I tried getting on w my DBT workbooks, everything I have learned in therapy over the years etc, but I also know that until I can address the physical part and start taking care of myself on a ""being made of flesh"" level, the emotional distress will linger.

152,From the other side of recovery: realizations after 10 years of therapy,"I no longer identify with my BPD and rapid-cycling bipolar diagnoses, mostly because I do not fear abandonment like I used to, and I have fewer extreme highs/lows. It took 10 years of weekly therapy (sometimes 3 sessions a week) and lots of meditation/DBT/studying Buddhism, but I think I'm finally there. I told my therapist two months ago that I was ready to stop seeing her and try to work through things all on my own. 

It's been going really well, and my family has been supportive of my decision. I think they can see how much I've changed, which makes me really proud of myself. I've been considering whether my decision to end therapy was just another BPD splitting thing or manic decision. After two months of being locked in the same house with my family (thx COVID), it's clear that I've actually made progress, so I made a list of things that I am grateful for because of therapy/recovery from BPD--on the other side of it.

1) Having BPD means that you've been through the lowest of mental lows. I can't count how many times I felt like I was physically dying because of a BPD-related fear/sadness. Once you get better at managing BPD, you'll realize that other people don't have past experiences like that to help balance catastrophic anxiety. We already know what ""the worst"" feels like, so it's not as scary. And we know it'll get better (life has its own mood swings), even though that's hard to remember. Ngl-- knowing how deep in the dark I've been makes me feel kinda badass for making it out.

2) Our emotional depth lets us experience life in the most immersive way. Humans have something like 30,000 emotions, but I swear the people I know have 10 max. The capacity to feel is what makes life worth living. When you can manage how you respond emotionally to things, this is probably our superpower imo.

3) Compassion. The drama, trauma, and general intensity that comes with BPD has put me through a lot. Like with any hardship, getting through it has made me aware of how life is tough on all of us. I crossed paths with SO many people who had no idea I was struggling with BPD, and I'm grateful that some of them showed me compassion when I had hurt them. Now, when someone is unkind to me, I recognize that it probably has nothing to do with me. Everyone is going through something, and we're all just doing our best.

4) DBT skills are just awesome in general for everyone. I've had psychologically-sound friends tell me they need advice (read: anxiously rant while I make a mental list of DBT skills that could help them). When I share the skills that have worked for me, I realize that DBT was a HUGE stepping stone that helped me become more emotionally healthy and self-aware than the average person without a mental health diagnosis.

5) This one is personal, because I don't know how many people with BPD experience symptoms from a young age. I was diagnosed at 15 years old, and I am now 21. (My parents sent me to therapy for anxiety when I was 11, so 10 years of that). I can't believe how far I've come in terms of emotional maturation, and I'm still so young. It just makes me excited for future personal growth:)

TLDR; If you're working on recovering from BPD, you're doing great! Recovery helped me develop mental strength, capacity for emotional connection, compassion, widely-applicable DBT skills, and a better future.",1586820768.0,False,55,10,pancakes904,None,g0uafg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/g0uafg/from_the_other_side_of_recovery_realizations/
153,Question to those who are recovering from BPD - how long does it take to 'fix' identity issues?,"Hi everyone!

I am 28 (f) and I have been diagnosed with BPD \~2 years ago (I've been in therapy long before, but it was not helpful until I found good DBT therapist).

For 1 year I had a very intensive personal therapy and DBT trainings, finished it 1 year ago (the demand is high that's why my therapist let me go once she admitted I was stable enough), I am still doing exercises, reflecting a lot, and I feel like I am recovering.

Don't take me wrong - BPD is still part of my life, but life is *in order* now.  

Here's the trick - although I managed to gain distress tolerance skills, improved interpersonal communication, managing emotions etc - disturbed identity is something that I can't 'fix' yet.

I keep questioning where's me and where's the disorder, and it seems like the most difficult part of my recovery. This is one of the reasons why I am hesitant about getting into a new romantic relationship - I am scared that because I sometimes don't know what I want/need, this won't be healthy.

I'm starting to suspect that this is something that I cannot force and it will take years of life without BPD turmoil before I start feeling more 'solid'.

155,My therapist questioned her own diagnosis,"Hi everyone!
I've been in therapy doing DBT for over 4 years. I first went to that therapist in 2018 and she pretty quickly (2 months/3 appointments) diagnosed me with BPD. To me it made a lot of sense and helped me understand myself better, and DBT has worked wonders throughout the years, with ups and downs of course. But still I have changed enormously so much so that my therapist told me a few months ago that she thought I didn't meet the criteria for diagnosis anymore.
I still struggle with BPD, and sometimes it gets frustrating that I'm not ""completely normal"" (i know, no one is) and can feel awfully intense things even though I'm managing to not let them impact my life negatively anymore. I was talking about this with my therapist at our last appointment and she reassured me that to her, I was still making progress. And then she said: ""you've improved so much since our first appointments that sometimes I question if I even got the right diagnosis"".
I've tried to not give it too much thought but!!! It's very hard not to have an existential crisis over this. I've already had an ex partner (ADHD+autism) who told me numerous times that they thought I wasn't BPD but rather autistic etc. The fact that even my therapist would come to question my diagnosis makes me really anxious and sad, like I could lose a part of myself. I know I shouldn't over-identify with BPD (even if the diagnosis is/was correct) but I would much rather think that I have BPD and therapy helped that think that I have another, yet undiscovered problem. I'm trying not to let my mind spiral about it (did I have PTSD? should I get tested for autism??) but I don't know what to do. Should I tell her at our next appointment that maybe she shouldn't have told me that? Should I seek another diagnosis?",1667904656.0,False,3,1,crestfallenTM,None,ypiiw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/ypiiw3/my_therapist_questioned_her_own_diagnosis/
156,Struggling with nightmares from the past.,"Throwaway account here.
So first a bit about us. You can skip to the question if you want.

My wife with BPD and i are together since 2008. We were at the tim 16 and 19 and did go through alm rough times together.
She got diagnosed at first with depression during our relationship and at the age of 18 with BPD and ADD. We did go to different therapist over the years. Some more usefull than others. She had for around one year a really creative one, who brought some ideas for her sleeping problems, but dropped out of the profession due pregnancy. She has now a therapist specialized on DBT. And she did some hughe improvements.


Question;

Now that she made hughe improvements in the last half of this year, but still struggles a lot with nightmares, where she falls back in her childhood, mixed with her current life.
We're now hoping to find something, that might her help with this. It really bothers her, since she feels like every progress she made, isn't there. In addition, she's not well rested.
Anyone had similar problems? If so, what helped you?

One trick I've found with DBT skills is that a lot of times you gotta string a combo together if you ever wanna really do damage to your maladaptive instincts. Like for lesser ones you can just spam one skill (usually stop for me), but once you start reaching the boss levels you gotta start stringing together combos.

UPDATED 3 FEB: Well, my big issue in organizing this is that there's no time that suits everyone globally.  Yet I need this and several of you are clearly interested. 

So I'm going to schedule this based on my time (GMT +7)  but trying my best to take others into consideration. I'M GOING TO GET IT SET UP BY FRIDAY 5 FEBRUARY. 

For those still following/interested- this will be a weekly 1.5 to 2 hour Zoom meeting focused on the group working through a DBT skills training workbook together (I'm leaning towards the DBT skills Workbook by Brantley, McKay, and wood, or the DBT Skills Manual by Linehan) I will commit to every week so I'm looking for similar commitment.

Our first meeting will involve selecting the workbook, getting comfortable and creating a safe space, and adjusting anything. I'm an experienced and certified learning facilitator and arts teacher, so I can get us started process-wise but otherwise i want us all equal and collaborative. 

On Friday morning Feb 5 (remember I live in Asia) I'll send info to those interested who have responded with the following in my Direct Messages (not a comment to this post, and I'll take those who provide ALL the following info (I'm a Virgo, possibly some level of OCD- But those who do DM me with this will have at least read and understand the intention here)

- reddit handle (no real names please)
-your home GMT time (not US time zone, Google your GMT)
-your age 
-preferred pronouns 
-date of BPD diagnosis by a licensed
 professional 

So for me it would be
be
-Ira Johnson 
-GMT+7
-53
-he/him
-mid 1995

I apologize because there will be no way to fit everyone who expressed interest. However for those that don't fit (time zone, inability to commit, preference for different workbook or style etc); I'll advise you if you like on setting something up... but let me get this one off the ground first.  I really need help, and I think others may too. 

Thank you so much. That's a lot to read. Please DM me with the 5 pieces of information I mentioned. 

Uncle Ira

19 JAN:  Thanks to those who have PMed me.  I'm currently working on a big project for work that will take place in less than a week - after 26 January I will have a lot more free time as we enter the Chinese New Year/Winter holiday season.  So after 26th if you have PMed me, watch for an update.

UPDATED:  Thanks for the responses!  Some have PMed me- if you're seriously interested and willing to commit, please PM me. 

Here's what's gelling at the moment:
-group of 8-12
-weekly commitment 
-DBT workbook/skills training 
-safe space (we will define that together)
-meet via Zoom 

Ideally I'll set something up next week, not to get right to work but to create the group collaboratively.

The key for me will be commitment of those involved. Let's approach this with empathy, authenticity, vulnerability,  trust, and integrity. 

Uncle Ira


Anyone have any suggestions on the best way to keep this safe?  I want to make sure that committed people in need can take part.

Serious interested people who read this and are willing to commit to a weekly Zoom meeting, please PM me.  It will be hard to find a time that suits all time zones but we can try.  I have organized online events for global audiences and usually only one or two folks has to get up super early.

Please DM me with your preferred name or handle, your time zone, and any other thoughts or information.

&#x200B;

I hope this can become active with ideas and thoughts:

Has anyone any experience with online support groups for BPD?  This subreddit is thankfully helpful and non-toxic, yet just go a few r/ over to some others... some can really hurt.  That's the thing for me, I want to be open and share, and talk to others, but I am frankly very scared of miscommunication causing hurt, and of trolls bombing the experience.

Miscommunication because we are each different in our struggle.  I am 50+, White, American (from the south, at that!), cisgender, hetero, agnostic, and not living in my home culture.  As you can imagine, some of the results of that combination result in my thinking not being as progressive in some areas.  I am very open-minded but not always quick on the uptake.  For example, I appreciate those in the LGBTQIA/BIPOC community who have helped me understand and change some of my behaviors and programming that are otherwise rooted in white western patriarchal bullshit.

Support groups require a lot of trust because we need the space to be vulnerable.  You do not know my real name or details, but in other parts of the redditsphere people are eager to do detective work and share others personal details.

I really have come to appreciate this subreddit, and would be really interested in participating in or setting up some kind of online support group.  In my career I am an experienced and respected facilitator of learning and development workshops, so I can easily design and help facilitate a simple format based on [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) \- I love this system because its co-designing the workshop with all the learners.  My company has a pro Zoom account that could be used as well.

I hope I can be a part of a weekly live-call support group, where the numbers are kept at a manageable level for sharing yet enough people are present to provide different perspectives - max 10 maybe? But then I do not want those in need to be excluded...  Perhaps there can be some demonstration of commitment, those who want to be part of such a thing for a period of time rather than just dropping in to try it out...  I'd love to share and hear tips and strategies and serve as a sounding board and have the accountability and support of such a group.  I'd especially love a situation where a group of us could work together towards DBT skills, but without prohibitive cost (I imagine, especially in times like these, that there are others of you who simply cannot afford typical DBT training costs - I cannot).

If the idea of such a group interests you, please share here - what would you want to see?  How would such a thing be useful to you?  What fears or concerns do you have?

It's something I want to be a part of, not necessarily something I want to organize.  I'd happily defer to an existing support group, or to a licensed counselor or therapist.   However if what we/I are looking for does not exist, then maybe we can create it.",1610685255.0,False,18,16,IraJohnson,None,kxn2hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/kxn2hk/online_bpd_support_group/

It helped me tremendously, It meant i wasn't crazy and the things I've always felt were legitimate and had an explanation. From there I started treatment with medication and therapy and DBT skills and my life got more balanced. 

So now I've been in a serious relationship for 3 years. We got married and had a baby and I'm currently pregnant. We both work from home and he is a very present father and husband, he is always with us. He is not secretive with his phone and gives me no reason to think he is cheating. 

However my BPD brain thinks something is happening. I downloaded an app yesterday for school (telegram) and saw he had an account and was last seen online last month. I freaked out and accused him of using it for cheating and he got extremely mad I and began to react saying he was making his bed and that this was the beginning of the end. I calmed down a bit and asked him to explain why he had downloaded it but he got defensive and said he doesn't need to justify himself. I began spiring, that hadn't happened to me in a while, this is the first relationship I have that I didn't cheat and we built a family so I feel super vulnerable.

The smallest things can cause an outburst, meltdown and my reaction is an insane rage, to the point where I physically have to hurt myself to let it out and I shout and look scary. I tried out different meds in the past, but my body had a bad reaction to even the smallest doses, so my psychiatrist told me to stop.

174,What's made you successful?,"Hi all - I think there is a small bump in the viewers of this sub from the question I asked in /r/BPD yesterday.  I think a lot of us are some way down the path of recovery or gaining control again in our lives.  I'm not too far down, only about a month in, but I'm trying everything I can to stay focused.  I definitely have my setbacks, but they seem to be occurring less and less.  

So, what are you doing that has helped you consistently or consistently-ish?  How consistent has it been?

**For me:**

1.Studying DBT. This includes:  
  
* Self-study (Online course, purchased the official DBT workbooks)  
* Official program through my psychologists (Actually a mix of schema and DBT therapy)
  
2.Studying discipline and habits and putting them into practice.  This includes:   
  
* Using a timing technique, and dividing all tasks into 5 minute pieces.  This helps me overcome and procrastination, seems to be addicting in a way, and I end up doing way more work than I expect most days.
* Forming everyday habits around household duties, exercise, spending habits, therapy, journaling, planning, DBT skills, tasks I normally procrastinate on, and even interaction with others.  
* Planning the majority of tasks every night before bed.

3.Thinking of others instead of myself.  This includes:  
  
* Calling my parents or reaching out to a friend/acquaintance every day, even when I don't want to.
* Reaching out to others I know are in pain  
* Looking for people in crisis online and making donations, learning about them, etc.  
* Journaling about my children, 5 minute gratefulness journaling which includes being thankful for others in my life.
* Planning activities with others and going through with them

Learning new tools to handle my emotions, developing many healthy habits and finding a way to stick to them (simple timing techniques), and putting much more emphasis in thinking of others around me when I tend to think of myself has been life-changing.  For about a month so far.  Two major emotional setbacks during this period, both when I decided to drink heavily.  In general I'm avoiding alcohol, and only allow myself to drink once per week (from Marsha Linehan - the more successful modern programs for alcoholics are not complete abstinence), however, I'm not strong enough to control myself once I start at this point, and it doesn't usually go well unless I'm around others.",1507020826.0,False,8,15,mgale85,None,73z6rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/73z6rc/whats_made_you_successful/

I have known my whole life something else was going on aside from severe ADHD I was diagnosed with in early adolescence along with all the other random diagnoses, codependency, substance abuse problems, anxiety, etc.. some I’ve overcome on my own some I still struggle with but not like splitting. 

I found a DBT therapist today that takes my insurance and am now taking steps to be the person I am deep down when the anger doesn’t have a hold on me. I honestly don’t know how my husband has put up with me all this time and I’m so thankful I got a proper diagnosis so I can be the mom, wife, and person I am deep down all the time here eventually. 

I struggle with extreme splitting where I do things that generally go against my moral compass. I never split on my son but I do get irritable easy when stuff is stressful. When I get angry its almost like I become the monster I used to hide from as a kid and the thought of that when I come down from the anger turns into instant remorse, pain, and regret. I will say very nasty abusive things to hurt him and have even shoved him/ gotten in his face. How do you learn to recognize and shut down the anger before it takes you over?

My family always told me I was like this. I thought it wasn't true but then I started to believe it.

I think now, however, that they are right. I have a DBT group therapist, regular therapist and psychiatrist. They're all at the end of their ropes with me and my psych just dumped me on Thursday. The same day, I told my best friend (who wont talk to me on nights or weekends bc that's when she's with her husband) that I don't want to be a backup friend. She told me she's had enough of my shit and pushing her away and she's done. I think other friends have tried to tell me I'm abusive bc I push them away before they can push me away. I don't know if I'm doing that with everyone right now or not, but my psychiatrist definitely dumped me without any referral elsewhere and I really believe my DBT therapist and regular therapist also don't want to work with me.  My DBT therapist is on call 24/7 for my group but won't return my phone call or email from over two days ago. 

Two of my exes told me they can't criticize me bc if they do, they're afraid I'd kill myself. My mom has always done that to me my whole life too. I think I have become my mom and that I'm emotionally abusing everyone around me, including my therapy team. I don't have any family, friends, or even acquaintances left. I'm scared. Help? I think I've ruined every relationship around me.

183,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ,"Does anyone else consistently feel like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?

Genuinely it’s this horrible phenomena I’ve experienced for almost my entire life. It feels like there are 2 different people inside of me.

I’m Dr. Jekyll in the ways that I’m calm, I can be social, I have dreams, I enjoy having friends, I care about my health, etc.

My issue lies in that I feel like I’m constantly keeping Mr. Hyde at bay. 

Mr. Hyde is not me. I don’t know who he is or where he comes from. Every now and again his horrible urge takes over me. It’s the worst thing ever. The worst part is I FEEL like I’m still in control but somehow the Mr. Hyde part of me takes over without me realizing and “he” wreaks absolute havoc on my life. I’m mean. I’m absolutely vicious. I say rude things to people I love. I treat the people I love with disrespect. I turn into someone who is not fun to be around. I become a person that I do not want to be around. 

The worst part is when I finally calm down and come to my senses I’m left with Mr. Hyde’s mess. I feel like I’m constantly looking back at my actions and doing damage control. 

I don’t want to do damage control anymore. I just want to stay in control.

I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago. I am now in my third year of therapy with two clinical psychologists: I have been through DBT, CBT, CBT-TF, Schema Therapy & mentalisation. It’s been a fight to stay alive so I can become a clinical psychologist to help treat those with personality disorders. I found out last night, after a lengthy internal review process, that a charity advocating for Borderline personality disorder awareness called “Emotions Matter” have decided to use their website as a platform to further spread my dissertation project. They have recently been on Fox 5 News too where they continuously fight for the stigmas we face. So often I’ve felt I’m not really making much of a difference, and whether my fight and passion is going anywhere, but this feels like such a great first step in primarily BPD awareness but also my career aspirations & the differences I want to make. You can find it in the “advocacy” section of their website over the next couple of days🥹🧡

Currently on 10mg of lexapro, 150mg of trazadone, doing acupuncture, therapy, and taking herbs. I want to get off of lexapro so badly. I've gained so much weight on it and it's become unbearable having to carry all of this literal weight around. I hate my body and I don't feel at home in at all. But unfortunately, lexapro helps me sleep. My insomnia is really bad, like up for days because my body won't let me sleep kind of bad. I want to get off of lexapro and trazadone. I want my body to let me sleep naturally. I want to heal and manage my symtpoms without having to take medications with awful side effects.

I was doing so well, I got to a point where I genuinely loved myself and felt genuine happiness, something I never felt before! I was developing healthy, stable relationships with people and exuding this confidence I never thought I was capable of experiencing; however, after a very traumatic car accident that I caused, I became severely depressed again. I felt defeated and ashamed. My progress began to retrogress. I started to gain a considerable amount of weight. I stopped practicing self-care and self-love. I feel as though I relapsed into my old mindset and started to revisit some my old toxic behaviors (black and white thinking, idealization & devaluation, suicide attempts and other dramatic gestures to avoid abandonment, etc.). Now, a year and a half later, I feel stuck. I have no motivation to change, and I feel so consumed by my negative thoughts and toxic, self-destructive behaviors. It’s so bad that I even ended up in the hospital again two weeks ago. I haven’t been to the hospital since before I started my DBT sessions over 3 years ago. Reaching rock bottom again, I feel I need to change! What baby steps should I take towards recovery again? What are some ways I can practice self-love?

2,Is DBT effective for BPD. !,"## My friends, focus well on dialectical behavior therapy with your therapists.

**Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is** **proven to be effective** **for** [treating](https://www.amazon.com/Borderline-Personality-Disorder-Journal-Dialectical/dp/B09MDH5RDR) **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).

3,What is wise mind in DBT?,"Have you ever snapped at someone and surprised yourself with how harsh you sounded?

You may have thought, *whoa… where did that come from?!*

You were probably acting from what’s called “Emotion Mind” in DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy). DBT is a therapy methodology developed by Marsha Linehan which helps people feel more in control of their thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

When in emotion mind, people react based on their mood, without taking logic into account.

**You May Be in Emotion Mind If:**

* You’re reacting quickly, without thinking things through
* You’re acting on urges without taking into account your long-term goals
* You’re behaving impulsively and aren’t considering potential consequences of your actions
* You want to hurt who hurt you, even if you’re not typically a vengeful person
* You’re not considering anyone else’s feelings or additional context of the situation

On the other end of the spectrum is Reasonable Mind, which is rational, logical and steady.

You might be thinking, *okay, reasonable and rational, that sounds good! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time must be the goal, right?*

Actually, no! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time isn’t ideal, either. 

**You May Be in Reasonable Mind If:**

* You feel cut off from, or “numb” to your emotions
* You minimize or shrug off your feelings
* You rationalize your own or others’ behavior, even behavior that is unacceptable
* You are avoiding or in denial about something that is happening
* You are completely focused on a task

When we’re in Reasonable Mind, we’re cut off from our emotions. It’s important to be aware of and feel our emotions. First, because it’s an essential part of the human experience. More importantly, emotions contain very important information we need to understand our needs and boundaries.

Here’s an example of why awareness of emotions is important. Let’s say you feel angry and irritable every time you see your friend. Reasonable mind might say you’re being irrational and dismiss the feelings. But chances are there’s a good reason why you’re feeling angry at them, especially since it keeps happening.

Maybe they’re putting you down a lot, or not listening to what you’re saying. Or maybe you feel jealous of them. Finding the answer to why you’re angry is important to figuring out how to resolve your anger, whether you do so on your own or with the other person.

There are a number of potential reasons why people have difficulty being in Wise Mind. Maybe they haven’t had many people in their life model what it looks like to be in Wise Mind. Maybe staying in Reasonable Mind has protected them from extreme traumatic reactions. Maybe acting from Emotion Mind has gotten their needs met, for better or worse.

When you’re able to acknowledge your feelings without acting impulsively on them, you’re in Wise Mind.

**You May Be in Wise Mind If:**

* You’re taking both your emotions and logic into account
* You can name and feel your emotions
* You’re considering different ways to proceed before acting
* You can see the situation from multiple perspectives
* It feels like *you* are in control, not your mood

If you’re rarely in Wise Mind, don’t worry! You can increase your Wise Mind skills with practice.

**Ways to Cultivate Wise Mind Skills**

* Pause throughout the day and ask yourself which state of mind you are in.
* If you are in Emotion Mind, label which emotions you’re feeling.
* Using coping skills before acting on your feelings (for instance, journal, go on a walk, or take a hot shower).
* If you want to engage in a behavior that’s impulsive or mood-based (for example, emotional eating, texting your ex, substance abuse, etc.)
   * Delay the behavior by 1 hour
   * Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or peer before engaging in the behavior
   * Consider the negative consequences of the behavior
   * Replace the behavior with something less harmful (for example, drawing on your arms with a Sharpie instead of self-harming)
* Participate in a DBT program in your area. It can help you develop not only Wise Mind skills, but also, a wide variety of other skills related to Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Relationships.
* Practice yoga, Tai-Chi, or other physical activities that help you get in touch with your body. These can also help you develop more awareness of yourself and your emotions.
* Talk to a therapist! A therapist can help you stay accountable as you work towards strengthening your Wise Mind.

6,How do you get know if you’re projecting or not? I asked chatGPT. The response made me realize that I might. What now?,"Here’s the response I got: 

Projecting involves attributing one's own thoughts, feelings, or traits onto another person. Here are some signs that may indicate you're projecting:

1. **Overly Critical of Others**: If you find yourself frequently criticizing or judging others for traits or behaviors that you dislike in yourself, it could be a sign of projection.

2. **Strong Emotional Reaction**: Feeling intense emotions, such as anger or resentment, towards someone else for reasons that seem disproportionate to their actions may indicate projection.

3. **Denial or Rationalization**: Ignoring or denying your own feelings or behaviors while focusing on those of others, or rationalizing your actions by attributing them to someone else's behavior, can be signs of projection.

4. **Repeated Patterns**: If you notice recurring patterns in your relationships or interactions where you consistently attribute certain traits or motives to others, it may be worth examining whether you're projecting.

5. **Lack of Self-Awareness**: Difficulty recognizing or acknowledging your own emotions, desires, or flaws, while readily identifying them in others, can indicate projection.

To address projection, it can be helpful to practice self-reflection, increase self-awareness, and explore the underlying reasons for projecting onto others.

7,What Is the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD?," Mental Disorders (DSM).

There's no biologically based test to definitively diagnose borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, mental health professionals often use screening instruments such as the MSI-BPD to help identify the likelihood of BPD and the need for further evaluation and treatment.

Scoring of the MSI-BPD

Each item is rated as a ""1"" if it is present and a ""0"" if it is absent, and items are totaled for possible scores from 0 to 10. A score of 7 is considered a valid diagnostic cutoff, meaning that a score of 7 or higher indicates that you likely meet the criteria for a BPD diagnosis.2

The first eight items of the MSI-BPD represent the first eight DSM-IV/5 diagnostic criteria for BPD, while the last two items assess the final DSM-IV/5 criterion, i.e., **paranoia/dissociation.**

## Uses for the MSI-BPD

Clinicians use the MSI-BPD to diagnose BPD, sometimes in conjunction with other screening tools. Research suggests the MSI-BPD is helpful in detecting BPD in the general population,3 but more studies are needed.

The MSI-BPD test has been shown to be very effective in detecting possible BPD in people who are seeking or have a history of treatment for mental health problems.

## Psychometric Properties

The MSI-BPD has demonstrated valid, reliable psychometric properties. It has adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. It has also demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for detecting borderline personality disorder when a score of 7 is used as a diagnostic cutoff.

[**Coping With Borderline Personality Disorder**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095SHGB9N) 

## Other Screening Tools

The MSI-BPD is only one of several that clinicians typically use to diagnose BPD. These include the following.  


Structured Clinical Interview

This official clinical interview of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is an update of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) but is very similar.4 Your mental health professional may use this screening tool to help determine your diagnosis by asking you questions directly related to the criteria for BPD that are listed in the DSM-5.

This screening instrument also has an optional self-reporting questionnaire with 108 questions, but not all clinicians who choose the SCID-5-PD use this. 

Causes of Borderline Personality Disorder

PDQ-4

The Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire, 4th Edition (PDQ-4) screening test consists of 99 true-or-false questions that can help screen for various personality disorders, including BPD.5

Zanarini Rating Scale

The Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD), also developed by Dr. Zanarini, is used for patients who have already been diagnosed with BPD to test for changes over time.1

Which Tool Is Best?

A recent study comparing correlations, sensitivity, and specificity among the MSI-BPD, PDQ-4, and SCID-II in adolescents and young adults showed they were equally effective in predicting a BPD diagnosis.6 On the other hand, another study concluded that the PDQ-4 ""should not be used in clinical practice as a screening instrument for PD assessment.""7

## Impact of BPD Screening

BPD is challenging to diagnose and treat because it's so often misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder and other conditions. Further complicating the issue is that BPD often exists with comorbidities, including bipolar disorder, and poses a significant risk of suicide.8 That makes accurate screening tools such as the MSI-BPD particularly important.  


Once BPD is diagnosed, the clinician can develop a treatment plan to address it. This might include such targeted approaches as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), which has been shown to be effective for people with BPD.8  


## Potential Pitfalls of the MSI-BPD

Tests such as the MSI-BPD provide a picture of person's mental status only at a particular point in time. Astute clinicians additionally take into account the person's patterns of behavior over time.9

&#x200B;

BPD is a particularly difficult disorder to diagnose and treat. Research indicates that the MSI-BPD is a valuable tool in this effort, however, and takes very little time to complete. Based on the results, a clinician can then help you address BPD's challenges and learn healthy ways to cope with and regulate your emotional states and responses.",1647850548.0,False,3,1,redditerX75,None,tj6rq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/tj6rq5/what_is_the_mclean_screening_instrument_for_bpd/

10,Should I be concerned?,"
I'd like to preface this post by stating that I have toxic behaviors in the relationship, such as invading space, being overly critical, heavy splitting, not listening to his side well, as well as my own yelling and general outbursts. I am in therapy partly to work on these behaviors.  
  
My bf does have some behaviors of his own that bother me, however I'm not sure if some of these are normal and I'm just splitting when I freak out about them. I've communicated about most of these and I've noticed some of it get better, however he's also told me he feels like I take everything as a personal attack and like I don't trust him. Sometimes when conflict has been very heated and I point out something that bothered me, he corrects it but explains he feels like he needs to keep a 'checklist"" of bad words/things to say. The behaviors that have been bothering me are:  
  
\-Swearing during conflict, but I've even corrected him when it isn't directed at me  
  
\-Yelling, he's also explained much of the time he does not mean to yell directly at me, but I have noticed it improve over time.  
  
\-Sometimes when we disagree he says what I said was ""stupid"", I've tried asking him to change it to say that what I'm saying doesn't make sense or something more neutral. I have noticed this get better as well, but he does get frustrated about it at times and doesn't always know how else to describe something  
  
\-Saying what I said was ""useless"", but this is often when I've repeated the same questions over and over or don't add anything to the conversation. He has gotten better about it but also does get frustrated about needing to stop.  
  
\-Saying that I'm being stupid/am stupid, however this has only been when I've highly bothered him and wouldn't give him space during the argument. He's only said this when I've split very hard and have had a giant episode where I won't let him calm down, so he likely does this because he doesn't feel like he has a choice. He does want to work on it, but I understand I provoke it and don't give him much of a chance to act differently.  
  
\-A few times he's hit things, such as the couch or his desk, but this is also often when I won't give him space when he's asked. He has thrown his phone once or twice when I was splitting very hard on him as well, but I've also done this to my phone much more. He's never thrown anything in my direction or near me, and I don't feel like he's trying to intimidate me.  
  
He does know these behaviors bother me, and when things are calm and we try to problem solve again after escalation he usually apologizes and wants to be better. However, sometimes he will say that I took some of it personally, such as swearing. Another thing that concerns me is that during arguments when I ask him not to call me stupid, he'll say ""I didn't call you stupid, I said you were being stupid."", I've read from some people that these things are forms of gaslighting, but I also know I provoke some of it after crossing his boundaries, and that BPD can often make us overreact so I am looking for input.  
  
Many of these things didn't start until I split on him more, however the yelling, swearing, and some moments of him saying I'm taking stuff personally did, as well as saying what I say in arguments at times is ""useless"".  
  
I've been bringing up couples therapy, now that our lives are less busy he said he'll try going. Going is very out of his comfort zone, as he's had trauma around therapists and doesn't think couples therapy is effective, but he said he'll try once a month then see if he's okay going more often. He's also told me if he can't figure out his behaviors on his own he'll try to see a therapist himself. For the couples therapist, he has said he doesn't want to do much of the work of looking for one, but it was my idea so I'm not sure if this is fair.  
  
We were trying to call each other out on these behaviors during conflict and then taking a break before re-engaging, but I've often failed at following through as I've explained. I am in no way trying to excuse my toxic actions. I'm just asking if his behavior seems like a valid reaction to my splitting and how I act, or if I should be concerned and he seems toxic as well.",1683955962.0,False,2,3,thelittlestone568,None,13g8f5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/13g8f5z/should_i_be_concerned/

I thought after 15+ years of borderline behavior and 6+ years of DBT informed therapy, I wouldn’t be in this same spot again, worrying those around me and not knowing what I want or need from them because nothing has worked to make me feel better. I’m so tired, so sad, so lonely. I just want to be loved unconditionally just once.

12,Cutting people off after healing,"Last year my partner and I broke up for many, many reasons, most of which stemmed from my untreated (at the time) BPD and his avoidant behavior and overall hyper independent nature. A classic combo. Our breakup broke me in many ways, but 2023 ended up being the best year of my life because I started going therapy every week, taking medication, learning how to be alone, and forming positive relationships in my life. I still struggle deeply with my BPD, but I've gotten better at identifying my emotions as they arise. This does not mean I have completely changed my behaviors or emotions themselves.

About a month ago, my ex and I reconnected. For some reasons, a relationship isn't feasible for us however the love and friendship is still there. He is still a solitary person and has his own mental health struggles that he hasn't really addressed. He hinted at us being in an ""open relationship,"" since when we are together now, we are loving and affectionate and to him I am the first person he wants to see. But because of our time constraints we both know that we can't fully devote ourselves to each other.

Very quickly into our reconnection, I've noticed that many of my old thought patterns, triggers, and behaviors have arisen. It honestly scares me; I've been really good this year when dating other people to mitigate toxic patterns and I've overall worked really hard to be different. At this point I don't know if it's just him who causes me this pain (because of our history, our love, and his avoidant tendencies) or if I am simply not healed. It is probably both. But he wants us to remain in each other's lives and honestly I do too. But there is a chasm of distance between us and it breaks me. And feeling shitty all the time has taken such a toll on me, because after our falling out last year I vowed to never feel this way again.

I feel sad at the idea of cutting him out completely but I honestly don't know how to feel okay with him in my life or if it is even worth it. I feel so conflicted and I wish I didn't feel anything.

Can anyone relate? Is this just a good opportunity to battle my triggers head on, or is it healthier to just let go?",1702519424.0,False,5,1,Andomasquemal,None,18hxon4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18hxon4/cutting_people_off_after_healing/

14,Holy wow DBT is amazing,"Wow dudes. It seriously is.

I’ve been in CBT with some DBT features for like a year and a half and I made huge strides! But now I moved, and am starting DBT group and a one on one CBT therapist in my new city in two weeks.

I haven’t started the new therapies yet - but my friend who is a psychologist sent me a packet of DBT worksheets for my time off therapy and holy WOW - they are effective.

Personally, they take a long ass time for me to fill out, and I only feel like they work for me because a.) I already have experience with doing logs like this and with cognitive distortions and schemas through my time in CBT, and b.) I already have worked on emotional awareness a lot for several years with several therapists.

But like - this morning my partner said something innocuous of course which scared the shit out of me and immediately felt anxious and scared and angry and confused and I wanted to ask him all these questions and interrogate him and do all my impulsive behaviors…

But then I filled out “check the facts” and wow. It just wild. It took probably an hour for me to really work through it, but I can see SO clearly exactly the route my mind took, and why, and I feel empathetic with myself, and I feel like I understand my partner, and I feel safe and happy and understood and I took no actions that I regret and just…wow.

Get into DBT guys!

15,BPDlovedones…helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I’m talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It’s all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that’s for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don’t really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I’m sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally. I feel like I’m trapped in the mind of a five year old as well trapped in the mind of 1000 year old person. I feel like I’ve lived 1000 lives and sometimes I’m not sure what’s real, what’s a delusion, and what is fact. This is why I love neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. It gives me explanations for why I am experiencing an emotion, why I am reacting to it, and to just remind myself that it’s not that big of a deal. I don’t want to make excuses for people who cannot take accountability of their actions however. I used to do that and thinking about it makes me ashamed. My mother has BPD and is closing in on 50. I have only repaired my relationship with her this year out of pity after cutting her off just as other people did. I understand how she does not see how her actions affect people, and that’s why the mental illness makes relationships difficult. She seems to think that she raised me perfectly fine even though sometimes I didn’t have food and we were homeless at one point and she constantly screamed in my face and hit me. She never hugged me. She never told me she loved me. I never felt like she was my mother. I don’t have a father. I don’t have siblings. I don’t have aunts and uncles. I grew up extremely lonely and the thing I struggle with the most as an adult is abandonment. I think I fear the way I felt as a child. I have had the thought “it will never get better” for as long as I can remember. And now I look around at the life I have created. With the person who I think is the love of my life, my wonderful friends and support systems, my education in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience, my ability to travel to different countries, and ability to have my own things. And yet there’s still a sense of chaos in my life and nothing can ever be stable. Am I doomed to live this way forever? All I want to do is fix this. And I don’t even know what “this” is. I fully support psychoactive compound therapy. From my readings of academic literature, and personal experiences, I think building neuroplasticity through psychoactive treatment is a key component to mental health rehabilitation. You obviously can’t just give people psychedelics and say go crazy—it needs to be monitored, and patients need directed therapy while they are experiencing altered states of consciousness. Becoming extremely emotional, and vulnerable has caused me so much grief, but has allowed me to discover so much about life and help me build extremely close personal relationships with people so I can learn more and give back to the field of neuropsychopharmacology.",1692082128.0,False,14,10,pthevslayer,None,15rku5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15rku5z/bpdlovedoneshelpful_or_harmful_idk_who_cares/

17,I caused the worst fight of our relationship and I don’t know why or what to do now.,"I had a horrible meltdown/BPD episode last night and I treated my also-BPD partner of 3+ years who I live with so horribly for no good reason right as we were trying to go to bed. I pushed him so far past his breaking point that he broke down horribly too and I ruined what had earlier been a really great night out with friends. 

I hate feeling so out of control of myself and especially hate being unable to explain away my poor behavior in any meaningful way. I’m so embarrassed and ashamed of my behavior and I feel like my world is ending. I don’t even have a good excuse for why I pushed it so far. It doesn’t even feel like me doing my actions, but it obviously was. 

I know that I’ve been very overwhelmed lately with financial concerns and I’ve felt the meltdown building in the background. I tried to preempt it by taking the meds that typically manage it but that wasn’t enough. I’ve also tried asking for space/time alone at home to recenter since that usually helps too, but that wasn’t able to happen. I am also on my period which makes my sensitivity and reactivity to much worse. I know these all sound like excuses, but I’m just trying to not feel like an innately horrible person. I understand what causes my overreactions and I don’t want to think it’s all my fault, but I also don’t want to shift blame. I can’t escape the fact that the consequences apply to me alone when I’m the one having the overreaction. I know my actions are my choices and I have to own up to the hurt I cause regardless of the reason behind it.

I’ve apologized profusely since I realized in the middle of last night how fucked up I was being, but obviously that doesn’t change or fix the hurt I caused immediately, which sucks. We’re not at odds necessarily now and he’s accepted my apologies and told me I don’t need to keep apologizing, but it’s still tense and I know I’ve hurt him deeply. We are trying to make things work and get through this fight, but I feel like I’ve just ruined everything and like it’ll never get better. I know that’s just a feeling and that I’ll be okay in the long run, but it’s a really hard day today. I do have my therapy this week and I’m going to talk to my therapist about all of this, I just needed to tell someone so that I’m not holding it all in until Wednesday.

18,My friend with bpd seems to hate me,"My friend was recently diagnosed with bpd, she’s also recently divorced. We got super close after her divorce even had something sexual for a time after. She would call and text me all the time, call me venting about life and I’d just listen. This went on for almost a year, we became extremely close spent most weekends together and she would always either ask to hangout, or be down to do something. Recently over the last month things have changed. In June she found out that her ex husband had moved on and found a new girlfriend. She called me crying and wanting to hurt herself. I talked her out of it and went over cuddled her until she fell asleep and then I left. Since then she has started changing, she seems annoyed to be around me, if I ask what’s wrong she flips out, she’s kicked me out of her house twice for trying to hold her while she’s upset. She admitted to me about a month ago that she and her ex husband and her never stopped sleeping together, that they had only been living apart. I asked why she kept it a secret she said she didn’t want to lose me. She then admitted that two weeks after seeing the exs new girlfriend she started talking to a guy she met on a site. They in just a month they are talking all day, have been on 8 dates, FaceTime at least three times a week, and they are going on weekend away trips. She’s rescheduling her kids and other friends to make sure she can squeeze him in, all while complaining she has not time for anything. I told her therapy is something to look into. She got herself set up and started going. I went with her to her first session and after the therapist asked if I was aware that she showed traits of bpd. I asked what it was and the therapist explained. They set her up for an evaluation and the doctor said it bpd was indeed the case. The therapist set up therapy for us together because she doesn’t have much family. The first session was brutal she never liked me, she couldn’t stand me, I wasn’t her type, she finds me disgusting, I’m annoying, I’m a bother, I’m a crybaby, I’m not her thing, I force her to sleep with me(not true at all), I cause nothing but drama. She goes back in the timeline and say she felt a particular way at whatever point but I can tell you the things she says didn’t happen and I actually at that time got something completely different. She does this with her ex husband as well she says she felt certain ways but he says that there was no way, that they actually were really good at the points she says they weren’t. The therapist says she editing the timeline with intrusive thought to try and justify behaviors. She We had , had  sex two weeks prior to the session and she actually asked me for it  and about two weeks before that same thing. When I asked about the guy she’s going away with she gets angry, she gets dismissive and says I’m bothering her. She’s been talked out of quitting therapy twice because if the therapist brings up the guy she gets big mad. When we see eachother I get the complete opposite treatment as long as I don’t bring up the guy. Shes also when given examples of fp or devaluing says she doesn’t see it that everyone is just making it up to make her sound crazy, she’s living life as a normal person would. When you point out that she’s doing thing out of the norm you are the issue. I miss my friend take away the sex and this is my friend someone I care about a lot. She’s an amazing person but I don’t know how to help or support her.

20,Am I crazy or did I use my skills/boundaries properly?,"(Originally posted in r/BPD but since I'm in recovery for awhile with my BPD I thought posting here would be better)

Update as of 10/13:

//My husband and I ended up looking through other messages between social medias we used together to come to terms with their behavior and again, find more patterns because I'm still trying to fight against their gaslighting. What we found was years worth of posts switching between talking absolute ill of our friend group and idolizing me, dragging and making very long hateful posts anytime one of us ended up in a relationship, the amount of hate and jealousy filled posts related to me was so nauseating that I've been sick for the past 15 hours. There's a lot more but I don't think it's quite on topic for this thread.

I feel much more confident and happy with myself that I was able to control my emotions regarding this situation and know I really did make the right decision. Thank you everyone for the support as well 🧡//

Long story short I had to end a friendship recently due to my boundaries not being respected and asking for mutual respect/support in specific areas of my life.

 I've brought them up for over a year until it got to a point where I needed to take time away to think about my future relationship with this person as their actions were not only harming me mentally but settling into my relationship with my husband and kids (my husband is aware of my diagnosis and is very patient with me. However, I did split more regularly during the times after interacting with this person which initially made us realize maybe I needed to reevaluate the friendship.) I've been going to therapy for my BPD for 6 years, know my subtypes, know my triggers, know when I need to step away and use wise mind. I have multiple workbooks that he and I do together in between the times I don't have therapy to keep up with my recovery as I very much want to work on myself and have for years.

Here is where I feel like I'm crazy: after bringing up that we needed time away from each other and go our separate lives and stating why, I am hearing from others that they're telling people that I abused them. That I sent hateful messages and that I was clearly devaluing them because they've been researching BPD for a little. I was very confused. Had my MIL, FIL and other family look at the messages. They said what I said wasn't hateful. I even showed my therapist and she said no and that I shouldn't be made to feel guilty for putting my kids first regardless of my diagnosis or not.

Am I crazy? Did my black and white thinking kick in? Or did I truly do the right thing and trusted myself? So many people use my diagnosis against me and many times I have to spend DAYS making decisions so I can make sure I'm not reacting out of pure emotion. However, this is my family and they ARE more important to me than anything else. I know after this I don't want them around me or my family ever again anyways, especially for what lies they're spreading. 

Being a mom with BPD is hard but I will always put them first. Their safety and security is most important to me. So why do I still feel bad for ending this friendship?

To update as of today as well with talking with my therapist; she mentioned that my friend is probably a covert narcissist and that it is common for them to shift blame, lie, and fake memory issues to avoid accountability. And since I have BPD that my friend probably dipped and played into that against me, especially since i was never originally diagnosed with it during the start of our friendship.",1697085744.0,False,6,3,WanderingFoxWitch,None,175yhrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/175yhrw/am_i_crazy_or_did_i_use_my_skillsboundaries/
21,Family Doesnt Respect *MY* Boundaries,"I know this is somewhat long but im looking for insight so please bare wih me. I'm 24F and I have come a long way in my recovery. As I've moved into adulthood and have gotten more serious about my recovery, I have noticed the further away I am from my family the better. I dont have issues with others to this degree, if im upset we'll talk it out calmly and in a mature fashion or we share our boundaries and what we need in the moment. When it comes to my family, despite them watch my journey with mental health and all kinds of therapy, their own behavior and actions seem to never improve or change. For example, Im on vacation with my family in new york to visit my sister and her husband and my baby niece. I just wanted to enjoy my time away and have fun in their company. I got irritated because we were trying to figure out plans and nobody was answering my calls/texts (were in different rooms) at this point, im not even acting out or screaming or being rude in any sort. even when im in control im aware that there can sometimes be a tone of irritation in my voice. and so do they... despite that I clearly set a boundary as simple as ""stop"" as I've learned to from therapy only for them to continue. instead of disengaging, they scream at me loudly telling me to calm down or continue invalidating me saying in the moment. Again, i was only mildly irritated. there was nothing major happening for me to \*normally outside of them\* get to a placewhere my anger gets so intense i cry. Instead of respecting my boundries after repeatedly saying ""Stop"" and giving me time to regulate myself (after pushing me to a point where i actually raised my own voice to again say STOP"" its as if they'd rather push my buttons until i get to point to where my anger gets so intense i react. And then they blame \*ME\* and feed into eachothers energy of being nasty laugh at me and sayi ""I cant deal with this"" or ""this is why we dont go on family vacations when all i want is respect and when I try to vent to the opposite party they dont want to deal with it either and tell me to stop. At 24, I've so tired of this despite living on my own already, Im finally at a point to where im ready to be financially independent, leave (them behind or go to a new state or go to school away from them) and pursue my own contentment. I'm not perfect, but there is no respect or awareness held when it comes to me in my family. Has anybody else gone through this? I'll take whatever advice I can get. I know I struggle with a disorder but I can't convince myself its just me anymore. I cant handle the invalidation of them thinking and acting like "" shes just crazy so we dont have to respect her cause its her fault"" just because of my disorder.

Is that just how it's going to be? Is there a way to get well enough to have it stop completely. I'd love to stop thinking he is attracted to any female he shows attention too..

23,how to work on attachment,"Hi. I (20F) just got broken up with by my ex (22M) last night and have been NC. It's a very long story, but he ended things because of my behavior in the past few months being toxic and harmful. He said he loved me, he didn't want to do it, was ugly crying with me, but it was done anyway. Over the course of our nearly 8 month relationship, major life events happened, I lost sight, and he ended up becoming my Favorite Person unintentionally. 

I have been in bouts of crying, but I have been talking with many people and have a rocky plan for the foreseeable future. First, I have CBT and DBT in the next two days, and then on Wednesday I'm going to the doctor to switch my medication (cymbalta) to something else that will target mood swings. I am going to join a grief support group to manage the grief I felt these past couple months. I've written out the toxic attachments I developed and boundaries that we had at the beginning that fell away. 

I'm going to stay NC until Friday, wherein I'll reevaluate everything, but I don't know how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? I don't have these issues with anyone else in my life, only my romantic partner(s), and until the shit of life hit the fan, I was navigating my attachment very well. 

He is truly the love of my life, and we had so many things planned together. Everything was mapped out, and I was so secure with him. I believe when things went down that I used him too much for emotional reliance and we became a tad codependent. We are both anxious attachment, I think, and I have BPD whereas he does not. I do still love him, though, and I want to firstly work on my own issues for a while, but I do want to be with him again, if he'd try us out again.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? Or just any advice in general? 

edit: broke no contact. found out he and his sister are leaving town for a while, so I left him a voice-mail last night telling him to stay safe and that I miss him. said I love you. texted his sister a similar sentiment. the lack of response really feels like I just tore my own insides out, but I suppose that's the decision that's been made. I dont want to lose him, and I feel I already have

edit 2: talked to my dr. the medication I was on for my arthritis gave me psychosis, and my rheumatologist didn't check my mental history before prescribing them. I stopped those, started taking prozac instead of cymbalta, and started 3 omega-3 fish oils, 1 vitamin b1, and 2 magnesium glycinate. i had a phone call w his sister a few days ago and she said he isn't ready to talk yet but it was fairly amicable. sending a text tmrw for his birthday but haven't reached out. going to the psychiatrist in a few weeks to get mood stabilizers. ive done a lot of journaling, therapy, and talking and distracting. I know I can thrive without him and I don't NEED him to survive, but I do love him and he enhances my life. I want us to work out, but I'm not going to spam or go crazy w the contact. After the bday text, I'm not going to reach out, which is hard, but if it's meant to be he will come back.",1711942056.0,False,5,4,casineb,None,1bstfxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1bstfxm/how_to_work_on_attachment/
24,I’m surviving the worst part of my life. Recovery IS possible and I’m proof of it.,"Long post ahead. Tl;dr at the bottom.

For some background, I’m 29, just got diagnosed BPD last September. Despite that I struggled my entire life (suicidal thoughts, self harm, toxic relationships, MULTIPLE trips to the ER and I still was never properly diagnosed). I started DBT in October and just finished the program in April. I also started lamictal last year but just got on a dose that worked for me around February.

A little over three weeks ago, my husband got physically violent with me. He had “only” been verbally abusive in the past, which I let happen because I believed he would get better, even though he never even promised he would. 

And I LEFT. I just LEFT. I’ve never really felt the FP thing, but I definitely let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to me in the past. And I know if this happened a year ago…I would have stayed. I would have let him tell me he only hit me because my behavior made him. I would have let him make me believe I was the one who was getting the second chance to not fuck up. 

But after a year of intense therapy and meds (less than a year actually) I had the ability to leave him. And when he tried to control me, I still left. And when it meant I’d have to live alone, I still left. And even when I had a full emotional breakdown on our first wedding anniversary, one week after he hit me, I still left.

Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am for keeping myself safe, something I never have done in the past. This is the hardest and worst thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. But I know I’ll survive, and honestly, I owe that to DBT and all the work I put into it.

Please don’t give up hope. Keep trying, keep putting in the work. It’s worth it and so are you.

Tl;dr my husband got physically violent and thanks to DBT and meds I was able to leave him, something my BPD would never let me do before recovery.",1657591858.0,False,47,7,devourtheunborn69,None,vwzpxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/vwzpxv/im_surviving_the_worst_part_of_my_life_recovery/
25,"How do I (22F, someone with BPD) stop instinctively verbally abusing my partner with autism? This is plea and rant for help and betterment","I’d like to give some background about my partner and then talk about me. He has high functioning autism (ASD; Asperger’s). He has also been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. While he does not have the diagnosis of Avoidant Personality Disorder, his behaviors often fall in line heavily with symptoms of AvPD.

I began dating him 5+ months ago. In the beginning, of course everything was fantastic (as it usually always is in the beginning). We texted each other and ended up hanging out daily per *his* request. He would spend the night often at my place. Initially, I was a bit off with the attachment because I thought we were both in school and had a lot of work to do. Often, when he came over, I still had homework I needed to finish. He seemed to have a lot of free time. It came out eventually that he was dishonest to me about school. He is not enrolled in our university and got dismissed due to being on academic probation for 3 terms (an entire year). He has not elaborated on why his grades were poor but he only said that he feels shame, which is why he didn’t tell me. I understand that and I understand that his disorders may also amplify the negative feelings he holds on himself.

He is incredibly intelligent (as many people with Asperger’s are). His lack of elaboration, of course, made me try and rationalize why he got kicked out. While I don’t know for sure, my gut tells me he probably didn’t do assignments and labs adequately due to focusing on other things. He is very isolating and often alone, in his room, so I was perplexed by what he could be occupied with. As I got to know him more, I know that his life is dominated with video games, watching media online (like movies, namely animated movies and musicals, and a lot of YouTube videos).

A bit of a tangent but it gets back on topic: Our sex life is dysfunctional. In the beginning for the first 3 or so months, we would be intimate often but he was unable to ejaculate except for one time during penetrative sex. I didn’t put any weight on it because sexual autonomy is important for both parties in a relationship and impotence can be caused for a variety of reasons. Initially, he told me that even when he masturbates, he sometimes can’t ejaculate, so I thought it was a physical and psych issue and thought nothing of it.

Eventually, it came out that he watches porn nearly everyday (namely animated porn, hentai, and just very specific genres for “real-people” porn (as he calls it)). This came about when we were unable to be intimate due to his penis being rubbed raw from his masturbation. His penis would usually be raw when we were intimate so intimacy was uncomfortable, which I didn’t know. We eventually got into a talk and he admitted he has a porn addiction. In fact, he was dishonest about the inability to cum from masturbation because he was shameful. I recommended sex therapy or any kind of therapy for his anxiety and ASD at some point in the future but he said no and that it’s too shameful. I asked him to refrain from maybe a week and he tried but failed and said he was unhappy not being able to watch porn and angry. So his habits continue and we rarely have sex now.

While I don’t know for a fact because he won’t answer most questions I ask, my gut is telling me his failure from school was due to his additions to video games and watching things like movies and porn.

He doesn’t contact me when we aren’t in front of each other’s eyes. He will not respond to my texts despite being in his room all the time. Because he is not enrolled in university, he is taking only a couple general education classes at the local community college and they are all asynchronous.

Eventually, he started making excuses for why he couldn’t hang out as often as we were before, to the point where he would say he would see me tomorrow but send me a text 20 minutes before we would meet that he can’t come over. I never knew why aside from being told he has a lot of schoolwork to do. But I’m not sure about that…I genuinely don’t believe it despite wanting to. My take is that he just wanted the nights to himself to watch videos, porn, and play video games because that’s all he likes to do. I asked him about other hobbies and he doesn’t have any and doesn’t want to try out any of my hobbies, like juggling or resin pouring.

His inconsistency frustrated me because it would destabilize my own plans. So, I proposed seeing each other on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays so he had enough alone time and I also had a bit more stability to my structure. He could have multiple days to engage in his additive tendencies and hopefully that would make the time we spend together a bit more enjoyable.

Which is where I get to avoidance. He can’t communicate long distance (even though we live like a 5 minute bike ride away from each other). The most recent time I tried calling him after he dropped me off (he wasn’t even out of my apt complex yet) was to give him some bread I made, but no answer. No response to text. He responded 22 hours later after I sent a follow up text saying I need to be able to communicate with him sometimes when not in his view. I have brought up long distance communication many times in the past but there has been no change. He just says sorry and that he will try to be better. I want to trust him but experiences with his is making me unable to take his words at face value.

He does the same thing to his parents and friends. His parents got furious with him and made him go home to their house because he would not communicate with them for weeks sometimes, ignoring their calls, emails, and texts. I managed to talk to his parents for him and they let him come back to the area we live in since he still has a lease up here. I talked to him about his avoidance tendencies and how hurtful people close to him feel when he chooses to not acknowledge their existence outside of them being in front his eyes. And it was weird, again, because in the beginning he was more responsive and texty than ME! He was always on his phone and would also tell me he talks to his parents at least once a week.

So this suggests to me that he knows his behavior is wrong, he knows what behavior is right and acceptable, but chooses to not engage in them. Is this a valid interpretation and stance I can hold?

It also really makes me wonder what he’s doing. He’s just in his room, not studying for his original major (electrical engineering) because he got kicked out of the university. He is not in challenging classes and has even told me he waits until last minute (often at night) to submit any assignment he does have. Because his classes are asynchronous, they are often due on one day, like Friday 11:59pm. I don’t understand what he is doing during the day. He doesn’t exercise, he doesn’t leave his room, he is not working, he is not talking to anyone close to him. He’s just on his computer for 12+ hours a day not really being productive…Again, he watches a lot of animated porn (…like Pokemon characters…and Disney characters, video game characters, etc). It makes me feel undesirable. Like why is it that 2D characters are more appealing than a real person he can be intimate with? In what ways am I not satisfying him? I go down on him for upwards of an hour+. When we have had sex, it’s for a LONG TIME! Like my jaw aches from trying to do so many things for him and then he just penetrates me for like another hour. I feel like I am in porn script of his because I genuinely try so hard to make him ejaculate again (aside from that ONE time) and I know it shouldn’t be the focus for any sexual relationship, but when his inability to ejaculate stems not from a physical issue but an addiction to his computer, it gets on my mind a lot and his impotence does become a big part of sexual intimacy.

Lately, when he has been spending the night, he has been unable to sleep. His restlessness would wake me up and I can’t fall asleep after. I asked him if he was stressed and he actually said no. I asked if it was because when he’s alone he probably has certain rituals before bed that he doesn’t engage in with me, and he corroborated that. He did not say what those rituals were but I know he means watching porn and jacking off. (We have sex and go to bed but that’s not enough to get him to fall asleep because he can’t cum, even when he masturbates with me; he needs specific porn to get him off). In the past, he told me he jacks off before bed because it helps him sleep.

When we were spending the night with each other daily, his sleep was not a problem. He would fall asleep before me and wake up after me. There were issues in the beginning with getting used to sleeping next to a new partner, but the consistency of sleeping together every night for months (again, per his request; he initially ignited wanting to see each other everyday, even if it wasn’t for the evening and night but just for a hug since we live so close). I think during this time, his brain “rewired” a bit to sleep upon tiredness and relaxation rather than ejaculating after watching porn.

Now to me. I have BPD (hence posting in this sub). I have been in therapy for over a year. It’s primarily DBT with other therapy types like Schema therapy also taught. I still have a lot of problems with verbal abuse. I do not throw things or do anything physical but I get VERY mean and attacking to him. For example, because of the last incident of him not responding to me after 22 hours despite incessant talk about long distance communication, when he DID get back to me, I went on a text rampage. I told him he continuously fails the people he is close to out of choice and that his willful negligence is the reason his issues of shame, anxiety, and other dysfunctions are perpetuated. I have told him in the past that he is not the fantasy characters he imagines himself to be when consuming media and that he is dysfunctional and needs to be grounded in reality if he desires intimacy. I feel vindictive when I feel hurt by him and those feelings come out through being overtly mean and harsh on his psychological problems. I will tell him that he claims he wants to be better but is not doing even the bare minimum to be adept as basic relational and social skills, like being attentive to emails and messages and to check his notifications at least once every 12 hours or so.

Also, it’s not like I don’t have issues either, and he is not mean to me about them the way I am to him, and in the aftermath I feel incredible guilt and resentment towards myself. I also have an OC related disorder (excoriation, or skin picking). My fear of abandonment is EXTREME and despite having a lot of control for most of the feelings I get, there are points where my gut is just bubbling and I explode verbally.

In those moments, I seem to forget that he has Asperger’s. Withdrawal is a big thing for those with ASD. Hyperfocus is a thing with ASD, which is why he is always focused on animation (movies, porn, games). That is something that developed in his childhood and has been consolidated strongly in his brain. I know I need to have more patience and support for him. I know what the struggle is like finally getting into therapy and saying, “I have problems and I want to change to be better to other people and myself”. But when he refuses to even just turn the volume on his phone on to hear notifications from family, friends, and me, I get really angry! Because those are some behavioral changes that are VERY small and doable. I never rushed him with his sexual dysfunctions. I tried finding solutions, like masturbating together, buying an obscenely large amount of lingerie OF HIS CHOICE to maybe be more desirable to him, but nothing works because he still is not changing the behaviors that make him dysfunctional. To me, it’s a choice. Simple things cannot be done on a prompt basis (hell, even for a few months and when his parents forced him to go to their home). And because he doesn’t talk much, there’s so much I don’t know. I just have to piece things together, similar to his parents.

I WANT to be patient and supportive. My cognition wants that but my emotions/gut is building up resentment and is making that difficult. This is causing a dissonance in my mind and I am just splitting hard on him. Again, I DO have a level of control in most cases but these days, there are just so many issues coming up that I am becoming a hypocrite. I told him he can’t change but yet right now neither can I! And at this point, in some way, it is willful. I know what I am doing is wrong. It is not the most evident when I am writing my messages (as many people would relate to). Sometimes I will write something and not send it, usually after rereading it and realizing, “This is too mean and unacceptable,” but sometimes I get into this fuming state where I don’t proofread my texts to him and so I just send them, unfiltered. Often, I write my messages in a notepad and THEN copy/paste it to send to people since that brings about a level of revision, but I don’t even have that line of thought in the moment of being angry and wanting to be mean. I cannot be like this if I want him to feel secure with me, feel supported and loved by me. I really want this relationship to work out and I hope he does to (he tells me words of affection when together, but again, it’s not that often anymore).

Furthermore, when I HAVE brought stuff up gently, it flies over his head. In our first talk about impotence, I asked him to cum with me sometime and said it with a smile. I also mentioned it would make me feel more desirable. Eventually when I brought that up again a few months later, he said he thought I wasn’t being serious because it didn’t seem serious. In some ways, I feel a bit conditioned to be mean in order to get things through his head. I feel if he feels bad and recognizes that I also feel really bad and undesirable, that would be the only way for him to maybe start picking up some changes. My experience has been he is only considerate of my concerns when I bring them up using harsh language rather than being (what I think of) as gentle. I am likely not approaching constructive criticism in the right way and I would like to learn how to do that. It’s either I am overly nice to the point where my concerns are not perceived as concerns to my partner, or I am mean and my concerns get through to them. I think my frustrations with his avoidance, dysfunctions/additions, and lack of communications are warranted but I know my reactions and behaviors are NOT! What are tools I can learn to use and build to support my partner and control myself in the midst of an abandonment and rejection BPD episode?

How do I deal with the really maladaptive behaviors of someone with Asperger’s? How should I help them deal with my maladaptive behavior? ASD and BPD are almost like opposites in terms of social and relational skills, it feels. Please give any thoughts and feedback and please try to not cushion anything. While my behavior with people outside of romantic relationships has been greatly improved from therapy, I still have a long ways to go with combating the feelings I get in my belly area and controlling my vindictive, emotional abuse nature. Knowledge is my biggest tool and the biggest tool for me to alter my behavior, and I feel I just do not have the knowledge about how someone with ASD might feel with their behaviors and my behavior. How can I also help him? I have written this in a rushed and frantic state and will not be proofreading it as I think it might be helpful to read someone’s stream of consciousness and thoughts without filter. I will be posting this on both BPD and Asperger’s subreddits to get as much information and feedback/advice possible.

26,Relationship dilemma,"BPD, CPTSD, Bipolar 2

Sorry for this long rant, trying to make sense of my broken life and needed to share with others who might be more understanding about what I’m going through, with my mental illness.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I’m afraid I’m too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I’d he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me….. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can’t and won’t get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",1688449467.0,False,1,0,Old-Meet-1322,None,14q68cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14q68cv/relationship_dilemma/
27,turning 25 really made me realize how narcissistic my parents are,"a little background for context: My whole life was spent in survival mode as I was systematically denied opportunities to grow into a healthy, happy, functional person. As the youngest in my family, for the longest time, I was told I was sick and to blame for my family's dysfunction. time after time my parents have proven to want me off their payroll and never showed genuine compassion, empathy, or support in any other way except financially. They would say cruel, horrible, hurtful things to bring me down but say they want the best for me and pull a woe-is-me card saying they have done everything they can to help. I softened and repeated to them that all I ever wanted was a cheerleader but instead, they'd continuously drag and slander me telling me I'd never get far in life and the world is a cruel place. the truth is they are the cruelest thing I have encountered in my lifetime. No matter what I did, even after 15+ years of therapy  I found my identity, improved myself, learned how to not react like them, communicated in a healthy manner, and am very confident and can defend myself properly.  it was never enough to change how they treated me. At 17 they sent me to a residential therapy center and I was in a position in which I couldn't decline or avoid it, which actually ended up saving me and changing my life forever. They were supposed to be a part of the journey but even experts couldn't convince them of their wrongdoings and who I really was, not who they interpreted me to be. They refused to listen to my therapists and tried to convince them of things they simply knew weren't true. (I lived there and interacted with them on a daily basis for a year). Eventually, it got to the point where my parents were constantly contacting my therapists, writing a literal \*book\* worth of an email, trying to tell them what to tell me or what I was doing. They wouldn't respect a professional's boundaries, how were they ever going to respect mine? hindsight is 20/20 as they spent my tuition to go to my dream college and pursue my dream job on this place. Grand total of $120,000+, to not listen to anything that was truly causing conflict. This problem persisted with all different therapists for years, looking back, they basically had me hop to different therapists throughout the years when thought they were wrong and couldn't sway them. When I was a kid I distinctly remember an incident where a therapist had restated something my mother had said to me recently, and i asked her if my mom told you to say that to which she replied, you're a smart cookie. They were convinced i would never take off and told me id never succeed yet resented me for being the reason I couldnt.

&#x200B;

Now, 25 (F), I live on my own and I have my dream job and found my dream apartment. I admit I had a late takeoff but everyone is on their own timeline, progress not perfection. They had helped me along the way financially but were consistent in their past behavior. I'm currently in the process of a move and things that shouldn't be arguments become arguments because they think I'm arguing when I'm cool as a cucumber. I did everything myself and orchestrated the move. I made plans and shared them and how we needed to get things done. they'd constantly interrogate me as if I hadn't recited the plan 10 times in a way that made me feel that they think I'm truly incapable. yet, they pushed me off when I reached out to get things done and would get so mad when id point it out respectfully and they'd blow me off while going off on me repeating the same horrible things. I know they are helping me financially but expressing my frustrations led to me being told I'm never going to have a relationship or friends and this is why people hate me and leave. to which I replied, like who? then they claim I gaslight them as they continue to try to tell me I'm this horrible person who lives to make them miserable. They go back and forth constantly from wanting to help to being punishing mean-spirited people and I'm just tired. I want to enjoy my life and I see now that even achieving what they thought I'd never do but claimed they wanted for me still isn't enough to earn their respect. I've done so much mourning over them never being the parents i needed through the years and now I just think my only option is to surrender to that. Its just really sad. I have so much anger and resentment from it, especially when I was the one told in my childhood that they had to walk on eggshells. But now I see, it was me that had to tip-toe and hold my breath. I don't want to be angry anymore, but god, do they fill me with rage. 

I don't know what I'm really looking for...  I want to preserve my identity and my recovery without their words living in my head. So maybe connection, advice, or a community. I just want to be happy and feel proud, my life has never been better and I feel like they have sucked the joy right out of my achievements. every. single. time.",1693340841.0,False,7,2,KirbyInTheClouds,None,164tdo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/164tdo4/turning_25_really_made_me_realize_how/
28,What Boundaries Aren’t,"You don’t set boundaries, you uncover them. 

A boundary is the point beyond which you can no longer reliably act in ways that you’re proud of. 

Ways that are consistent with your values. 

Ways that move you closer to your goals. 

Whenever you cross your boundaries, you move away from your goals, away from your values, away from a life you can be proud of. 

Before I got help and learned skills, it wasn’t a question of __whether__ I crossed my boundaries and did things I regret, but rather a matter of __when__ and how much damage there would be to repair. 

I was always terrified by the prospect of setting boundaries with others, because I knew I wasn’t capable of withdrawing my desperate need for approval and validation. I couldn’t depend on myself to enforce consequences. 

Besides, there was no doubt in my mind: if I set even a single boundary, every shred of connection or relationship I’d painstakingly and painfully gathered would scatter to the wind. It wasn’t worth the risk. I knew I wouldn’t survive it. 

When I changed the way I saw boundaries, everything changed. 

In intensive therapy I learned about a location I had never, ever, in my 31 years of life, experienced. 

The Window of Tolerance. 

Physiologically speaking, the kinds of behaviors I was exhibiting were caused by a nervous system swinging between hyperarousal and hypoarousal states. Like a car that can only shift into first or reverse.

If I could get inside my window of tolerance, and figure out how to stay there, my therapists promised me I’d be able to deal with the intrusive thoughts and compulsive urges that were destroying my will to continue with life.

Finding and accepting safety and making grounding and mindfulness the core of my existence got me back to the window of tolerance. 

Boundaries are what keep me inside. Boundaries are what keep me safe. 

From there, I can authentically connect with others. I can manually regulate my emotions. I can read the signals my body sends me. I can think clearly about the consequences of my actions. 

Finally, I could cruise along in fourth gear. 

Everyone always says you have to choose yourself over others, prioritize your life and your happiness. If you’ve read this far, you know the hollow pain of those platitudes as they thud against your empty rib cage. If thag’s the solution, we’ll never get well. How could anyone prioritize or value a noxious hellscape of constant pain?

Get inside your window of tolerance. Develop strategies to stay there. Inside, you’ll find a life worth living. 

And when you’re invited to step beyond the boundaries of your window of tolerance, you can make an informed decision about whether that’s the best idea for you or not. 

And the best part of this is, when you’ve made those safe and stable connections (possible because you can consistently show up in ways that you’re proud of), you can point them out to the people you trust. 

‘See that ridge over there? I don’t go past that point. If you want to go that way, you can, but I can’t come with you.’

They won’t try to convince you, because they believe that you know what’s best for you. And they want you to have what they need. Sometimes you’ll have to part ways so they can go places you won’t. That’s sad, but it’s okay, because you’re still in your wonderful garden of tolerance. 

Connection and pleasure and peace are abundant here.

Finally, you’re okay.",1620561442.0,False,53,15,arithmetok,None,n8crd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/n8crd0/what_boundaries_arent/
29,Going through a breakup,"I spent a LOT of time focusing on myself afyer getting out of an abusive relationship a few years back. I spent time alone finding hobbies and working on so many of my own issues as well as coping with what happened during that relationship. I ended up getting clean from self harm and I even went back and graduated high school and started working again. I was so proud of myself and thought I could handle a relationship again finally. 

I may have been wrong.

We moved really slow at first, we took our time with dates and spending the night. We didn't want to force anything and I didn't want to get addicted so fast. Things went really well until around the 3 month mark I had a bad week, I was crying a lot and upset and for the first time, I brought up how when I feel like a mess I want to selfharm. I thought he would be able ro handle it since after a while of dating I told him about BPD and he read up on it and even highlighted and annotated a book about it, just to study and better handle what could happen. But he did not handle the stress well when I break down did come, he tried to leave but ended up wanting to stay, and I felt good about his choice at first since I did not beg or freak out when he brought it up, I tried to just talk about our issues. However trying to leave 3 months in really set something off in me, immediately I sowed seeds of abandonment and left me paranoid. 

As time went on I still had breakdowns over something dumb every few months, but when he'd bring up something to me that upset him or hurt him, I'd always take the steps to start changing, and more often than not I'd stop the bad behavior he pointed out. I was lucky of he pointed it out though, he had a fear of confrontation and as he told me ""I didn't make it easy for him."" I know it should be easier for me to see what I'm doing wrong but sometimes it was hard, I told him he'd need to spell it out for me, and there's times I'd get really defensive and mad when he did. I'd always apologize afyer the fact and tell him I overreacted and that he's in the right to feel that way. I ALWAYS made sure to tell him his feelings were valid and good and I tried my best to take accountability, even of he had to point out my wrongdoings. 

Though I'd have these bad times, I will say I didn't insult him, I never uses shoes like or SH as a threat and I'd take accountability for myself feeling like that, when he was upset with me I'd even be sure to avoid talking about those feelings so he wouldn't associate them with his own emotions towards me. 

But eventually he tried to leave again, showing me no warnings and coming home and breaking the news to me a year into the relationship. I yet again, just sat there and tried to talk about it and we worked though things... only for him to do it again the next day and decide to stay AGAIN. At that point I was horrified. Always scared he's going to go and not knowing when it would happen. He wouldn't talk to me about any issues he had when they came up. He would give me the chance to talk about anything or seek any help cuz he wouldn't even let me know when he felt I was doing something wrong. I shouldn't have been so blind to it and I know that, but I thought I was trying. I tried so hard on the things he wanted fixed. I tried.

He stayed after that though. Flash forward 3 more months, I have the worst week I've had in our relationship, I was very aware of my wrong doings and told him everytime, but it didn't change how I was feeling. We were on a time crunch to get my me drivers license, I have college starting up in 2 weeks, and he's supposed to leave town for the first time for a week. This is all happening at the same time and I was horrified. I even broke down crying during my behind the wheel test and things hadn't been feeling too real for a few weeks, I didn't feel ready for any of it and because of it I felt like a failure. On top of that I felt I needed to be afraid of him leaving, like I NEEDED that fear. I knew he was stressed too because of how I felt and I knew I wasn't handling stuff well. Eventually I broke down, I was sobbing and yelling about how I wanted to die, I told him it's cuz I felt like a failure, because if I couldn't handle getting my license how am I supposed to handle school. This break down soon flipped into me yelling at him that he's going to leave. I KNEW my breakdowns were too much and I felt like he was going to go again for it, it felt inevitable.

The next day happens and all the bad feelings built up, and for the first time in 2 years I relapsed on self harm. When I got home that night i told him, and I told him I stopped because it wasn't worth it to myself to fall back into that behavior. I also told him that I was scared to tell him because I thought he'd leave if I got that weak and hurt myself. I was right, he left. He told me after he saw the mark on my leg he gave up on me. I know it's selfish to expect him to stay after that, but I really wish he did. I didn't want him to fix me, just to be there for me and talk about ways to get over this stress

After everything he came by to talk to me and told me all these things i had no clue he felt during our relationship. Things that I felt, if they were talked about, really could have been worked on and fixed, but he told me ""it's just not worth it"". He didn't want to stick around and work on anything. If he had mentioned couples therapy I would have done it in a heartbeat, if he had just needed space I would have done it in a moment, no guilt involved. 

He mentioned feeling like I didn't want him to see his siblings alone BUT HE NEVER TRIED. HE NEVER BROUGHT IT UP ONCE. I even asked him ""why haven't you seen you siblings in a whileyou should make plans soon."" But he decided that meant nothing. I tell him ""hey you should play the piano or do *insert hobby here* today, and I'll just play a video game"" but he decided I wanted him glued to me at all times. And undeniably there WERE times like that. I wanted him in the same room as me a lot, I wanted to he near him, but he never once told me that wasn't okay. He always entertained it, I didn't know. If he wasn't happy I wish he would have at least told me. Inwish he would have at least given me a chance. 

He also said i shouldn't ever ""subject"" someone to my thoughts of SH. I feel so destroyed. This was supposed to be my first healthy relationship and I did mess up, I did breathe down his neck too much but if he had at least talked to me I feel like i could have tried. I just want someone to communicate with me and give me a fighting chance.",1691158407.0,False,3,6,tiddifukr69,None,15i17q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15i17q7/going_through_a_breakup/
30,First few days...,"It  has been an exhausting 5 years. I escaped my abusers, got married to my soulmate (yikes), started therapy for PTSD, got diagnosed with ADHD, and tried medication this year. There’s one huge problem: I’m on dialysis and Adderall XR is __undializable__ meaning it’s has no way to exit my body. I went full psychotic you guys. So I stopped taking the Adderall and it finally has broken down to its components and filtered out. 

But then I was still getting angry. Just like I used to. I still couldn’t sleep, just like I used to. My inner critic used me as a whipping girl, just like she did when I was mentally hallucinating that she was gonna eat my face off. 

I got a Generalized Personality Disorder diagnosis from a resident marriage therapist about a year ago. 

It’s been a long ass fucking year. I’ve touched on DBT, and fought tooth and nail with my behaviors to “prove” I didn’t have BPD. But I was bent until I was broken and I had to pick up the pieces. And the BPD was still there. 

Y’all, I’ve never got a 9/9 on anything. I finally watched a few videos. My flip-switch, ends-quick rage, my self hate, my suicidal but not really tendencies, it was all in there. Even the parts where I was more prone to stressed-based psychosis. (Previously I had been diagnosed as “depression with psychosis”) 

So over the weekend I’ve been trying to hard. I’ve been messaging my therapist instead of my husband. When I do tell my husband stuff it’s consise and not 15 pages. I isolated myself today while I was mad, and “rode the wave” and was able to figure out almost everything behind that particular shitfit. I also didn’t escalate my anger at something my husband was doing, into anger at him, and I avoided a good bit of verbal abuse. 

But all of this is so tiring. And I’m barely scratching the surface. The conversations my husband and I are having are deep and scary and I haven’t been this honest with anybody about this stuff. I have new fears, and new ways to practice old fears. 

I just wanna be better. I wanna stop abusing my husband. I wanna not feel like shit all the time. I wanna stop fighting because I have a hairline trigger and he accidentally makes it worse somehow. 

The road has been long, and the road will be long ahead. But I am recognizing how sneaky (In a good way) my therapists have been and how I actually have a few DBT skills already, I just have to learn how to apply them. Radical acceptance a few months ago helped us stop fighting about the dishes. Riding the Wave has helped me isolate and quickly manage breakdowns before they affect my husband. 

He just is so afraid of me now. He’s so jumpy. And I am heartbroken. I can’t believe I’ve done this to the man I love. Except this time instead of my inner critic taking hold, I’m using it to be better every time in cognizant enough to S T O P. 

On the one hand, this is such a tall mountain. An Everest perhaps. But I have told him that he is my Foreverest Love, because I would climb Everest for him. Well now I’m being called to task, and I just gotta pick up my ropes and start climbing, no matter how hard it is.

I’m posting this cause I’m anxious I can’t do it. I’m so early in my journey I still have most of my disordered thoughts and behaviors. I’ve been looking for the evidence to calm my anxiety, but even so, my critic pesters me “you’ll never be good enough and he’ll leave” even though he knows I’m afraid of that and had literally guaranteed the opposite. 

I just want to be good for him. Will I ever be good for him?",1593992654.0,False,11,0,TarnishedTeal,None,hlwvnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/hlwvnh/first_few_days/
31,"blew up a relationship and now I don't know what to do. also, very sad","Context:

Moved from Chicago to Albuquerque with my partner in September in a very fast and dramatic nature. We broke up Oct/Nov, and have continued to live together as chosen family. I worked and supported us when we first got here, and then I was unemployed from the end of November until a week ago, and the roles reversed. 

In December, I was in the psych hospital and while I was in there got a very angry text outlying some of my behavior that hurt them with the boundaries to ""not ask them for shit"" and that they were no longer the default for anything. Rides, weed, money, etc. Things that have been shared. It really hurt and was triggering. 

I've been trying, what is my current best, to maintain the boundaries, but still find myself asking for things and for help. Never really had anyone be so strict about boundaries before, and I share a lot of things with them, whenever they ask. The biggest thing is that they have had had access to is my laptop, which they have unlimited access to because they use it for work. My laptop is also the only way we are able to watch tv or movies. 

They are moving to a different city in another state at the end of March, and it's brought up a lot, on top of the whirlwind of our relationship and breakup that I haven't even remotely processed. And I have no idea what I am doing. Whether I'm staying in this city or moving on somewhere else, and if I stay in the same house or move out to another place. 

On Friday I lost one of my new jobs after 2 days of training, while I was in the middle of working my other job, and this week/weekend has been the anniversary of some very traumatic experiences and losses. I have been at the bottom of the well and in so much pain for a very, very long time and all of that turned into a lot of anger. That anger hasn't been excised in any sort of way. 

I had let them know what had happened and asked them if they could share some weed because I had worked a 15 hour day and everything was closed so I was unable to procure it myself. They have a car, and I don't. Not having a car in this city is incredibly unreliable and unsustainable, btw. The next morning before work they said they wanted to talk about boundaries when I got home. 

On the way to work, I decided to go full destruction and sent them a very nasty text saying things like how I jump when they say how high because I owe them, they didn't ask me about anything relating to losing my job, but fuck me, right? cancelling our Valentine's plans, telling them to not use my laptop anymore, and that we can stop pretending like we're going to talk or see each other once they move away. 

It went as well as we know it did. Told me that was all baseless and fucked up. They called me some names, fragile princess and fucking foul for getting in the way of their ability to work and make money. Saying if I wanna be done, we're done and that there's nothing for us to talk about unless it's about the house. I was immediately regretful and apologetic and took accountability for how I've treated them, that I hope they find someone who treats them better and can show up for them in a way that I haven't been able to, and in a way they deserve. Said that they could continue to use the laptop. They never responded to any of that. We did text today about the lease.

We haven't had any interaction as I've been at work and I'm not trying to impose myself. When I came home last night, I cleaned the kitchen, did dishes took out trash, and straighted up the living room. The vibe was a lot better than I thought it would be when I got home,  which was a surprise. 

Today I've started to cry off and on at work. I'm weirdly calm. Maybe because I'm accepting of my bed, and because I know I have to repair through action, which is getting back into program and all of the therapy and additional work. 

I'm sharing all this, because I really need to hear or know about others experiences that are similar to this. I really don't know what to do. I'm incredibly sad. All they wanted was for the rest of out time living together to be joyous, and I ruined everything. Don't even know if I should try and do any repair. I feel like it would be kinder to let them go.

32,Reflections After 1 Year of DBT,"  Hey there Reddit, so I wanted to do this for myself, but I know that I found these sorts of posts helpful when I was just starting my recovery journey. I post this here in the hopes that it helps one person, because having been through this shit, I know how difficult it is, and how much better things CAN get, with a combination of luck, effort, and the right therapist. None of that shit is easy to find, and I feel extremely fortunate to no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for BPD. It was the hardest thing I’ve done in my life to point – harder than college, harder than working 80 hours per week in a job I hated, harder than the nights I laid in bed crying with emotional pain. There’s a dialectic between “it’s worth the effort” and “the effort takes a LOT out of you” that I want to strike right up top here, because I know this shit doesn’t go quite so smoothly for everyone. Just know that I’m wishing all of you luck, better days, and skillful means <3

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So today marks the one year anniversary of my first visit with \[my therapist\]. I don’t honestly know if that truly “counts” as a year in DBT, since there were a few sessions we had before I formally committed, but I’m finished with group and scaling back to one-on-ones every other week, and hopefully once a month by the end of the year. So it does feel like an important date to both mark and celebrate, and a good opportunity to reflect in a bigger-picture way than I tend to do. 

It’s honestly a bit difficult to remember my mindset back then. Not to say I don’t remember the struggles and the pain of searching for the right therapist, but in a very real way I feel like a fundamentally different person now compared to when I started. So it’s both tricky and a bit painful to recall that time, because I was truly adrift. I’d quit my job with no notice after a full-on breakdown, had flown out to see my family and barely survived the trip. I knew my older brother, who I was staying with, had a gun in his house, and I remember needing to tell him NOT to let me know where it was, or how to access it. There have been some low points since then, but that trip stands out as the last truly difficult thing I went through before getting started with DBT, so I do think that’s noteworthy. 

I do remember having quite a bit of shame that I even “needed” DBT, or any sort of therapy, to start with. I was raised to believe that your problems are self-created, and I felt like if I had caused myself all of this emotional distress, there MUST be some way I could fix it by myself. I tried that for a few months, and it was a spectacular failure. I tried reaching out to non-DBT therapists, tried BetterHelp (should be called BetterNotHopeForHelp), tried just looking up resources online – I was aware of DBT, and that it was considered quite effective at treating what I was dealing with, but I was also aware it was a major commitment, and part of me still held out hope that I could salvage the burning building that was my internal reality without having to accept that there wasn’t much worth saving, and that the right move was to let it burn down to the foundations and start rebuilding. I’ve always been a bit jealous of those who got ID’d at a younger age, I think that process would have been less intimidating in my 20s, but the idea of essentially starting my life over at 34 just seemed too daunting. 

There was also a lot of shame at the beginning that I didn’t know any of the shit that DBT was teaching me – in a lot of ways, it felt like needing to take remedial classes in being human. It wouldn’t be until I was around six months in that I read through the DBT workbook cover to cover, and came across Marsha’s quote that “’Aren’t these skills your mother was supposed to teach you?’ I always say yes, but for many people their mother just did not or was not able to get around to it.” That was a big perspective shift for me - I don’t know why I expected myself to know things I was never taught, but that alone went a long way for me.

While the past year has been extremely difficult, it’s also not an exaggeration to say it’s the best year I’ve ever had as an adult. I managed to find a fairly validating environment in college, which I think went a long way to heading off the worst of my symptoms (though there are a few breakdowns that I glossed over at the time that stand out with the clarity of hindsight), but honestly I don’t know that I was ever happy after college. 12 full fucking years of misery before I could swallow my pride to reach out for help – I wish I’d done it sooner, but I also don’t know if I would have been ready for it then. Everyone has their own path, and maybe mine needed to go through a long and undeniable valley of torment to get me there. Maybe it didn’t, but no amount of regret can change the past, and I do think knowing just how deep that well went helped me stay committed during the tough times, of which there were many.

I also can’t help but reflect on how incredibly lucky I’ve been throughout this process.  When I first reached out to \[my therapist\], she wasn’t taking on new patients, but I guess I sounded desperate enough on the phone that she squeezed me in. Given how well a fit we ended up being, I can’t help but wonder if I would have gotten to where I am with another therapist. I don’t know how I would have felt about being “rejected” by the first DBT therapist I had the courage to reach out. Despite how badly I was struggling, I was very much in the “I’m sure I’m actually faking all of this shit” vortex that many of us on the quieter end of the spectrum struggle with. I might have taken that as evidence that, actually, I wasn’t even struggling that bad, that so many people had it worse than I did, that I didn’t deserve help, and that I was a true piece of shit for thinking that I did, even for a moment. I’d like to think I would have found my way to DBT sooner or later, but knowing how I was at the time, I’m very unsure and it’s scary to think what my life would look like now if I didn’t. I also can’t overstate how much having a great match with my therapist helped – I didn’t trust her right off the bat, but by a few months in I trusted her pretty much unconditionally. I don’t know that I’ve EVER trusted another person as much as I trust her, and I don’t know that this whole thing would have stuck without that trust. 

So I’ve talked about this idea of “changing” quite a bit in these journals, and it is that, but it’s maybe closer to reclaiming (or just plain claiming) an authentic self. My self-hatred went so deep. I knew all of the worst parts of myself, and I fucking detested them, was disgusted by them, couldn’t even stand to look at myself in the mirror or reflect on what I was feeling because it was so much easier to just deny and numb with an insane workload to keep me occupied during the day, and enough weed to drown out my own internal monologue at night. I’m still not sure that I love myself – that self-loathing was such a prominent feature of my existence for so long that it’s fair to say that only a year of work, even if it was incredibly hard work, wasn’t enough to completely undo that. But, I accept myself, and I think I even like myself. I wouldn’t have thought either of those things were possible at the start of the process (at least not the self that I actually ended up embracing – I was more interested in becoming a different person than I accepting the person I was). And, to be fair, despite my optimism about DBT, I didn’t have a whole lot of confidence in what was actually possible at the start of the program. When \[my therapist\] asked for long-term goals, I REALLY struggled to come up with them, because I thought that what I wanted wasn’t possible, at least not for me.

And I guess that leads me to the now, and my worries about what comes next. I’ve been a bit depressed since I got my results that I no longer meet the diagnostic criteria – I knew it was coming, but I think a part of me was holding out hope that there was some secret trick that would be revealed to me once I got to that point. And maybe I’m discounting the extent to which that did happen, but not in the “fit it on a bumper sticker” sort of simplicity I wanted. DBT has provided me with a path, the tools to stay on it, and the tools to come back to it when I wander off it (and I expect I will continue to wander off it. I tend to think success is measured more by your ability to come back rather than your ability to never stray). I suppose it’s a bit more muddled than that – there wasn’t a day when I suddenly woke up and knew the way, no more than there was a day when I woke up and realized I was no longer a child but an adult. That liminal space between the two is more massive than I think I anticipated, and only now towards the end of the process am I able to look back over my life and really appreciate and feel just how far I’ve come.

Among the many things that DBT has brought into my life, I think one of the most lasting will be end up an appreciation of Buddhist philosophies. I don’t think I realized just how baked in those practices are until after reaching Marsha’s autobiography and seeking them out myself. But, this passage still makes me happy-cry every time I read it. The author uses the word “awakening”, but I think you can just as easily substitute “recovery” or “building a life worth living” or whatever else you want. It really gets that the “two steps forward, one step back” nature of the process, and what I anticipate the next steps will look like for me. 

“But no sooner is (awakening) glimpsed than it is gone. Cessation of craving is like a momentary gap in the clouds. The sun shines brilliantly for a few moments, only to be covered over again. We find ourselves back in the humbling fog of anguish, craving, habit, restlessness, distraction. But with a difference: now we know where this track goes…

Henceforth, the resolve to cultivate this path becomes unwavering yet entirely natural. It is simply what we do…Awakening is no longer seen as something to attain in the distant future, for it is not a thing but a process – and this process is the path itself. But neither does this render us in any way perfect or infallible. We are quite capable of subverting this process to the interests of our far-from-extinct desires, ambitions, hatreds, jealousies, and fears. We have not been elevated to the lofty heights of awakening; awakening has been knocked off its pedestal into the turmoil and ambiguity of everyday life.”

33,the eventual decline of chris and maud,"I'm unsure why I'm writing this out.  I suppose part of me believes it could be cathartic but a bigger part of me believes someone else might benefit from reading it & relating.  
I tried a NoContact subreddit first thinking it was where I wanted to write this but I backed out of there pretty quick, that was some scary obsessive shit. I'm not convinced this is the right subreddit for it either but there's so many subreddits that it's a wee bit daunting to find the right fit sometimes.  Having said that, if this isn't the right place please don't tear me apart over it, I'm getting really tired of the hostility online.  Just refer me to a better sub.  


I broke up with my significant other (I'll call him Chris, that's a common enough name) a few days ago but yesterday I asked him to refrain from contacting me.  We had been together for about a year, maybe almost two now?  I'm inept at tracking time.  At first he was interesting and quiet and as we got to know each other it was a lovely time in my life.  We brought out the best in each other.  Several months into the relationship I had a phone issue and he let me borrow his for the day while he was at work.  A message popped up that was clearly about me.  I felt myself flood with anger and I opened it.  I'm sure there will be people who decide to be angry in my decision to do so and I honestly don't care.  If a gross text about you popped up on your SO's phone I wonder if you'd be so inclined to ignore it.  Anyway, I opened it and read it.  What I read indicated there was more elsewhere too so I opened up all his texts and facebook messages.  He was talking about me to several people.  Before I continue, he doesn't keep close friendships with anyone so all of these people were people he barely had relationships with.  One was an ex girlfriend, one was a gamer friend he barely knew, one was an older gay gentleman who had a crush on him, it was so weird that he would choose to indulge such information to any one of them.  The texts were interesting.  He would discuss my mental health diagnoses, my finances, my family, and other deeply personal topics with these people... and what's worse is a lot of what he said was dishonest and one sided.  I used my Kindle to take pics of all of the texts and facebook messages.  There were so many.  When I gave him back his phone I confronted him by asking him if he ever talks to people about our relationship and he said no.  He said no but I could see his fear spreading across his face so I asked him again.  He started acting like a cornered animal and finally said yes but then lied about how many people he told.  He said one.  There were four, I think.  I clearly remember three but there were four.  In the end he said he understood that what he did was wrong and he was sorry but I suppose truthfully I never got past it.  I tried to be a bigger person and forgive it and move past it but I didn't.  It lingered and finally I broke up with him.  There were three of us living in the house together and we would all meet up in the living room to watch Twin Peaks in the evenings.  After the breakup he would be on his phone constantly and suddenly began acting secretive.  Our other housemate had to go out of town for a weekend or something and during his absence Chris said he was going away for the weekend as well- to the ex girlfriend's house a few hours away.  This triggered something in me.  I mentioned previously that I have Borderline Personality Disorder.  Borderlines will do almost anything to avoid real or perceived abandonment, logic be damned.  It was no different for me, I suddenly felt like it was essential to have him back.  I sat down and thought about everything, tried to sort the emotion and logic.  Chris was texting me the whole first day of that weekend and that was making it harder.  He said he was walking around some store and everything reminded him of me and he was starting to think he made a mistake.  At the time I didn't see the forest for the trees and I blocked Chris that Friday until Sunday afternoon.  On Sunday I unblocked him and shared what I had been going through mentally and we agreed that we still had feelings for one another and wanted to keep at this.  He admit he did sleep with his ex but that good ol' BPD brain of mine excused it.  I'll take this moment to encourage you to seek therapy for any mental health issues.  If you're fortunate enough not to have one I'll thank you for not insulting me over what I couldn't work through properly.  


We stayed together for quite some time and then in October of last year he got deployed.  There were minor issues in that time but nothing like the great text ordeal at the beginning.  We had actually talked about getting married and I had planned out a whole engagement thing with his mom, who I was (am?) close to.  He had made it sounds like he wasn't traditional and wanted something different and meaningful like I did so I thought that he would love the idea of me proposing to him with socks instead of a ring.  There's a story there (for those of you who raised a brow) but it's not worth sharing.  It was something between myself and Chris.  A couple days before Christmas we were watching a movie using the Netflix Party chrome extension and there was a scene where a girl proposed to her boyfriend.  Chris commented and said the idea of that was awful.  I asked why and he gave me a few reasons.  I sighed and told him what I had planned.  Although he had been telling me for months prior to this that he was ready to get married and he wanted to marry me and blah blah fucking blah, all of a sudden he wasn't.  He said he wasn't ready, he had all these questions to figure out first and all this stuff that was news to me.  At this point I started seeing Chris as a liar.  This wasn't the first lie, it was one of several, but it was a massive lie.  He had led me on for months about MARRIAGE.  I was clearly upset and I had to tell his mom that the time wasn't right after all and she needed to cancel the plans we'd made to surprise Chris.  She wasn't happy with Chris for his lies and she was worried that we would break up over this.  Yes, we should have but stupidly we didn't.  After December things went pretty easy and we tried working through stuff.  At that point the communication issues started becoming more prevalent.  We hadn't had communication issues except for his lying prior to that.  Over time it felt like communication got worse.  I started catching more lies and they were stupid too, stupid things to lie about.  Excuses for every little thing started coming up.  Looking back I'm not sure how we got to summer of this year but we did.   


The plan for summer was I would go visit Chris for a couple months.  I was looking forward to working on communication in person and just being with him.  I especially missed holding his hand, it was a powerful tool in alleviating anxiety.  Chris drove to pick me up so I could bring more of my own stuff with me.  The trip back to where he was deployed went ok, more or less.  Communication was basically breaking down but it wasn't garbage yet.  Chris would tell me we were going to do this and we were going to do that and I was excited about the summer.  Long story short my summer basically consisted of me sitting alone most of the time while he was at work.  There was NOTHING to do there except watch Netflix and I gained some weight because the food there was... different, we'll say.  It was quite interesting to me how the things I consistently ate at home weren't available where Chris was.  Of all the promises Chris had made, he did follow through on one.  We visited his parents that summer.  It's even harder to eat my diet where they live and that ended up being a real problem.  Just little issues peppering the trip, how Chris dealt with anything or didn't, stuff like that.  I started noticing more negative things about Chris.  He would not only lie to me but to his family as well.  He would pretend, for lack of better word. I feel like lie is too extreme for his behavior around his family.  Pretend works better.  He would make promises and not follow through, he was dishonest often, he would behave more like a child as the summer carried on, he was doing things almost regularly that were inconsiderate.  With having so much free time I sat and thought about the relationship often.  At some point it just clicked.  I realized that I was forcing myself to stay in a relationship that should have been over after the texting thing happened.  I realized that Chris was a liar and the whole relationship was a lie built on a lie painted over with lies and decorated with lies.  I cared so much for Chris that even then, even after that realization, I still didn't want to leave him.    


I've been home for about a month now and I've taken the time to tell Chris how I feel, using specific examples from our relationship.  I've clearly laid out where our communication issues are and why they happen.  I have taken the time to find solutions that require his involvement on his own time for his own self if this relationship will have any hope at all.  Three days ago he said something to me, I don't remember what it was now.  It wasn't a big thing, it wasn't an important thing, but it happened to be the last straw.  I told him that his behavior was affecting me in a negative way, triggering my BPD, holding me back from going forward in my recovery (which otherwise had been a steady path forward for years).  I told him how I felt around his family (the pros and the cons), I told him how certain things had certain outcomes and I provided suggestions for ways to avoid finding ourselves in a bad place again.  I told him I wanted some space from him, I wanted to end our relationship until he had done the legwork to fix the bigger issues that fell on him.  I was carrying Chris through our relationship and I couldn't continue to do so.  He agreed and over the next day he would text me these stupid little remarks about progress he was making except it wasn't progress at all.  It was more of the typical Chris lies and trying to manipulate the situation.  I called him out on it instead of ignoring it.  He continued to do it, I continued to call him out.  The next day he said I was making him feel terrible when he was trying to ""get better"" and I called him out on that too.  I told him that his ""plans"" to see a therapist in two more months and to ""be more mindful"" of how he communicates were just more lies and there was no evidence.  He said he couldn't change in a week.  I told him I didn't expect him to but I did expect more than trying to hoover me back in with falsehoods.  I told him that his attempts to persuade me that he was actually taking real initiatives were making the problems worse and that everything still felt like lies.  I told him that no contact might be the best thing for us right now.  He texted me yesterday morning, just a normal hello how do you do type thing.  The way he phrased his text felt a little off so I pushed a bit and of course broke open the festering communication issue.  On my end I broke down crying.  I suppose that's when I really knew that it was hopeless.  Every communication issue we had would get discussed and then immediately happen again, over and over, and I was broken from it.  The stress from trying to sort it out had reached the apex.  By that afternoon I had responded to all his attempts at excuses with calling him out until finally he said he needed space from me because I wasn't helping him.  The facade shattered.  I'd told him twice in the last couple days to give me space and he had a way of worming back in with his lies.  I told him that I believed that we were fundamentally different and we no longer brought out the best in one another.  I told him that his behavior had become a major trigger for my BPD and I wasn't going to undo years of progress for a toxic relationship. I told him he'd be better suited with someone who didn't mind being lied to because that wasn't going to change.  I told him I wish him well and I hope he finds happiness in himself.  He wrote back that he wishes the same for me and I haven't heard from him since yesterday afternoon.    


Normally the BPD would have me raging and seething and crying and hysterical.  This is what I mean about progress.  I'd been going forward for years, making steady progress, growing into a functional and healthy person.  I'm actually proud of myself for identifying the behaviors in a toxic relationship and (although it took a year too long I got there eventually) breaking it off with a no contact request.  I don't know what I would do if Chris tried to text me.  I doubt very much he will.  I think he will revert back to talking to people with whom he had very superficial relationships with, being dishonest with them in order to validate himself.  It's not for me to worry about, I figure if it does happen I'll just block the number.  I have my own life to live without Chris and the childish drama that took up so much of my time for so long.

Of course they do. But they don't bat an eye when it comes to doing shady things to me.

Sending someone exciting news and they respond with a thumbs up. And you ask what's up with that and they go what do u want me to say it's normal? As if im not hyper aware of behavioral changes. As if i can't scroll back and find 89 examples of me sending you good news and you responding normally, nicely, like a regular friend. As if you saying à thumbs up is normal won't affect me. Gaslighting, childish behavior.

And then I sit there calmly explaining where im coming from and in the end I'm still the one apologizing. Lol okay.

I'm exhausted. I'm 31 and I have made self improvement my fucking hobby. I do the work. I manage my emotions. I am self aware. I give my all to my relationships. And then I'm still the one fixing everything in the end. Nah.

1,Diagnosed with BPD and Became A Therapist ?,"Hello!

Wanting to put feelers out there to see if anyone can share their experience of having BPD yet becoming a psychotherapist? I’m pursuing education in this area at the Masters level now, and I’m really questioning whether I can handle it or not, and if people won’t connect with me because of sensing I’m not “whole” or something along those lines. Aside from that, there’s also just the general worry that hearing people share depressing and traumatic things all week will make it too hard to maintain an even keel in my own mental health.

2,Skills for dealing with intense emotion,"I posted this in the regular BPD sub but had zero responses and I'm feeling desperate and alone. I'm hoping that I'll have more luck here. The situation: I'm in my second week of inpatient ED treatment and I've never felt so emotionally disregulated IN. MY. LIFE.

I have (quiet) BPD, and my emotions are UNBEARABLE lately, especially since I don't have access to my unhealthy coping mechanisms (food restriction, substance abuse and self-harm) OR a one-on-one therapist. I just feel like I'm going to go nuts if I don't figure out skills that actually help. They're not teaching us formal DBT (the handouts are ""inspired by"" Linehan's DBT sheets) and this isn't going to change so I need to find some alternatives. My biggest struggle rn is whether I'm ""sick enough"" or that things were ""serious enough"" to warrant me being here, and I've been looking up narrative therapy because I'm a writer and feel like this could help give me perspective. Does anyone have experience with this? Or can link me to some reliable resources? Are there any other skills other than TIP and accepts?

On top of all this my mum's been sending me nasty texts about how I'm not trying hard enough, that taking PRNs like Ativan and Seroquel are a cop out and that I have skills and that I'm ""choosing"" not to use them. I just feel so invalidated by her and the psychiatrist I deal with here is gaslighting. I won't even go in to what he's said to me but ultimately I need to learn how to validate myself and not depend on others for that validation. Any tips on how I can learn this? I'm so desperate, I'm ready to drop out of this program if things don't get better... they won't take my intense emotions seriously and I suspect they're stigmatizing due to the BPD diagnosis, but I have no proof of that and I don't want to play the victim so take that with a grain of salt. Anyways, any skills or advice? Please, I'm desperate...",1593344535.0,False,13,11,realsimoneweil,None,hhd0it,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/hhd0it/skills_for_dealing_with_intense_emotion/
3,"I know that BPD is an exceptionally painful disorder, but I am grateful to be a member of this community.","I've read articles about how painful BPD can be. I included a few quotes from pages that summarize the research below so as to substantiate what I am writing about for those w/oBPD because it is difficult to explain the absolute AGONY that can be felt inside my body at any given time because of a thought or feeling. It's absolutely unreal! I've had a kid without pain intervention. I've been stabbed. I've dealt with broken bones. None of these experiences come close to how painful it can be when my mind is SCREAMING at me that I am useless, worthless, dirty, disgusting, pathetic, stupid, shameful... I can't even tell you how desperate I've been to make the pain to STOP although I have a feeling that many of you understand all too well. 

With this said, I can't help but be grateful to be a member of the BPD community. I have been diagnosed with other disorders, and even though I find them easier to manage, I don't find myself actually happy to be dealing with any of them. They're just an accepted reality. With BPD though, I have all of YOU, so I am not just okay to be tackling this disorder - I'm kinda glad that I am. I have never ever met a group of people like us in any other space for any other disorders. Yes, there are always supportive people to be found in all communities, but the way that BPD folks can empathize non-judgmentally is something unlike anything else.

If I could take all of our suffering away, I would because I don't wish BPD on anyone, but if this is what we need to deal with, I'm glad to be in good company with all of you. 

Thank you for being here. x.

4,What is wise mind in DBT?,"Have you ever snapped at someone and surprised yourself with how harsh you sounded?

You may have thought, *whoa… where did that come from?!*

You were probably acting from what’s called “Emotion Mind” in DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy). DBT is a therapy methodology developed by Marsha Linehan which helps people feel more in control of their thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

When in emotion mind, people react based on their mood, without taking logic into account.

**You May Be in Emotion Mind If:**

* You’re reacting quickly, without thinking things through
* You’re acting on urges without taking into account your long-term goals
* You’re behaving impulsively and aren’t considering potential consequences of your actions
* You want to hurt who hurt you, even if you’re not typically a vengeful person
* You’re not considering anyone else’s feelings or additional context of the situation

On the other end of the spectrum is Reasonable Mind, which is rational, logical and steady.

You might be thinking, *okay, reasonable and rational, that sounds good! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time must be the goal, right?*

Actually, no! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time isn’t ideal, either. 

**You May Be in Reasonable Mind If:**

* You feel cut off from, or “numb” to your emotions
* You minimize or shrug off your feelings
* You rationalize your own or others’ behavior, even behavior that is unacceptable
* You are avoiding or in denial about something that is happening
* You are completely focused on a task

When we’re in Reasonable Mind, we’re cut off from our emotions. It’s important to be aware of and feel our emotions. First, because it’s an essential part of the human experience. More importantly, emotions contain very important information we need to understand our needs and boundaries.

Here’s an example of why awareness of emotions is important. Let’s say you feel angry and irritable every time you see your friend. Reasonable mind might say you’re being irrational and dismiss the feelings. But chances are there’s a good reason why you’re feeling angry at them, especially since it keeps happening.

Maybe they’re putting you down a lot, or not listening to what you’re saying. Or maybe you feel jealous of them. Finding the answer to why you’re angry is important to figuring out how to resolve your anger, whether you do so on your own or with the other person.

There are a number of potential reasons why people have difficulty being in Wise Mind. Maybe they haven’t had many people in their life model what it looks like to be in Wise Mind. Maybe staying in Reasonable Mind has protected them from extreme traumatic reactions. Maybe acting from Emotion Mind has gotten their needs met, for better or worse.

When you’re able to acknowledge your feelings without acting impulsively on them, you’re in Wise Mind.

**You May Be in Wise Mind If:**

* You’re taking both your emotions and logic into account
* You can name and feel your emotions
* You’re considering different ways to proceed before acting
* You can see the situation from multiple perspectives
* It feels like *you* are in control, not your mood

If you’re rarely in Wise Mind, don’t worry! You can increase your Wise Mind skills with practice.

**Ways to Cultivate Wise Mind Skills**

* Pause throughout the day and ask yourself which state of mind you are in.
* If you are in Emotion Mind, label which emotions you’re feeling.
* Using coping skills before acting on your feelings (for instance, journal, go on a walk, or take a hot shower).
* If you want to engage in a behavior that’s impulsive or mood-based (for example, emotional eating, texting your ex, substance abuse, etc.)
   * Delay the behavior by 1 hour
   * Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or peer before engaging in the behavior
   * Consider the negative consequences of the behavior
   * Replace the behavior with something less harmful (for example, drawing on your arms with a Sharpie instead of self-harming)
* Participate in a DBT program in your area. It can help you develop not only Wise Mind skills, but also, a wide variety of other skills related to Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Relationships.
* Practice yoga, Tai-Chi, or other physical activities that help you get in touch with your body. These can also help you develop more awareness of yourself and your emotions.
* Talk to a therapist! A therapist can help you stay accountable as you work towards strengthening your Wise Mind.

5,About to embark on a 32 week DBT/Therapy program - spaces available in the group DBT sessions,"I am about to bite the bullet and begin a course of therapy and DBT training.  It’s going to send me into debt, but I’ve been in debt before and never for anything this valuable.

After searching online, I have found a licensed professional counselor and psychologist who is trained and experienced in working with pwBPD and in facilitating DBT Skills training sessions.

This therapist has a solid track record and (like Linehan) does not suggest medication – and very importantly to me, does not suggest facing or exploring traumas during this program.  This appeals to me.

I am in Asia, so I have been looking all over.  This counselor is based in the UK – and recommends a 32 week program – two sessions a week. One session each week will be group DBT Skills training, and the other will be 1 on 1 sessions exploring and applying the DBT training.

Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 2 (8 weeks) 	emotion regulation
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 3 (8 weeks)	interpersonal effectiveness
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 4 (8 weeks)	distress tolerance
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness

What is really tough for me is the cost – the session cost is 95GBP per session.  However, they would pro-rata this rate for the group DBT sessions – 95 divided by the number of participants.  That appeals to me because I learn very well in a group, and the pwBPD support group I take part in has been very valuable to me.

They are currently reaching out to colleagues to learn if there are others being treated who would like to be part of DBT Skills training and therapy.  So I want to share that opportunity here.

I recognize it is expensive.  I am fortunate enough that a close friend has seen how I suffered in the past 18 months and is lending me the money – it will take me quite a while to pay it back but its so much more important than anything I ever went into debt for.   It is also a solid commitment – they require we sign a contract  to commit to the program.

While it might not be for everyone here, I thought it might be worthwhile to present it to see who in this subreddit is interested.  I am eager to get started, to finally take a step I have never done and commit to 8 months of difficult weekly work.  It would certainly make it easier if the group sessions had 3-5 people, and not only me or me and one other.

IF you are interested, feel you can manage the cost (with a group session reduction as indicated), and want to know more; PM me.  I am happy to share the therapists profile and answer what I can, and connect you with them if you want to know more – they offer a free consultation session to help you decide if its right for you.

6,What's made you successful?,"Hi all - I think there is a small bump in the viewers of this sub from the question I asked in /r/BPD yesterday.  I think a lot of us are some way down the path of recovery or gaining control again in our lives.  I'm not too far down, only about a month in, but I'm trying everything I can to stay focused.  I definitely have my setbacks, but they seem to be occurring less and less.  

So, what are you doing that has helped you consistently or consistently-ish?  How consistent has it been?

**For me:**

1.Studying DBT. This includes:  
  
* Self-study (Online course, purchased the official DBT workbooks)  
* Official program through my psychologists (Actually a mix of schema and DBT therapy)
  
2.Studying discipline and habits and putting them into practice.  This includes:   
  
* Using a timing technique, and dividing all tasks into 5 minute pieces.  This helps me overcome and procrastination, seems to be addicting in a way, and I end up doing way more work than I expect most days.
* Forming everyday habits around household duties, exercise, spending habits, therapy, journaling, planning, DBT skills, tasks I normally procrastinate on, and even interaction with others.  
* Planning the majority of tasks every night before bed.

3.Thinking of others instead of myself.  This includes:  
  
* Calling my parents or reaching out to a friend/acquaintance every day, even when I don't want to.
* Reaching out to others I know are in pain  
* Looking for people in crisis online and making donations, learning about them, etc.  
* Journaling about my children, 5 minute gratefulness journaling which includes being thankful for others in my life.
* Planning activities with others and going through with them

Learning new tools to handle my emotions, developing many healthy habits and finding a way to stick to them (simple timing techniques), and putting much more emphasis in thinking of others around me when I tend to think of myself has been life-changing.  For about a month so far.  Two major emotional setbacks during this period, both when I decided to drink heavily.  In general I'm avoiding alcohol, and only allow myself to drink once per week (from Marsha Linehan - the more successful modern programs for alcoholics are not complete abstinence), however, I'm not strong enough to control myself once I start at this point, and it doesn't usually go well unless I'm around others.",1507020826.0,False,11,15,mgale85,None,73z6rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/73z6rc/whats_made_you_successful/
7,having bpd is the equivalent to having third degree burns all over your body,"long ass vent for myself tbh

""Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement""

Marsha linehan who developed the therapy method DBT said that about people who suffer from borderline.

It quite literally produces the most intense emotional pain of any mental illness, it has a fatality rate of 10% 45 times more than the general population. 

According to Linehan we lose all cognitive functioning during periods of extreme emotional distress which unfortunately for BPD can happen at the drop of a feather. 

Personally for me it used to be a raging burning feeling in my head. Where I couldnt hear the rational part of my brain telling me you love this person, this isn't you, you don't want to do this, it's not a big deal. The voice in the back of my head that shuts that shit down immediately now was practically silenced. I couldnt hear them no matter how much I tried. Or if I actually managed to hear them and gripped onto it to bring myself back; I would just spiral and fall right back into the pit anyways. Because I had never even started the true healing process. And because the person I was with fed the worst parts of my fears and insecurities. My brain was completely consumed with so much of that hurt/fear/insecurity/humilation and it turned to a unceasing completely blinding rage. I would fall back in again and again desperately clawing to get out but succumbing each time to the borderline insanity that involuntarily manifested in my brain. 

My most painful moments of BPD haunt me every day. The absolute loss of control I used to feel over the smallest most stupid things. Scream crying alone in my room again and again, feeling the extreme grief equivalent to all my loved ones being murdered in front of me repeatedly over a simple relationship ending, its literally hell on fucking earth. Right now my dog who I love more than anything (outside of my FP) even more than myself, could be murdered right in front of me and I still know it wouldn't even compare to what I felt in every moment of the nightmare that was my existence at the time. 

I remember thinking in those moments of absolute mania and panic that this was anguish beyond belief, nothing had ever compared or ever could. Not even the extreme torture and abuse from my childhood. And I got brushed off and told it wasn't nearly THAT bad and it just feels that way because I'm still so close to it. No way could the emotional pain ever match the insanity of what my step mum put me through. As if I wasn't the one who had to deal with and then overcome the unceasing years and years of nightmares, flashbacks and constant panic attacks. As if I don't remember how acute that particular pain is. 

Well it's been over a year now and my extreme physical pain experiences will never ever fucking compare to the absolute torture of those moments. I would go through the worst of the worst all again than feel even a moment of that. When I tell people that they really can't believe me. They hear what happened to me in childhood and then what my ex did to me and it's not even comparable to them. How could I even for a second say she hurt me more? 

People without BPD literally cannot even comprehend how painful and intense our emotions can get. How everything is dialled up to a billion and we have NO control over it. I truly believe the vast vast majority of them (even ones who have been seriously hurt) have never felt the amount of agony that BPD people (involuntarily) create in their own heads. I believe that, because I've been through extreme verbal sexual and physical abuse and it was nothing to how my brain blindsided and ambushed me when I got my first FP. I understand why it doesn't make sense to them they will never understand what we have to live with and go through every day just by existing. But for me personally no amount of my sexual trauma or physical torture will ever compare to the pain of just being with a favourite person who showed me my first experiences of ""love"", made me feel joy for the first time in my life and then had to leave me, moved on and no longer cared for me at all anymore. (Actually was actively out for my blood in my situation 😐) Especially when you only live for the people you love in the first place. They are your entire centre of existence. In your head it's absolutely inconceivable you could ever not dedicate every part of yourself to them. What do you do then...

Fortunately for me I healed. Back then, with the person I was with, my body did really feel like an exposed wound at all times. Any little thing could set it off and cause me extreme pain. She couldn't understand how much pain I was in because I was cursed to manifest it as anger. Of course that makes it hard to empathise with especially when you become a victim of abuse as a result. I truly couldn't control it, I didn't realise this at the time but she constantly unintentionally kept me in a state of fear of abandonment and continuously enforced insecurities surrounding my body and who I even am as a person. Every little thing would set me off subconsciously, it would effect my emotions and actions in ways I couldn't control or many times even notice. Because my feelings were constantly being hurt by her, constantly felt devestation bubbling under the surace because no one meant more to me, no one's effect on my emotions even came close. So sometimes it was overt and drastic. I truly could not understand my extreme reaction to something so stupid after. That wasn't me. No part of that was me I know now deep down to my core my need for control completely came from fear. I was 100x more sensitive, everything was so agonising all the time without me even realising. And unfortunately that led me to take it out on them which kept me in a constant state of shame and regret that I had to push down as well.

Throughout my childhood my brain learned that fight, not flight would save me. The only time the torture stopped was when I hurt them back. So when I feel pain or hurt or anything that destabilizes me; especially from the person who had grounded me the most and had once made me feel the safest and most loved when no one else has before. I became theirs. I quite literally belonged to them, I didn't even realise how miserable I was. Once they showed me that side to life I couldn't let go. I relied on them entirely for any sense of safety and comfort or happiness so subconsciously when they took that away from me my brain ""defends"" itself without my fucking permission. It haunts me that the people I loved the most I used to hurt the most. I wish it could have been anyone else than the people I care for so deeply. As much as I wish I internalized that pain...I couldn't, I really really fucking couldnt at the time. So I lashed out, again and again and again uncontrollably until she thankfully left me and I got to find someone I could actually have my skin and a true sense of safety with for the first time in my life. 

Immense healing happened so rapidly. She immediately made me feel secure in my body, and satisfied in general within the first few weeks, which gave me a huge boost of self esteem and motivation to actually practice self care and improve myself. I mean if she could find me beautiful this fucking girl then I gotta try. I had to actually be worthy of her. I will never let myself be unworthy again. I needed to stop being a depressed potato and actually be my best self. Be Bucky in a sense. Also she seemed so attracted to me, so into me and even my body. She saw something I never could I wanted to see myself for the first time through her eyes. See myself as beautiful. 

She gave me hope, actually hope I could be better and change everything. Undo all the excessive damage that was done to my brain. Figure out all the different personalities rattling around in there and learn to listen and focus on the ones that are actually me. Not manifested from the darkest, traumatised, survival mode parts of myself. I realised I had so many layers, so many different thought processes going on at once. Of course it led to instability. I needed to silence them... I started DBT. I grinded in therapy twice a week. I consistently took my Lamictal and started Vyvanse to help with the head buzzing. Worked full time while in school to afford the insurance. Let out my emotions through working with animals and working out. I felt satisfication with myself every day, not even exhausted cause atleast now I was trying. I was accomplishing something. Every day learning new things about myself and taking steps forward. I discovered crazy things about myself in therapy (not necessarily always fun stuff) but it opened my mind so much to hopefully bring out the best version of me. 



One of my most intense triggers was retroactive jealousy. It tormented me constantly in my last relationship it was one of the first big leaps to destroying it and continued to break it down further throughout. Every tiny thing used to set me off and make me feel incredibly insecure. It's hard to describe what it felt like it's been so long since I felt anything even similar and it wasn't quite as overwhelming as the black out split rages. So not as potent a memory for me. But it was a mix of masochism and deep deep insecurity and hatred of myself compared to CIS men, which led to rages and spiralling. I would make her confirm my worst fears again and again maybe just to hurt myself, maybe in desperate attempt to make it okay in my head. It was mental self harm and I didn't realise that. RAJ was completely new to me (in fact I didn't even know every through out what was really going on) and it absolutely blindsided me. After that I didn't even know how to deal with it, I didn't know where to begin. I don't think I even possibly could have with the person I was with. I could never have gotten to a point with them where I believed in myself, or didn't constantly hate myself, and wasnt stuck in perpetual loop of survival mode with.

I thought I experienced RAJ with her because she was my first FP but with my current FP I could prod myself all day and feel absolutely nothing. Not a shred of hurt or insecurity. She healed me so much by just making me feel unconditionally loved for the first time in my life. Physically being with her is incredibly important it's my #1 love language and she has built up my view of my body to heights I would have never imagined. We are so fucking intensely intimate all the time it's crazy (it's the bpd in us) Who else could fucking matter we are each other's universes. I know that I'm her world and no one else, even a CIS man could compare. (Seriously though retroactive jealousy as a transman dating a straight girl is the worst and made me act like a completely different person Jesus Christ) I know I don't have to feel jealous because every fucking day she shows me that. I don't feel completely disconnected and isolated from her. I'm so god damn lucky, she gives me such a sense of peace and fullfillment. I tricked myself into thinking my last relationship was anything close to love or feeling real love...when I don't feel that constant turmoil and instability, when I actually feel like enough, when I'm grounded in who I am and feel safe and secure with who I'm with; it's so so so much easier. Everything felt so out of control when my head was constantly scared and in defence mode with them. Constantly needing to win arguments because admitting I'm wrong takes vulnerability which I could not show to her. So easy to admit I'm wrong to my current partner and to just drop any disagreement because I feel subconsciously safe enough to give up all power to her anytime. Plus my current partner having BPD unlike my ex; she actually can understand the insane amount of pain we can feel over the smallest things. How it compares to nothing else. How out of that pain we can say and do things that aren't any part of us at all. She doesn't just write it off because its so extreme and irrational. We both can have so much empathy and understanding for each other and it's so peaceful. Never taking an us VS them mentality. Feeling like you're always on the same team with your partner. Constantly growing, learning and healing together. We don't argue at all because before it can even escalate we have already focused on listening and validating the other person in their concern and come to a conclusion together that works.

Along those lines she also helped me discover my severe sexual abuse, healed my ""partners family hating me trauma"" that I've experienced throughout the years for many different reasons, affirmed me constantly in every aspect of my body that used to destroy me, rekindled my relationship with my mum an old shame of mine. Basically pushed the kind, strong, grounded side of me to the surface with her unceasing support, and given me a first look at a stable normal happy healthy life. (god damn the way she went all out at Christmas for me, healed something deep to my little kid core) She was my first hope. Hope that we can actually achieve the dream future I've always pictured; become the person I always dreamed of. First real reason to have any ambition or to give a shit in life where my brain before was just in a dead end slump of hopelessness.

BPD is a fucking curse. But with the right support system and enough effort/ dedication it can actually be manageable. Life is so much easier when I can practice emotional regulation and actually grow my emotional skin for the first time. It may have been stripped from me as a kid but I know love, time, dedication and resources can heal me fully one day. I may always be a loaded gun because of what happened to me, and I've always struggled before to keep my finger off the trigger. But not anymore with the right toolset I'm going to destroy that trigger entirely.

UPDATED 3 FEB: Well, my big issue in organizing this is that there's no time that suits everyone globally.  Yet I need this and several of you are clearly interested. 

So I'm going to schedule this based on my time (GMT +7)  but trying my best to take others into consideration. I'M GOING TO GET IT SET UP BY FRIDAY 5 FEBRUARY. 

For those still following/interested- this will be a weekly 1.5 to 2 hour Zoom meeting focused on the group working through a DBT skills training workbook together (I'm leaning towards the DBT skills Workbook by Brantley, McKay, and wood, or the DBT Skills Manual by Linehan) I will commit to every week so I'm looking for similar commitment.

Our first meeting will involve selecting the workbook, getting comfortable and creating a safe space, and adjusting anything. I'm an experienced and certified learning facilitator and arts teacher, so I can get us started process-wise but otherwise i want us all equal and collaborative. 

On Friday morning Feb 5 (remember I live in Asia) I'll send info to those interested who have responded with the following in my Direct Messages (not a comment to this post, and I'll take those who provide ALL the following info (I'm a Virgo, possibly some level of OCD- But those who do DM me with this will have at least read and understand the intention here)

- reddit handle (no real names please)
-your home GMT time (not US time zone, Google your GMT)
-your age 
-preferred pronouns 
-date of BPD diagnosis by a licensed
 professional 

So for me it would be
be
-Ira Johnson 
-GMT+7
-53
-he/him
-mid 1995

I apologize because there will be no way to fit everyone who expressed interest. However for those that don't fit (time zone, inability to commit, preference for different workbook or style etc); I'll advise you if you like on setting something up... but let me get this one off the ground first.  I really need help, and I think others may too. 

Thank you so much. That's a lot to read. Please DM me with the 5 pieces of information I mentioned. 

Uncle Ira

19 JAN:  Thanks to those who have PMed me.  I'm currently working on a big project for work that will take place in less than a week - after 26 January I will have a lot more free time as we enter the Chinese New Year/Winter holiday season.  So after 26th if you have PMed me, watch for an update.

UPDATED:  Thanks for the responses!  Some have PMed me- if you're seriously interested and willing to commit, please PM me. 

Here's what's gelling at the moment:
-group of 8-12
-weekly commitment 
-DBT workbook/skills training 
-safe space (we will define that together)
-meet via Zoom 

Ideally I'll set something up next week, not to get right to work but to create the group collaboratively.

The key for me will be commitment of those involved. Let's approach this with empathy, authenticity, vulnerability,  trust, and integrity. 

Uncle Ira


Anyone have any suggestions on the best way to keep this safe?  I want to make sure that committed people in need can take part.

Serious interested people who read this and are willing to commit to a weekly Zoom meeting, please PM me.  It will be hard to find a time that suits all time zones but we can try.  I have organized online events for global audiences and usually only one or two folks has to get up super early.

Please DM me with your preferred name or handle, your time zone, and any other thoughts or information.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I hope this can become active with ideas and thoughts:

Has anyone any experience with online support groups for BPD?  This subreddit is thankfully helpful and non-toxic, yet just go a few r/ over to some others... some can really hurt.  That's the thing for me, I want to be open and share, and talk to others, but I am frankly very scared of miscommunication causing hurt, and of trolls bombing the experience.

Miscommunication because we are each different in our struggle.  I am 50+, White, American (from the south, at that!), cisgender, hetero, agnostic, and not living in my home culture.  As you can imagine, some of the results of that combination result in my thinking not being as progressive in some areas.  I am very open-minded but not always quick on the uptake.  For example, I appreciate those in the LGBTQIA/BIPOC community who have helped me understand and change some of my behaviors and programming that are otherwise rooted in white western patriarchal bullshit.

Support groups require a lot of trust because we need the space to be vulnerable.  You do not know my real name or details, but in other parts of the redditsphere people are eager to do detective work and share others personal details.

I really have come to appreciate this subreddit, and would be really interested in participating in or setting up some kind of online support group.  In my career I am an experienced and respected facilitator of learning and development workshops, so I can easily design and help facilitate a simple format based on [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) \- I love this system because its co-designing the workshop with all the learners.  My company has a pro Zoom account that could be used as well.

I hope I can be a part of a weekly live-call support group, where the numbers are kept at a manageable level for sharing yet enough people are present to provide different perspectives - max 10 maybe? But then I do not want those in need to be excluded...  Perhaps there can be some demonstration of commitment, those who want to be part of such a thing for a period of time rather than just dropping in to try it out...  I'd love to share and hear tips and strategies and serve as a sounding board and have the accountability and support of such a group.  I'd especially love a situation where a group of us could work together towards DBT skills, but without prohibitive cost (I imagine, especially in times like these, that there are others of you who simply cannot afford typical DBT training costs - I cannot).

If the idea of such a group interests you, please share here - what would you want to see?  How would such a thing be useful to you?  What fears or concerns do you have?

It's something I want to be a part of, not necessarily something I want to organize.  I'd happily defer to an existing support group, or to a licensed counselor or therapist.   However if what we/I are looking for does not exist, then maybe we can create it.",1610685255.0,False,17,16,IraJohnson,None,kxn2hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/kxn2hk/online_bpd_support_group/

2,Holy wow DBT is amazing,"Wow dudes. It seriously is.

I’ve been in CBT with some DBT features for like a year and a half and I made huge strides! But now I moved, and am starting DBT group and a one on one CBT therapist in my new city in two weeks.

I haven’t started the new therapies yet - but my friend who is a psychologist sent me a packet of DBT worksheets for my time off therapy and holy WOW - they are effective.

Personally, they take a long ass time for me to fill out, and I only feel like they work for me because a.) I already have experience with doing logs like this and with cognitive distortions and schemas through my time in CBT, and b.) I already have worked on emotional awareness a lot for several years with several therapists.

But like - this morning my partner said something innocuous of course which scared the shit out of me and immediately felt anxious and scared and angry and confused and I wanted to ask him all these questions and interrogate him and do all my impulsive behaviors…

But then I filled out “check the facts” and wow. It just wild. It took probably an hour for me to really work through it, but I can see SO clearly exactly the route my mind took, and why, and I feel empathetic with myself, and I feel like I understand my partner, and I feel safe and happy and understood and I took no actions that I regret and just…wow.

I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago. I am now in my third year of therapy with two clinical psychologists: I have been through DBT, CBT, CBT-TF, Schema Therapy & mentalisation. It’s been a fight to stay alive so I can become a clinical psychologist to help treat those with personality disorders. I found out last night, after a lengthy internal review process, that a charity advocating for Borderline personality disorder awareness called “Emotions Matter” have decided to use their website as a platform to further spread my dissertation project. They have recently been on Fox 5 News too where they continuously fight for the stigmas we face. So often I’ve felt I’m not really making much of a difference, and whether my fight and passion is going anywhere, but this feels like such a great first step in primarily BPD awareness but also my career aspirations & the differences I want to make. You can find it in the “advocacy” section of their website over the next couple of days🥹🧡

I was not compliant. Never found a good therapist. Was just heavily medicated with antipsychotics. But my patterns? Worse and worse with time. Dad died at 18. No financial stability and abuse at home of all kinds. Writing this post outside of my family house where my brother broke my nose. 

Just following with a convenient psychiatrist for the time. But no real change. Just staying afloat. CBT doesn’t work.

I am lonely. I do not fit in. People mostly bullied me for being autistic. In teen years and adulthood, I was sometimes repulsive. I lost my elementary school friends. I traveled and didn’t contact them for a decade. I don’t make real friends . I just act like a clown and mask. Or trauma dump.

Was stuck in a toxic FP situation for 3 years. Took my emotions and energy and complicated things. Much older person (3 times my age) and was pretty much groomed at 18. Finally left him . I was clingy desperate for a toxic person.

But I am always emotionally promiscuous anyway. Any guy shows the slightest bit of attention, I run into his arms regardless of red flags.

DBT is, but my only option to self administer. I've already noticed that distress is much easier to tolerate, I'm more mindful, etc. It's nice.

However - there are certain things I'm struggling with, and dont know what skills to apply to combat. These are two things.

The first of which is the awareness of futility, and fear of the future. I am painfully aware of the fact that tomorrow, my entire family could die, or I could face brutal abuse, and no amount of therapy skills could help me. Frankly, the world can be a horrible and cruel place, and it makes any amount of self improvement feel almost counterintuitive, and as though as the smart solution is to...Off yourself. I won't, I'm just aware of this thought pattern, and I think it impacts my commitment to the treatment.

The second is my struggle in identifying which of my interpersonal needs are valid, and which may be unfair. For example - my boyfriend and I had a fight last night because I felt as though he never listens to me (I was showing him YouTube videos, and he rolled over and groaned). Objectively very rude - but what degree of response is warranted? Or the time I got upset with him over something I completely made up in my head, and was quite unpleasant about? In the moment - how do you distinguish, find, and calmly communicate your own fair needs as a person from mental illness symptoms when they often feel identical?",1698636329.0,False,6,6,recovet,None,17jkbv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17jkbv2/struggling_with_some_things_in_regard_to_dbt/
22,how do I stop running away when I feel hurt,"I try to communicate with my partner and problem solve for the most part, but sometimes emotions get to intense were I can't and so I just run away and tell him I don't want to be together. Sometimes I mean it, other times it's so he will take me seriously or feel the pain I feel. But alot of the time I don't even think about why I do it, it's just a intense reaction to my emotions. Sometimes I can't put space in-between them no matter how much I use my DBT or CBT skills. Sometimes it just happens.

I’ve lurked on this sub for a few months now and I’ve been in remission for 1.5 years now. I had a very intense upbringing filled with domestic violence, sexual abuse, and bullying throughout my early childhood years but I was known for being a very sweet girl, top student in class throughout my K-12 years, generally always having a “fawn” response because of my intense fear of letting others down. My worst breakup occurred close to 2.5 years ago and it made me reevaluate everything I knew about love so I took a 1.5 year break from romantic relationships and went to CODA meetings, attended therapy weekly (CBT), and graduated from university and got my first big girl job as a school librarian. I’ve been with my lovely boyfriend for almost a year now (in may!!) and this is the FIRST time in my life where I haven’t blown up a person’s phone with nonsensical paragraphs about delusional bullshit and trauma. Mainly, if I’m having a bad day, I let him know in a very loving manner and request just a bit of time to cool down. I was diagnosed with autism 3ish years ago so it’s been quite a journey. I don’t have the easiest living situation (I have a younger sister who has Down syndrome; she is nonverbal and blind) but I truly try to practice gratitude everyday because I have a roof over my head and that’s such a huge blessing.

But ether way,  I have not been as bad as I have tonight... Not for years... And I'm thinking it's because I smoked weed about two days ago. 


First here me out, the last 3 attempts I've had at smoking weed, has helped. But about 2-4 days afterwards my anger and emotions become insane. It takes afew weeks for it to subside. I hadn't smoked weed since I was dignosised with schizophrenia, but I have been trying a purple CBD strain with very little thc. I heard it can help with psychosis and bpd. And the last few times I wasn't sure but now I definitely think it's the weed. I threatened suicide on someone that I really really liked romanically and who were one of the most amazing guys I'd ever dated. I ruined it all and I hate myself for it. I have not threatened anything like that in many many years. I have no experienced that amount of emotion in my life. This was not normal at all for me. I ruined so many things in the last few days and now it's becoming a pattern. I smoke, I feel amazing, then two days later I am uncontrollable.

I'm now a shell of my old self. Today I was looking through all my old posts on Instagram and I cried. Because I mentally had forgotten who I was and how confident and happy I was back then. I didn't even realize at the time how much I had found myself back then. How free I was.. how courageous and inspiring and truly just nothing but my unapologetic self not letting anything hold me back. Fast forward 8 months and I'm a mess. I don't recognize that person anymore. I have been in abusive relationships all my life. This isn't my first rodeo. I have a very long history of childhood abuse over years.

34,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

36,how to work on attachment,"Hi. I (20F) just got broken up with by my ex (22M) last night and have been NC. It's a very long story, but he ended things because of my behavior in the past few months being toxic and harmful. He said he loved me, he didn't want to do it, was ugly crying with me, but it was done anyway. Over the course of our nearly 8 month relationship, major life events happened, I lost sight, and he ended up becoming my Favorite Person unintentionally. 

I have been in bouts of crying, but I have been talking with many people and have a rocky plan for the foreseeable future. First, I have CBT and DBT in the next two days, and then on Wednesday I'm going to the doctor to switch my medication (cymbalta) to something else that will target mood swings. I am going to join a grief support group to manage the grief I felt these past couple months. I've written out the toxic attachments I developed and boundaries that we had at the beginning that fell away. 

I'm going to stay NC until Friday, wherein I'll reevaluate everything, but I don't know how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? I don't have these issues with anyone else in my life, only my romantic partner(s), and until the shit of life hit the fan, I was navigating my attachment very well. 

He is truly the love of my life, and we had so many things planned together. Everything was mapped out, and I was so secure with him. I believe when things went down that I used him too much for emotional reliance and we became a tad codependent. We are both anxious attachment, I think, and I have BPD whereas he does not. I do still love him, though, and I want to firstly work on my own issues for a while, but I do want to be with him again, if he'd try us out again.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? Or just any advice in general? 

edit: broke no contact. found out he and his sister are leaving town for a while, so I left him a voice-mail last night telling him to stay safe and that I miss him. said I love you. texted his sister a similar sentiment. the lack of response really feels like I just tore my own insides out, but I suppose that's the decision that's been made. I dont want to lose him, and I feel I already have

edit 2: talked to my dr. the medication I was on for my arthritis gave me psychosis, and my rheumatologist didn't check my mental history before prescribing them. I stopped those, started taking prozac instead of cymbalta, and started 3 omega-3 fish oils, 1 vitamin b1, and 2 magnesium glycinate. i had a phone call w his sister a few days ago and she said he isn't ready to talk yet but it was fairly amicable. sending a text tmrw for his birthday but haven't reached out. going to the psychiatrist in a few weeks to get mood stabilizers. ive done a lot of journaling, therapy, and talking and distracting. I know I can thrive without him and I don't NEED him to survive, but I do love him and he enhances my life. I want us to work out, but I'm not going to spam or go crazy w the contact. After the bday text, I'm not going to reach out, which is hard, but if it's meant to be he will come back.",1711942056.0,False,6,4,casineb,None,1bstfxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1bstfxm/how_to_work_on_attachment/
37,Getting over the final frontier?,"Hi, I have never posted here before. Hello. I (26F) have been diagnosed with BPD since I was 16. Things were incredibly chaotic in my life until I was about 22, and then I began to grow more self-aware. I have been steadily improving; though of course I've had periods of intense reactivity and disorder along the way. 

At this point, it feels like my self-awareness has maxed out. A lot of the time I can recognize when I'm becoming activated, and am able to stop my impulse to freak out at someone, or self-harm, or spiral or whatever. But there are still other times when my emotions become too powerful, and I get blown away by them. Especially anger or shame. Many of those instances, I'm even somewhat aware that I'm reacting intensely/inappropriately - but I still can't stop myself from reacting. 

My question is - how does one surpass this final frontier, and get to a place where you have your emotional reactivity under control? 

I'm really sick of being like this, and sometimes I hurt people emotionally, which is horrible. But I don't even feel bad until afterwards, when the emotional tide has ended. I would like to never hurt anyone again, but it's like I won't ever fully tame my emotions. 

I've gotten probably 75% better but I can't get over that last quarter. I've been through therapy many times, I've studied CBT, DBT, mindfulness, meditation, PTSD recovery.

I think the younger you are with BPD the harder it is / the more emotional you are.  So if you are young and it is very hard for you - this is normal.

- Learn coping skills and practice them as much as you can

- Embrace all of the methods people say work.  No need to waste time on fringe / unproven stuff.  YouTube has videos on all of these : CBT, DBT, Mindfulness, Mentalization, Stoicism, Buddhism, and anything else common I forgot.

- **avoid toxic relationships**

- **avoid toxic work environments**

- **avoid toxic friends**

- you need to relearn how to think, this will take time and effort

- take shelter from the world in your own inner strength (buddhism / stoicism)

40,Success story: 3 years since I no longer met the criteria for BPD,"**Background:**

Diagnosed with BPD at 19: I would engage in extremely toxic and manipulative behaviours with my boyfriend at the time - spamming his phone if he didn’t reply within one hour, threatening self harm if he wasn’t spending all his spare time with me or felt he would leave me, I would split him every single day, within a matter of hours, no matter how hard he tried to make me happy or “do things right”. 
I was in college but couldn’t keep even a part-time job and failed countless classes because I’d lose motivation and had absolutely no sense of self.
I wanted him to hurt as much as I hurt from all my past unresolved trauma, putting it onto small things he might have misstepped, swinging from being extremely anxious/depressed to explosive anger. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn’t help myself - no emotional regulation, black and white thinking, the works.

When he finally couldn’t take it anymore, I broke down completely and sought professional help where I was diagnosed with BPD. When I first read the symptoms, it was like reading myself on a page. 

**Recovery:**

Recovery took at least 5 years: I had to take a long, hard, brutal look at myself and shared it (embarrassingly) with my psych - identifying my traumas, triggers, behaviours and accepting it. 

I had times (especially in the first 2 years) where I regressed and engaged in undesirable behaviours and would hate myself so much I wanted to die.
The most difficult to manage was my dependency on partners, I feared abandonment more than anything and would lie or threaten self-harm to make them stay. 
But I kept self-compassion, accountability for my actions, and persevered. The frequencies became noticeably less and I used that to keep motivated. 
DBT and CBT worked wonders, especially practicing radical acceptance, wise mind, mindfulness, GIVE, and self-soothing techniques.
I also worked on my trauma through multiple EMDR sessions and counselling sessions at the same time.

3 years ago I was told I no longer met the criteria for BPD. I’m so proud of myself for keeping up with all my improvements (still use the same techniques today).
I’m so much more stable and confident. I have never insulted my husband, breached his privacy, threatened self-harm, spammed messages, tried to control his actions, blew up on him, or shifted blame during the entirety of this 4 year relationship (I had already come so far then) - it’s basic respect, but before therapy this would’ve been impossible for me.

41,Ex pwBPD Reflection,"My ex pwBPD [43f] told me,

>I love you but I’m not in love with you. Because the person you met before was not me. Because in the moment I was completely out of it and the person you met was a crazy f****** b**** who was 20 something. Like I can remember everything we were saying. People switch (split?), I switched (split?) myself. When I don’t want to feel pain or whatever I run away and I start doing stupid shit. And that’s the reason I’m hiding and it’s coming out this other person. The therapist said it happened because of everything you went through in your life. 
My therapist told me, “Do you know that what are you doing right is not correct, it’s not you? That you’re just toxic right now and damaging that person.” And I think it’s the best, it’s much better because when she starts working on when I was abused, and it’s going to be very soon, believe me I don’t wanna go through that pain. I don’t want to be with nobody. I don’t wanna have a boyfriend that’s the problem you don’t understand. I don’t want a boyfriend. I don’t want a man touch me. I don’t want anything. I don’t want to future with a man. want to be alone. 
Because when I met you, I was escaping from my ex-boyfriend. and I was just escaping. that’s the reason you met the person. it wasn’t me because I was lost. I’m still lost but in the moment I was completely out of control without the correct medication. 

Some questions I have,

1. Is this common for a BPD episode or a manic episode?

2. Do borderlines ever want to reconcile with their healthy/supportive ex partners after going through medication, intensive DBT and CBT? Even if this is a matter of years into recovery? We are friends now, and my ex borderline is extremely sorry and feeling beyond guilty for hurting me. She cares about me **immensely** and is still extremely sweet to me. She does not want a relationship but does not want one in general. The mention of wanting to be with nobody, not wanting a husband, and a future alone sounds like borderline black-and-white thinking. 

Also she mentioned in the past while we were still together and her BPD was triggered,

>I am not able to have a relationship with you or nobody else because It **never** going to work 
out because of my condition.

It sounds like very dichotomous thinking that you’d

42,I was psyical with my now ex,"I'm going to write this because I feel this is a safe place I won't be judged. Because you can rest assured, if anyone's judged me the most, it's me right now. 


Tonight I was psyical with my below ex partner. I found out he had cheated on me with his ex. I punched his back and sides whilist pushing him out if the car (the car was parked btw, I'm not that evil). All I remember is I just went crazy and exploded with anger. I had 0 intent of doing that. I didn't even know I was. I know that sounds like a excuse but honestly it came out of nowhere and was definitely not controlled. It's like I wasn't even there anymore. It's like I wasn't even real or happening. 


Previous to this he was being suspicious and was being quite hateful and angry towards me. Gaslighting and manipulative. This in turn made my bpd worse. I became angry and manipulative back. My nervous system became overloaded and I could not eat, shower, or function for days. I'd just shake with the intense panic and emotional terminal I was feeling over this time. Before I saw him, I meditated and did breathing exercises because I could not stop shaking knowing it could be the end of the relationship. And then all of a sudden after hearing he cheated I don't know what happened, I completely lost control. I mean that to my core. 


I came home and I am a mess. I'm seeing fading colors, I'm swinging from extreme emotions, I am suicidal, you name it. I have such a intense long past of being cheated on since I was 16 all the way to my 30s now. I'm still being cheated on to this day. To find out he was cheating must have been enough for me to just explode. 

I have been in dbt and CBT for a long time but I tend to relapse once I'm in a relationship. Going forward I think I will have to take anther mood stabilizer or something to help. But I feel I am not deserving of anyone anymore. I feel I'd be better off gone.

44,"REALIZED I HAVE BPD....SUPPLEMENTS? 5HTP, GABA?","ill try to make this brief,even though we all know  BPD Struggle is far from...

i think i have been dealing with BPD all my life but i never quite knew it..

in hindsight i can see where BPD played a role in a lot of situations throughout my life..

2 years ago on my birthday i had a huge panic attack i thought i was going to die, i was smoking weed,drinking and i took some pills..i still dont know wtf they were...then my heart started beating..my vision started getting blurry..i was seeing white...it was like i was dieing...i was taken to the ER...i left the ER and was experiencing depersonalization and derealization for the first time ever...my gf left the next day and i was left by myself with this horrible fuckin feeling...

i stayed in that house for months...i couldnt even leave the house..i would go buy food at 2 or 3 in the morning..i was smoking weed even though the weed instantly gave me panic attacks..i was just hoping that it would fix me somehow...i stayed in this horrible state for months..non stop panic attacks..no sleep...barely eating...shut off from the world..having to fake like i was okay when i spoke with my mother...i cant worry her..i couldn't tell her that i wanted to kill myself and that looking in the mirror i did not recognize myself..

 time goes by...cant work...cant function..im just in hell all day 24/7

its been a while and i dont really feel depersonalized anymore but my emotions are out of control...like on a severe level...

for the longest i was so focused on the DP/DR that i never took the time to look at the cause of the anxiety..i was so focused on treating anxiety and dp/dr but this last month my girlfriend broke up with me because i had an instance of ""splitting"" i guess they call it and for the very first time i actually noticed that my way of thinking is waaay screwed up.....i finally see alot of the BPD symptoms...i now know that i don't think like everyone else...im always thinking negative...typical bpd things like the black and white..the favorite person...the splitting..and the shame...guilt...all these things i had been feeling my whole life...but before it was manageable...i was able to function...i didnt ever think about suicide..but after that huge panic attack and dp/dr/depression/ it seems my BPD is just fuckin exploded full force and all those symptoms are flaring all day....im sensitive as hell..on edge

i cant function...the only thing keeping me calm is a benzo..klonapin...that takes the anxiety away but without it...i feel like ill fall back into the pitts of dp/dr...i have been taking it for a while..maybe 2 years?

My  ex gf broke up with me after i had an instance where i ""split"" because she didnt answer my phone call it was scary.......fear of abandonement kicked in and everything else aswell..but thanks to her breaking up with me...i came to the realization that im not just dealing with extreme anxiety...but that i have deeper problems like bpd...

my thoughts are suicidal and negative all the time but now i am aware of the thoughts and i am aware that i am thinking incorrectly..i know can see and observe...where as before i didnt...i just felt the emotions and  rolled with them unknowingly...

ive done my due diligence on several other disorders...bipolar..bipolar 2..schizophrenia..etc but BPD describes me down to a T..it finally makes sense..any thoughts?opinions??questions??

theres more to the story such as im not in the U.S which is where i was raised till the age of 19, i was deported for buying alcohol with a fake id.

i was sent  to a 3rd world country..people dont speak the language and i cant relate,ive been here for 8 years and all that stress was probably building till the mind just couldn't handle it anymore? causing me to dissociate..?

but why the severe BPD?

i am always on the brink of tears..i am agitated and sad...suicidal thoughts are most of my day..i remember my ex gf and i feel guilty because i put her through alot of bad moments in life...from her witnessing me having to go to the ER to a lot of emotional abuse,she is a sweetheart.. truly beautiful..she not once disrespected me ever..so when i think of those times...my anxiety instantly revs up..and i start thinking suicidal thoughts due to the guilt and negative self talk..racing thoughts etc... its like its happening all over again...i feel pathetic because i fucked up bad and put her through hell..

i know i shouldnt feel that way beacause i really dont think im too much at fault,the bpd was fucking my life up for the longest and i had no clue..now i challenge my thoughts,meditate,supplement,trying to do CBT...wish there was DBT here but there is not...im really down and out..i feel alone...im isolated...i think im what is considered a quiet borderline...why? because no one here speaks english..i have no family here in this country.. gf left me..no medical help...i cant even express my thoughts concerns or anything...if only someone here spoke some english..that would be helpful i feel...situation sucks...i've begun to kind of tip my family off to the fact that suicide is something i consider alot...its horrible i don't want to make them sad but this sucks...i cant go on this way...they are in the U.S. and i cant see them..they cant come here and i cant go back to the U.S. im kind of trying to ease the idea of me not being here but at the same time i feel horrible doing so..

I HAVE 2 SISTERS,AND MY MOTHER..I AM THE ONLY MALE..FATHER IS OUT THE PICTURE..

Help anyone?  
sometimes a kind word works wonders for me

SUPPLEMENTS TAKEN..OMEGA 3,POTASSIUM,VITAMIN B COMPLEX,VITAMIN D,MAGNESIUM,VITAMIN A,CENTRUM DAILY VITAMIN FOR MEN,MELATONIN EVERY OTHER MONTH...

THINKING OF TRYING 5HTP AND GABA....THEY JUST CAME IN THE MAIL.

i can elaborate more but im going to try and sleep now...just thought id post something quickly about supplements but it turned into this...  


i find comfort in youtube channels such as BIGNOKNOW,DR DANIEL FOX,NOAH ELKRIEF AND DIVING DEEP INFINITE WATERS,RALPH SMART..

I have been reading up and the “typical” symptoms I do not relate to. 

An example is he splitting. I never admire someone and then hate them.  However I do have a very black and white view of most things. 

Especially peoples actions. It’s either this or that it can’t be more and it can’t be both kind of mentality. An example would be when my ex slept with someone new I wouldn’t accept any other reason except that he preferred her over me OR he did it because he is a slut. I just couldn’t comprehend any other explanation. After I calmed down and was able to self reflect I realised that I was splitting and now see things different.

46,What's your opinion on my realization? ,"I'm posting this to a few bpd communities to try to reach more people with different perspectives. If you're active in other communities and have seen this post recently I apologize!

I'm a good person. I know that. I love people with my whole heart. But my behaviors (or at least motivation behind behaviors) have not always shown that, even if they were disguised as ""good"". Something that has helped me A LOT lately is thinking ""am I doing this act to help someone, or to make myself look good."" The statement varies slightly according to the situation of course, but honestly it has helped stop many attention seeking behaviors. This has helped me modify and adjust how I react to situations. 

For example, I daydream every night before bed about me or characters from a show being either a victim or a hero. One or the other (thanks black and white thinking). Basically I write fanfiction in my head. It usually contains dark subjects like SA, abuse, death, etc. When I first started giving myself time to daydream before bed I noticed a decrease in attention seeking behaviors in real life, however as the years went on I started to convince myself that those things I was purposely dreaming of were ok to do irl if given the possibility. Anyway what caused this revelation is that my favorite resident at a SNF I work for is in the hospital with an unclear fate. In my daydream time about a week ago I imagined different scenarios and played through them. Doing this led to me really thinking about why I do things. One of the scenarios I had to run through of course was ""what happens if the resident passes."" So I imagined myself at her funeral and her family member asked if anyone else wanted to speak. So I did. But as I was dreaming about what I would say ""...when you see someone everyday for two and a half years you get to love them. She watched me grow up and gave me some of the best advice one could ask for..."" I realized I was thinking about the family feeling sorry for me. I saw her daughter looking at me thinking ""oh that poor person loved my mom so much, they must be hurting a lot."" This made me snap open my eyes and look at the ceiling. I realized i was imagining my favorite resident's funeral (i usually try to picture future scenarios in my daydreaming time to prepare because it soothes anxiety, i don't plan to stop fully but at least be more conscious of my actions to those scenarios in my dreams) and picturing her FAMILY, feeling sorry for ME. 

Ever since I had that dream about a week ago it has completely changed my perspective of how I go about things and I hope I keep this in mind. Humans are inherently selfish. Every action we do have some form of self satisfaction to it. Even something as simple as tying your shoe laces so you don’t fall, is motivated by a level of selfishness. That is normal. However, I want to make sure I do things for the right reasons even if the outcome of the deed wouldn't change. If I volunteer l to help someone with a task is it because there are other people in the room watching me and I want to look good? Is it because I want this person to like me and think I'm a good person? Or, is it because humans deserve help and kindness and if I have the (mental, physical, financial) capacity to do so I WANT to help someone just to make their lives easier. 

Like I stated earlier, it is very human to have to think of yourself in others shoes to be empathetic in most situations, I mean that's what the golden rule is (for example, I don't want to see people in pain because I know what pain feels like, therefore I do my best to prevent and reduce pain in others)! But in my experience people with bpd tend to have a little extra motivation: how we are perceived to others as ""good"" to prevent abandonment, or for validation/attention seeking that we feel we deserve and honestly sometimes NEED. As basic as it sounds I'm trying to be more aware of my motivation behind my actions. Who new it would take 7 years of CBT and 1 year of DBT to get to this point. I feel kind of silly honestly.

 I am a self aware person, however that often made my attention seeking behaviors worse. This made my behaviors worse because I would rationalize them as ""well I'm communicating to people what my needs are, therefore if they don't react appropriately they are at fault. If I'm genuinely suicidal and I let my friends know then they should shower me with love and concern. Even if I've been genuinely suicidal over many 'little' things that they now think it's a boy who cried wolf situation. I've identified my feelings (which really are real, just because they seem dramatic doesn't mean im not feeling them, so me it's so intense and real, to them it's purely for attention) and communicated so I must be doing things right."" Now I realize that crying to my coworkers while they are trying to work is not acceptable because they are acquaintances and we are at work. Another thing that has caused me to have trouble identifying what is or isn't okay is understanding that just because I would drop everything to comfort a random coworker/acquaintance at work does not mean everyone else is comfortable, has the emotional capacity, feels safe, or feels motivated, to do the same. In my mind everyone takes the golden rule (treat others the way you want to be treated) so literally. It's why I'm seen as clingy and can't often tell the difference between romantic, platonic, acquaintance relationships. Because I dont care if we met a week ago if I like you and you seem to like my you're my friend in my mind and I got your back. 

So yeah I just wanted to share/rant lol. Do you guys, gals, and nonbinary pals have any recommendations for how to deal with needing to be listened to or almost ""coddled"" sometimes? For me it was the daydreaming that I use for my anxiety but I'm not sure if that's the healthiest for me anymore. It definitely helped for a long time, but I think some change would do me some good.

47,"I know my brain is trying to protect me, but I don’t want these feelings anymore","It’s been a long journey. Lots of pit stops and roundabouts and detours and wrecks and repairs and general surreal debauchery along the way. I thought I was starting to get better at it. Until They (ex partner/ex fp) left and never came back. Never offered a gesture at closure. Not even a lazy shrug or flick of a finger…just nothing, forevermore.

I did DBT, CBT, and prolonged exposure for years. Worked my ass off. Poured endless sweat and tears into treatment and recovery until my heart was caked with the saltwater. But my heart also became large and strong during that time. I could feel the weight starting to lift, the demons start to retreat from my head. Then my lover, my best friend of almost 10 years, left me. I still do not understand why. Perhaps that was the problem. Why it happened I do not know, but I do know I shattered. Completely and utterly broke.

In September, it will have been 4 years since I spoke to that person. Not a word between us. Just empty white space where profound love used to be. Those years were spent desperately, clumsily, agonizingly trying to piece my jagged remains back together. To reform myself as a stronger individual and to once again be able to see a person staring back at me when I look in the mirror. A person who, while flawed, is growing and reasonably content and moving forward. 

[I think that might be the hardest part. Looking in the mirror and seeing yourself, but not seeing a person. I haven’t been able to make one out in my reflection for 4 years. Just hollow black circles meet my gaze. Nothingness.]

Try as I might, I cannot seem to even begin to put myself back together. No matter how much treatment I get or support I seek or love I give or receive, my shattered pieces only seem to degrade further. Turning slowly but surely to naught but dust. I have had 2 long term relationships since They left, and both were spectacular disasters. Beautiful, incredible, loving, passionate, toxic, dramatic, exhilarating disasters. As I write this, I am feeling the deep sting of losing another partner/fp, the second of those two disasters. There is nothing I can do to rid myself of this pain—there is only acceptance, which has started to feel incredibly numb and pointless. 

tl;dr—my BPD (along w comorbid trauma/anxiety/substance abuse/mood regulation disorders) symptoms have grown so monstrous. So inhuman, so horribly broken as they well up out of me. That I cannot seem to even start to heal from one lost relationship, let alone begin to think about starting a new, healthy relationship. Or even more importantly, that I cannot seem to find any minuscule way to start the process of healing and finding myself at my core. My emotions are completely out of control, and they consume and burn relationships and people like fire when they rise through me. I know that I feel things because my brain is trying in its misguided way to protect me. I just…do not want it anymore. They are Pain, at its essence. I want to live very much, but I do not want That anymore.",1628143245.0,False,9,5,SaveYourSelf_FromSin,None,oybeu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/oybeu8/i_know_my_brain_is_trying_to_protect_me_but_i/
0,Holy wow DBT is amazing,"Wow dudes. It seriously is.

I’ve been in CBT with some DBT features for like a year and a half and I made huge strides! But now I moved, and am starting DBT group and a one on one CBT therapist in my new city in two weeks.

I haven’t started the new therapies yet - but my friend who is a psychologist sent me a packet of DBT worksheets for my time off therapy and holy WOW - they are effective.

Personally, they take a long ass time for me to fill out, and I only feel like they work for me because a.) I already have experience with doing logs like this and with cognitive distortions and schemas through my time in CBT, and b.) I already have worked on emotional awareness a lot for several years with several therapists.

But like - this morning my partner said something innocuous of course which scared the shit out of me and immediately felt anxious and scared and angry and confused and I wanted to ask him all these questions and interrogate him and do all my impulsive behaviors…

But then I filled out “check the facts” and wow. It just wild. It took probably an hour for me to really work through it, but I can see SO clearly exactly the route my mind took, and why, and I feel empathetic with myself, and I feel like I understand my partner, and I feel safe and happy and understood and I took no actions that I regret and just…wow.

3,How do you get know if you’re projecting or not? I asked chatGPT. The response made me realize that I might. What now?,"Here’s the response I got: 

Projecting involves attributing one's own thoughts, feelings, or traits onto another person. Here are some signs that may indicate you're projecting:

1. **Overly Critical of Others**: If you find yourself frequently criticizing or judging others for traits or behaviors that you dislike in yourself, it could be a sign of projection.

2. **Strong Emotional Reaction**: Feeling intense emotions, such as anger or resentment, towards someone else for reasons that seem disproportionate to their actions may indicate projection.

3. **Denial or Rationalization**: Ignoring or denying your own feelings or behaviors while focusing on those of others, or rationalizing your actions by attributing them to someone else's behavior, can be signs of projection.

4. **Repeated Patterns**: If you notice recurring patterns in your relationships or interactions where you consistently attribute certain traits or motives to others, it may be worth examining whether you're projecting.

5. **Lack of Self-Awareness**: Difficulty recognizing or acknowledging your own emotions, desires, or flaws, while readily identifying them in others, can indicate projection.

To address projection, it can be helpful to practice self-reflection, increase self-awareness, and explore the underlying reasons for projecting onto others. Therapy or counseling can also be beneficial in gaining insight into these patterns and learning healthier ways of relating to oneself and others.",1713518997.0,False,4,3,NightStar_69,None,1c7sm45,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1c7sm45/how_do_you_get_know_if_youre_projecting_or_not_i/

5,What is wise mind in DBT?,"Have you ever snapped at someone and surprised yourself with how harsh you sounded?

You may have thought, *whoa… where did that come from?!*

You were probably acting from what’s called “Emotion Mind” in DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy). DBT is a therapy methodology developed by Marsha Linehan which helps people feel more in control of their thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

When in emotion mind, people react based on their mood, without taking logic into account.

**You May Be in Emotion Mind If:**

* You’re reacting quickly, without thinking things through
* You’re acting on urges without taking into account your long-term goals
* You’re behaving impulsively and aren’t considering potential consequences of your actions
* You want to hurt who hurt you, even if you’re not typically a vengeful person
* You’re not considering anyone else’s feelings or additional context of the situation

On the other end of the spectrum is Reasonable Mind, which is rational, logical and steady.

You might be thinking, *okay, reasonable and rational, that sounds good! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time must be the goal, right?*

Actually, no! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time isn’t ideal, either. 

**You May Be in Reasonable Mind If:**

* You feel cut off from, or “numb” to your emotions
* You minimize or shrug off your feelings
* You rationalize your own or others’ behavior, even behavior that is unacceptable
* You are avoiding or in denial about something that is happening
* You are completely focused on a task

When we’re in Reasonable Mind, we’re cut off from our emotions. It’s important to be aware of and feel our emotions. First, because it’s an essential part of the human experience. More importantly, emotions contain very important information we need to understand our needs and boundaries.

Here’s an example of why awareness of emotions is important. Let’s say you feel angry and irritable every time you see your friend. Reasonable mind might say you’re being irrational and dismiss the feelings. But chances are there’s a good reason why you’re feeling angry at them, especially since it keeps happening.

Maybe they’re putting you down a lot, or not listening to what you’re saying. Or maybe you feel jealous of them. Finding the answer to why you’re angry is important to figuring out how to resolve your anger, whether you do so on your own or with the other person.

There are a number of potential reasons why people have difficulty being in Wise Mind. Maybe they haven’t had many people in their life model what it looks like to be in Wise Mind. Maybe staying in Reasonable Mind has protected them from extreme traumatic reactions. Maybe acting from Emotion Mind has gotten their needs met, for better or worse.

When you’re able to acknowledge your feelings without acting impulsively on them, you’re in Wise Mind.

**You May Be in Wise Mind If:**

* You’re taking both your emotions and logic into account
* You can name and feel your emotions
* You’re considering different ways to proceed before acting
* You can see the situation from multiple perspectives
* It feels like *you* are in control, not your mood

If you’re rarely in Wise Mind, don’t worry! You can increase your Wise Mind skills with practice.

**Ways to Cultivate Wise Mind Skills**

* Pause throughout the day and ask yourself which state of mind you are in.
* If you are in Emotion Mind, label which emotions you’re feeling.
* Using coping skills before acting on your feelings (for instance, journal, go on a walk, or take a hot shower).
* If you want to engage in a behavior that’s impulsive or mood-based (for example, emotional eating, texting your ex, substance abuse, etc.)
   * Delay the behavior by 1 hour
   * Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or peer before engaging in the behavior
   * Consider the negative consequences of the behavior
   * Replace the behavior with something less harmful (for example, drawing on your arms with a Sharpie instead of self-harming)
* Participate in a DBT program in your area. It can help you develop not only Wise Mind skills, but also, a wide variety of other skills related to Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Relationships.
* Practice yoga, Tai-Chi, or other physical activities that help you get in touch with your body. These can also help you develop more awareness of yourself and your emotions.
* Talk to a therapist! A therapist can help you stay accountable as you work towards strengthening your Wise Mind.

7,Should I be concerned?,"
I'd like to preface this post by stating that I have toxic behaviors in the relationship, such as invading space, being overly critical, heavy splitting, not listening to his side well, as well as my own yelling and general outbursts. I am in therapy partly to work on these behaviors.  
  
My bf does have some behaviors of his own that bother me, however I'm not sure if some of these are normal and I'm just splitting when I freak out about them. I've communicated about most of these and I've noticed some of it get better, however he's also told me he feels like I take everything as a personal attack and like I don't trust him. Sometimes when conflict has been very heated and I point out something that bothered me, he corrects it but explains he feels like he needs to keep a 'checklist"" of bad words/things to say. The behaviors that have been bothering me are:  
  
\-Swearing during conflict, but I've even corrected him when it isn't directed at me  
  
\-Yelling, he's also explained much of the time he does not mean to yell directly at me, but I have noticed it improve over time.  
  
\-Sometimes when we disagree he says what I said was ""stupid"", I've tried asking him to change it to say that what I'm saying doesn't make sense or something more neutral. I have noticed this get better as well, but he does get frustrated about it at times and doesn't always know how else to describe something  
  
\-Saying what I said was ""useless"", but this is often when I've repeated the same questions over and over or don't add anything to the conversation. He has gotten better about it but also does get frustrated about needing to stop.  
  
\-Saying that I'm being stupid/am stupid, however this has only been when I've highly bothered him and wouldn't give him space during the argument. He's only said this when I've split very hard and have had a giant episode where I won't let him calm down, so he likely does this because he doesn't feel like he has a choice. He does want to work on it, but I understand I provoke it and don't give him much of a chance to act differently.  
  
\-A few times he's hit things, such as the couch or his desk, but this is also often when I won't give him space when he's asked. He has thrown his phone once or twice when I was splitting very hard on him as well, but I've also done this to my phone much more. He's never thrown anything in my direction or near me, and I don't feel like he's trying to intimidate me.  
  
He does know these behaviors bother me, and when things are calm and we try to problem solve again after escalation he usually apologizes and wants to be better. However, sometimes he will say that I took some of it personally, such as swearing. Another thing that concerns me is that during arguments when I ask him not to call me stupid, he'll say ""I didn't call you stupid, I said you were being stupid."", I've read from some people that these things are forms of gaslighting, but I also know I provoke some of it after crossing his boundaries, and that BPD can often make us overreact so I am looking for input.  
  
Many of these things didn't start until I split on him more, however the yelling, swearing, and some moments of him saying I'm taking stuff personally did, as well as saying what I say in arguments at times is ""useless"".  
  
I've been bringing up couples therapy, now that our lives are less busy he said he'll try going. Going is very out of his comfort zone, as he's had trauma around therapists and doesn't think couples therapy is effective, but he said he'll try once a month then see if he's okay going more often. He's also told me if he can't figure out his behaviors on his own he'll try to see a therapist himself. For the couples therapist, he has said he doesn't want to do much of the work of looking for one, but it was my idea so I'm not sure if this is fair.  
  
We were trying to call each other out on these behaviors during conflict and then taking a break before re-engaging, but I've often failed at following through as I've explained. I am in no way trying to excuse my toxic actions. I'm just asking if his behavior seems like a valid reaction to my splitting and how I act, or if I should be concerned and he seems toxic as well.",1683955962.0,False,2,3,thelittlestone568,None,13g8f5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/13g8f5z/should_i_be_concerned/
8,Controlling rage without meds?,"Hello! I am in a bit of a tough situation in here, right now my life can be summed up in “Anything that can go wrong, goes wrong”. My fp broke up with me, I had to move back to my kinda toxic family, I don’t make enough money to be able to move out soon, I can’t go to sleep before six in the morning. The smallest things can cause an outburst, meltdown and my reaction is an insane rage, to the point where I physically have to hurt myself to let it out and I shout and look scary. I tried out different meds in the past, but my body had a bad reaction to even the smallest doses, so my psychiatrist told me to stop. Insurance doesn’t cover therapy, and rn I just simply can’t afford it. I downloaded some dbt workbooks, but I hope you could suggest some other methods to help me control my emotions. Of course, I should fix my sleep schedule, but I genuinely feel so apathetic towards my life (I was really ambitious during the relationship)
Also, yesterday I watched one of Dr. K’s (healthy gamer gg) videos, and he said that the method of how they cure personality disorders is by changing the meta-cognition and meta-emotion (how you think and feel about your reactions), but I’d honestly feel like a clown if I tried to pat my back and say “It’s okay buddy” after a meltdown.

9,Holiday blues,"I’m home for the holidays which coincides with my birthday (28F) and always culminates in absolutely bashing myself for not being who, where, or what I want or should be. A previous therapist mentioned it could be a self fulfilling prophecy; if I expect to feel this way around this time of the year I will. But it’s hard to be positive about a life that continues to be unrewarding, unfulfilling, and unhappy. I thought after 15+ years of borderline behavior and 6+ years of DBT informed therapy, I wouldn’t be in this same spot again, worrying those around me and not knowing what I want or need from them because nothing has worked to make me feel better. I’m so tired, so sad, so lonely. I just want to be loved unconditionally just once.

10,Cutting people off after healing,"Last year my partner and I broke up for many, many reasons, most of which stemmed from my untreated (at the time) BPD and his avoidant behavior and overall hyper independent nature. A classic combo. Our breakup broke me in many ways, but 2023 ended up being the best year of my life because I started going therapy every week, taking medication, learning how to be alone, and forming positive relationships in my life. I still struggle deeply with my BPD, but I've gotten better at identifying my emotions as they arise. This does not mean I have completely changed my behaviors or emotions themselves.

About a month ago, my ex and I reconnected. For some reasons, a relationship isn't feasible for us however the love and friendship is still there. He is still a solitary person and has his own mental health struggles that he hasn't really addressed. He hinted at us being in an ""open relationship,"" since when we are together now, we are loving and affectionate and to him I am the first person he wants to see. But because of our time constraints we both know that we can't fully devote ourselves to each other.

Very quickly into our reconnection, I've noticed that many of my old thought patterns, triggers, and behaviors have arisen. It honestly scares me; I've been really good this year when dating other people to mitigate toxic patterns and I've overall worked really hard to be different. At this point I don't know if it's just him who causes me this pain (because of our history, our love, and his avoidant tendencies) or if I am simply not healed. It is probably both. But he wants us to remain in each other's lives and honestly I do too. But there is a chasm of distance between us and it breaks me. And feeling shitty all the time has taken such a toll on me, because after our falling out last year I vowed to never feel this way again.

I feel sad at the idea of cutting him out completely but I honestly don't know how to feel okay with him in my life or if it is even worth it. I feel so conflicted and I wish I didn't feel anything.

12,A question about bpd and favorite person,"I have a question about favorite persons, more specifically my therapist

So I have not been medically diagnosed with BPD but I have GAD, OCD, autism, and depression and all of which have made things very hard. 

Recently I’ve been struggling with some very complex emotions and mental struggle including obsessive thoughts about my therapist. How every it feels slightly different to ocd. I get these thoughts where I over analyze and find a problem with the things she does (wears, behaviors, etc.) it has caused me to feel like a horrible person. And no matter how much cognitive reframing I do it won’t stop. My brain won’t listen to any logic or rationale. I end up checking her Facebook and pretty much every other thing online of her multiple times a day. I feel as if I NEED to know more about her. Sometimes I just have this feeling like somethings off and I relate it to her. And over all it makes me feel like a creep and a horrible person. Especially since she is basically the sweetest person I know, and has helped me so much, and always been there for me

I though originally this may have been more tied to my OCD, but after doing some research I think I may need to ask my psychiatrist about bpd. I thought I would come to this sub and maybe seek some help. Does this sound like what a favorite person is like. And can I please have some support and advice.",1693022295.0,False,2,2,JishFellOver,None,161kif7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/161kif7/a_question_about_bpd_and_favorite_person/

14,BPDlovedones…helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I’m talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It’s all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that’s for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don’t really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I’m sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally. I feel like I’m trapped in the mind of a five year old as well trapped in the mind of 1000 year old person. I feel like I’ve lived 1000 lives and sometimes I’m not sure what’s real, what’s a delusion, and what is fact. This is why I love neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. It gives me explanations for why I am experiencing an emotion, why I am reacting to it, and to just remind myself that it’s not that big of a deal. I don’t want to make excuses for people who cannot take accountability of their actions however. I used to do that and thinking about it makes me ashamed. My mother has BPD and is closing in on 50. I have only repaired my relationship with her this year out of pity after cutting her off just as other people did. I understand how she does not see how her actions affect people, and that’s why the mental illness makes relationships difficult. She seems to think that she raised me perfectly fine even though sometimes I didn’t have food and we were homeless at one point and she constantly screamed in my face and hit me. She never hugged me. She never told me she loved me. I never felt like she was my mother. I don’t have a father. I don’t have siblings. I don’t have aunts and uncles. I grew up extremely lonely and the thing I struggle with the most as an adult is abandonment. I think I fear the way I felt as a child. I have had the thought “it will never get better” for as long as I can remember. And now I look around at the life I have created. With the person who I think is the love of my life, my wonderful friends and support systems, my education in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience, my ability to travel to different countries, and ability to have my own things. And yet there’s still a sense of chaos in my life and nothing can ever be stable. Am I doomed to live this way forever? All I want to do is fix this. And I don’t even know what “this” is. I fully support psychoactive compound therapy. From my readings of academic literature, and personal experiences, I think building neuroplasticity through psychoactive treatment is a key component to mental health rehabilitation. You obviously can’t just give people psychedelics and say go crazy—it needs to be monitored, and patients need directed therapy while they are experiencing altered states of consciousness. Becoming extremely emotional, and vulnerable has caused me so much grief, but has allowed me to discover so much about life and help me build extremely close personal relationships with people so I can learn more and give back to the field of neuropsychopharmacology.",1692082128.0,False,14,10,pthevslayer,None,15rku5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15rku5z/bpdlovedoneshelpful_or_harmful_idk_who_cares/

16,hitting rock-bottom,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""
-Panic! At the Disco.

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439573.0,False,1,7,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1ad08qo/hitting_rockbottom/
17,I caused the worst fight of our relationship and I don’t know why or what to do now.,"I had a horrible meltdown/BPD episode last night and I treated my also-BPD partner of 3+ years who I live with so horribly for no good reason right as we were trying to go to bed. I pushed him so far past his breaking point that he broke down horribly too and I ruined what had earlier been a really great night out with friends. 

I hate feeling so out of control of myself and especially hate being unable to explain away my poor behavior in any meaningful way. I’m so embarrassed and ashamed of my behavior and I feel like my world is ending. I don’t even have a good excuse for why I pushed it so far. It doesn’t even feel like me doing my actions, but it obviously was. 

I know that I’ve been very overwhelmed lately with financial concerns and I’ve felt the meltdown building in the background. I tried to preempt it by taking the meds that typically manage it but that wasn’t enough. I’ve also tried asking for space/time alone at home to recenter since that usually helps too, but that wasn’t able to happen. I am also on my period which makes my sensitivity and reactivity to much worse. I know these all sound like excuses, but I’m just trying to not feel like an innately horrible person. I understand what causes my overreactions and I don’t want to think it’s all my fault, but I also don’t want to shift blame. I can’t escape the fact that the consequences apply to me alone when I’m the one having the overreaction. I know my actions are my choices and I have to own up to the hurt I cause regardless of the reason behind it.

I’ve apologized profusely since I realized in the middle of last night how fucked up I was being, but obviously that doesn’t change or fix the hurt I caused immediately, which sucks. We’re not at odds necessarily now and he’s accepted my apologies and told me I don’t need to keep apologizing, but it’s still tense and I know I’ve hurt him deeply. We are trying to make things work and get through this fight, but I feel like I’ve just ruined everything and like it’ll never get better. I know that’s just a feeling and that I’ll be okay in the long run, but it’s a really hard day today.

18,My friend with bpd seems to hate me,"My friend was recently diagnosed with bpd, she’s also recently divorced. We got super close after her divorce even had something sexual for a time after. She would call and text me all the time, call me venting about life and I’d just listen. This went on for almost a year, we became extremely close spent most weekends together and she would always either ask to hangout, or be down to do something. Recently over the last month things have changed. In June she found out that her ex husband had moved on and found a new girlfriend. She called me crying and wanting to hurt herself. I talked her out of it and went over cuddled her until she fell asleep and then I left. Since then she has started changing, she seems annoyed to be around me, if I ask what’s wrong she flips out, she’s kicked me out of her house twice for trying to hold her while she’s upset. She admitted to me about a month ago that she and her ex husband and her never stopped sleeping together, that they had only been living apart. I asked why she kept it a secret she said she didn’t want to lose me. She then admitted that two weeks after seeing the exs new girlfriend she started talking to a guy she met on a site. They in just a month they are talking all day, have been on 8 dates, FaceTime at least three times a week, and they are going on weekend away trips. She’s rescheduling her kids and other friends to make sure she can squeeze him in, all while complaining she has not time for anything. I told her therapy is something to look into. She got herself set up and started going. I went with her to her first session and after the therapist asked if I was aware that she showed traits of bpd. I asked what it was and the therapist explained. They set her up for an evaluation and the doctor said it bpd was indeed the case. The therapist set up therapy for us together because she doesn’t have much family. The first session was brutal she never liked me, she couldn’t stand me, I wasn’t her type, she finds me disgusting, I’m annoying, I’m a bother, I’m a crybaby, I’m not her thing, I force her to sleep with me(not true at all), I cause nothing but drama. She goes back in the timeline and say she felt a particular way at whatever point but I can tell you the things she says didn’t happen and I actually at that time got something completely different. She does this with her ex husband as well she says she felt certain ways but he says that there was no way, that they actually were really good at the points she says they weren’t. The therapist says she editing the timeline with intrusive thought to try and justify behaviors. She We had , had  sex two weeks prior to the session and she actually asked me for it  and about two weeks before that same thing. When I asked about the guy she’s going away with she gets angry, she gets dismissive and says I’m bothering her. She’s been talked out of quitting therapy twice because if the therapist brings up the guy she gets big mad. When we see eachother I get the complete opposite treatment as long as I don’t bring up the guy. Shes also when given examples of fp or devaluing says she doesn’t see it that everyone is just making it up to make her sound crazy, she’s living life as a normal person would. When you point out that she’s doing thing out of the norm you are the issue. I miss my friend take away the sex and this is my friend someone I care about a lot.

19,"Disturbance of the sense of self is core to BPD: So developing the ""Healthy Adult"" is the solution, given that framing.","One of the primary goals of healing work is to develop the Health Adult.

&#x200B;

Specifically, developing the Healthy Adult is an important piece of developing earned secure attachment.

&#x200B;

The Healthy Adult is confident, balanced, in touch with their emotions, and able to relate well with others. Everyone has a Healthy Adult to varying degree of development.

The Healthy Adult can be understood as having two major groupings of positive traits:

1. Strength based traits

&#x200B;

The strength based traits are comprised of (drawing from Jeffrey Young’s ‘Healthy Adult Mode’, Dan Brown’s ‘Best Self’, and The Third School of Cognitive Therapy’s metacognitive skills):

&#x200B;

Healthy self-definition (knowing who you are and what you are about)

Assertiveness

A well developed sense of agency (internal locus of control)

Well developed ability to explore

Healthy self esteem

Metacognitive skills

Stress tolerance and emotional self-regulation skills

&#x200B;

2. Attachment and Connection based traits

&#x200B;

The attachment based traits of the healthy adult are (drawing form Brown & Elliott 2016 and Allan Schore):

&#x200B;

Desire to protect others and expectation that loved ones protect self

Ability to attune to others and the expectation of attunement from others

Ability to physically comfort and soothe and expectation to receive the same

Support of explorations of loved ones and expectation of support from them and

getting and giving guidance

Physical and mental entrainment/synchronization with loved ones which creates a sense of belonging

Ability to trust

Generosity

&#x200B;

So how can you strengthen the Healthy Adult Mode?

&#x200B;

To be fair, there are likely many ways.

&#x200B;

However, the means that I know of to do this work is through guided visualization meditations in which you embody these qualities.

22,Am I crazy or did I use my skills/boundaries properly?,"(Originally posted in r/BPD but since I'm in recovery for awhile with my BPD I thought posting here would be better)

Update as of 10/13:

//My husband and I ended up looking through other messages between social medias we used together to come to terms with their behavior and again, find more patterns because I'm still trying to fight against their gaslighting. What we found was years worth of posts switching between talking absolute ill of our friend group and idolizing me, dragging and making very long hateful posts anytime one of us ended up in a relationship, the amount of hate and jealousy filled posts related to me was so nauseating that I've been sick for the past 15 hours. There's a lot more but I don't think it's quite on topic for this thread.

I feel much more confident and happy with myself that I was able to control my emotions regarding this situation and know I really did make the right decision. Thank you everyone for the support as well 🧡//

Long story short I had to end a friendship recently due to my boundaries not being respected and asking for mutual respect/support in specific areas of my life.

 I've brought them up for over a year until it got to a point where I needed to take time away to think about my future relationship with this person as their actions were not only harming me mentally but settling into my relationship with my husband and kids (my husband is aware of my diagnosis and is very patient with me. However, I did split more regularly during the times after interacting with this person which initially made us realize maybe I needed to reevaluate the friendship.) I've been going to therapy for my BPD for 6 years, know my subtypes, know my triggers, know when I need to step away and use wise mind. I have multiple workbooks that he and I do together in between the times I don't have therapy to keep up with my recovery as I very much want to work on myself and have for years.

Here is where I feel like I'm crazy: after bringing up that we needed time away from each other and go our separate lives and stating why, I am hearing from others that they're telling people that I abused them. That I sent hateful messages and that I was clearly devaluing them because they've been researching BPD for a little. I was very confused. Had my MIL, FIL and other family look at the messages. They said what I said wasn't hateful. I even showed my therapist and she said no and that I shouldn't be made to feel guilty for putting my kids first regardless of my diagnosis or not.

Am I crazy? Did my black and white thinking kick in? Or did I truly do the right thing and trusted myself? So many people use my diagnosis against me and many times I have to spend DAYS making decisions so I can make sure I'm not reacting out of pure emotion. However, this is my family and they ARE more important to me than anything else. I know after this I don't want them around me or my family ever again anyways, especially for what lies they're spreading. 

Being a mom with BPD is hard but I will always put them first. Their safety and security is most important to me. So why do I still feel bad for ending this friendship?

To update as of today as well with talking with my therapist; she mentioned that my friend is probably a covert narcissist and that it is common for them to shift blame, lie, and fake memory issues to avoid accountability. And since I have BPD that my friend probably dipped and played into that against me, especially since i was never originally diagnosed with it during the start of our friendship.",1697085744.0,False,5,3,WanderingFoxWitch,None,175yhrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/175yhrw/am_i_crazy_or_did_i_use_my_skillsboundaries/
23,"How do I (22F, someone with BPD) stop instinctively verbally abusing my partner with autism? This is plea and rant for help and betterment","I’d like to give some background about my partner and then talk about me. He has high functioning autism (ASD; Asperger’s). He has also been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. While he does not have the diagnosis of Avoidant Personality Disorder, his behaviors often fall in line heavily with symptoms of AvPD.

I began dating him 5+ months ago. In the beginning, of course everything was fantastic (as it usually always is in the beginning). We texted each other and ended up hanging out daily per *his* request. He would spend the night often at my place. Initially, I was a bit off with the attachment because I thought we were both in school and had a lot of work to do. Often, when he came over, I still had homework I needed to finish. He seemed to have a lot of free time. It came out eventually that he was dishonest to me about school. He is not enrolled in our university and got dismissed due to being on academic probation for 3 terms (an entire year). He has not elaborated on why his grades were poor but he only said that he feels shame, which is why he didn’t tell me. I understand that and I understand that his disorders may also amplify the negative feelings he holds on himself.

He is incredibly intelligent (as many people with Asperger’s are). His lack of elaboration, of course, made me try and rationalize why he got kicked out. While I don’t know for sure, my gut tells me he probably didn’t do assignments and labs adequately due to focusing on other things. He is very isolating and often alone, in his room, so I was perplexed by what he could be occupied with. As I got to know him more, I know that his life is dominated with video games, watching media online (like movies, namely animated movies and musicals, and a lot of YouTube videos).

A bit of a tangent but it gets back on topic: Our sex life is dysfunctional. In the beginning for the first 3 or so months, we would be intimate often but he was unable to ejaculate except for one time during penetrative sex. I didn’t put any weight on it because sexual autonomy is important for both parties in a relationship and impotence can be caused for a variety of reasons. Initially, he told me that even when he masturbates, he sometimes can’t ejaculate, so I thought it was a physical and psych issue and thought nothing of it.

Eventually, it came out that he watches porn nearly everyday (namely animated porn, hentai, and just very specific genres for “real-people” porn (as he calls it)). This came about when we were unable to be intimate due to his penis being rubbed raw from his masturbation. His penis would usually be raw when we were intimate so intimacy was uncomfortable, which I didn’t know. We eventually got into a talk and he admitted he has a porn addiction. In fact, he was dishonest about the inability to cum from masturbation because he was shameful. I recommended sex therapy or any kind of therapy for his anxiety and ASD at some point in the future but he said no and that it’s too shameful. I asked him to refrain from maybe a week and he tried but failed and said he was unhappy not being able to watch porn and angry. So his habits continue and we rarely have sex now.

While I don’t know for a fact because he won’t answer most questions I ask, my gut is telling me his failure from school was due to his additions to video games and watching things like movies and porn.

He doesn’t contact me when we aren’t in front of each other’s eyes. He will not respond to my texts despite being in his room all the time. Because he is not enrolled in university, he is taking only a couple general education classes at the local community college and they are all asynchronous.

Eventually, he started making excuses for why he couldn’t hang out as often as we were before, to the point where he would say he would see me tomorrow but send me a text 20 minutes before we would meet that he can’t come over. I never knew why aside from being told he has a lot of schoolwork to do. But I’m not sure about that…I genuinely don’t believe it despite wanting to. My take is that he just wanted the nights to himself to watch videos, porn, and play video games because that’s all he likes to do. I asked him about other hobbies and he doesn’t have any and doesn’t want to try out any of my hobbies, like juggling or resin pouring.

His inconsistency frustrated me because it would destabilize my own plans. So, I proposed seeing each other on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays so he had enough alone time and I also had a bit more stability to my structure. He could have multiple days to engage in his additive tendencies and hopefully that would make the time we spend together a bit more enjoyable.

Which is where I get to avoidance. He can’t communicate long distance (even though we live like a 5 minute bike ride away from each other). The most recent time I tried calling him after he dropped me off (he wasn’t even out of my apt complex yet) was to give him some bread I made, but no answer. No response to text. He responded 22 hours later after I sent a follow up text saying I need to be able to communicate with him sometimes when not in his view. I have brought up long distance communication many times in the past but there has been no change. He just says sorry and that he will try to be better. I want to trust him but experiences with his is making me unable to take his words at face value.

He does the same thing to his parents and friends. His parents got furious with him and made him go home to their house because he would not communicate with them for weeks sometimes, ignoring their calls, emails, and texts. I managed to talk to his parents for him and they let him come back to the area we live in since he still has a lease up here. I talked to him about his avoidance tendencies and how hurtful people close to him feel when he chooses to not acknowledge their existence outside of them being in front his eyes. And it was weird, again, because in the beginning he was more responsive and texty than ME! He was always on his phone and would also tell me he talks to his parents at least once a week.

So this suggests to me that he knows his behavior is wrong, he knows what behavior is right and acceptable, but chooses to not engage in them. Is this a valid interpretation and stance I can hold?

It also really makes me wonder what he’s doing. He’s just in his room, not studying for his original major (electrical engineering) because he got kicked out of the university. He is not in challenging classes and has even told me he waits until last minute (often at night) to submit any assignment he does have. Because his classes are asynchronous, they are often due on one day, like Friday 11:59pm. I don’t understand what he is doing during the day. He doesn’t exercise, he doesn’t leave his room, he is not working, he is not talking to anyone close to him. He’s just on his computer for 12+ hours a day not really being productive…Again, he watches a lot of animated porn (…like Pokemon characters…and Disney characters, video game characters, etc). It makes me feel undesirable. Like why is it that 2D characters are more appealing than a real person he can be intimate with? In what ways am I not satisfying him? I go down on him for upwards of an hour+. When we have had sex, it’s for a LONG TIME! Like my jaw aches from trying to do so many things for him and then he just penetrates me for like another hour. I feel like I am in porn script of his because I genuinely try so hard to make him ejaculate again (aside from that ONE time) and I know it shouldn’t be the focus for any sexual relationship, but when his inability to ejaculate stems not from a physical issue but an addiction to his computer, it gets on my mind a lot and his impotence does become a big part of sexual intimacy.

Lately, when he has been spending the night, he has been unable to sleep. His restlessness would wake me up and I can’t fall asleep after. I asked him if he was stressed and he actually said no. I asked if it was because when he’s alone he probably has certain rituals before bed that he doesn’t engage in with me, and he corroborated that. He did not say what those rituals were but I know he means watching porn and jacking off. (We have sex and go to bed but that’s not enough to get him to fall asleep because he can’t cum, even when he masturbates with me; he needs specific porn to get him off). In the past, he told me he jacks off before bed because it helps him sleep.

When we were spending the night with each other daily, his sleep was not a problem. He would fall asleep before me and wake up after me. There were issues in the beginning with getting used to sleeping next to a new partner, but the consistency of sleeping together every night for months (again, per his request; he initially ignited wanting to see each other everyday, even if it wasn’t for the evening and night but just for a hug since we live so close). I think during this time, his brain “rewired” a bit to sleep upon tiredness and relaxation rather than ejaculating after watching porn.

Now to me. I have BPD (hence posting in this sub). I have been in therapy for over a year. It’s primarily DBT with other therapy types like Schema therapy also taught. I still have a lot of problems with verbal abuse. I do not throw things or do anything physical but I get VERY mean and attacking to him. For example, because of the last incident of him not responding to me after 22 hours despite incessant talk about long distance communication, when he DID get back to me, I went on a text rampage. I told him he continuously fails the people he is close to out of choice and that his willful negligence is the reason his issues of shame, anxiety, and other dysfunctions are perpetuated. I have told him in the past that he is not the fantasy characters he imagines himself to be when consuming media and that he is dysfunctional and needs to be grounded in reality if he desires intimacy. I feel vindictive when I feel hurt by him and those feelings come out through being overtly mean and harsh on his psychological problems. I will tell him that he claims he wants to be better but is not doing even the bare minimum to be adept as basic relational and social skills, like being attentive to emails and messages and to check his notifications at least once every 12 hours or so.

Also, it’s not like I don’t have issues either, and he is not mean to me about them the way I am to him, and in the aftermath I feel incredible guilt and resentment towards myself. I also have an OC related disorder (excoriation, or skin picking). My fear of abandonment is EXTREME and despite having a lot of control for most of the feelings I get, there are points where my gut is just bubbling and I explode verbally.

In those moments, I seem to forget that he has Asperger’s. Withdrawal is a big thing for those with ASD. Hyperfocus is a thing with ASD, which is why he is always focused on animation (movies, porn, games). That is something that developed in his childhood and has been consolidated strongly in his brain. I know I need to have more patience and support for him. I know what the struggle is like finally getting into therapy and saying, “I have problems and I want to change to be better to other people and myself”. But when he refuses to even just turn the volume on his phone on to hear notifications from family, friends, and me, I get really angry! Because those are some behavioral changes that are VERY small and doable. I never rushed him with his sexual dysfunctions. I tried finding solutions, like masturbating together, buying an obscenely large amount of lingerie OF HIS CHOICE to maybe be more desirable to him, but nothing works because he still is not changing the behaviors that make him dysfunctional. To me, it’s a choice. Simple things cannot be done on a prompt basis (hell, even for a few months and when his parents forced him to go to their home). And because he doesn’t talk much, there’s so much I don’t know. I just have to piece things together, similar to his parents.

I WANT to be patient and supportive. My cognition wants that but my emotions/gut is building up resentment and is making that difficult. This is causing a dissonance in my mind and I am just splitting hard on him. Again, I DO have a level of control in most cases but these days, there are just so many issues coming up that I am becoming a hypocrite. I told him he can’t change but yet right now neither can I! And at this point, in some way, it is willful. I know what I am doing is wrong. It is not the most evident when I am writing my messages (as many people would relate to). Sometimes I will write something and not send it, usually after rereading it and realizing, “This is too mean and unacceptable,” but sometimes I get into this fuming state where I don’t proofread my texts to him and so I just send them, unfiltered. Often, I write my messages in a notepad and THEN copy/paste it to send to people since that brings about a level of revision, but I don’t even have that line of thought in the moment of being angry and wanting to be mean. I cannot be like this if I want him to feel secure with me, feel supported and loved by me. I really want this relationship to work out and I hope he does to (he tells me words of affection when together, but again, it’s not that often anymore).

Furthermore, when I HAVE brought stuff up gently, it flies over his head. In our first talk about impotence, I asked him to cum with me sometime and said it with a smile. I also mentioned it would make me feel more desirable. Eventually when I brought that up again a few months later, he said he thought I wasn’t being serious because it didn’t seem serious. In some ways, I feel a bit conditioned to be mean in order to get things through his head. I feel if he feels bad and recognizes that I also feel really bad and undesirable, that would be the only way for him to maybe start picking up some changes. My experience has been he is only considerate of my concerns when I bring them up using harsh language rather than being (what I think of) as gentle. I am likely not approaching constructive criticism in the right way and I would like to learn how to do that. It’s either I am overly nice to the point where my concerns are not perceived as concerns to my partner, or I am mean and my concerns get through to them. I think my frustrations with his avoidance, dysfunctions/additions, and lack of communications are warranted but I know my reactions and behaviors are NOT! What are tools I can learn to use and build to support my partner and control myself in the midst of an abandonment and rejection BPD episode?

How do I deal with the really maladaptive behaviors of someone with Asperger’s? How should I help them deal with my maladaptive behavior? ASD and BPD are almost like opposites in terms of social and relational skills, it feels. Please give any thoughts and feedback and please try to not cushion anything. While my behavior with people outside of romantic relationships has been greatly improved from therapy, I still have a long ways to go with combating the feelings I get in my belly area and controlling my vindictive, emotional abuse nature. Knowledge is my biggest tool and the biggest tool for me to alter my behavior, and I feel I just do not have the knowledge about how someone with ASD might feel with their behaviors and my behavior. How can I also help him? I have written this in a rushed and frantic state and will not be proofreading it as I think it might be helpful to read someone’s stream of consciousness and thoughts without filter. I will be posting this on both BPD and Asperger’s subreddits to get as much information and feedback/advice possible.

24,Family Doesnt Respect *MY* Boundaries,"I know this is somewhat long but im looking for insight so please bare wih me. I'm 24F and I have come a long way in my recovery. As I've moved into adulthood and have gotten more serious about my recovery, I have noticed the further away I am from my family the better. I dont have issues with others to this degree, if im upset we'll talk it out calmly and in a mature fashion or we share our boundaries and what we need in the moment. When it comes to my family, despite them watch my journey with mental health and all kinds of therapy, their own behavior and actions seem to never improve or change. For example, Im on vacation with my family in new york to visit my sister and her husband and my baby niece. I just wanted to enjoy my time away and have fun in their company. I got irritated because we were trying to figure out plans and nobody was answering my calls/texts (were in different rooms) at this point, im not even acting out or screaming or being rude in any sort. even when im in control im aware that there can sometimes be a tone of irritation in my voice. and so do they... despite that I clearly set a boundary as simple as ""stop"" as I've learned to from therapy only for them to continue. instead of disengaging, they scream at me loudly telling me to calm down or continue invalidating me saying in the moment. Again, i was only mildly irritated. there was nothing major happening for me to \*normally outside of them\* get to a placewhere my anger gets so intense i cry. Instead of respecting my boundries after repeatedly saying ""Stop"" and giving me time to regulate myself (after pushing me to a point where i actually raised my own voice to again say STOP"" its as if they'd rather push my buttons until i get to point to where my anger gets so intense i react. And then they blame \*ME\* and feed into eachothers energy of being nasty laugh at me and sayi ""I cant deal with this"" or ""this is why we dont go on family vacations when all i want is respect and when I try to vent to the opposite party they dont want to deal with it either and tell me to stop. At 24, I've so tired of this despite living on my own already, Im finally at a point to where im ready to be financially independent, leave (them behind or go to a new state or go to school away from them) and pursue my own contentment. I'm not perfect, but there is no respect or awareness held when it comes to me in my family. Has anybody else gone through this? I'll take whatever advice I can get. I know I struggle with a disorder but I can't convince myself its just me anymore. I cant handle the invalidation of them thinking and acting like "" shes just crazy so we dont have to respect her cause its her fault"" just because of my disorder.

25,Romantic Obsessions,How is the best way you deal with your romantic obsessions. I recently found out about my bpd. I always thought I was just over jealous but my jealousy was always super intense. I've had a lot of bad relationships because of it.. Currently married and been with my partner almost 6 years and he has some how manged to put up with it. We are at a point now to where I figure my shit out or we are going to have to part ways which would be hard cause there are 2 children involved.. I've been doing therapy and I suppose it had helped some. I'm more self aware now. I have stopped a lot of my obsessive behavior but like he's always a thought in the back of my mind. Is that just how it's going to be? Is there a way to get well enough to have it stop completely. I'd love to stop thinking he is attracted to any female he shows attention too.. That has caused a ton of issues. I know thats mostly to deal with how I see myself but that's not something I can change over night.

26,how to work on attachment,"Hi. I (20F) just got broken up with by my ex (22M) last night and have been NC. It's a very long story, but he ended things because of my behavior in the past few months being toxic and harmful. He said he loved me, he didn't want to do it, was ugly crying with me, but it was done anyway. Over the course of our nearly 8 month relationship, major life events happened, I lost sight, and he ended up becoming my Favorite Person unintentionally. 

I have been in bouts of crying, but I have been talking with many people and have a rocky plan for the foreseeable future. First, I have CBT and DBT in the next two days, and then on Wednesday I'm going to the doctor to switch my medication (cymbalta) to something else that will target mood swings. I am going to join a grief support group to manage the grief I felt these past couple months. I've written out the toxic attachments I developed and boundaries that we had at the beginning that fell away. 

I'm going to stay NC until Friday, wherein I'll reevaluate everything, but I don't know how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? I don't have these issues with anyone else in my life, only my romantic partner(s), and until the shit of life hit the fan, I was navigating my attachment very well. 

He is truly the love of my life, and we had so many things planned together. Everything was mapped out, and I was so secure with him. I believe when things went down that I used him too much for emotional reliance and we became a tad codependent. We are both anxious attachment, I think, and I have BPD whereas he does not. I do still love him, though, and I want to firstly work on my own issues for a while, but I do want to be with him again, if he'd try us out again.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? Or just any advice in general? 

edit: broke no contact. found out he and his sister are leaving town for a while, so I left him a voice-mail last night telling him to stay safe and that I miss him. said I love you. texted his sister a similar sentiment. the lack of response really feels like I just tore my own insides out, but I suppose that's the decision that's been made. I dont want to lose him, and I feel I already have

27,I’m surviving the worst part of my life. Recovery IS possible and I’m proof of it.,"Long post ahead. Tl;dr at the bottom.

For some background, I’m 29, just got diagnosed BPD last September. Despite that I struggled my entire life (suicidal thoughts, self harm, toxic relationships, MULTIPLE trips to the ER and I still was never properly diagnosed). I started DBT in October and just finished the program in April. I also started lamictal last year but just got on a dose that worked for me around February.

A little over three weeks ago, my husband got physically violent with me. He had “only” been verbally abusive in the past, which I let happen because I believed he would get better, even though he never even promised he would. 

And I LEFT. I just LEFT. I’ve never really felt the FP thing, but I definitely let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to me in the past. And I know if this happened a year ago…I would have stayed. I would have let him tell me he only hit me because my behavior made him. I would have let him make me believe I was the one who was getting the second chance to not fuck up. 

But after a year of intense therapy and meds (less than a year actually) I had the ability to leave him. And when he tried to control me, I still left. And when it meant I’d have to live alone, I still left. And even when I had a full emotional breakdown on our first wedding anniversary, one week after he hit me, I still left.

Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am for keeping myself safe, something I never have done in the past. This is the hardest and worst thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. But I know I’ll survive, and honestly, I owe that to DBT and all the work I put into it.

Please don’t give up hope. Keep trying, keep putting in the work. It’s worth it and so are you.

Tl;dr my husband got physically violent and thanks to DBT and meds I was able to leave him, something my BPD would never let me do before recovery.",1657591858.0,False,49,7,devourtheunborn69,None,vwzpxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/vwzpxv/im_surviving_the_worst_part_of_my_life_recovery/
28,Relationship dilemma,"BPD, CPTSD, Bipolar 2

Sorry for this long rant, trying to make sense of my broken life and needed to share with others who might be more understanding about what I’m going through, with my mental illness.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I’m afraid I’m too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I’d he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me….. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can’t and won’t get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",1688449467.0,False,1,0,Old-Meet-1322,None,14q68cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14q68cv/relationship_dilemma/
29,turning 25 really made me realize how narcissistic my parents are,"a little background for context: My whole life was spent in survival mode as I was systematically denied opportunities to grow into a healthy, happy, functional person. As the youngest in my family, for the longest time, I was told I was sick and to blame for my family's dysfunction. time after time my parents have proven to want me off their payroll and never showed genuine compassion, empathy, or support in any other way except financially. They would say cruel, horrible, hurtful things to bring me down but say they want the best for me and pull a woe-is-me card saying they have done everything they can to help. I softened and repeated to them that all I ever wanted was a cheerleader but instead, they'd continuously drag and slander me telling me I'd never get far in life and the world is a cruel place. the truth is they are the cruelest thing I have encountered in my lifetime. No matter what I did, even after 15+ years of therapy  I found my identity, improved myself, learned how to not react like them, communicated in a healthy manner, and am very confident and can defend myself properly.  it was never enough to change how they treated me. At 17 they sent me to a residential therapy center and I was in a position in which I couldn't decline or avoid it, which actually ended up saving me and changing my life forever. They were supposed to be a part of the journey but even experts couldn't convince them of their wrongdoings and who I really was, not who they interpreted me to be. They refused to listen to my therapists and tried to convince them of things they simply knew weren't true. (I lived there and interacted with them on a daily basis for a year). Eventually, it got to the point where my parents were constantly contacting my therapists, writing a literal \*book\* worth of an email, trying to tell them what to tell me or what I was doing. They wouldn't respect a professional's boundaries, how were they ever going to respect mine? hindsight is 20/20 as they spent my tuition to go to my dream college and pursue my dream job on this place. Grand total of $120,000+, to not listen to anything that was truly causing conflict. This problem persisted with all different therapists for years, looking back, they basically had me hop to different therapists throughout the years when thought they were wrong and couldn't sway them. When I was a kid I distinctly remember an incident where a therapist had restated something my mother had said to me recently, and i asked her if my mom told you to say that to which she replied, you're a smart cookie. They were convinced i would never take off and told me id never succeed yet resented me for being the reason I couldnt.

&#x200B;

Now, 25 (F), I live on my own and I have my dream job and found my dream apartment. I admit I had a late takeoff but everyone is on their own timeline, progress not perfection. They had helped me along the way financially but were consistent in their past behavior. I'm currently in the process of a move and things that shouldn't be arguments become arguments because they think I'm arguing when I'm cool as a cucumber. I did everything myself and orchestrated the move. I made plans and shared them and how we needed to get things done. they'd constantly interrogate me as if I hadn't recited the plan 10 times in a way that made me feel that they think I'm truly incapable. yet, they pushed me off when I reached out to get things done and would get so mad when id point it out respectfully and they'd blow me off while going off on me repeating the same horrible things. I know they are helping me financially but expressing my frustrations led to me being told I'm never going to have a relationship or friends and this is why people hate me and leave. to which I replied, like who? then they claim I gaslight them as they continue to try to tell me I'm this horrible person who lives to make them miserable. They go back and forth constantly from wanting to help to being punishing mean-spirited people and I'm just tired. I want to enjoy my life and I see now that even achieving what they thought I'd never do but claimed they wanted for me still isn't enough to earn their respect. I've done so much mourning over them never being the parents i needed through the years and now I just think my only option is to surrender to that. Its just really sad. I have so much anger and resentment from it, especially when I was the one told in my childhood that they had to walk on eggshells. But now I see, it was me that had to tip-toe and hold my breath. I don't want to be angry anymore, but god, do they fill me with rage. 

I don't know what I'm really looking for...  I want to preserve my identity and my recovery without their words living in my head. So maybe connection, advice, or a community. I just want to be happy and feel proud, my life has never been better and I feel like they have sucked the joy right out of my achievements. every. single. time.",1693340841.0,False,8,2,KirbyInTheClouds,None,164tdo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/164tdo4/turning_25_really_made_me_realize_how/
30,What Is the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD?," Mental Disorders (DSM).

There's no biologically based test to definitively diagnose borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, mental health professionals often use screening instruments such as the MSI-BPD to help identify the likelihood of BPD and the need for further evaluation and treatment.

Scoring of the MSI-BPD

Each item is rated as a ""1"" if it is present and a ""0"" if it is absent, and items are totaled for possible scores from 0 to 10. A score of 7 is considered a valid diagnostic cutoff, meaning that a score of 7 or higher indicates that you likely meet the criteria for a BPD diagnosis.2

The first eight items of the MSI-BPD represent the first eight DSM-IV/5 diagnostic criteria for BPD, while the last two items assess the final DSM-IV/5 criterion, i.e., **paranoia/dissociation.**

## Uses for the MSI-BPD

Clinicians use the MSI-BPD to diagnose BPD, sometimes in conjunction with other screening tools. Research suggests the MSI-BPD is helpful in detecting BPD in the general population,3 but more studies are needed.

The MSI-BPD test has been shown to be very effective in detecting possible BPD in people who are seeking or have a history of treatment for mental health problems.

## Psychometric Properties

The MSI-BPD has demonstrated valid, reliable psychometric properties. It has adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. It has also demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for detecting borderline personality disorder when a score of 7 is used as a diagnostic cutoff.

[**Coping With Borderline Personality Disorder**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095SHGB9N) 

## Other Screening Tools

The MSI-BPD is only one of several that clinicians typically use to diagnose BPD. These include the following.  


Structured Clinical Interview

This official clinical interview of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is an update of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) but is very similar.4 Your mental health professional may use this screening tool to help determine your diagnosis by asking you questions directly related to the criteria for BPD that are listed in the DSM-5.

This screening instrument also has an optional self-reporting questionnaire with 108 questions, but not all clinicians who choose the SCID-5-PD use this. 

Causes of Borderline Personality Disorder

PDQ-4

The Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire, 4th Edition (PDQ-4) screening test consists of 99 true-or-false questions that can help screen for various personality disorders, including BPD.5

Zanarini Rating Scale

The Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD), also developed by Dr. Zanarini, is used for patients who have already been diagnosed with BPD to test for changes over time.1

Which Tool Is Best?

A recent study comparing correlations, sensitivity, and specificity among the MSI-BPD, PDQ-4, and SCID-II in adolescents and young adults showed they were equally effective in predicting a BPD diagnosis.6 On the other hand, another study concluded that the PDQ-4 ""should not be used in clinical practice as a screening instrument for PD assessment.""7

## Impact of BPD Screening

BPD is challenging to diagnose and treat because it's so often misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder and other conditions. Further complicating the issue is that BPD often exists with comorbidities, including bipolar disorder, and poses a significant risk of suicide.8 That makes accurate screening tools such as the MSI-BPD particularly important.  


Once BPD is diagnosed, the clinician can develop a treatment plan to address it. This might include such targeted approaches as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), which has been shown to be effective for people with BPD.8  


## Potential Pitfalls of the MSI-BPD

Tests such as the MSI-BPD provide a picture of person's mental status only at a particular point in time. Astute clinicians additionally take into account the person's patterns of behavior over time.9

&#x200B;

BPD is a particularly difficult disorder to diagnose and treat. Research indicates that the MSI-BPD is a valuable tool in this effort, however, and takes very little time to complete. Based on the results, a clinician can then help you address BPD's challenges and learn healthy ways to cope with and regulate your emotional states and responses.",1647850548.0,False,3,1,redditerX75,None,tj6rq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/tj6rq5/what_is_the_mclean_screening_instrument_for_bpd/
31,What Boundaries Aren’t,"You don’t set boundaries, you uncover them. 

A boundary is the point beyond which you can no longer reliably act in ways that you’re proud of. 

Ways that are consistent with your values. 

Ways that move you closer to your goals. 

Whenever you cross your boundaries, you move away from your goals, away from your values, away from a life you can be proud of. 

Before I got help and learned skills, it wasn’t a question of __whether__ I crossed my boundaries and did things I regret, but rather a matter of __when__ and how much damage there would be to repair. 

I was always terrified by the prospect of setting boundaries with others, because I knew I wasn’t capable of withdrawing my desperate need for approval and validation. I couldn’t depend on myself to enforce consequences. 

Besides, there was no doubt in my mind: if I set even a single boundary, every shred of connection or relationship I’d painstakingly and painfully gathered would scatter to the wind. It wasn’t worth the risk. I knew I wouldn’t survive it. 

When I changed the way I saw boundaries, everything changed. 

In intensive therapy I learned about a location I had never, ever, in my 31 years of life, experienced. 

The Window of Tolerance. 

Physiologically speaking, the kinds of behaviors I was exhibiting were caused by a nervous system swinging between hyperarousal and hypoarousal states. Like a car that can only shift into first or reverse.

If I could get inside my window of tolerance, and figure out how to stay there, my therapists promised me I’d be able to deal with the intrusive thoughts and compulsive urges that were destroying my will to continue with life.

Finding and accepting safety and making grounding and mindfulness the core of my existence got me back to the window of tolerance. 

Boundaries are what keep me inside. Boundaries are what keep me safe. 

From there, I can authentically connect with others. I can manually regulate my emotions. I can read the signals my body sends me. I can think clearly about the consequences of my actions. 

Finally, I could cruise along in fourth gear. 

Everyone always says you have to choose yourself over others, prioritize your life and your happiness. If you’ve read this far, you know the hollow pain of those platitudes as they thud against your empty rib cage. If thag’s the solution, we’ll never get well. How could anyone prioritize or value a noxious hellscape of constant pain?

Get inside your window of tolerance. Develop strategies to stay there. Inside, you’ll find a life worth living. 

And when you’re invited to step beyond the boundaries of your window of tolerance, you can make an informed decision about whether that’s the best idea for you or not. 

And the best part of this is, when you’ve made those safe and stable connections (possible because you can consistently show up in ways that you’re proud of), you can point them out to the people you trust. 

‘See that ridge over there? I don’t go past that point. If you want to go that way, you can, but I can’t come with you.’

They won’t try to convince you, because they believe that you know what’s best for you. And they want you to have what they need. Sometimes you’ll have to part ways so they can go places you won’t. That’s sad, but it’s okay, because you’re still in your wonderful garden of tolerance. 

Connection and pleasure and peace are abundant here.

Finally, you’re okay.",1620561442.0,False,51,15,arithmetok,None,n8crd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/n8crd0/what_boundaries_arent/
32,Going through a breakup,"I spent a LOT of time focusing on myself afyer getting out of an abusive relationship a few years back. I spent time alone finding hobbies and working on so many of my own issues as well as coping with what happened during that relationship. I ended up getting clean from self harm and I even went back and graduated high school and started working again. I was so proud of myself and thought I could handle a relationship again finally. 

I may have been wrong.

We moved really slow at first, we took our time with dates and spending the night. We didn't want to force anything and I didn't want to get addicted so fast. Things went really well until around the 3 month mark I had a bad week, I was crying a lot and upset and for the first time, I brought up how when I feel like a mess I want to selfharm. I thought he would be able ro handle it since after a while of dating I told him about BPD and he read up on it and even highlighted and annotated a book about it, just to study and better handle what could happen. But he did not handle the stress well when I break down did come, he tried to leave but ended up wanting to stay, and I felt good about his choice at first since I did not beg or freak out when he brought it up, I tried to just talk about our issues. However trying to leave 3 months in really set something off in me, immediately I sowed seeds of abandonment and left me paranoid. 

As time went on I still had breakdowns over something dumb every few months, but when he'd bring up something to me that upset him or hurt him, I'd always take the steps to start changing, and more often than not I'd stop the bad behavior he pointed out. I was lucky of he pointed it out though, he had a fear of confrontation and as he told me ""I didn't make it easy for him."" I know it should be easier for me to see what I'm doing wrong but sometimes it was hard, I told him he'd need to spell it out for me, and there's times I'd get really defensive and mad when he did. I'd always apologize afyer the fact and tell him I overreacted and that he's in the right to feel that way. I ALWAYS made sure to tell him his feelings were valid and good and I tried my best to take accountability, even of he had to point out my wrongdoings. 

Though I'd have these bad times, I will say I didn't insult him, I never uses shoes like or SH as a threat and I'd take accountability for myself feeling like that, when he was upset with me I'd even be sure to avoid talking about those feelings so he wouldn't associate them with his own emotions towards me. 

But eventually he tried to leave again, showing me no warnings and coming home and breaking the news to me a year into the relationship. I yet again, just sat there and tried to talk about it and we worked though things... only for him to do it again the next day and decide to stay AGAIN. At that point I was horrified. Always scared he's going to go and not knowing when it would happen. He wouldn't talk to me about any issues he had when they came up. He would give me the chance to talk about anything or seek any help cuz he wouldn't even let me know when he felt I was doing something wrong. I shouldn't have been so blind to it and I know that, but I thought I was trying. I tried so hard on the things he wanted fixed. I tried.

He stayed after that though. Flash forward 3 more months, I have the worst week I've had in our relationship, I was very aware of my wrong doings and told him everytime, but it didn't change how I was feeling. We were on a time crunch to get my me drivers license, I have college starting up in 2 weeks, and he's supposed to leave town for the first time for a week. This is all happening at the same time and I was horrified. I even broke down crying during my behind the wheel test and things hadn't been feeling too real for a few weeks, I didn't feel ready for any of it and because of it I felt like a failure. On top of that I felt I needed to be afraid of him leaving, like I NEEDED that fear. I knew he was stressed too because of how I felt and I knew I wasn't handling stuff well. Eventually I broke down, I was sobbing and yelling about how I wanted to die, I told him it's cuz I felt like a failure, because if I couldn't handle getting my license how am I supposed to handle school. This break down soon flipped into me yelling at him that he's going to leave. I KNEW my breakdowns were too much and I felt like he was going to go again for it, it felt inevitable.

The next day happens and all the bad feelings built up, and for the first time in 2 years I relapsed on self harm. When I got home that night i told him, and I told him I stopped because it wasn't worth it to myself to fall back into that behavior. I also told him that I was scared to tell him because I thought he'd leave if I got that weak and hurt myself. I was right, he left. He told me after he saw the mark on my leg he gave up on me. I know it's selfish to expect him to stay after that, but I really wish he did. I didn't want him to fix me, just to be there for me and talk about ways to get over this stress

After everything he came by to talk to me and told me all these things i had no clue he felt during our relationship. Things that I felt, if they were talked about, really could have been worked on and fixed, but he told me ""it's just not worth it"". He didn't want to stick around and work on anything. If he had mentioned couples therapy I would have done it in a heartbeat, if he had just needed space I would have done it in a moment, no guilt involved. 

He mentioned feeling like I didn't want him to see his siblings alone BUT HE NEVER TRIED. HE NEVER BROUGHT IT UP ONCE. I even asked him ""why haven't you seen you siblings in a whileyou should make plans soon."" But he decided that meant nothing. I tell him ""hey you should play the piano or do *insert hobby here* today, and I'll just play a video game"" but he decided I wanted him glued to me at all times. And undeniably there WERE times like that. I wanted him in the same room as me a lot, I wanted to he near him, but he never once told me that wasn't okay. He always entertained it, I didn't know. If he wasn't happy I wish he would have at least told me. Inwish he would have at least given me a chance. 

He also said i shouldn't ever ""subject"" someone to my thoughts of SH. I feel so destroyed. This was supposed to be my first healthy relationship and I did mess up, I did breathe down his neck too much but if he had at least talked to me I feel like i could have tried.

33,First few days...,"It  has been an exhausting 5 years. I escaped my abusers, got married to my soulmate (yikes), started therapy for PTSD, got diagnosed with ADHD, and tried medication this year. There’s one huge problem: I’m on dialysis and Adderall XR is __undializable__ meaning it’s has no way to exit my body. I went full psychotic you guys. So I stopped taking the Adderall and it finally has broken down to its components and filtered out. 

But then I was still getting angry. Just like I used to. I still couldn’t sleep, just like I used to. My inner critic used me as a whipping girl, just like she did when I was mentally hallucinating that she was gonna eat my face off. 

I got a Generalized Personality Disorder diagnosis from a resident marriage therapist about a year ago. 

It’s been a long ass fucking year. I’ve touched on DBT, and fought tooth and nail with my behaviors to “prove” I didn’t have BPD. But I was bent until I was broken and I had to pick up the pieces. And the BPD was still there. 

Y’all, I’ve never got a 9/9 on anything. I finally watched a few videos. My flip-switch, ends-quick rage, my self hate, my suicidal but not really tendencies, it was all in there. Even the parts where I was more prone to stressed-based psychosis. (Previously I had been diagnosed as “depression with psychosis”) 

So over the weekend I’ve been trying to hard. I’ve been messaging my therapist instead of my husband. When I do tell my husband stuff it’s consise and not 15 pages. I isolated myself today while I was mad, and “rode the wave” and was able to figure out almost everything behind that particular shitfit. I also didn’t escalate my anger at something my husband was doing, into anger at him, and I avoided a good bit of verbal abuse. 

But all of this is so tiring. And I’m barely scratching the surface. The conversations my husband and I are having are deep and scary and I haven’t been this honest with anybody about this stuff. I have new fears, and new ways to practice old fears. 

I just wanna be better. I wanna stop abusing my husband. I wanna not feel like shit all the time. I wanna stop fighting because I have a hairline trigger and he accidentally makes it worse somehow. 

The road has been long, and the road will be long ahead. But I am recognizing how sneaky (In a good way) my therapists have been and how I actually have a few DBT skills already, I just have to learn how to apply them. Radical acceptance a few months ago helped us stop fighting about the dishes. Riding the Wave has helped me isolate and quickly manage breakdowns before they affect my husband. 

He just is so afraid of me now. He’s so jumpy. And I am heartbroken. I can’t believe I’ve done this to the man I love. Except this time instead of my inner critic taking hold, I’m using it to be better every time in cognizant enough to S T O P. 

On the one hand, this is such a tall mountain. An Everest perhaps. But I have told him that he is my Foreverest Love, because I would climb Everest for him. Well now I’m being called to task, and I just gotta pick up my ropes and start climbing, no matter how hard it is.

I’m posting this cause I’m anxious I can’t do it. I’m so early in my journey I still have most of my disordered thoughts and behaviors. I’ve been looking for the evidence to calm my anxiety, but even so, my critic pesters me “you’ll never be good enough and he’ll leave” even though he knows I’m afraid of that and had literally guaranteed the opposite.

34,"blew up a relationship and now I don't know what to do. also, very sad","Context:

Moved from Chicago to Albuquerque with my partner in September in a very fast and dramatic nature. We broke up Oct/Nov, and have continued to live together as chosen family. I worked and supported us when we first got here, and then I was unemployed from the end of November until a week ago, and the roles reversed. 

In December, I was in the psych hospital and while I was in there got a very angry text outlying some of my behavior that hurt them with the boundaries to ""not ask them for shit"" and that they were no longer the default for anything. Rides, weed, money, etc. Things that have been shared. It really hurt and was triggering. 

I've been trying, what is my current best, to maintain the boundaries, but still find myself asking for things and for help. Never really had anyone be so strict about boundaries before, and I share a lot of things with them, whenever they ask. The biggest thing is that they have had had access to is my laptop, which they have unlimited access to because they use it for work. My laptop is also the only way we are able to watch tv or movies. 

They are moving to a different city in another state at the end of March, and it's brought up a lot, on top of the whirlwind of our relationship and breakup that I haven't even remotely processed. And I have no idea what I am doing. Whether I'm staying in this city or moving on somewhere else, and if I stay in the same house or move out to another place. 

On Friday I lost one of my new jobs after 2 days of training, while I was in the middle of working my other job, and this week/weekend has been the anniversary of some very traumatic experiences and losses. I have been at the bottom of the well and in so much pain for a very, very long time and all of that turned into a lot of anger. That anger hasn't been excised in any sort of way. 

I had let them know what had happened and asked them if they could share some weed because I had worked a 15 hour day and everything was closed so I was unable to procure it myself. They have a car, and I don't. Not having a car in this city is incredibly unreliable and unsustainable, btw. The next morning before work they said they wanted to talk about boundaries when I got home. 

On the way to work, I decided to go full destruction and sent them a very nasty text saying things like how I jump when they say how high because I owe them, they didn't ask me about anything relating to losing my job, but fuck me, right? cancelling our Valentine's plans, telling them to not use my laptop anymore, and that we can stop pretending like we're going to talk or see each other once they move away. 

It went as well as we know it did. Told me that was all baseless and fucked up. They called me some names, fragile princess and fucking foul for getting in the way of their ability to work and make money. Saying if I wanna be done, we're done and that there's nothing for us to talk about unless it's about the house. I was immediately regretful and apologetic and took accountability for how I've treated them, that I hope they find someone who treats them better and can show up for them in a way that I haven't been able to, and in a way they deserve. Said that they could continue to use the laptop. They never responded to any of that. We did text today about the lease.

We haven't had any interaction as I've been at work and I'm not trying to impose myself. When I came home last night, I cleaned the kitchen, did dishes took out trash, and straighted up the living room. The vibe was a lot better than I thought it would be when I got home,  which was a surprise. 

Today I've started to cry off and on at work. I'm weirdly calm. Maybe because I'm accepting of my bed, and because I know I have to repair through action, which is getting back into program and all of the therapy and additional work. 

I'm sharing all this, because I really need to hear or know about others experiences that are similar to this. I really don't know what to do. I'm incredibly sad. All they wanted was for the rest of out time living together to be joyous, and I ruined everything. Don't even know if I should try and do any repair. I feel like it would be kinder to let them go.

35,having bpd is the equivalent to having third degree burns all over your body,"long ass vent for myself tbh

""Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement""

Marsha linehan who developed the therapy method DBT said that about people who suffer from borderline.

It quite literally produces the most intense emotional pain of any mental illness, it has a fatality rate of 10% 45 times more than the general population. 

According to Linehan we lose all cognitive functioning during periods of extreme emotional distress which unfortunately for BPD can happen at the drop of a feather. 

Personally for me it used to be a raging burning feeling in my head. Where I couldnt hear the rational part of my brain telling me you love this person, this isn't you, you don't want to do this, it's not a big deal. The voice in the back of my head that shuts that shit down immediately now was practically silenced. I couldnt hear them no matter how much I tried. Or if I actually managed to hear them and gripped onto it to bring myself back; I would just spiral and fall right back into the pit anyways. Because I had never even started the true healing process. And because the person I was with fed the worst parts of my fears and insecurities. My brain was completely consumed with so much of that hurt/fear/insecurity/humilation and it turned to a unceasing completely blinding rage. I would fall back in again and again desperately clawing to get out but succumbing each time to the borderline insanity that involuntarily manifested in my brain. 

My most painful moments of BPD haunt me every day. The absolute loss of control I used to feel over the smallest most stupid things. Scream crying alone in my room again and again, feeling the extreme grief equivalent to all my loved ones being murdered in front of me repeatedly over a simple relationship ending, its literally hell on fucking earth. Right now my dog who I love more than anything (outside of my FP) even more than myself, could be murdered right in front of me and I still know it wouldn't even compare to what I felt in every moment of the nightmare that was my existence at the time. 

I remember thinking in those moments of absolute mania and panic that this was anguish beyond belief, nothing had ever compared or ever could. Not even the extreme torture and abuse from my childhood. And I got brushed off and told it wasn't nearly THAT bad and it just feels that way because I'm still so close to it. No way could the emotional pain ever match the insanity of what my step mum put me through. As if I wasn't the one who had to deal with and then overcome the unceasing years and years of nightmares, flashbacks and constant panic attacks. As if I don't remember how acute that particular pain is. 

Well it's been over a year now and my extreme physical pain experiences will never ever fucking compare to the absolute torture of those moments. I would go through the worst of the worst all again than feel even a moment of that. When I tell people that they really can't believe me. They hear what happened to me in childhood and then what my ex did to me and it's not even comparable to them. How could I even for a second say she hurt me more? 

People without BPD literally cannot even comprehend how painful and intense our emotions can get. How everything is dialled up to a billion and we have NO control over it. I truly believe the vast vast majority of them (even ones who have been seriously hurt) have never felt the amount of agony that BPD people (involuntarily) create in their own heads. I believe that, because I've been through extreme verbal sexual and physical abuse and it was nothing to how my brain blindsided and ambushed me when I got my first FP. I understand why it doesn't make sense to them they will never understand what we have to live with and go through every day just by existing. But for me personally no amount of my sexual trauma or physical torture will ever compare to the pain of just being with a favourite person who showed me my first experiences of ""love"", made me feel joy for the first time in my life and then had to leave me, moved on and no longer cared for me at all anymore. (Actually was actively out for my blood in my situation 😐) Especially when you only live for the people you love in the first place. They are your entire centre of existence. In your head it's absolutely inconceivable you could ever not dedicate every part of yourself to them. What do you do then...

Fortunately for me I healed. Back then, with the person I was with, my body did really feel like an exposed wound at all times. Any little thing could set it off and cause me extreme pain. She couldn't understand how much pain I was in because I was cursed to manifest it as anger. Of course that makes it hard to empathise with especially when you become a victim of abuse as a result. I truly couldn't control it, I didn't realise this at the time but she constantly unintentionally kept me in a state of fear of abandonment and continuously enforced insecurities surrounding my body and who I even am as a person. Every little thing would set me off subconsciously, it would effect my emotions and actions in ways I couldn't control or many times even notice. Because my feelings were constantly being hurt by her, constantly felt devestation bubbling under the surace because no one meant more to me, no one's effect on my emotions even came close. So sometimes it was overt and drastic. I truly could not understand my extreme reaction to something so stupid after. That wasn't me. No part of that was me I know now deep down to my core my need for control completely came from fear. I was 100x more sensitive, everything was so agonising all the time without me even realising. And unfortunately that led me to take it out on them which kept me in a constant state of shame and regret that I had to push down as well.

Throughout my childhood my brain learned that fight, not flight would save me. The only time the torture stopped was when I hurt them back. So when I feel pain or hurt or anything that destabilizes me; especially from the person who had grounded me the most and had once made me feel the safest and most loved when no one else has before. I became theirs. I quite literally belonged to them, I didn't even realise how miserable I was. Once they showed me that side to life I couldn't let go. I relied on them entirely for any sense of safety and comfort or happiness so subconsciously when they took that away from me my brain ""defends"" itself without my fucking permission. It haunts me that the people I loved the most I used to hurt the most. I wish it could have been anyone else than the people I care for so deeply. As much as I wish I internalized that pain...I couldn't, I really really fucking couldnt at the time. So I lashed out, again and again and again uncontrollably until she thankfully left me and I got to find someone I could actually have my skin and a true sense of safety with for the first time in my life. 

Immense healing happened so rapidly. She immediately made me feel secure in my body, and satisfied in general within the first few weeks, which gave me a huge boost of self esteem and motivation to actually practice self care and improve myself. I mean if she could find me beautiful this fucking girl then I gotta try. I had to actually be worthy of her. I will never let myself be unworthy again. I needed to stop being a depressed potato and actually be my best self. Be Bucky in a sense. Also she seemed so attracted to me, so into me and even my body. She saw something I never could I wanted to see myself for the first time through her eyes. See myself as beautiful. 

She gave me hope, actually hope I could be better and change everything. Undo all the excessive damage that was done to my brain. Figure out all the different personalities rattling around in there and learn to listen and focus on the ones that are actually me. Not manifested from the darkest, traumatised, survival mode parts of myself. I realised I had so many layers, so many different thought processes going on at once. Of course it led to instability. I needed to silence them... I started DBT. I grinded in therapy twice a week. I consistently took my Lamictal and started Vyvanse to help with the head buzzing. Worked full time while in school to afford the insurance. Let out my emotions through working with animals and working out. I felt satisfication with myself every day, not even exhausted cause atleast now I was trying. I was accomplishing something. Every day learning new things about myself and taking steps forward. I discovered crazy things about myself in therapy (not necessarily always fun stuff) but it opened my mind so much to hopefully bring out the best version of me. 



One of my most intense triggers was retroactive jealousy. It tormented me constantly in my last relationship it was one of the first big leaps to destroying it and continued to break it down further throughout. Every tiny thing used to set me off and make me feel incredibly insecure. It's hard to describe what it felt like it's been so long since I felt anything even similar and it wasn't quite as overwhelming as the black out split rages. So not as potent a memory for me. But it was a mix of masochism and deep deep insecurity and hatred of myself compared to CIS men, which led to rages and spiralling. I would make her confirm my worst fears again and again maybe just to hurt myself, maybe in desperate attempt to make it okay in my head. It was mental self harm and I didn't realise that. RAJ was completely new to me (in fact I didn't even know every through out what was really going on) and it absolutely blindsided me. After that I didn't even know how to deal with it, I didn't know where to begin. I don't think I even possibly could have with the person I was with. I could never have gotten to a point with them where I believed in myself, or didn't constantly hate myself, and wasnt stuck in perpetual loop of survival mode with.

I thought I experienced RAJ with her because she was my first FP but with my current FP I could prod myself all day and feel absolutely nothing. Not a shred of hurt or insecurity. She healed me so much by just making me feel unconditionally loved for the first time in my life. Physically being with her is incredibly important it's my #1 love language and she has built up my view of my body to heights I would have never imagined. We are so fucking intensely intimate all the time it's crazy (it's the bpd in us) Who else could fucking matter we are each other's universes. I know that I'm her world and no one else, even a CIS man could compare. (Seriously though retroactive jealousy as a transman dating a straight girl is the worst and made me act like a completely different person Jesus Christ) I know I don't have to feel jealous because every fucking day she shows me that. I don't feel completely disconnected and isolated from her. I'm so god damn lucky, she gives me such a sense of peace and fullfillment. I tricked myself into thinking my last relationship was anything close to love or feeling real love...when I don't feel that constant turmoil and instability, when I actually feel like enough, when I'm grounded in who I am and feel safe and secure with who I'm with; it's so so so much easier. Everything felt so out of control when my head was constantly scared and in defence mode with them. Constantly needing to win arguments because admitting I'm wrong takes vulnerability which I could not show to her. So easy to admit I'm wrong to my current partner and to just drop any disagreement because I feel subconsciously safe enough to give up all power to her anytime. Plus my current partner having BPD unlike my ex; she actually can understand the insane amount of pain we can feel over the smallest things. How it compares to nothing else. How out of that pain we can say and do things that aren't any part of us at all. She doesn't just write it off because its so extreme and irrational. We both can have so much empathy and understanding for each other and it's so peaceful. Never taking an us VS them mentality. Feeling like you're always on the same team with your partner. Constantly growing, learning and healing together. We don't argue at all because before it can even escalate we have already focused on listening and validating the other person in their concern and come to a conclusion together that works.

Along those lines she also helped me discover my severe sexual abuse, healed my ""partners family hating me trauma"" that I've experienced throughout the years for many different reasons, affirmed me constantly in every aspect of my body that used to destroy me, rekindled my relationship with my mum an old shame of mine. Basically pushed the kind, strong, grounded side of me to the surface with her unceasing support, and given me a first look at a stable normal happy healthy life. (god damn the way she went all out at Christmas for me, healed something deep to my little kid core) She was my first hope. Hope that we can actually achieve the dream future I've always pictured; become the person I always dreamed of. First real reason to have any ambition or to give a shit in life where my brain before was just in a dead end slump of hopelessness.

BPD is a fucking curse. But with the right support system and enough effort/ dedication it can actually be manageable. Life is so much easier when I can practice emotional regulation and actually grow my emotional skin for the first time. It may have been stripped from me as a kid but I know love, time, dedication and resources can heal me fully one day. I may always be a loaded gun because of what happened to me, and I've always struggled before to keep my finger off the trigger. But not anymore with the right toolset I'm going to destroy that trigger entirely.

36,the eventual decline of chris and maud,"I'm unsure why I'm writing this out.  I suppose part of me believes it could be cathartic but a bigger part of me believes someone else might benefit from reading it & relating.  
I tried a NoContact subreddit first thinking it was where I wanted to write this but I backed out of there pretty quick, that was some scary obsessive shit. I'm not convinced this is the right subreddit for it either but there's so many subreddits that it's a wee bit daunting to find the right fit sometimes.  Having said that, if this isn't the right place please don't tear me apart over it, I'm getting really tired of the hostility online.  Just refer me to a better sub.  


I broke up with my significant other (I'll call him Chris, that's a common enough name) a few days ago but yesterday I asked him to refrain from contacting me.  We had been together for about a year, maybe almost two now?  I'm inept at tracking time.  At first he was interesting and quiet and as we got to know each other it was a lovely time in my life.  We brought out the best in each other.  Several months into the relationship I had a phone issue and he let me borrow his for the day while he was at work.  A message popped up that was clearly about me.  I felt myself flood with anger and I opened it.  I'm sure there will be people who decide to be angry in my decision to do so and I honestly don't care.  If a gross text about you popped up on your SO's phone I wonder if you'd be so inclined to ignore it.  Anyway, I opened it and read it.  What I read indicated there was more elsewhere too so I opened up all his texts and facebook messages.  He was talking about me to several people.  Before I continue, he doesn't keep close friendships with anyone so all of these people were people he barely had relationships with.  One was an ex girlfriend, one was a gamer friend he barely knew, one was an older gay gentleman who had a crush on him, it was so weird that he would choose to indulge such information to any one of them.  The texts were interesting.  He would discuss my mental health diagnoses, my finances, my family, and other deeply personal topics with these people... and what's worse is a lot of what he said was dishonest and one sided.  I used my Kindle to take pics of all of the texts and facebook messages.  There were so many.  When I gave him back his phone I confronted him by asking him if he ever talks to people about our relationship and he said no.  He said no but I could see his fear spreading across his face so I asked him again.  He started acting like a cornered animal and finally said yes but then lied about how many people he told.  He said one.  There were four, I think.  I clearly remember three but there were four.  In the end he said he understood that what he did was wrong and he was sorry but I suppose truthfully I never got past it.  I tried to be a bigger person and forgive it and move past it but I didn't.  It lingered and finally I broke up with him.  There were three of us living in the house together and we would all meet up in the living room to watch Twin Peaks in the evenings.  After the breakup he would be on his phone constantly and suddenly began acting secretive.  Our other housemate had to go out of town for a weekend or something and during his absence Chris said he was going away for the weekend as well- to the ex girlfriend's house a few hours away.  This triggered something in me.  I mentioned previously that I have Borderline Personality Disorder.  Borderlines will do almost anything to avoid real or perceived abandonment, logic be damned.  It was no different for me, I suddenly felt like it was essential to have him back.  I sat down and thought about everything, tried to sort the emotion and logic.  Chris was texting me the whole first day of that weekend and that was making it harder.  He said he was walking around some store and everything reminded him of me and he was starting to think he made a mistake.  At the time I didn't see the forest for the trees and I blocked Chris that Friday until Sunday afternoon.  On Sunday I unblocked him and shared what I had been going through mentally and we agreed that we still had feelings for one another and wanted to keep at this.  He admit he did sleep with his ex but that good ol' BPD brain of mine excused it.  I'll take this moment to encourage you to seek therapy for any mental health issues.  If you're fortunate enough not to have one I'll thank you for not insulting me over what I couldn't work through properly.  


We stayed together for quite some time and then in October of last year he got deployed.  There were minor issues in that time but nothing like the great text ordeal at the beginning.  We had actually talked about getting married and I had planned out a whole engagement thing with his mom, who I was (am?) close to.  He had made it sounds like he wasn't traditional and wanted something different and meaningful like I did so I thought that he would love the idea of me proposing to him with socks instead of a ring.  There's a story there (for those of you who raised a brow) but it's not worth sharing.  It was something between myself and Chris.  A couple days before Christmas we were watching a movie using the Netflix Party chrome extension and there was a scene where a girl proposed to her boyfriend.  Chris commented and said the idea of that was awful.  I asked why and he gave me a few reasons.  I sighed and told him what I had planned.  Although he had been telling me for months prior to this that he was ready to get married and he wanted to marry me and blah blah fucking blah, all of a sudden he wasn't.  He said he wasn't ready, he had all these questions to figure out first and all this stuff that was news to me.  At this point I started seeing Chris as a liar.  This wasn't the first lie, it was one of several, but it was a massive lie.  He had led me on for months about MARRIAGE.  I was clearly upset and I had to tell his mom that the time wasn't right after all and she needed to cancel the plans we'd made to surprise Chris.  She wasn't happy with Chris for his lies and she was worried that we would break up over this.  Yes, we should have but stupidly we didn't.  After December things went pretty easy and we tried working through stuff.  At that point the communication issues started becoming more prevalent.  We hadn't had communication issues except for his lying prior to that.  Over time it felt like communication got worse.  I started catching more lies and they were stupid too, stupid things to lie about.  Excuses for every little thing started coming up.  Looking back I'm not sure how we got to summer of this year but we did.   


The plan for summer was I would go visit Chris for a couple months.  I was looking forward to working on communication in person and just being with him.  I especially missed holding his hand, it was a powerful tool in alleviating anxiety.  Chris drove to pick me up so I could bring more of my own stuff with me.  The trip back to where he was deployed went ok, more or less.  Communication was basically breaking down but it wasn't garbage yet.  Chris would tell me we were going to do this and we were going to do that and I was excited about the summer.  Long story short my summer basically consisted of me sitting alone most of the time while he was at work.  There was NOTHING to do there except watch Netflix and I gained some weight because the food there was... different, we'll say.  It was quite interesting to me how the things I consistently ate at home weren't available where Chris was.  Of all the promises Chris had made, he did follow through on one.  We visited his parents that summer.  It's even harder to eat my diet where they live and that ended up being a real problem.  Just little issues peppering the trip, how Chris dealt with anything or didn't, stuff like that.  I started noticing more negative things about Chris.  He would not only lie to me but to his family as well.  He would pretend, for lack of better word. I feel like lie is too extreme for his behavior around his family.  Pretend works better.  He would make promises and not follow through, he was dishonest often, he would behave more like a child as the summer carried on, he was doing things almost regularly that were inconsiderate.  With having so much free time I sat and thought about the relationship often.  At some point it just clicked.  I realized that I was forcing myself to stay in a relationship that should have been over after the texting thing happened.  I realized that Chris was a liar and the whole relationship was a lie built on a lie painted over with lies and decorated with lies.  I cared so much for Chris that even then, even after that realization, I still didn't want to leave him.    


I've been home for about a month now and I've taken the time to tell Chris how I feel, using specific examples from our relationship.  I've clearly laid out where our communication issues are and why they happen.  I have taken the time to find solutions that require his involvement on his own time for his own self if this relationship will have any hope at all.  Three days ago he said something to me, I don't remember what it was now.  It wasn't a big thing, it wasn't an important thing, but it happened to be the last straw.  I told him that his behavior was affecting me in a negative way, triggering my BPD, holding me back from going forward in my recovery (which otherwise had been a steady path forward for years).  I told him how I felt around his family (the pros and the cons), I told him how certain things had certain outcomes and I provided suggestions for ways to avoid finding ourselves in a bad place again.  I told him I wanted some space from him, I wanted to end our relationship until he had done the legwork to fix the bigger issues that fell on him.  I was carrying Chris through our relationship and I couldn't continue to do so.  He agreed and over the next day he would text me these stupid little remarks about progress he was making except it wasn't progress at all.  It was more of the typical Chris lies and trying to manipulate the situation.  I called him out on it instead of ignoring it.  He continued to do it, I continued to call him out.  The next day he said I was making him feel terrible when he was trying to ""get better"" and I called him out on that too.  I told him that his ""plans"" to see a therapist in two more months and to ""be more mindful"" of how he communicates were just more lies and there was no evidence.  He said he couldn't change in a week.  I told him I didn't expect him to but I did expect more than trying to hoover me back in with falsehoods.  I told him that his attempts to persuade me that he was actually taking real initiatives were making the problems worse and that everything still felt like lies.  I told him that no contact might be the best thing for us right now.  He texted me yesterday morning, just a normal hello how do you do type thing.  The way he phrased his text felt a little off so I pushed a bit and of course broke open the festering communication issue.  On my end I broke down crying.  I suppose that's when I really knew that it was hopeless.  Every communication issue we had would get discussed and then immediately happen again, over and over, and I was broken from it.  The stress from trying to sort it out had reached the apex.  By that afternoon I had responded to all his attempts at excuses with calling him out until finally he said he needed space from me because I wasn't helping him.  The facade shattered.  I'd told him twice in the last couple days to give me space and he had a way of worming back in with his lies.  I told him that I believed that we were fundamentally different and we no longer brought out the best in one another.  I told him that his behavior had become a major trigger for my BPD and I wasn't going to undo years of progress for a toxic relationship. I told him he'd be better suited with someone who didn't mind being lied to because that wasn't going to change.  I told him I wish him well and I hope he finds happiness in himself.  He wrote back that he wishes the same for me and I haven't heard from him since yesterday afternoon.    


Normally the BPD would have me raging and seething and crying and hysterical.  This is what I mean about progress.  I'd been going forward for years, making steady progress, growing into a functional and healthy person.  I'm actually proud of myself for identifying the behaviors in a toxic relationship and (although it took a year too long I got there eventually) breaking it off with a no contact request.  I don't know what I would do if Chris tried to text me.  I doubt very much he will.  I think he will revert back to talking to people with whom he had very superficial relationships with, being dishonest with them in order to validate himself.  It's not for me to worry about, I figure if it does happen I'll just block the number.  I have my own life to live without Chris and the childish drama that took up so much of my time for so long.  I can only go forward.",1567008897.0,False,5,2,MaudlinEdges,None,cwmysb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/cwmysb/the_eventual_decline_of_chris_and_maud/

6,TMS therapy for BPD?," Hi!

I am 22m, diagnosed with BPD. I have tried so many things, been constantly diagnosed and rediagnosed. I've seen therapists, homeopathic therapists, psychologists, and completed an intensive outpatient therapy program. I have tried CBT, DBT, talk therapy, EMDR, and group therapy. I recently started with a new therapist with a mental health treatment system. My responses during our intake session tagged me as a potential candidate for TMS.

I haven't seen much about TMS for BPD and was hoping to hear from folks who have BPD and tried TMS. I have three therapists right now (two individual and a group facilitator), and have talked to the group facilitator and the new therapist, and they didn't have a lot of info for me. I'm going to talk to the other therapist, who I've been seeing for years, and hear his thoughts, as well as talk to the TMS therapist, but I would really like first-hand accounts if I can get them.",1703880646.0,False,2,10,worthlessinsum,None,18tw66e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18tw66e/tms_therapy_for_bpd/

For me, FP came in the form of someone who could could love like me, absolutely in freedom without fear, no masks, total authenticity. Now that I've healed so much, that's what I've learned I need...and the realization that I can really totally find that in myself is both relieving and heartbreaking. One can only give to others what they can give to themselves. I know I'll be ok. But rn I'm grieving and I have to give myself some space to do it.

8,Just venting- rambling run on sentences- CW - mentions of ineffective behaviors and drugs,"I’m about to be one month without cigarettes after smoking for 10 years, I’m doing EMDR, and I recently stopped taking my seroquel because it was making me too tired. 

I’ve been extremely emotional and moody since coming off of seroquel and I’m super sensitive because of EMDR. 

Since quitting cigarettes I feel like I’m smoking waaaaaay more weed because it gives me something to do. Plus I JUST got my MMJ card so I’m like binging on it all. 

I’m relying way too much on my partner to fill my boredom. 

I’m avoiding packing and I’m moving in two weeks. It’s stressing me out because I’ve only moved from my bedroom at my parents to my dorms and then to this apartment. I have so much more stuff now and it’s overwhelming. 

 I can’t handle my money for shit and idk I won’t have any money to do anything fun for the next two months - my whole vacation (I’m working as close to 40 hours as I can but I’m a teacher so my summer job does not pay as much and I haven’t saved money because as mentioned before, I suck at money) - and it’s really bumming me out. And I’m just freaking out about being able to actually afford the place that I’m moving into. 

Plus the amount of therapy I do is really taking a toll on me. I’ve been in DBT groups on and off for the past few years as well as individual dbt therapy. Now I’m doing EMDR and it’s draining. Especially the day after. So like 3 a appointments a week. It’s the worst. It’s so much harder than I expected. I’ve only processed my first memory like two thirds of the way and i felt so emotional for the following 48 hours and it was supposed to be one of the “less intense” ones. 

I’m just not having a good time. I’m really emotional and really bored and codependent. None of it feels good. I’m having trouble sitting through the discomfort of my life right now.

12,What coping strategies worked for you?,"Hey all, this is my first time posting on reddit so I hope I'm doing this right. Also, just a quick warning for mention of suicide and ED's.

I was around 15/16 when I was first diagnosed with BPD and transferred to a specialist. I've been coping alright since (I am now 18), and l'd thought I improved quite a lot, however as of late l've noticed that l've fallen back into old habits and rather detrimental thought patterns. I've been especially disregulated the past few months, undoubtably provoked by a relapse in my disordered eating. Right now, my emotions have plateaued, and I'm able to think critically about my situation with a clear mind, so I'll use that as an opportunity to reach out and make some progress.

I'm operating under the assumption that my restrictive food intake has been the stressor triggering my states of emotional disfunction, however my ED is a seperate problem that runs so deep that it would be very difficult to just 'stop’. Because I'm not able to remove the trigger, I'm looking for ways to manage the resultant emotional tailspin.

Yesterday was definitely one of the worst yet - my head was clouded with blatantly untrue thoughts about my family and relationships which pushed me further down the pit of self isolation. Despite being in an objectively good place in life, l'd convinced myself there was no future for me and I had nothing to live for. That was probably the closest l'd been to actually going through with my plans to end my life since my last attempt in early 2023. A few hours pass, I listen to some music, and I feel fantastic. Super productive, I'm on top of the world and nobody can stop me. It's exhausting being stuck in this cycle of utter despair and what I can only describe as borderline narcissism. It feels like my brain is split in two, and I just can't seem to get that horrible part of me ur control. It's a constant battle between critical thinking and utter delusion. 

My friends, family and therapists are fantastic, but as bystanders they can only do so much. I have EMDR booked for the end of the year, but in the interim I need to lock in and really commit to my personal development. My question is, does anyone have any coping mechanisms/ self-help that genuinely worked for them? I don't care how niche or odd it may be, I just want some advice that isn't ""read a book"" or ""go on a walk"" - not that these aren't valid control strategies, it's just difficult to convince your mind to go on a walk when you're consumed by hopelessness.

I want to get better. I cannot keep living like this, it's hurting the people I love and corrupting my mind. So, please let me know what helped you. Anything is appreciated.

15,I have sex repulsion that’s been spreading even to being repulsed by romantic relationships after a traumatic breakup,"I was/am deeply in love with my first love. We’ve been broken up for almost a year now. I idealized them so much and they felt like a god to me at times. I’m demisexual so they were the first person I felt comfortably sexual with (all online, we never met in person thankfully) and I really felt like I gave myself to them and I would tell them that. They had a porn addiction and would cheat on me online and hide it from me, which led to huge suicidal breakdowns. I felt really violated and degraded from it but I couldn’t leave them. I have bad jealousy and passiveness issues to begin with and this fueled them, causing intrusive thoughts (I have a lot of pure ocd symptoms) and worsened my sex repulsion so much. They broke up with me but wanted to stay in contact as friends but they led me on that we’d get back together again (not on purpose). Months later I find out they are in their first in person relationship with someone and was hiding it from me bc they were scared of how I’d react bc of my bpd. I blocked them on everything after this. I now have this repulsion/phobia of romantic relationships. It makes me not want to see/talk to people in relationships. It’s just so triggering and causes jealousy and intrusive thoughts of my ex with their current partner. I feel so ashamed and pathetic from this. I feel scared and uncomfortable with people who have sex. I can’t even talk to my current DBT therapist about this partly bc she’s married. I’ve told her about my sex repulsion a bit. I don’t know how to fix this but I hate it and want to think normally. I’m on Prozac and am slowly increasing to 80mg which is the dosage for OCD. I want to try EMDR when I graduate DBT.

16,only medication has helped me (finally),"TW: mention of intense childhood SA



I've been under mental health care since the age of 15. I'm now 30 and nothing in my life has helped me with my BPD except this one medication that I researched about myself because my psychiatrist and doctors never talked about it. 


It's a anticonvulsant medication used off label to treat mood disorders by stabilizing the same area of the brain that overactive that produces seizures aswell as emotional sensitivity. 


I've tried antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos, you name it. Nothing has ever worked. DBT, CBT, EMDR, threapy etc. Nothing works. Not for the amount of trumua I've gone through in my life. My brain is to reactive for threapy. I was abused my intire childhood and possibly into my early teens by my own brother sexually and psyically every day. You have no idea how much that messes someones brain up beyond what threapy could do for me. Along with constant trumatic and abusive events happening to me in my adulthood too. Nothing ever worked. Finally I went on Topiramate. I haven't been on it for very long. But my life has improved vastly! Yes there's some not great side effects especially to start off with, but honestly it's worth it. I no longer feel any intense emotion. None!! But I am also not numb like antidepressants. Honestly everything in my life has changed. It's insane. I see things so differently now and I'm so much healthier that I don't even need threapy anymore. Now I'm not saying it's a be all end all medication, and some people can have really bad reactions to medications and may really not work for them. But I thought it was worth telling you guys about as it may help someone on here atleast. It also aids in weight loss unlike alot of meds. Some people have had weight gain but mostly it's weightloss unlike antipsychotics.

17,Question to those who are recovering from BPD - how long does it take to 'fix' identity issues?,"Hi everyone!

I am 28 (f) and I have been diagnosed with BPD \~2 years ago (I've been in therapy long before, but it was not helpful until I found good DBT therapist).

For 1 year I had a very intensive personal therapy and DBT trainings, finished it 1 year ago (the demand is high that's why my therapist let me go once she admitted I was stable enough), I am still doing exercises, reflecting a lot, and I feel like I am recovering.

Don't take me wrong - BPD is still part of my life, but life is *in order* now.  

Here's the trick - although I managed to gain distress tolerance skills, improved interpersonal communication, managing emotions etc - disturbed identity is something that I can't 'fix' yet.

I keep questioning where's me and where's the disorder, and it seems like the most difficult part of my recovery. This is one of the reasons why I am hesitant about getting into a new romantic relationship - I am scared that because I sometimes don't know what I want/need, this won't be healthy.

I'm starting to suspect that this is something that I cannot force and it will take years of life without BPD turmoil before I start feeling more 'solid'.

18,Some help here.,"

Can anybody help me. I am all alone. I am 31 yo Indian man.I feel stagnant in life. I have never been in a relationship and never will be. 
I have a family that has mental health issues. I got them from age 16. I know no one cares for this too but atleast some might gaze through.
I have no talent. I lived my life fighting what was diagnosed OCD and anxiety in the beginning and now after 15 years passing through psychotic diagnoses, has reached dependent traits hyper vigilant and now I conclude based on years long suffering and self redirections, and recent counseling that involved a psychometric test as a form of bpd known as quiet bpd. Now, before seeing my worthlessness right away for a relationship, I am not harmful like the other bpd types( even though they suffer much more and get no help from society), mine is not evident and hence took so long to find. 
Now, I have no purpose in life no self image, dependent, people pleasing( I hate myself for that, because world is so selfish when I look it through my bpd glasses.)I worked in different domains in a job I got and now I am a jack of all.
I hate myself.
I don't want this life. But I am not suicidal. I just want to walk away. Just avoid the trauma altogether. You know what on top of all this I took an snri a few years ago along with the high dose ssri(prescribed) without asking anyone or consulting, because I felt ( rn I am sure nobody will read it but there is a very small hope a little light, a fantasy rather. It's very painful to recollect it in a way that conveys my situation here).
So I took that snri because I felt so down and afraid of myself and my future as I stayed alone in the apartment and thought atleast I overcome that fear, because somehow I had to complete the integrated mtech that was the only way forward for me. I did all the work I could and somehow got out with some experience and the degree sponsored by the company.
In the end, here is the funny part, the snri complicated my condition. I have this frozen feeling with no emotions. I was in a constant fight or fright mode and it even affected my health. I started feeling zero hope in life. All I could do was sit on a bed and being I don't know just felt empty all the time. Actually I stopped feeling anything, let alone fear. No docs could help. Because I don't know how to relax. I am processing that stressed state in some other way
that I can't let go. I just start to panic when I feel stressed. I tried many relaxation techniques like emdr and eft and all that. I am now using CBD daily and it is helping my psychotic mind as well as slowly I am able to process the stuck energy.

19,Has anyone talked to their DBT therapist about repressed memories of childhood trauma that have suddenly resurfaced?,"I’ve been reading The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk (an excellent book, but one I’d recommend with hesitation), and it’s caused fragments of repressed memories of severe childhood trauma to come to the surface. 

I used to think I didn’t even *have* any trauma, so this has been very unsettling for me. I’ve just been trying to accept that it happened and grieve for myself as the little girl it happened to.

I know I need to talk to my therapist about all of it, but I’ve been putting it off for weeks because my job was so stressful. I wanted to wait until summer break when I had as much time to myself as possible to have a breakdown if it came to that. 

But now it’s summer break, my appointment is tomorrow, and I’m absolutely terrified. I don’t want to talk about it at all with anyone ever. I know that I need to, but the thought is excruciating.

Part of this stems from the fact that I don’t know what will happen. Do DBT therapists usually work with trauma? I think the scariest thing would be if she told me I must be misremembering or trying to victimize myself and that it likely never even happened. (To be clear, I have a wonderful therapist who has never said anything like this to me and has *always* validated how I’m feeling.)

21,Success story: 3 years since I no longer met the criteria for BPD,"**Background:**

Diagnosed with BPD at 19: I would engage in extremely toxic and manipulative behaviours with my boyfriend at the time - spamming his phone if he didn’t reply within one hour, threatening self harm if he wasn’t spending all his spare time with me or felt he would leave me, I would split him every single day, within a matter of hours, no matter how hard he tried to make me happy or “do things right”. 
I was in college but couldn’t keep even a part-time job and failed countless classes because I’d lose motivation and had absolutely no sense of self.
I wanted him to hurt as much as I hurt from all my past unresolved trauma, putting it onto small things he might have misstepped, swinging from being extremely anxious/depressed to explosive anger. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn’t help myself - no emotional regulation, black and white thinking, the works.

When he finally couldn’t take it anymore, I broke down completely and sought professional help where I was diagnosed with BPD. When I first read the symptoms, it was like reading myself on a page. 

**Recovery:**

Recovery took at least 5 years: I had to take a long, hard, brutal look at myself and shared it (embarrassingly) with my psych - identifying my traumas, triggers, behaviours and accepting it. 

I had times (especially in the first 2 years) where I regressed and engaged in undesirable behaviours and would hate myself so much I wanted to die.
The most difficult to manage was my dependency on partners, I feared abandonment more than anything and would lie or threaten self-harm to make them stay. 
But I kept self-compassion, accountability for my actions, and persevered. The frequencies became noticeably less and I used that to keep motivated. 
DBT and CBT worked wonders, especially practicing radical acceptance, wise mind, mindfulness, GIVE, and self-soothing techniques.
I also worked on my trauma through multiple EMDR sessions and counselling sessions at the same time.

3 years ago I was told I no longer met the criteria for BPD. I’m so proud of myself for keeping up with all my improvements (still use the same techniques today).
I’m so much more stable and confident. I have never insulted my husband, breached his privacy, threatened self-harm, spammed messages, tried to control his actions, blew up on him, or shifted blame during the entirety of this 4 year relationship (I had already come so far then) - it’s basic respect, but before therapy this would’ve been impossible for me.

1,'Liking' myself leads to dislike from others leads to disliking myself - How my BPD deals with Facebook,"I’ve spent a lot of the past year thinking about self-love.  That’s a tough concept for me to grasp.   

As a child, I listened to my mom speak glowingly of a professional athlete who wore an ‘I’m #3’ necklace.  As she explained it, God/Jesus was number one, everyone else was number two (as it's better to serve others), and I am number 3.  This was reinforced as a teenager when a pastor gave a series of sermons on the dangers of the ‘self-esteem movement.’  He basically reiterated that we must put ourselves after all others, that self-sacrifice and service were the keys to Jesus’ heart.

Many of my challenges stem from how I think about myself, and self-love seems desirable but also alien.  Self-care I can get behind and understand, and I work more towards self-tolerance, self-support, and self-sufficiency (and I see I have so much yet to learn).

I crave love, demonstrations of love, affirmation, validation, praise and respect.  I would imagine most people like these, probably most people want more of these in their life.  However, these are not things it is ok to ask for – or at least it feels really weird to ask for them.  Even reaching out timidly and indirectly on social media to ask for affirmation or validation has resulted in expressions of disappointment or even disgust for ‘attention-seeking’ or being dramatic.

Even in those times in my life where I felt more surrounded by love and support, these same expressions of affirmation and validation did not always come in forms I immediately understood and accepted.  Additionally, my internal dialogue was quite skilled and explaining those things away.

I think that this confusing situation in which we cannot ask for these things leads to unspoken expectations and ‘should’ thinking – and that is actually natural, of course deep inside we know how we want to be loved.  We are just not allowed to ask for that.  Its seen as weird, needy, dramatic, and awkward – and the unspoken suggestion is that we should each be able to find these things within ourselves, or that the people who are admirable never ask for affirmation and love.

Recently I noticed that someone I follow on Instagram was ALWAYS the first person to like her own posts – makes sense!  Those algorithms are based on the number of clicks or hearts or little blue thumbs, so why wouldn’t you like your own post?

So out of this came a revelation – Could this also be a step towards self-like and self-love?  Obviously I agree with what I post, would my own ‘liking’ it give me any boost of affirmation?  So I posted one line – ‘Normalize ‘liking’ your own posts.’  Then I ‘liked’ my own post.

Several people went on to ‘like’ the post as well, a couple ‘loved’ the post.  One commentor supported the idea, and shared their experience when someone disagreed with them on the same idea.  

A few people had different opinions, both publicly and in private chats. Someone felt it was weird, someone else felt it was wrong, and another expressed disgust.

My first reactions were anger, and disappointment – were these not my friends? Did their mom not tell them as mine did ‘if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all?’  Were they never taught not to ‘yuck another person’s yum?’ 

Then I remembered two important things.  The first was that this is social media… people do not behave online the way they do face to face; and social media can make you feel you MUST share a response especially if it is dissenting.

The other thing I remembered was the 4th grade class election.  I do not even remember what it was for – class president or some sort of ceremonial situation to teach kids about voting etc.  But I do remember I was new to the school at that age and I saw that this was about popularity – and I wanted to be popular. (I was not. What new kid ever is?). What I understood was – the person with the most votes won.  As everyone was about to vote, the teacher reminded the 5-6 of us that had been nominated or had nominated ourselves that we were NOT to vote for ourselves!  The proper, sportsmanlike thing to do was to vote for an opponent.

This confused me then and still does now.  But I imagine I was not the only one who was taught in this way.

I have long understood that for whatever reason, it is not ok to ask another for expressions of love, affection, validation, support or respect.  I’d guess there are some who would see this as weak.

And yet, even though we are each of us ultimately alone – in our heads, in those dark 3am regret reflections, as we face our mortality – it is also not ok in many people’s eyes to demonstrate self-love or self-support… at least on social media.

My takeaway?  My own self-tolerance journey will likely be improved by less social media interactions.",1620902703.0,False,15,4,IraJohnson,None,nbdqjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/nbdqjx/liking_myself_leads_to_dislike_from_others_leads/
2,having bpd is the equivalent to having third degree burns all over your body,"long ass vent for myself tbh

""Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement""

Marsha linehan who developed the therapy method DBT said that about people who suffer from borderline.

It quite literally produces the most intense emotional pain of any mental illness, it has a fatality rate of 10% 45 times more than the general population. 

According to Linehan we lose all cognitive functioning during periods of extreme emotional distress which unfortunately for BPD can happen at the drop of a feather. 

Personally for me it used to be a raging burning feeling in my head. Where I couldnt hear the rational part of my brain telling me you love this person, this isn't you, you don't want to do this, it's not a big deal. The voice in the back of my head that shuts that shit down immediately now was practically silenced. I couldnt hear them no matter how much I tried. Or if I actually managed to hear them and gripped onto it to bring myself back; I would just spiral and fall right back into the pit anyways. Because I had never even started the true healing process. And because the person I was with fed the worst parts of my fears and insecurities. My brain was completely consumed with so much of that hurt/fear/insecurity/humilation and it turned to a unceasing completely blinding rage. I would fall back in again and again desperately clawing to get out but succumbing each time to the borderline insanity that involuntarily manifested in my brain. 

My most painful moments of BPD haunt me every day. The absolute loss of control I used to feel over the smallest most stupid things. Scream crying alone in my room again and again, feeling the extreme grief equivalent to all my loved ones being murdered in front of me repeatedly over a simple relationship ending, its literally hell on fucking earth. Right now my dog who I love more than anything (outside of my FP) even more than myself, could be murdered right in front of me and I still know it wouldn't even compare to what I felt in every moment of the nightmare that was my existence at the time. 

I remember thinking in those moments of absolute mania and panic that this was anguish beyond belief, nothing had ever compared or ever could. Not even the extreme torture and abuse from my childhood. And I got brushed off and told it wasn't nearly THAT bad and it just feels that way because I'm still so close to it. No way could the emotional pain ever match the insanity of what my step mum put me through. As if I wasn't the one who had to deal with and then overcome the unceasing years and years of nightmares, flashbacks and constant panic attacks. As if I don't remember how acute that particular pain is. 

Well it's been over a year now and my extreme physical pain experiences will never ever fucking compare to the absolute torture of those moments. I would go through the worst of the worst all again than feel even a moment of that. When I tell people that they really can't believe me. They hear what happened to me in childhood and then what my ex did to me and it's not even comparable to them. How could I even for a second say she hurt me more? 

People without BPD literally cannot even comprehend how painful and intense our emotions can get. How everything is dialled up to a billion and we have NO control over it. I truly believe the vast vast majority of them (even ones who have been seriously hurt) have never felt the amount of agony that BPD people (involuntarily) create in their own heads. I believe that, because I've been through extreme verbal sexual and physical abuse and it was nothing to how my brain blindsided and ambushed me when I got my first FP. I understand why it doesn't make sense to them they will never understand what we have to live with and go through every day just by existing. But for me personally no amount of my sexual trauma or physical torture will ever compare to the pain of just being with a favourite person who showed me my first experiences of ""love"", made me feel joy for the first time in my life and then had to leave me, moved on and no longer cared for me at all anymore. (Actually was actively out for my blood in my situation 😐) Especially when you only live for the people you love in the first place. They are your entire centre of existence. In your head it's absolutely inconceivable you could ever not dedicate every part of yourself to them. What do you do then...

Fortunately for me I healed. Back then, with the person I was with, my body did really feel like an exposed wound at all times. Any little thing could set it off and cause me extreme pain. She couldn't understand how much pain I was in because I was cursed to manifest it as anger. Of course that makes it hard to empathise with especially when you become a victim of abuse as a result. I truly couldn't control it, I didn't realise this at the time but she constantly unintentionally kept me in a state of fear of abandonment and continuously enforced insecurities surrounding my body and who I even am as a person. Every little thing would set me off subconsciously, it would effect my emotions and actions in ways I couldn't control or many times even notice. Because my feelings were constantly being hurt by her, constantly felt devestation bubbling under the surace because no one meant more to me, no one's effect on my emotions even came close. So sometimes it was overt and drastic. I truly could not understand my extreme reaction to something so stupid after. That wasn't me. No part of that was me I know now deep down to my core my need for control completely came from fear. I was 100x more sensitive, everything was so agonising all the time without me even realising. And unfortunately that led me to take it out on them which kept me in a constant state of shame and regret that I had to push down as well.

Throughout my childhood my brain learned that fight, not flight would save me. The only time the torture stopped was when I hurt them back. So when I feel pain or hurt or anything that destabilizes me; especially from the person who had grounded me the most and had once made me feel the safest and most loved when no one else has before. I became theirs. I quite literally belonged to them, I didn't even realise how miserable I was. Once they showed me that side to life I couldn't let go. I relied on them entirely for any sense of safety and comfort or happiness so subconsciously when they took that away from me my brain ""defends"" itself without my fucking permission. It haunts me that the people I loved the most I used to hurt the most. I wish it could have been anyone else than the people I care for so deeply. As much as I wish I internalized that pain...I couldn't, I really really fucking couldnt at the time. So I lashed out, again and again and again uncontrollably until she thankfully left me and I got to find someone I could actually have my skin and a true sense of safety with for the first time in my life. 

Immense healing happened so rapidly. She immediately made me feel secure in my body, and satisfied in general within the first few weeks, which gave me a huge boost of self esteem and motivation to actually practice self care and improve myself. I mean if she could find me beautiful this fucking girl then I gotta try. I had to actually be worthy of her. I will never let myself be unworthy again. I needed to stop being a depressed potato and actually be my best self. Be Bucky in a sense. Also she seemed so attracted to me, so into me and even my body. She saw something I never could I wanted to see myself for the first time through her eyes. See myself as beautiful. 

She gave me hope, actually hope I could be better and change everything. Undo all the excessive damage that was done to my brain. Figure out all the different personalities rattling around in there and learn to listen and focus on the ones that are actually me. Not manifested from the darkest, traumatised, survival mode parts of myself. I realised I had so many layers, so many different thought processes going on at once. Of course it led to instability. I needed to silence them... I started DBT. I grinded in therapy twice a week. I consistently took my Lamictal and started Vyvanse to help with the head buzzing. Worked full time while in school to afford the insurance. Let out my emotions through working with animals and working out. I felt satisfication with myself every day, not even exhausted cause atleast now I was trying. I was accomplishing something. Every day learning new things about myself and taking steps forward. I discovered crazy things about myself in therapy (not necessarily always fun stuff) but it opened my mind so much to hopefully bring out the best version of me. 



One of my most intense triggers was retroactive jealousy. It tormented me constantly in my last relationship it was one of the first big leaps to destroying it and continued to break it down further throughout. Every tiny thing used to set me off and make me feel incredibly insecure. It's hard to describe what it felt like it's been so long since I felt anything even similar and it wasn't quite as overwhelming as the black out split rages. So not as potent a memory for me. But it was a mix of masochism and deep deep insecurity and hatred of myself compared to CIS men, which led to rages and spiralling. I would make her confirm my worst fears again and again maybe just to hurt myself, maybe in desperate attempt to make it okay in my head. It was mental self harm and I didn't realise that. RAJ was completely new to me (in fact I didn't even know every through out what was really going on) and it absolutely blindsided me. After that I didn't even know how to deal with it, I didn't know where to begin. I don't think I even possibly could have with the person I was with. I could never have gotten to a point with them where I believed in myself, or didn't constantly hate myself, and wasnt stuck in perpetual loop of survival mode with.

I thought I experienced RAJ with her because she was my first FP but with my current FP I could prod myself all day and feel absolutely nothing. Not a shred of hurt or insecurity. She healed me so much by just making me feel unconditionally loved for the first time in my life. Physically being with her is incredibly important it's my #1 love language and she has built up my view of my body to heights I would have never imagined. We are so fucking intensely intimate all the time it's crazy (it's the bpd in us) Who else could fucking matter we are each other's universes. I know that I'm her world and no one else, even a CIS man could compare. (Seriously though retroactive jealousy as a transman dating a straight girl is the worst and made me act like a completely different person Jesus Christ) I know I don't have to feel jealous because every fucking day she shows me that. I don't feel completely disconnected and isolated from her. I'm so god damn lucky, she gives me such a sense of peace and fullfillment. I tricked myself into thinking my last relationship was anything close to love or feeling real love...when I don't feel that constant turmoil and instability, when I actually feel like enough, when I'm grounded in who I am and feel safe and secure with who I'm with; it's so so so much easier. Everything felt so out of control when my head was constantly scared and in defence mode with them. Constantly needing to win arguments because admitting I'm wrong takes vulnerability which I could not show to her. So easy to admit I'm wrong to my current partner and to just drop any disagreement because I feel subconsciously safe enough to give up all power to her anytime. Plus my current partner having BPD unlike my ex; she actually can understand the insane amount of pain we can feel over the smallest things. How it compares to nothing else. How out of that pain we can say and do things that aren't any part of us at all. She doesn't just write it off because its so extreme and irrational. We both can have so much empathy and understanding for each other and it's so peaceful. Never taking an us VS them mentality. Feeling like you're always on the same team with your partner. Constantly growing, learning and healing together. We don't argue at all because before it can even escalate we have already focused on listening and validating the other person in their concern and come to a conclusion together that works.

Along those lines she also helped me discover my severe sexual abuse, healed my ""partners family hating me trauma"" that I've experienced throughout the years for many different reasons, affirmed me constantly in every aspect of my body that used to destroy me, rekindled my relationship with my mum an old shame of mine. Basically pushed the kind, strong, grounded side of me to the surface with her unceasing support, and given me a first look at a stable normal happy healthy life. (god damn the way she went all out at Christmas for me, healed something deep to my little kid core) She was my first hope. Hope that we can actually achieve the dream future I've always pictured; become the person I always dreamed of. First real reason to have any ambition or to give a shit in life where my brain before was just in a dead end slump of hopelessness.

BPD is a fucking curse. But with the right support system and enough effort/ dedication it can actually be manageable. Life is so much easier when I can practice emotional regulation and actually grow my emotional skin for the first time. It may have been stripped from me as a kid but I know love, time, dedication and resources can heal me fully one day. I may always be a loaded gun because of what happened to me, and I've always struggled before to keep my finger off the trigger. But not anymore with the right toolset I'm going to destroy that trigger entirely.

6,Some help here.,"

Can anybody help me. I am all alone. I am 31 yo Indian man.I feel stagnant in life. I have never been in a relationship and never will be. 
I have a family that has mental health issues. I got them from age 16. I know no one cares for this too but atleast some might gaze through.
I have no talent. I lived my life fighting what was diagnosed OCD and anxiety in the beginning and now after 15 years passing through psychotic diagnoses, has reached dependent traits hyper vigilant and now I conclude based on years long suffering and self redirections, and recent counseling that involved a psychometric test as a form of bpd known as quiet bpd. Now, before seeing my worthlessness right away for a relationship, I am not harmful like the other bpd types( even though they suffer much more and get no help from society), mine is not evident and hence took so long to find. 
Now, I have no purpose in life no self image, dependent, people pleasing( I hate myself for that, because world is so selfish when I look it through my bpd glasses.)I worked in different domains in a job I got and now I am a jack of all.
I hate myself.
I don't want this life. But I am not suicidal. I just want to walk away. Just avoid the trauma altogether. You know what on top of all this I took an snri a few years ago along with the high dose ssri(prescribed) without asking anyone or consulting, because I felt ( rn I am sure nobody will read it but there is a very small hope a little light, a fantasy rather. It's very painful to recollect it in a way that conveys my situation here).
So I took that snri because I felt so down and afraid of myself and my future as I stayed alone in the apartment and thought atleast I overcome that fear, because somehow I had to complete the integrated mtech that was the only way forward for me. I did all the work I could and somehow got out with some experience and the degree sponsored by the company.
In the end, here is the funny part, the snri complicated my condition. I have this frozen feeling with no emotions. I was in a constant fight or fright mode and it even affected my health. I started feeling zero hope in life. All I could do was sit on a bed and being I don't know just felt empty all the time. Actually I stopped feeling anything, let alone fear. No docs could help. Because I don't know how to relax. I am processing that stressed state in some other way
that I can't let go. I just start to panic when I feel stressed. I tried many relaxation techniques like emdr and eft and all that. I am now using CBD daily and it is helping my psychotic mind as well as slowly I am able to process the stuck energy.

7,There is hope.,"I have no formal diagnosis but I firmly believe that I once had BPD. I used fit the criteria to a T. I'm writing this in hope that I can help others, give others hope and maybe inspire some of you. 

First, background, as it's all relevant. 

I had an unstable childhood, lots of trauma and abuse. I was thrown out at 15 and had to pretty much fend for myself. From the ages of 15 to 27 I lived a hugely chaotic life, moving from place to place and unable to hold down a job, relationship or anything meaningful. 
I was abusive in all my previous relationships, never physical, but emotional. I would lash out at the most minor inconvenience, I was angry and aggressive and I create an environment whereby all those around me felt as though they were walking on eggshells. I had the most poisonous tongue known to man and I'd hit people exactly where I knew it would hurt. I was never satisfied. I always wanted and expected far too much from those around me and when I felt I hadn't gotten what I deserve, I would attack with words and empty threats. I would threaten partners with leaving them. I would tell partners they were meaningless to me, I'd tell them I didn't love them, nor did I want them around. I would cause arguments with people literally every day of my life. I would ruin outings and social events. I used suicide as a threat and as a means of control. I don't believe, during these years, I had the mental capacity, or genuine desire to better my behaviour. Luckily for me I have a fantastic group of friends who have stood by me, regardless of all my faults, and regardless of pain I have caused them. 

Fast forward to my 26th year and I decided I needed to change. For me, there was no big event that led to this, it was a decision I made based on how I felt my life and relationships would turn out if I continued as I was. I wanted to be a better person and rectify my wrongdoings as much as is possible. I began reading self-help books and researched BPD. I was later diagnosed with ADHD, severe depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Eventually, after months of trying medicines, I was put on Venlafaxine. This was both a blessing and a curse. My moods became stable, I had better emotional regulation and I had no desire to hurt those around me, no matter how upset I became. Alas, this came with conditions: My sex drive is constantly low and I have to actively work on this, although able to understand emotion, I feel very little emotion and my passion for life and my previous interests has dissipated. It's a sacrifice I choose to make because I want to be a good person.
Since taking meds I have invested countless hours reading and educating myself on neuropsychology, BPD, trauma, neuroplasticity, anything I felt may help me to better understand my behaviours, and various literature, both academic and otherwise, regarding changing responses and behaviours. 

It's been a long road and it isn't over. I still slip up every now and again but I am so much healthier and better able to handle emotional situations. I am emotionally available, discussing feelings and thoughts with those in my life. I take my meds as I am supposed to. I rarely react with anger. I ask others opinions before I respond, so as to guage whether or not my feelings/reactions are in line with the situation. I NEVER call anyone names in malice. I listen before I jump to conclusions and I try to think with logic and reason at all times. I am now an asset to the people around me. 

I attribute my progress to a few things; education and understanding my conditions, discussing, with everyone in my life, all the negative things I had done and taking ownership of the damage I caused... This was paramount; taking Venlafaxine, for me this is a wonder drug, although please bear in mind that what works for one of us may not work for you; and taking LSD in a therapeutic environment, engineered for self reflection. 

I wanted to change so very much that I actively make it happen. It was my decisions alone that have led me to recovery and I cannot stress enough that recovery is only accessible to those who see the damage they cause, see the hurt and chaos, and then act alone (without need for encouragement from others) to better themselves. 

I still need therapy and I will continue to work on my flaws. I may have to do this for the duration of my life. I still suffer with the invasive thoughts. The evil remarks and hurtful comments still enter my head, but now I can observe these thoughts and I choose to act with compassion and understanding over anger and frustration. There is a better way. 

TL;DR Was an ar*sehole, sought meds and education. Now much better for it. LSD for a mind reset and discussions with everyone in my life led me to take ownership of my behaviours. Not an ar*sehole anymore.",1583850127.0,False,10,13,kitamajita,None,fgek26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/fgek26/there_is_hope/
8,BPDlovedones…helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I’m talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It’s all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that’s for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don’t really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I’m sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally. I feel like I’m trapped in the mind of a five year old as well trapped in the mind of 1000 year old person. I feel like I’ve lived 1000 lives and sometimes I’m not sure what’s real, what’s a delusion, and what is fact. This is why I love neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. It gives me explanations for why I am experiencing an emotion, why I am reacting to it, and to just remind myself that it’s not that big of a deal. I don’t want to make excuses for people who cannot take accountability of their actions however. I used to do that and thinking about it makes me ashamed. My mother has BPD and is closing in on 50. I have only repaired my relationship with her this year out of pity after cutting her off just as other people did. I understand how she does not see how her actions affect people, and that’s why the mental illness makes relationships difficult. She seems to think that she raised me perfectly fine even though sometimes I didn’t have food and we were homeless at one point and she constantly screamed in my face and hit me. She never hugged me. She never told me she loved me. I never felt like she was my mother. I don’t have a father. I don’t have siblings. I don’t have aunts and uncles. I grew up extremely lonely and the thing I struggle with the most as an adult is abandonment. I think I fear the way I felt as a child. I have had the thought “it will never get better” for as long as I can remember. And now I look around at the life I have created. With the person who I think is the love of my life, my wonderful friends and support systems, my education in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience, my ability to travel to different countries, and ability to have my own things. And yet there’s still a sense of chaos in my life and nothing can ever be stable. Am I doomed to live this way forever? All I want to do is fix this. And I don’t even know what “this” is. I fully support psychoactive compound therapy. From my readings of academic literature, and personal experiences, I think building neuroplasticity through psychoactive treatment is a key component to mental health rehabilitation. You obviously can’t just give people psychedelics and say go crazy—it needs to be monitored, and patients need directed therapy while they are experiencing altered states of consciousness. Becoming extremely emotional, and vulnerable has caused me so much grief, but has allowed me to discover so much about life and help me build extremely close personal relationships with people so I can learn more and give back to the field of neuropsychopharmacology.",1692082128.0,False,15,10,pthevslayer,None,15rku5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15rku5z/bpdlovedoneshelpful_or_harmful_idk_who_cares/
9,About to embark on a 32 week DBT/Therapy program - spaces available in the group DBT sessions,"I am about to bite the bullet and begin a course of therapy and DBT training.  It’s going to send me into debt, but I’ve been in debt before and never for anything this valuable.

After searching online, I have found a licensed professional counselor and psychologist who is trained and experienced in working with pwBPD and in facilitating DBT Skills training sessions.

This therapist has a solid track record and (like Linehan) does not suggest medication – and very importantly to me, does not suggest facing or exploring traumas during this program.  This appeals to me.

I am in Asia, so I have been looking all over.  This counselor is based in the UK – and recommends a 32 week program – two sessions a week. One session each week will be group DBT Skills training, and the other will be 1 on 1 sessions exploring and applying the DBT training.

Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 2 (8 weeks) 	emotion regulation
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 3 (8 weeks)	interpersonal effectiveness
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness
Module 4 (8 weeks)	distress tolerance
Module 1 (2 weeks)	mindfulness

What is really tough for me is the cost – the session cost is 95GBP per session.  However, they would pro-rata this rate for the group DBT sessions – 95 divided by the number of participants.  That appeals to me because I learn very well in a group, and the pwBPD support group I take part in has been very valuable to me.

They are currently reaching out to colleagues to learn if there are others being treated who would like to be part of DBT Skills training and therapy.  So I want to share that opportunity here.

I recognize it is expensive.  I am fortunate enough that a close friend has seen how I suffered in the past 18 months and is lending me the money – it will take me quite a while to pay it back but its so much more important than anything I ever went into debt for.   It is also a solid commitment – they require we sign a contract  to commit to the program.

While it might not be for everyone here, I thought it might be worthwhile to present it to see who in this subreddit is interested.  I am eager to get started, to finally take a step I have never done and commit to 8 months of difficult weekly work.  It would certainly make it easier if the group sessions had 3-5 people, and not only me or me and one other.

IF you are interested, feel you can manage the cost (with a group session reduction as indicated), and want to know more; PM me.  I am happy to share the therapists profile and answer what I can, and connect you with them if you want to know more – they offer a free consultation session to help you decide if its right for you.

Thanks everyone, and please pardon if this is a weird thing to post… I am mainly trying to get started on healing myself.",1621955276.0,False,21,6,IraJohnson,None,nkry8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/nkry8m/about_to_embark_on_a_32_week_dbttherapy_program/

4,BPDlovedones…helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I’m talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It’s all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that’s for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don’t really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I’m sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally.

5,(TW: Suicidal thoughts),"You can't talk about suicide. You just can't. 

I don't want to live. I've been dealing with the emotional pain (and literal physical pain and discomfort because of the emotional pain) for the better part of a year. My wife left me after 10 years together. She now is back in our old city, has been dating for months and is allegedly 'serious' about someone. 

I can't fall asleep because of the memories of all my awful monstrous behavior. When I do sleep, I wake up and am somehow shocked to discover I'm alone. This is every morning for the last 8 months. 

I've moved three times to try to reboot myself. But it's the same pain every day and it occupies my mind most of the day. I don't know how anyone cries this much. 

2 good friends who know of my diagnosis try to be encouraging. They push me saying things are better, don't think about it, focus on other things. Fellow pwBPD who I respect are understanding and (like my friends) tell me I'm not alone. All these people live in other countries. 

I am alone. I live alone in a small town in a country not my own where I don't speak the language. When these well meaning folks say helpful things; they will shortly put down their phone and live their own lives. 

I don't have and can't afford insurance. Because I'm American, insurance is more expensive for me than any other nationality; and therapists and psychiatrists who are from the English speaking world are exorbitantly expensive.  I no longer take medication because I had to make the choice between rent/food and the hit-or-miss prescription-happy behavior of the medical school psychiatrists I could once afford. 

I want to end my life. I'm told things will get better but they haven't for over 8 months and I see no relief ahead. I'm over 50, I had a great life for several years with her, so I've gotten more than many people do. Now my life is just crying, having the same sad conversations with the same 5 people who must be sick and tired of my same song over and over. 

I want to end my life and this pain.  I'm not allowed to talk about this and neither are you. Forums like this require trigger warnings, reddit has ONE subreddit called 'suicidewatch' which basically represents the entire fucking world's programmed reaction to anyone voicing any thoughts of suicide- stop listening, get that person safe at all costs. Great intentions; but for a person like me it means people share hotlines or videos or articles then go back to their day and forget it all. 

There's only one reason I don't just end my life- the mess that leaves behind. Someone (likely someones who have no idea of my actual situation) would have to deal with my body, the cleanup, Communication with authorities and those few who care about me- and the trauma they would endure. 

But every day it gets harder and harder. Reading books like REASONS TO STAY ALIVE or the hokey elementary condescension of DBT workbooks turn me off and make it worse.  

There's a growing open minded conversation regarding self euthanasia and 'right to die,' but these are centered around people with cancer, terminal physiological illnesses, chronic pain, etc. But hey not me, not pwBPD, we can chin up and buck up and think of other things because our pain is not only less valid- to many it's not even real!! 

I don't know what I want from this post. All I know is I'm focusing a lot of energy on researching painless, inexpensive, and low impact suicide methods. I even looked into ways that would leave no mess, no body- for all intents and purposes I'd just have 'disappeared.' 

And we all know the truth- a few people would be hurt by my disappearance but not many and not for long, because they're loved by people who are physically present. They'll move on and I'll be just a memory. I don't really matter that much. 

My ex is not a good person, I've come to learn; or has drastically changed. Yet I still make sure enough of my income is routed to a bank in her city under her name so she can be ok. I love her still and I know I'd she wanted to be together again I'd crumble and submit to anything she asked. Even though that's a fantasy I know it wouldn't work out. 

But if I died- lets say in a true accident- there's loads of benefits for her and others. She'd inherit our small company and my reputation, I'd become a mascot for our company and organization, she would get the support and sympathy of a widow and be truly free of me so she can be with her new someone freely, and my close friends wouldn't have to bear my daily sadness-by-text. 

I'm so tired. The idea of this as my future is not something I can face anymore. I see no brightness ahead- the only thing I see for sure is another 6-8 months of this life and I do not see any light at the end of that tunnel. 

I once had a life I thought I was dissatisfied with. But now I see it was ambition and drive for more that blinded me to the happiness i had before me. 

I have moments when I think ok, I feel a bit stable- but so far these periods of time are never longer than a few hours. 

Today I won't try to take my life. But it's harder every day and suicide is tempting. 

I hope society can normalize talking about death, suicide, and mental/emotional challenges without judgment (and knee jerk reactions of medication, institutionalization etc ARE judgmental).  Maybe if there was a way to openly discuss these feelings without fear of being treated like that, and without fear of the conversation hurting others who suffer, then maybe people like me could find some answer. 

I think that answer is normalizing suicide. A structure that provides non judgmental realistic exploration of the potential reasons to die or not die; allowing the suicidal person the opportunity to make a truly informed choice. 

I know I'm posting this in reddit. I know there are no safe subreddits. I'm preparing myself for the trolls... or maybe I'm hoping their cruelty will motivate me to stop being a fucking coward and just end it. 

I wish I didn't feel this way and instead could offer genuine support to others suffering here. Instead I'm just taking up too much space- look at how much I've written now already, demanding attention. I'm disgusted with myself. 

I guess that's my rant. If you read this far thank you, and I'm sorry if it was hurtful or unpleasant in any way.",1615514627.0,False,26,11,IraJohnson,None,m36wo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/m36wo2/tw_suicidal_thoughts/

1,Skills for dealing with intense emotion,"I posted this in the regular BPD sub but had zero responses and I'm feeling desperate and alone. I'm hoping that I'll have more luck here. The situation: I'm in my second week of inpatient ED treatment and I've never felt so emotionally disregulated IN. MY. LIFE.

I have (quiet) BPD, and my emotions are UNBEARABLE lately, especially since I don't have access to my unhealthy coping mechanisms (food restriction, substance abuse and self-harm) OR a one-on-one therapist. I just feel like I'm going to go nuts if I don't figure out skills that actually help. They're not teaching us formal DBT (the handouts are ""inspired by"" Linehan's DBT sheets) and this isn't going to change so I need to find some alternatives. My biggest struggle rn is whether I'm ""sick enough"" or that things were ""serious enough"" to warrant me being here, and I've been looking up narrative therapy because I'm a writer and feel like this could help give me perspective. Does anyone have experience with this? Or can link me to some reliable resources? Are there any other skills other than TIP and accepts?

On top of all this my mum's been sending me nasty texts about how I'm not trying hard enough, that taking PRNs like Ativan and Seroquel are a cop out and that I have skills and that I'm ""choosing"" not to use them. I just feel so invalidated by her and the psychiatrist I deal with here is gaslighting. I won't even go in to what he's said to me but ultimately I need to learn how to validate myself and not depend on others for that validation. Any tips on how I can learn this? I'm so desperate, I'm ready to drop out of this program if things don't get better... they won't take my intense emotions seriously and I suspect they're stigmatizing due to the BPD diagnosis, but I have no proof of that and I don't want to play the victim so take that with a grain of salt.

2,What medications worked for your symptoms?,"I'm having a very bad ""flare up"" so to say of my borderline lately. It's not like I've been happy or very stable before but thought I was doing better the last year in terms of acting out in unhealthy ways or being super anxious. However, my worst trigger: rejection and abandonment are tearing me apart right now due to a possible break up. I'm acting out destructively, am in enormous pain 24/7 and feel suicidal, absolutely sick and broken and unloveable. 

  
I've been on lots of SSRI's and SNRI's over the years, most of them stopped pretty quickly due to side effects, others I've taken for about a year but didn't really work.

0,Meds that work?,"Has anyone found any meds that work? I was on Zoloft and it went pretty badly for me.

1,I don't know what to do with this realization.,"  If I sit still for more than a little while, my mind starts to fantasize suicide and self harm for all the perceived wrongs I've done. I become filled with hopelessness and desperation. So I clean, I can't sit still. I must distract myself. I work until my back locks up (I have a herniated disc) and then I sit until the spasms stop, then I have to go again or I will start wanting to harm myself. The next day, I will wake up and be angry at myself for being in pain from pushing myself so hard, then I become despondent at my inability to distract myself, so I push through the pain. This lasts about 4 days then I give up, I lose myself in a game or watching videos, falling deeper into self loathing until I melt-down. I spend a day in complete mental crisis, suicidal ideation and self destructive thoughts, affecting those around me, lost in my own head. The next day I am renewed and must do things to keep myself from falling down again. It feels endless.


UPDATE: A lot of what I was experiencing, as it turned out, was caregiver burnout. My husband passed in his sleep on Saturday, 4/24/21 and the weight of worry had become overwhelming. I didn't realize the constant stress I was experiencing just from the worry that he was dying. Now, no more pain for him, no more breathing treatments, no more making him eat. I love him always, but I think he knew it was slowly killing me with him, to watch him in the process of dying for so many years. I'm grateful beyond words for his limitless love.",1617171396.0,False,9,6,loriann14,None,mgznrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/mgznrz/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_this_realization/

I’m so tired Of fighting with this disorder yall. It’s literally ruining my life with the mood swings. I’m from Florida and I just got out of a year long relationship where my mood swings, hyper reactivity, and abandonment perceptions where a huge rift between us. She is such a sweet girl, I was lucky to have her as long as I did. She put up with so much man. She just had her fill of it and I can’t blame her. I am tired of it too, and I try so hard. It’s like every time I take a step forward I go back 3. It’s really frustrating and upsetting. I can’t talk to any of my friends about it because it’s hard to articulate what I’m feeling. It’s like a million emotions you want to describe but you can’t. I finally am getting back up with counseling as well as restarting my antidepressant and buspar. I want the change for myself. I’m tired of this disorder ruining my life. I feel so alone, my mom passed away in January 2020 and she was my confident. When I lost her I lost that so I hold it all in, and tbh I’m not dealing with her death well at all. I just want to be different. I want to prove those who say im incapable of change wrong",1613433608.0,False,15,8,traytray19900524,None,lkqss6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/lkqss6/fed_up_with_bpd/
