1,1,i felt the same when reading the symptoms of it im not diagnosed currently being treated as complex ptsd but so many of the important symptoms seem overlapped have you struggled being able to recognize what youre feeling and never seem to be able to communicate it leading to constantly feeling misunderstoodmy only worry about this being another wrong turn for me is that i dont seem to experience anger havent for years but i think i may have just masked and muted it for years i was an angry teen but as i grew im athletic build though far from athletic anymore lol i feared scaring people and i do feel i have a kind heart that i began directing it inward then shutting it out almost entirely or possibly burned out by a serious relationship with my ex who had typical bpd but i noticed my anger does seep through when journalingwriting sorry just started to see the possibility of quiet bpd being behind my struggles so head is all over the place i hope the diagnosis has brought you some relief just in itself from finally having an answer to why youve felt so out of placebroken and are able to get the right treatment to help you reclaim your life,Standard-Holiday-486,ea6i4a

7,7,im as well first im glad that you finally have some answers and still exhibit such an admirable mindset after what im sure hasnt been an easy journey i was wondering if you had spent most of your life being diagnosed seemingly everything in the dsm and wondering why none of the treatments seem to ever really fix anythingand also wanted to ask how your treatment has been going and have you noticed much of a positive impact in your life also i guess what the approach theyve taken has been for therapyi worry that even if i find the answers ive spent half my life looking for guess im afraid of how much of a difference it can make in terms of quality of life going forward i was engaged but that fell apart a couple years ago im still recovering from that so id basically be restarting my life if i ever figure out why im broken but guess im afraid that so much of my life has passed me by and dont have to show for it and nothing much from to build uponi realize your situation may be entirely different but that and just diagnosed jumped out at me so was wondering how its made a difference for you,Standard-Holiday-486,ea6i4a

11,0,hard to love is good this is about quiet bpd but about men with quiet bpd,joachjoach,huocc3
12,1,wwweggshelltherapycom,sensitive_15,huocc3
13,2,i am currently undiagnosed but feel is a comfortable fit,badimitation,huocc3
14,3,i dont have a suggestion but following in case there is one everything is so focused on acutecrisis recently diagnosed classic rage borderline im yrs into recovery that type of literature is not helpful and doesnt even come close to representing where im at and how i presentand as a side not i hate you dont leave me is one of the worst its so nasty about us painting us as intentionally manipulative and just plain awful my parents bought it when i was diagnosed around i didnt read it until about thats when i realized thats why they accused me of just trying to constantly manipulate them i love my parents we have a good relationship now but at the end of the day they are the reason i have bpd they have absolutely no awareness of this thats okay they dont need to for me to heal i would guess that at least one of the authors of this book has a bpd child and was hopefully unintentionally deflecting blame about their part in causing it,myholelove,huocc3
15,4,its quite difficult to find books but ive found a youtube resource in dr ramanis work as well as the collaborations she works with on medcircle both are youtube channels that i have found very informative,Original_Average_882,huocc3
16,5,i hate you dont leave me,Several_Ad4656,huocc3
17,6,the metaphor of play disruption and restoration of the borderline experience and intimacy and alienation memory trauma and personal being both by russell mearesedit ive only read the first one so far written by a psychiatrist but the language is accessible and in my opinion a must read for anyone interested in understanding bpd,Wide-Lavishness-6591,huocc3
18,7,thank you,miss80five,huocc3
19,8,very helpful resource there,brittanyssadagain,huocc3
20,9,okay thank you so much for this i was headed in thinking that my husband has quiet bpd but reading this i see theyre often misdiagnosed as that i will read through this site very helpful,mishael53,huocc3
21,10,shes great,Then-Examination-649,huocc3
22,11,oh dear i didnt realize that book was so accusatory i just hear it recommended does the author even have bpd,JellyfishinaSkirt,huocc3
23,12,thats a terrible experience and like you say adds a lot of shame where are you based i think in the uk they wont diagnose bpd until although im not sure why if it means early access to treatment,Entrance-Public,huocc3
24,13,thanks,sensitive_15,huocc3

27,0,holy shit i could have written this myself i cant tell you how many times ive had this experience with therapists and it is absolutely devastating it makes me so skeptical of ever opening up to a new one ive learned that despite my fearresistance to boundaries i desperately need them dbt therapists typically have excellent boundaries because they know that people with bpd often need them i almost cried at the miss honey reference because i used to watch matilda over and over as a kid and just cry because i wanted that relationshipsituation so badly i wanted a mother figure to swoop in and save me and that dynamic has informed the rest of my life,existentialdread0,hrdv1y
