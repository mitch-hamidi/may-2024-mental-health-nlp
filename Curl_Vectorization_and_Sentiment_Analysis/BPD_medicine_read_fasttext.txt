__label__1 medication isnt used for bpd there is no approved medication for bpd you must be being medication for symptoms or conditions caused by the bpd i feel for you its a lot all at once and then they just hand you prescriptions and say take this you dont ask and they dont explain you are not the only this subreddit is filled with people who think they are taking medication for their bpd they are not you need to speak to your doctor about what the medication is and what specifically is he prescribing it to you but your bpd will never be fixed with medicine bpd is addressed through therapyn__label__8 bupropionwellbutrin has been really good for me with trazodone for sleep and hydroxyzine if i end up having an anxiety attacki am pretty sensitive to meds and ive retained my libido feel more energetic and focused depression and anxiety are helped enough so that i can do my own work to better the symptoms and my emotions have been way more manageable i of course was distraught but i didnt breakdown or shutdown when in the span of a month and a half my exgood friend died in a traumatic way my snake died i had periods my car got a flat i got into a fenderbender and it was all over the first holidays i spent being nc with my abusive mom usually just one of those things would send me into a si spiral and complete dorsal vagal shutdownalso since starting ive been able to quit smoking cigarettes i now drink only maybe day a week with drinks being the max and the constant feeling of weight and pain in my chest is gone i am currently on the max dose and i dont have any nausea sleeping issues beyond the normal insomnia ive had all my life and i can still cry feel and process the world it hasnt made me numb at all which is a godsend lexapro effexor strattera and buspiron all fucked me up pretty badxbeta this is a medication where you risk serotonin syndrome though so if you use any kind of drugs you need to be really carefuln__label__2 ive tried most medicines mostly ssris mood stabilisers and benzosi found that tricyclic antidepressants work the best for me but the dose is really highi still have emotions it just softens the edges and makes my responses to stimuli more normaln__label__8 unfortunately there are no meds specifically for bpd and all the psychiatrist prescribe meds in order to try out and find out some people with bpd see that they feel better by taking ssris others by snris others by mood stabilizers and others by mixing any of the above with or without antipsychotics from what ive noticed most psychiatrists prescribe meds according to the symptoms that trigger bpd or according to the disorders that comorbid with bpd ex im prescribed lamictal for the mood swings and concerta for my adhd and this combo works wayyyy better so far than my previous meds combo which was concerta fluoxetine also many meds make your symptoms worse until they start to work lamictal is one of them it needs months to work and it increases the severity of every symptom which is why many people who just started lamictal have si since week of taking them but in most cases si stops once these months passidk if just therapy helps with bpd but therapy meds is the one that worked for me dbt is the best option for therapy for people with bpd or any disorders that cause emotional disregulationn__label__1 therapymedicationn__label__0 i also have bipolar disorder so they put me on vraylar it has not only helped my bipolar immensely but my bpd symptoms are way more tolerable now it is an antipsychotic but its the only thing that has worked for me hasnt made me feel like my body is weighed down i can still party drink on it but i also dont get hangovers never have i dont know if my sex drive is affected as im asexual so i cant give you insight on that part overall its been a great meditation to be on helped me get my life on the right trackn__label__4 i take lamictal propranolol and trazodone for comorbid conditions but not for bpd they help with some of the symptoms but personality disorders are never treated by medication see if therapy helps rather than jumping through medications so quicklyn__label__1 definitely if you feel empty then your meds arent working properly contrary to popular beliefn__label__2 all of the meds im prescribed end up having side effects that outweigh the benefitsn__label__1 im on a mix of venlafaxine and trazodone and that actually gave me my life backn__label__2 im sorry youre having a hard time right now the way you respond to medication is going to be different from the way each of us do because were different people i will say though that there are a ton more psychiatric medications that you havent tried and it is possible that one could help improve your symptomsn__label__1 therapy generally works better but a mood stabilizer like lamictal may be more effective omega fish oil also has some cool researchn__label__1 there are no meds for bpd i have never taken any and i no longer fit the criterian__label__0 its worth it to white knuckle it and stay in therapy for a few years more so its worth it to create an intention in getting to know yourself to the core i purposely didnt take anythingonly cbd gummies for emergencies so that i could get to understand myself my body and my feelings better i do the same thing with stripping down my diet to no processed foods at all some big feelings are felt in the process but it builds boundaries and a strong relationship with the selfn__label__5 mood stabilizers have been most effective but i wouldnt recommend a high dose unless youre desperate because of potential side effectslamictal tends to be tolerated best tried ssris bupropion antipsychotics an snri or two and antianxietyn__label__0 i went to doctor and got all my bloodwork done bpd can make us forget our bodies physical health daily vitamin regiment weekly therapy xs a week is a the only thing that worked for me i do also smoke exclusively sativa or sativa hybrid heavy weed every morning with my coffee its mainly about routinen__label__6 ive been on paxil zoloft lexapro abilify klonopin propanolol trileptal olanzipine lamotrigine clonidine im currently taking the lamotrigine clonidine klonopin they seem to have worked best for me of course everyone is different this is just what has happened to work men__label__1 meds may not be the answer i would recommend a genesight test to see if the meds youre taking would even be effectivemy test made it a lot easier to find the right mix fastern__label__1 comorbid depression i was on lexapro for depressionanxiety but i felt like a zombie too ive been on bupropion the last two years it isnt as effective for my depression but it helps enough and doesnt make me feel like a zombien__label__0 i went the route of increasing brain function and blood flow ginkgo biloba for flow zinc and magnesium for function its not perfect and it wont take away any of the impulsiveness but it helps me stay above the shit and not completely in the hole of course your usage may vary and by no means do i think it will fix anything just helps somehow keep my brain working better and helps again somehow its bizarren__label__1 lamotrigine has only dulled me in what id consider a positive way in that it helps calm down my mood cycling and brings my anger to a manageable level duloxetine helps a lot with my suicidal thoughts but it doesnt interact with alcohol the greatest i still drink on it but i black out easier both have actually given me a normal sex drive when it used to be nonexistentn__label__4 i was diagnosed with bpd about years ago and i take a few medications to treat the symptoms i experience as a result of my bpd i also have severe depression and anxiety so my medications address those as well i take auvelity and lamotragine to help my mood swings and the anger and violence that comes with it both of those medications have helped my bpd symptoms well medications just help with the chemical changes and pathways in your brain there is no cure for bpd its therapy that helps treat the actual bpd group therapy has helped me tremendously along with dbt and individual therapy the medications help balance me out the therapy and individual work is what healsn__label__0 welbutrinbupropion helps lessen my symptomsn__label__3 my doctor put me on lamotrigine for my bpd dissociation i have been on it for years and even tho my symptoms are still there im not constantly thinking about dying ive tried so many medications and this one is the one that hasnt made me a zombie i really hope you can find something that helps youn__label__3 took me ages to find meds that didnt affect my sex drive but meds arent for bpd just some of its symptomsif you want the best shot then dbt will help you in ways medication cantn__label__3 therapy and cbt or dbt are a godsend but ive taken wellbutrin on and off for years and at times id say it saved me life without stopping me from feeling i didnt gain weight worth a try if u need something newn__label__1 tbh ill be bat shit crazy without my quetiapine used prn for anxietyagitationn__label__3 wellbutrin and snris mess with norepinephrine which is stimulating people either really like it or hate it like it cuz energy hate cuz anxietyn__label__1 prozac has been helpful for me for the last couple of yearsn__label__1 im on seroquel low naltrexone and vyvanse for bpdn__label__1 im on seroquel low doee naltrexone and vyvanse for bpdn__label__1 i used to take risperidone that was until i started lactating it definitely worked thoughn__label__1 nope meds suck assn__label__8 we all react to medications differently so what works for others might not for you which makes recommending meds difficult lamotrigine is one that a lot of people with bpd find helps though im on a combo of seroquel lamotrigine paxil and klonopin and i dont feel like a zombie i had to try many different psych meds before finding the ones that worked best for me out of your three lexapro made me suicidal pristiq did nothing for me after reaching the max dose possible and i hated mirtazapinen__label__3 i use brintellix mg which causes the least side effects for me tried of antidepressantsanti anxiety meds plus therapy monthlyn__label__1 wellbutrin saved my lifen__label__1 wellbutrin has been working okay for me at first it intensified my irritability but in general it doesnt take away a sex drive you arent supposed to drink on it though because of seizure risk i have been nervous about the seizure risk as im on mg its said to ben__label__4 lamictal is a really good one and despite what some people say yes there is literature that supports lamictal for bpd my psychiatrist is brilliant and she recommended lamictal dbt for my bpd meds psychotherapy dbt did wonders for men__label__1 lamictaln__label__0 latuda was life changing for men__label__3 lamictal welbutrin and buspar are the big ones that do not cause sexual side effectsn__label__2 you must be taking medication for symptoms or conditions caused by the bpdor medication that helps to treat symptoms of a comorbid disorder or illness that would trigger your bpd criterian__label__0 lamotroginen__label__3 how many times people would say akchually theres no medication for bpd go for therapy yeah therere not cause its not even a mental illness however most of bpd patients would benefit from some combinations of meds and its way easier than finding a therapist im holding myself together just because i taking meds because waiting an appointment with psychiatrist takes months and waiting for therapy from year to infinity sorry for being aggressive but its very easy to look smart online saying things like you need therapy to address the core issue or dont selfmedicate find a specialist without further elaboration on how the fuck are you supposed to do it for me its honestly sounds like why homeless people dont buy a house type of advicen__label__1 i just got put on wellbutrin about weeks ago the problem is that if you drink alcohol while on the med you can have seizures my st birthday is in about weeks so i might have to have an alcohol free birthday celebrationn__label__2 wellbutrin is helpful against apathyanhedonia and libido loss but over time it feels incredibly weak gives just a little bump of energyfocus even at highest dose but its the only dopaminergic antidepressant that isnt an abusable stimulantn__label__0 trazadone has been a life savern__label__0 so first of all i am so sorry about those fucking hellish six weeks especially about your friend secondly you didnt find the bupropion increased your anxiety for me it made me so anxious it also increased my libido to frankly satanic levelsn__label__2 i would encourage people to go for meds first and then seek therapy if they still need it and youre absolutely right reactions on meds are vastly different and you have to be a guinea pig for a while to find something that works not like i got prescribed lexapro but it made me feel worse so i never touch meds again when they work condition gets more manageable and its easier to sort your shit out even without therapy you absolutely should go for therapy if its possible but theres a lot of people for whom its just not realisticn__label__1 i agree completely youre not going to learn how to manage your emotions on just medicationn__label__1 good luck finding therapist who even knows bpd disgnosis when you live in rural ukraine and poorgood luck finding therapy in germany without speaking german and having public health insurance cant say anything for people living in the us but from what i heard about their healthcare system i just wish them a good luck and why those homeless people just dont buy a housen__label__2 but sertraline which i took before venlafaxine took my amaxing orgasms away forever it seems it was like yrs ago and it didnt rly get much bettern__label__2 this is unhelpful and harmful yes many medications can be used to ease the symptoms of bpd just because you didnt need medication does not mean others wontn__label__0 cutting out processed food is very hard if you live a modern lifestylen__label__3 are you dependent on the klonopin i take it infrequently and it helps immensely i just wish it wasnt addictive and easy to build a tolerance for i think that alone would be first line treatment for bpd if it wasnt so dangerous long termn__label__1 yep this im on medication for multiple things that ive developed both before and after developing bpd either as a comorbid or as a secondary condition that works great medication for just only bpd though isnt really a thingn__label__1 lamotrigine gangn__label__1 upvote it has been great for me with a minimum of side effectsn__label__1 isnt that abilifyn__label__2 double edged sword for me strangely enough it works as antidepressant for me has very uplifting and stimulating effect but if i dont counterbalance it with ssris i get very emotionally unstable and aggressive but it saved me from a horrible episodes of dysphoria saying this because its an example of how combining meds is important if i had too high of a dose over big nono for me or took it solo i would tell everyone how horrible it is and that i will never use it againn__label__3 second this my psychiatrist worked in a womens ward specialized for borderline and lamictal haldol was the go to treatment it has truly changed my lifen__label__0 if your arm breaks and a doctor never sets the bone just puts a cast one it and sends you on your way your arm continues to hurt your arm also itches you go back to the doctor he gives you something to take away the feeling of the itching but still doesnt fix the bone he just says this will make you feel betterpeople deserve the right to know how the main problem is addressed what are just bandaids again most people are in a bad place or stunned by the diagnosis they just take the prescriptions and dont know what they are forn__label__0 bpd is definitely a mental illness loln__label__0 i guess it works out that i dont really drink anymore i had a problem with it for a while nothing horribly over the top but definitely not a healthy relationship idk its worth it for me to have this mental clarity and energy to not drink i spent about years prioritizing fun over my mental health and it bit me in the ass hardcore so time to switch it upn__label__0 thats true and probably why its so helpful for me its starting to become clear that my adhd has been pretty hidden by emotional issues since i started concurrently developing my bpd at a pretty young agen__label__0 ahhh i could see that as a problem for me a lot of my anxiety is based around my perception of myself so as i start to feel better and do better and accomplish things that make me happy my anxiety drops a ton so i can probably accommodate the extra bit that comes with it i could definitely see it not being helpful thoughn__label__0 thats what im trying to say but ive heard about some cases where the pwbpd chose just therapy alongside vitamin supplements idk how this method worked for them but good for themn__label__2 this is what my therapist and psychiatrist told me it just treats the symptoms not bpd itself it isnt harmful it is the truthn__label__0 its really not i spend less than a month on groceries for myself that includes grass fed meat and dairy cries tears of happiness in grocery outletalso i was comparing the two i wasnt saying op should cut processed foods although it does helpn__label__0 my tolerance is ridiculously high i take it once in the morning once at night whenever i have a panic attack ive been on it for a long time but thankfully i dont have withdrawals when i stop taking it like most people don__label__1 lamotrigine changed my life i was resistant for months at first because i was scared of becoming another sedated mad person but im able to actually be myself fully and manage my emotions i still feel the symptoms they just dont get to an unmanageable point anymore truly saved my lifen__label__1 it is lamictaln__label__3 on that note i legit think abilifys helped me im on mg zoloft mg abilify might even go higher then again could just be changing circumstances but ive been more sane because of it nothing else has happened as far as i know like side effectsn__label__0 homeless deserve to know that his issue is being fixed by buying a housen__label__0 its personality disorder it doesnt have episodes if you fucked you fucked of the timen__label__0 hey im just glad you found something that actually works for you im jealousn__label__0 im not talking about money im talking about being on the gon__label__1 i have the exact same experience i dont know what i would do without my lamotrigine now im living not survivingn__label__0 i couldnt remember what it was lol i knew that name but couldnt remember the brand name for itn__label__1 yeah thats what i was on i havent taken it in over a year because i genuinely havent needed it abilify genuinely helped me feel normal and kind of taught me how to regulate emotions on its own if that makes any sense it was an absolute godsend in my eyes and i know exactly what i need if i ever start getting bad againn__label__0 dude what are you talking about non__label__0 thats a priority and boundary issuen__label__0 no exactly it did the same for me helped me regulate my emotions on its own too gives me hope that you got to a point where you dont need it anymore do you have tips as to when you know you can get off of itn__label__0 honestly i stopped taking it when i felt like i could recognize irrational behaviors and figure out how to regulate my emotions on my own it may be different for everyone else but ive been in remission for over a year and its been going really well ive learned to talk to people about things that upset me rather than shutting down or blowing up its really all about learning how to cope in a healthy way and regulating irrational emotionsn__label__5 i didnt like lexapro it helped depression but i didnt get the same enjoyment in life i have been on bupropion for two years now and feel it was a great decision contending with bpd and mdd is hard i encourage you to find a depression treatment that works treating the depression with meds allowed my dbt therapy to be successful without meds the depression cycles would have set back my progress or i wouldve been focusing on managing depression symptoms instead of making breakthroughsn__label__0 did you find that bupropion destabilized everything in the beginning or in general im unsure whether or not im just feeling my true self after switching from ssri to bupropion after years or if im taking crazy pills loln__label__3 i want to tell my psychiatrist that lexapro isnt helping me i have also tried zoloft and it made me feel dissociated and like a piece of me was missing i feel like my lexapro wears out and i dont even feel anything but sadness and my emotions my mom has told me about bupropion and said it didnt work for her so im not sure if it will work for me but she is suggesting lamictal for my moods but i still want to feel happy and being on a antipsychotic for mania from my bipolar disorder has took the life from me i feel liken__label__2 i was off of meds for two years between lexapro bupropion once on bupropion i think i had that manic period for a couple of weeks before stabilizing that said going off of meds is hard ive done it twice with bad transitional states switching means you are going off of one so make sure to judge your outcome after a few weeks what youre feeling could be the withdrawal from the ssri or the adjustment to the bupropionn__label__2 lamictal and bupropion is the absolute business also with a small dose of mg of venlafaxine it is further augmentedn__label__1 ive been prescribed antipsychotics i guess that type of thingn__label__2 antipsychotics helped me i use abilify and if i stop taking it i definitely have terrible episodesn__label__1 just wanted to say ive been there and will likely go there again and i know how scary and disorienting depersonalization can be hope at some point if not now you can recognize how brave it is to show up every day and live in the face of symptoms like these but ofc brave is cold comfort when we feel disconnected from reality itselfi dont know if it will help but i wanted to share some of the things ive tried tomy experiences with similar typs of symptoms ive been waiting to see a psychiatrist for ages and only got diagnosed with bpd recently i was prescribed a low dose of antipsychostics on top of a new ssri to help with my severe depersonalizationdissociationderealization i havent even started them yet its so recent up until now ive been relying on a patchwork of coping mechanisms i used to roll my eyes at mindfulness but eventually i got desperate enough to put aside my ego and and actually try because it was basically life or death focusing on your senses to the best of your ability and i know even your senses can seem like someone elses far away dulled unreal etc but still trying to anchor myself however i could into the present moment mainly dbt mindfulness skills if possible try to find little things that anchor you even a little a hot shower a familiar favourite show the smell of coffee the feeling of a pets fur the feeling of breath whatever i marked down or took random photos during good moments so i remember they really happened even if i forgot or feel like it happened to someone else i tried to limit my stress in any way i could because my symptoms are exacerbated by stress find out your triggers when experiencing depersonalization i tried accepting my current experience no matter how scary while remembering that it will pass and i will feel eventually different that i have survived difficult moments before that i am safe weird but ive found it helpful saying to myself that i notice im am experiencing a symptom of mental illness right now or i notice that my body feels like a mannequin im very depersonalized right now it gives you a framework to understand and tolerate your raw experience through kinda accepting that sometimes it will be very difficult to function and not beating yourself up for this being kind to yourself and caring for your needs as as you would your most beloved longest friend even if you cant access love for yourself thendont isolate yourself i know how tempting it is how it can feel like the only option but please even if its awkward or anxiety inducting or youre totally dissociated the whole time i really recommend seeing people you feel safe with anything makes a difference even a short visit once a week participating in real life is such an important component of mental health even if you feel separate from it and that is really distressing for understandable reasons it is okay to just go through the motions at least youre moving and it is okay to want more than that and be upset by that at the same time remember recovery is possible remember there are hotlines to call if you feel you might resort to harming yourself or others honestly it isnt usually the talking that helps but the keeping myself occupied until the urge subsides that is usefulof course try to access psychiatric and pharmaceutical care as well as counselling there is medicine for this i know its really hard to access these service for many if not most though and i wish it was different wishing you well on your journeyn__label__1 it all depends on the cause of it which can be so hard to figure out i switched me ssri meds one day for other reasons and suddenly it was gonen__label__0 i have another question as well how do you function with day to day work and job is that even possiblen__label__1 i dont take antidepressants i think the cause is just general anxietyn__label__0 thats often the casen__label__0 once i got used to it and found the correct strain i started to become a much better person but it passes through my system quickly and i tend to think i dont need it because im feeling good and make a messblow up have a two hour argument with my fp but we seem to be communicating better than before i got my scriptn__label__0 it depends sativa is an upper i like to smoke it when i hikecleanbe productivesocialize etc it helps take the edge off things as well indica is a downer its for lazy comfort days indica is going to put me in the couch with snacks lol its nice for end of the day relaxing after a social day or if i just need to calm down sativa tends to be more of a head high indica more of a body high i personally favor sativa dominate hybridsn__label__1 i strongly suggest starting off with hybrids and if you like a certain type of feeling try another hybrid that leans more to that side say strain x is hybrid and you like more of the indica side effects then the next time try a indica dominant hybridn__label__3 they can extremely addicting and like all drugs youll build a tolerance unfortunately the withdraw symptoms from benzos can be life threatening in serious cases i have a friend whos liver shut down if you do end up getting off them make sure you tapern__label__0 deletedn__label__0 ever heard of bar brainn__label__1 benzos are severely physically addicting if you are using them to numb on a regular basis in fairly short order you will be completely dependent i recommend finding another solution like edible cbd or thc not a perfect solution but does not create a physical dependence its better if you find ways to cope with your reality through therapy but benzos or booze to cope is nasty in the long run due to physical dependencen__label__0 if you dont wana go through hella bullshit and learn the hard way then unless you know you can handle taking shit like that then dont even bother whatever issues you have will clear up eventually and when that happens you dont want a huge dependency and habbit fucking over your life youll lose money aswel as possibly everything else stick it out n keep working hard no point considering it unless your literally fucking dying theres other shit out there id recommend trying everything thats more natural and healthier first before u write yourself off good luck and merry christmas mfn__label__1 i was on xanax for years i started on mg and steadily worked my way up to mg a day it sounds crazy now how much i took but i was prescribed it and didnt question it after a while i decided it wasnt helping enough for me to be taking that much and decided with my doctor to titrate down when i finally stopped taking them i went through pretty bad withdrawals i was shaky twitchy felt sick just overall not a fun experience im so glad i stopped taking them i just started a mood stabilizerantipsychotic and it already works so much bettern__label__1 yep i know that benzos are addictive and thats the reason why my psychiatrist does not prescribe them it was an impulsive decision tbh and i havent been able to stop consuming them because they give me this false sense of control around food i also struggle with an ed and also because like i mentioned in the inicial post they allow me not to be totally present in my life thanks for the information i would take it into consideration and hopefully stop using them thank you so much and merry christmas btw have an amazing dayn__label__0 nop whats thatn__label__0 what you described is addictionn__label__5 if you struggle with ed i suggest being very careful what meds you taking if youre worried about your teeth im and been on medications since i was ive had problems with binge eating and drugs and my teeth are all messed up really bad i remember dentists always warning me when they saw my list of medications and i just didnt carei was on opiates for years it really effected how much i took care of myself youre just out of it in__label__0 impulsive dont even fuck yourself over and waste ur timen__label__0 listen stop now lmao just trust men__label__0 u think that shit dont come with a pricen__label__1 its where even off the xans youre stupid as fuck you start walking and talking weird cant hold conversation forgetting things you just heard and a lot more my best friend watched someone he knew go down the xanax hole and it was the most depressing thing ever benzodiazepines should really only used in cases you are a danger to yourself or other people if you arent prescribed them the story of benzo abuse never ends goodn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 youll be good after a while you werent doing it for too longn__label__0

mood severity of episodes dissociation impulsivity self destructive tendencies cynicism and insomnia it can be prescribed for so many of the symptoms its been a miracle for me after ssrissnrismood stabilisers antipsychotics and off label epilepsyblood pressure meds only worsened my mental healthn__label__0 if its just been a few days then i wouldnt worry it takes something like a month for your brain to adjustn__label__0 when i started to take my medicine for the first time i stopped it after weeks i have had terrible symptoms and it was like i have lost the colors of my life it was empty and i hated it i started to feel better when i tried to take them for the third time properly and then i definitely became happier and happier with the years but if you arent ready to the healing it can be a bad experience and i just hope you will continue to take the medicine and will be bettern__label__0 omg im taking the same and i have maladaptative daydreaming and now i can imagine my its hardern__label__0 i hope so i cant afford to let it affect my studiesn__label__0 is it necessary for me to take it everyday if im around people it does help alot but if im alone for the whole day i dont really want the weird feelingn__label__0 if you choose to take medicine than you have to do it every day if you have some good days it doesnt mean you are really okay it is for your health and only can affect by regular takingn__label__2 cbd lsd and mdma have changed my life i take cbd twice daily to stabilize my moods lsd once every two months to give me that emotional reset and mdma once every three months to remind me that i can feel happy on top of bpd i also have ptsd depression anxiety and adhd so existing is pretty hard sometimes lol but ive discussed my use with doctors and my therapist and they say as long as im not abusing the chemicals and taking safe amounts that there is scientific evidence that these chemicals can help people granted im lucky to have open minded physicians but its either these substances or mood stabilizers and the last one i took gave me heart issues and i refuse to go through that againn__label__0 yes i got my medical card for my chronic pain issues in august i also have bpd and its made living my life much easiern__label__2 weed is sometimes the only reason i do anything all day ive been on antidepressants antianxiety mood stabilizers uppers for appetite and motivationthe only things that make me feel calm and centered enough to be a person are healthy foods staying hydrated and weedhopefully it becomes legal hopefully i start regularly working out or being active and that will increase my resilience so far getting high and calm is the only thing that gets me out of bed consistentlyn__label__3 i also used to rely on marijuana pretty heavily it was the only thing that was able to change my mood and the only time i felt truly happy or care free was when i was high i totally relate though when u said sometimes it can produce opposite results like anxiety and even more paranoia i started experimenting with different strains and after being a hybrid ride or die for years i tried out sativa strains and loved it im definitely glad you found something that works for you and dont let your parents make you feel bad about smoking weed seriously its saved my life multiple times and should be thought of as treatmentmedication for those who really benefit from it its not just for recreational use although i support that use as well one thing i will say though is that i did end up getting addicted it doesnt happen to everyone and actually im probably in the minority but it did happen to me where i couldnt go one day without it i didnt want to even eat meals without it because food just didnt taste as good when sober and when i ran out of bud things got pretty desperate so to answer your question of what worked best for me was for one finding the right strain and then personally i smoke only when things get really bad for me or when i feel like i truly deserve it or need it i had to make sure that i wasnt so reliant on it for regulating my emotions because i was smoking instead of acknowledging what was going on in my head this is completely individual though so its up to u to really experiment with it and find whats bestn__label__5 ive never been on antidepressants but when i started struggling to feel emotions i started smoking and all the emotions came back to me my parents are the same way about stigma around weed they managed to make me feel like an awful person for smoking but its the only way i can feel normal now if i dont smoke its basically guaranteed ill either have a panic attack an angry outrage a depressive episode or some do crazy impulsive thing acid helps me so much i usually take it once a month ive never thought of it as an emotional reset but thats the perfect way to describe it like for me the come up feels like im feeling such intense highs of those emotions to the point im almost overwhelmed but after the peak i feel this really great balance and i can recognize the beauty in it all it really sucks that theres so much stigma about all of this but think about it they dont know a whole lot of information about bpd in general so they also dont have a good identification of treatment what if with certain people these drugs is the most effective treatmentn__label__0 if i have accessyou wont ever catch me soberluckily i dont have accessit makes life survivable because it fixates me and forces me to occupy myself with simple pleasures like porn food and musici love it tbh but it just reinforces laziness and unhealthy habitsthe thing is i do that anyways i just feel guilty about it sober and cant enjoy it with the thoughts looping nonstopn__label__0 great post op im in sydney aus and although its pretty frowned upon here i use microdosing of homemade edibles and sometimes pipes every few days or sometimes once a week on good weeks my tolerance is light so small amounts work wonders and even if i dont get high i still get emotionally reset which can be a positive im in the process of getting it medicinally through cannabis doctors australia but they dont prescribe it to people with psychotic disorders and im worried ill have to just remain a criminal for me it helps me relax and lessens chances of emotional outbursts but i still have episodes finding balance is important so healthy food exercise and good sleep makes all the difference thanks for the post good to know im less crazy than i thoughtn__label__0 just dont smoke tobacco tobacco floods your brain with glutamate which is not good if you have personality disordersn__label__0 surprisingly yes it actually helps me a lot especially if i have other people to smoke with ive noticed if im depressed it can make me sadder but if its just the feelings of anxiety or emptiness weed helps drasticallyn__label__3 in my opinion being dependent on lexapro or zoloft or whatever the fuck they prescribed us is the same as being dependent on weed only difference is weed is natural i dont understand why they have a problem with us smoking because i actually have a medical marijuana card i think i should get weed for free with this fucking disorder but thats dreams also i live alone so im lonely as hell and will you takes that away i think weed is natural its medicinal and it has no more side effects than these pharmaceuticals i also wanna try shrooms because they say that helps mental illness were just trying to be happy i see you if anything goes wrong you could just keep it a secret from your doctors thats probably not good advice but im youngn__label__0 smoking is the only thing that helps me let go of shit instead of letting it festern__label__2 lsd changed my life definitely an emotional reset i like to describe it as a dose of mindfulness lol allows me to look at my situation from a completely different perspective listening to grateful dead on lsd is equally as life changing lol but thats jus the hippie in me cool to hear it works for other people out there with similar struggles i also deal with adhdanxietydepression i always fear im going to become schizophrenic or psychotic from too much tripping but maybe thats a myth from the war on drugs era too idk so far the benefits have far outweighed the negativesn__label__0 i can smoke a pound of cbd and it wont do shitbut thats probably because i smoke the weak ass legal cbd which has to have near thcn__label__0 totally not trying to hate i legit believe it helped you i however hallucinated for months so it doesnt help everyone and im not schizoaffective or schizophrenicn__label__0 ive been thinking about getting a medical card not too sure what the process is like would be cool to have complete control over the strains im smokingn__label__0 thanks for your insights i definitely want to get a medical card or something so i can control the strainsi do sometimes feel addicted to it if i dont have any im scraping my grinder and putting joint roach weed on a new joint im not proud of it lol but i have been able to stop before and ive also been able to just lower my use in general in the past without much of an issue ive been spiraling a lot lately though so ive been relying on it heavily to keep me leveln__label__0 i do the same dopamine seeking behaviors alllll fuckin day lmao i think thats an adhd thing for me normally i can manage it relatively well and still handle my responsibilities but when things get intense emotionally i feel my self control becomes nonexistent and im just on a rollercoaster riden__label__0 definitely not crazy people have been smoking bud for centuries its just become demonized in capitalist societies because it gets in the way of productivity but maybe just maybe productivity isnt what makes our lives valuable i think we could all use a little weed and relaxation ok im ranting i think im high enoughn__label__0 recently kicked my years long nicotine habit been almost months lately ive been craving just because emotions have been high but im fighting the cravings with cbd joints go weedn__label__0 as an official adult let me just be the debbie downer and reinforce that moderation is key too much of any good thing can become a bad thing the trick is finding a balance for yourselfshroomslsd have completely shifted my perspective on life again not saying its a cure all i find myself repeating toxic patterns all the time but with mindfulness practices and some wonderful psychedelic experiences ive gotten a lot better at seeing things from outside of my sphere of pain still tough but it really has been transformative and made me much more optimisticspiritual just make sure youre in a safe comfortable space going outside is wonderful but make sure its a safe space as well maybe bring a sober babysitter along with you happy travels loln__label__0 likewisen__label__3 i totally relate with the different perspective thing i always have a goal when i trip and reflect on past trauma and lsd has allowed me to see the good and the bad that came out of every situation and the things it taught me id say i have about trips under my belt and have only had three bad trips and thats cause i was dumb and took lsd while on mood stabilizers and then kept trying before it was out of my system cause im an idiot lol i definitely think psychosis can become a problem if youre taking like tabs every week and not being mindful of the substance like some people i know but i havent had any issues im hoping what theyre doing in oregon can spread throughout the states and we can start to see psychedelics as an accepted form of mental health treatmentn__label__0 i mean its not supposed to get you high lol cbd for me is like a mild anti depressantn__label__0 depends on where you are located i am in ohio and one of my dxed illnesses is fibromyalgia which is on the list it was an easy process since i have access to my records from online its even easier with virtual appts now instead of in officen__label__0 yea i would totally recommend a med card or even traveling to a rec state if youre the dispensary workers are mostly really nice and informed if u go to ones with good reviews and they can recommend strains based on your needs and budget u can even mess around with edibles oils and the thc vape pens which are great if ur ever worried about the smell but yea ive totally been there too scraping the keif from the bottom lol which is why i personally had to take a step back but yea when youre spiraling sometimes its the only refuge i feel u if u arent able to get a med card tho you could try ordering higher dose cbd one time i accidentally took way too much tincture and it felt like thc high straight upn__label__0 its not nicotine that floods your brain with glutamate afaik its something else in tobacco nicotine works on nicotinic acetylcholine receptorsn__label__0 facts i hope so too no clue how many trips ive had but its probably somewhere around and only a few bad trips every bad trip was produced by a situation that causes me significant anxiety when im sober so when it happened while tripping i got stuck in an anxiety loop for what felt like an eternity now i know to make sure im in a space i feel comfortable and have everything that i needn__label__0 i know but you said you use it to regulate moodim looking for anything at all not getting high reallybut it does nothing not even physicallyn__label__0 right on im in philly and jersey just legalized it so as soon as some dispensaries start poppin up in south jersey ill be all over it the cbd i have is solid doesnt get me thc high but it feels more comparable to nicotine with slight light headed feel definitely is a life saver for anxietyn__label__0 ahh gotcha i smoked tobacco for a long time but switched to the juul and my addiction got out of control it definitely fucked with my mental health just constantly needed to puff that stupid nicotine vapor not to mention my wallet im happy to be past thatn__label__0 thats so strange especially cause you say youve smoked hemp when i smoke a joint of hemp i immediately feel my mood change and even the isolate i make edibles with it and can tell my mood is better but im also taking mg a dayn__label__0 oh awesome its great to see more and more states legalizing hopefully youll have some more options soonn__label__0 good on you mann__label__0 im on lamatrogene and it works for me that being said you might need something else but you have to give them a shotn__label__5 medications are completely ymmv your mileage may vary meaning something might work for someone and not for you its all a process of trial and error have you spoken to a gp about a care plan and a potential referral to a psychiatrist this is probably the first step and they can get you on the right track with all treatment options such as dbt medication ongoing therapy etcn__label__0 im on lithium and i can feel my mood is already more stable but im only on week of taking it you should see a psychiatrist and tell them about your mood instability based on your symptoms and lots of other factors your doctor will prescribe what they think is best for youn__label__0 im on trileptal and so far it seems to be working well for mood stabilizationn__label__4 i am on vraylar and effexor however what may work for me might not work for you and for all medications there are side effects i went through many medications until finding the right ones for me just keep using your skills and keeping up with therapy until you find the right combination and dont give upn__label__2 ive been on lamotrigine for about years and thats been somewhat effective i started abilify about months ago and thats been pretty life changingn__label__0 topamax can help with cocaine cravingsn__label__0 ahh i did not know thatn__label__0 topamax can make birth control ineffective depending on what kind is being used if you use birth controln__label__1 what meds are you takingn__label__0 im taking lithium carbonate currentlyn__label__0 thanks im meeting with my med shrink tues and i like to be informed about stuff real people experience instead of the crap they say thanks againn__label__0 youre welcome champn__label__0 me too following for advice loln__label__1 literally me every night i ruminate way too much on the past and stress the future way too much to fall asleep without some sort of aid this has only been going on for about months now and i know what caused it but yeah i cant sleep without taking my prescribed meds and smoking some weed if i dont i can stay away hoursn__label__0 same i also rarely stay asleep throughout the night and falling back to sleep is a struggle all over again knocked myself out with the last of the weed i had at around pm its now am and ive been up since am ill probably lay here until am and either be tired enough to fall back asleep or ill just get upn__label__0 yes its such a huge problem in my life and so frustrating also annoying when ppl give you sleeping techniques and say it will work and that you just need to turn off all devices or some shit i try to explain that my brain literally cant turn off all of the intrusive thoughts but they dont understand like literally fuck off you have no idea how difficult it is to live in our brainsn__label__0 me im in in my a and have had this issue all my life the early years were tough when there was no tv to distract me from my thoughts until i fell asleep i remember as a kid running into my mums room crying after getting myself worked up from hours of being left alone with my thoughts relationships are impossible with people who need a silentdark room to sleep ive been asked so many times to have the tv on really quietly so as not to disturb themummm no i need to listen to the dialogue listening to other people snore or just generally breathing in their sleep really sets me off when i cant relax myself ive got out of my ex partners bed and driven home in the middle or the night many times or left my own bed to go chill on the sofa with the tv if im at home this has led to soooo many arguments too other people who dont suffer from this just dont get itn__label__0 yup which is why i smoke marijuana every night unfortunately right now im looking to leave my job so i cant smoke so i can test clean so i get to sleep like trash and have nightmaresn__label__3 i have to take prescribed sleep meds every single night these meds arent supposed to be taken for more than consecutive days but ive been taking them nightly for over three years i take two different ones each nightmy gp knows and says theyre safe for me to take the day limit is only imposed for people who may have another underlying cause for their sleeping problems in which case they need to see a doctor hes the one who writes up the new scripts for me every few monthsi also have cptsd this compounded with bpd means i suffer from hyper vigilance my brain cannot switch off its always on high alert even though i dont usually feel anxious when im trying to sleepive seen one of the best sleep specialists in the country for over two years now and even he agrees that the best course of action here is to take the sleeping medications i get pissed off when people suggest deep breathing meditation etc i know they have good intentions but i have exhausted virtually every option with my gp and sleep specialist unfortunately this symptom requires medication otherwise i will be awake for daysn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 same sometimes i cant breath it gets so bad its more intrusive thoughts for me i end up just switching between apps to keep deistracted until i finally can sleep or make my mind just chilln__label__0 wait i thought this was fucking normal do people not usually do thisn__label__0 even with my sleeping pills i have to scroll through my phone to fall asleep cant just lay there and thinkn__label__0 same weed helpsn__label__0 me every single night unfortunately at this point ive gotten used to it although i know its not the healthiest i tried melatonin but that stopped working i just smoke a bit of weed to fall asleep which works and pauses all my thoughts racing and such but if im woken up i can never go back to sleep i also can only fall asleep once i cant grasp my phone anymore work nights ruin me when i cant sleep i definitely feel you on the sleep irregularitiesn__label__0 have you tried listening to asmrn__label__1 yepweed other herbal remedies exercise to wear me tf out and medication are all things i use to help me sleepn__label__0 i have a radio tuned to talk usually bbc world service that way if i wake up i can just listen without moving until i go back to sleep i also sleep in a separate bedroom from my partner as i dont want to disturb himn__label__0 me too but it started with a traumatic experiencen__label__0 thats one thing i have no problems withim so exhausted from just existing that i fall asleep within minutes almost every timen__label__0 n__label__0 this has been me for the past year i got way too involved with alcohol as a substitute and am just now learning new methods lately ive been putting a youtube playlist of true crime and strange disappearances sandwiched between my pillows at a low volume to help distract my thought without forcing me to keep my eyes open watching something its very relaxingn__label__0 yep youre going to want to start structuring your mind around something when you lay down and close your eyes take the reins of your mind dont let it wander i first starting doing this with a house i would build it in my mind i found that focusing on where the doors were and how big the wrap around porch was and where the greenhouse was going to go eventually would put me to sleep at first certain things might excite me or keep me up but i found that after a while of thinking about just one imaginary thing would become very relaxing eventually a house became a neighborhood became a city which became a world ill think about other things too the important thing is to keep the focus on something that isnt stressful hope i could helpn__label__1 i cant sleep without seroquel like at alln__label__0 i do im not the reflective type so usually i just think about my future until i get too nervous to sleep lol thank god for unisomn__label__0 ive been having a lot of trouble sleeping recently ive had to start mixing high doses of benadryl unisom and ambien every night just to sleep the mornings are the fuckin worstn__label__0 me too but not because of anything bad i just cant do it i dont know why but its annoying afn__label__0 weeeeeeed for me i had insomnia and trouble sleeping my whole life been smoking for years now and i doubt ill ever stopn__label__1 yes at the moment im using nortriptyline because quetiapine is too strong and makes it hard to wake up the next dayn__label__1 same here it stacks with my gad and im always dealing with insomnia weed melatonin benadryl benzos kratom i rarely sleep without something to knock me outn__label__0 try working out or do something that makes u burn energy and stay away from sugar and caffeine as much as possible that for starters n what i don__label__0 i never can fall asleep without assistance from something ive been on trazodone for awhile and that used to knock me out now i cant fall asleep without it and when i do take it ill only stay asleep for a few hours ill either just get really stoned or lay there for hours on end until i maybe fall asleep its exhausting i just want to sleepn__label__0 i had this issue turns out im bipolar whoopsn__label__1 i used to get a nightly hr nap and the meds knocked me out a lil too good lol pot has really helped me sleep and function its a miracle when i have a panic attack also i recommend trying to get a med cardn__label__0 no i do not have this problem i usually feel sleep cravings in my body similar how somebody might crave a hamburger and falling asleep goes as fast for me as the first bite of a hamburger goes down your throat i never had sleeping problems as far as i can remember once i lay down my mind just goes blank because there is nothing in the darkness that could inspire enough thoughts to stimulate my mind and so i get bored easily and find stimulation or the lack of it once i enter the rem phase of sleepn__label__0 during the pandemic ive become dependent on melatonin actually let me take some right now its amn__label__1 i do this every night i smoke and smoke and take medication or drink its definitely a huge issue my brain just doesnt stop going and i may have been exhausted all day but still cant sleep at night its almost am and im finally feeling the effects of all my substances and may be able to sleep soon its an awful cycle i know i need to cut off but thats much easier said than donen__label__0 me me me in a single paragraphn__label__0 i do the same thing dailyn__label__0 i have this issue as well usually getting physically exhausted helps a bitn__label__1 this is me especially the part about not being to sleep with a partner ive been on meds to sleep for a few years nowstill wake up too early with anxiety attacks but can at least fall asleep nown__label__0 so ive noticed something similar i kind of live with my best friend she needed a place to crash i let it be known to all my friends that my house is always an option like i just want to help people and i feel like shes asleep it isnt actually all the time when she sleeps its literally just normal hours but i am awake all the fucking time i can sleep for hours and then have enough energy to last me a day and a half whenever i wake up and get restless however i move around a lot i sift through things trying to clean up and i know im not loud because if shes sleeping im not inconsiderate about it but she always freaks out when she sees me with that much energy so early in the day she always tells me i have adhd or something because i cannot sit still for ten minutes but i actually just need to feel in control of something and seeing my house a mess makes me super anxious and stressed out subconsciouslyn__label__0 i suggest looking into blue lotusn__label__0 what sleeping pills do you taken__label__0 this is so relatable its eerie its either they type me to sleep or call me until im asleep even better if they keep the call on if they cant be there physically and when i lose my fp i lose my sleep toon__label__0 you cant breathe ive had this feeling the past week and a half thats been interrupting my life constantly and i cant ever describe it any other way than as i cant breatheits a very heavy feeling in my throatchest area and i cant fully take a deep breath this in turn makes me have a panic attack and start hyperventilating and i cant breathe moren__label__0 exactly my thought smhn__label__0 same liquor knocks me out faster but then i always wake up a few hours earliern__label__0 you may be better off not sleeping that is a dangerous combon__label__2 im glad the meds help with one side of it anyway ive tried a few meds but i get unpleasant side effects from everything ive ever tried think ive just become accustomed to being permanently tired nown__label__0 i cant say ive ever heard of it will definitely do some research thank youn__label__0 yes that sounds very similaritstarts in my chest then to my throat its almost like its slowly suffocating me which you know makes you panic even more but its usually accompied with racing thoughts as well it happens pretty often toon__label__1 im on a mirtazapine melatonin combo works great no side effects have you tried melatoninn__label__0 i havent i read about it a while ago and read something about it eventually messing up your system which put me out i dont think it can be bought otc either do you have a prescriptionn__label__0 just realised you can buy melatonin online im not sure what i was thinking theren__label__0 melatonin is otc in the us ive never heard about bad effects with longterm use thoughn__label__0 what does the line through the text mean i think the thing i read was that over time your body stops producing it or stops producing it correctly or something if you keep taking it im guessing the reason wed need it is because were not producing it anyway i dont know why but i couldve edit my comment above and had to write a new reply about how it is available online here uk im sure i was looking for it on amazon once and couldnt find it but just typed into google and its definitely for sale onlinen__label__0 i was crossing out what i had already typed about melatonin being otc when i got your reply that you answered your own question sorry for the confusionn__label__0 ahh no thank you for explaining i often see text crossed out and wondered what it means til something newn__label__1 can i ask which medication you were givenn__label__0 thats really sweet to hear thank you for sharingn__label__0 thats really sweet of your brother to suggest playing a game and mention that it was nice to see you happy yayn__label__0 removedn__label__0 very nicen__label__0 sure its vraylar mg it was originally developed for people who have bipolarschizophrenia but has been showing promising results in bpdit is very expensive but the company that makes it has a payment club that will make things easiern__label__0 im wondering the same thingn__label__4 the best treatment for bpd is dialectical behavioral therapy dbt i can guarantee theres nothing they can do that will be as great at dbt check out therapy in your area or get some booksn__label__1 im not entirely sure but i think i read something about supplements like shatavarigreen tea and ashwagandha having mood stabilizing effects its no replacement for medicine of courseand they have their own side effects check it out if youd like but im no doctor and this isnt medical advicen__label__1 thank you yes i already do dbt but was just hoping for like a mood stabilizer alternative or something of the liken__label__0 thank you so much i ended up going to a holistic doctor and they werent much help lol but thank youn__label__0 please update if you do try them happy to helpn__label__8 sadly there isnt any approved medications for bpd even mood stabilizers that commonly help people with bipolar disorder have been shown to have almost no effect treatment for bpd right now is pretty much limited to the standard antidepressants i believe something like more than of people eventually have depression creep back up when on antidepressant eventually so youre not alone wellbutrin and stimulants like vyvanse have worked really well for me almost no depression but increased my anxiety an equal measure there is also dbtn__label__1 this is honestly pretty sad to hear i think so many people are misdiagnosed with depression when in reality its bpd or even bipolar disorder wellbutrin was not good for me but im glad it works for youn__label__4 i stopped the wellbutrin for lexapro a bit ago because of the anxiety and this seems to be helping for now so yeah hope it keeps up aha it is pretty sad there is one drug thats being tested right now and seems pretty promising but still a couple years out assuming it passes all phases from my experience with therapists and psychs they have a really strict image of how someone with bpd is and acts and if you dont fit it perfectly they wont diagnose it or even entertain the idean__label__0 off i hate the judgement people have like be happy that you dont have to be medicated to be mentally stablen__label__1 yep one helped but made me have major blood sugar issues so i had to stop olanzapine and the other does nothing but gives me extremely vivid nightmares so cant take that either because ill actively fight sleep seroqueln__label__4 hey ive been on seroquel or quetiapine as they call it here in the uk because i was disassociating a lot ive noticed some improvement but honestly dbt therapy has been the most helpful for me let us know how it goes with your new medication dont be afraid if you feel you need it take it theres no shame in itn__label__0 i actually do have psychotic symptoms and i had them before i was diagnosed with bpd ive been on them for years i think they do help overall with my symptoms as a whole but itd be hard for me to say if they helped with the bpd stuff or just with the psychosis ive also had a negative reaction from every one ive tried ranging from face bloating to an allergy to the physical dependence i have on the one i take now good luck though i hope your experiences are better than minen__label__0 i already get quite bad dreams bit ive always had them and im being sent for bloods to see how im getting onn__label__1 thats what ive been put on they tried a little of dbt and i had a group thing that i went to but because ive shown depression symptoms at age ive had a lot of experiences that have worsened my diagnosis so its really tricky to unpick everythingn__label__0 thank you for sharing your experience with me i can only hope it goes alrightn__label__1 lamictal helped me ive known a few people with bpd whove been prescribed it im sorry your psychiatrist is so resistant to doing their jobn__label__1 meds dont work for everyone but mine have saved my life i hope you are able to convince your psychologist to refer you do you need their referral in order to see someonen__label__3 i did when i first tried to go off of meds years ago but then my psychiatrist confirmed that i had discontinuation syndrome most people develop discontinuation symptoms or develop discontinuation syndrome when they go off their meds that can happen even if youre being tapered slowly but its virtually guaranteed to happen if you stop taking your meds because you dont have them basically the way you feel when you are discontinuing medications doesnt mean anything about how you would feel when you were totally off medication to me discontinuation felt like bpd but to the max no inhibition acute pain i got brain zaps and my skin crawled i felt like a heroin addict in that i would have done anything to make it stop there is no reason to stop taking your medication suddenly if something has happened between you and your doctor if you cant reach them or they wont write you a renewal go straight to the hospital they know stopping a psychiatric medication cold turkey because you suddenly lost access to it is very very bad dont worry if it was your fault you threw it away or forgot to pick up the prescription they would rather you come in than not in the future you need to have enough medication so that you wont be left in the lurch if something happens even something like covid that could interrupt supply my psychiatrists have always recommended at least one month extra supply i know were not supposed to give medication advice so i hope this doesnt violate the subs rules but i think i should be ok because all im saying is its dangerous to stop taking your medication if you suddenly dont have access to itn__label__0 oh thank you it makes me feel a bit better that i probably have discontinuation syndrome and am not actually this crazy i managed to dig up some of my old medicine hidden in my room so ill hopefully be okay til my doctor stops freakin ignoring me thank you for the advice i appreciate itn__label__0 youre very welcomen__label__3 for me they tried the hey now buddy ya want valium once or twice a week for crippling anxiety attacks well how about you take this other pill every single day and gain weight and lose ur boner instead mkay mkay buddy so i got my drugs onlinen__label__0 the orgasm inhibition is a really common side effect of ssris and its under researched as to whyyou should see a shrink and ask for the best mood stabiliser that has least effectn__label__2 ive been on buspirone for years with no ill side effects and a few months ago added welbutrin since adding the welbutrin ive noticed it takes a bit longer to get there but i still climax the buspirone really did help with my panic attacksn__label__0 deletedn__label__4 you can refuse treatment they provide same as they can refuse to provide it to you dont take those meds if you dont think theyll help as much as you need them to in exchange for the shit side effects i was persistent with one doc in america and he gave up and gave me a six month supplyn__label__1 i have a small town doctor where i could probably also get the rx but hes a real creep maybe this will work out or maybe ill lie and say im taking the daily meds even though im notn__label__1 thanks my therapist made an appt with the inhouse doctor so ill talk to him about it and see if there are other optionsn__label__1 i may mention this drug thanksn__label__0 do those tests really exist or do you think it is possible it is a scamn__label__1 exactly ive sorta come to terms with my moods and phases and do fairly well with dealing and holding down a job living my life but i do need chemical help at times in some moments i didnt know these ssris could have permanent effects yikes i am not taking the daily medicine yet so im just trying to decide how to handle it im going to talk to the doctor at my therapists clinic soon so maybe thatll help thingsn__label__2 ive certainly not given up but im fairly impoverished and have few options kinda gotta take what you can get sometimes im still not taking the daily meds right now just using the benzos as neededn__label__0 deletedn__label__1 thanks i did some follow up my choice of phrasing was poor scam wasnt really what i meant you are correct there does seem to be tests emerging that check for genes that metabolise compounds i think what i mean by scam is clinics are going to sell those tests because technically they are testing how your body metabolises ssris but im not sure what useful information that gives a patient uncertain about antidepressants to begin withn__label__2 none no medication was effective for my bpd symptoms just buried it deeper dbp has been invaluable as well as general psychotherapy and mindfulnessn__label__4 i did weed every day for a few months and i found it helped me a ton but i started to feel dependent and stopped drugs altogether for a couple months and then i started going back to it now feels more helpful than ever it sometimes feels hard to tell if im addicted or if its more like medicationthought the former once now im back to the latter ive always had substance problems but at the same time i have problems medications and drugs like weed are known to help which makes the line feel blurry for me it greatly improves and stabilises my mood and rather than making me lazy actually makes me far more productive and active less empty sativa dominant hybrid strains help me most indica strains tend to just make me feel bored and like doing nothing it also helps me get a good nights sleep regularly rather than my mind staying active getting nightmares and night terrors etc and barely ever getting any rest i have ptsd as welli also dont like smoking personally it doesnt last long and its expensive to do regularly i buy concentrate and make edibles since it lasts entire days with only slight redosing needed and of it can last me months at less than a dosen__label__0 long term stoner here i think smoking weed stops me being able to relax when im not high i forget how to turn my own brain off and it increases general anxietyn__label__0 ive only been high twice in my life but they both happened within the past two weeks i love it because i feel happy but at the same time it dramatically increases the presence of any issues with depersonalizationto elaborate when im high i feel like im myself but like more to where the depersonalization is more apparent so when the high wears off i cant tell if im still high or not sometimes bc my trust in reality is weaker and i have an even weaker sense of selfn__label__0 i smoke every night pot makes it so i can sort my thoughts and untangle them from all of the feelings and helps me put it all in perspective without getting anxiousn__label__0 i think cannabis use can be quite complex for people with bpd especially because bpd and substance abuse seem to go hand in hand unfortunatelyfor example i have a female friend who has been smoking cannabis since her early teens i guess she started at about years old at that time it was more of a recreational kind of thing and she wasnt diagnosed with bpd yetnow shes in her late s and is smoking daily most of the time in the evening but then at least or grams a day to cope with real lifeher bpd issuesshe mentions it is the only thing that is keeping her somewhat sane and relaxes her which i believe but she refuses to see all the negative sideeffects that stem from her abuse which i do see better then her i think she has problems with her weight shes really skinny because she finds it hard to eat when she isnt high so mostly skips eating all day until somewhere in the evening prefers sugar candy above most other things so really little healthy foods unless someone else cooks for her even then she eats about rd of what should be healthy for any human being to survive sleeps in really late and isnt able to keep a steady sleeping pattern she used to have grouptherapy but due to her not showing up and still sleeping not caring she got kicked out this worsened her mental state even more if she cant smoke shell get really anxiousmad and it triggers her bad side has low motivation to finish anything she promised to do only thing she does really well is keeping her appartment clean forgets a lot of appointments and has poor memory overalli wouldnt say that all of these problems come from her abuse of cannabis but im pretty sure she would be better off without or at least greatly reducing her use my problem is that ive tried to talk about it with her many times but she doesnt want to hear itreflect on her own life and get mad at me for even trying to talk about thisso while i know cannabis can help her cope with all the rollercoaster thoughts and heavy emotions she tries to drown them all in cannabis forget about everything and rinse repeat the next day with the same negative outcomes i truely think cannabis is holding her mental development back for years now and keeps her stagnantn__label__0 man i have a lovehated relationship with weed i almost always go through a smoke everyday as much as i can in one day each years for months at a time its pretty harmless if i do it only every few days but then that very quickly changes sometimes i can smoke and be fine othertimes i become a rude unreasonable asshoooole around the people i care about most especially if i have no weed that day i also find that if i quit i hate the feeling this isnt bpd more anxiety related and get extremely anxious sometimes burst into tears and cant communicate for the whole day and end up going back home and either stopping or just hermitting and smoking everyday until i can do it and be social at the same time still love weed though just know i shouldnt smoke it as much as i do or that whole smoking everyday thing will probably happen pretty soon into the yearn__label__0 ive been smoking regularly since i was and i am now one positive effect i found about dope when i get really mad about something or going through a hard time as soon as i get a puff into me i think you know what it isnt even a big deal and then i rethink my behaviour if i over react it basically makes me a civilized person ive had behavioural issues and acted on impulse since i was a little kid and weed actually changed my life i was really socially awkward too instead of being impulsive all the time i chilled out and became a normal guy started rethinking my priorities and other things and got motivated to do good in life i failed grade and had to do a summer term before i started smoking then grade when i started i got s and over i also started going to the gym got really motivated with it and went pretty far made a ton of friends and completely turned my life aroundi still smoke every day at and im on my second year in college in marine engineering with an average i owe a lot to weed its basically therapy in a plantsome of the negatives though would be bad anxiety in social situations harshly criticizing thoughts sometimes feeling tired afterwards i only smoke at night and of course the legal issue ive found out a lot of people who smoke that are criminals really give it a bad name too i know a lot of very successful people who smoken__label__1 i smoke every day and have done so for about years honestly its what keeps me sane and focused most days i like to pick up sativa dominant strains that channel my creativity and energy levels the type of weed definitely determines my mood though i detest the couch locking strains sober i feel enough like a lazy potato and usually just adds to the guilt when i smoke something that further hinders me i use my smoking sessions as a part of my daily routine its like a nice cup of coffee or a nap to keep me going and feeling like a normal human i put myself on a strict morning and nightly ritual and it helps create consistency maybe im addicted but ive found meditating while sober gives similar invigorating effects in place of weed in my day i live in a legal state so its much easier to find what im after in my medicinal weed i feel strongly that weed strains are important because weed really is a medicine and its different for everyone i struggle with a lot of black and white thinking depersonalization and anger and the weed helps me channel those bizarre feelings into productive energy my boyfriend calls its neurotic but i feel happy giggly even and i cope healthily with unsettling emotions with weeds amazing effects tldr weed is an amazing mood stabilizer energy producer or relaxation treat but it the strains really matter information is powern__label__0 ive started smoking the last few months somewhat more regularly then before once or twice a week seems to help with my weekly troubles and stresses im trying to find a balance because when i smoke i smoke too much in the session and get too high to somewhat function normally ive started cutting down the amount i smoke in the amount of time i roll up take two hits leave it for half hour and do something in the mean time come back to it have a few big hits then see how i feel seems to work better for me to be able to function in the day its helped me again like above to relieve my stresses and give my over thinking mph mind a break weed is not for everyone though so my effects might be completely different for you and others you may need to smoke more or less or none at all its worth a try then tinker about with it to see if it works well for youn__label__0 positives for me makes me more giggly and positive makes me enjoy my usually boring surroundings helps me get back into my art and music stuff helps my body image somehownegatives anxiety if i smoke a whole lot or took a break from it binge eating impulsive online shopping paranoian__label__1 i smoke everyday i actually started smoking again due to a nerve issue i couldnt keep taking opiates and i ended up smoking randomly and it helped i have my card now i think that like any drug it has its pluses and minuses it definitely helps quell some of the bpd but it also keeps me slightly less motivated id take it for my neck anyway though bpd or not i think its helpful and a nice little release throughout the dayn__label__1 i use it recreationally but it has useful medicinal side effects weed has got me through a whole bunch of crises and dangerous situations my last care coordinator actually said if theres a thing you do responsibly that stops you getting into a life or death situation and that happens to be smoking a joint then obviously thats the better option ive found it to be a great mood stabilizer and it doesnt half help clear your mind having a walk through the countryside with a jointthe downsides for me are the next morning when its a fair bit harder to get out of bed and moving once every now and then ill have a bad trip where any anxiety ive been sitting on comes to the surface however that happens maybe in times or less i dont get paranoid or anxious thankfully its nice to go off into the country with a picnic and have a little holiday for a few hours its also nice to have a joint and then get really involved in making music or doing electronics projects plus me and my partner talk for hours about all sorts of things which is a good soul cleanser too every so often though you need to take a break to get used to soberness again its easy to use it habitually and forget how to function or entertain yourself without itit doesnt work that way for everyone though from what ive been told if it agrees with you then it agrees with you if it doesnt and youre one of the very few people where it causes anxiety or psychosis then it doesnt work for you and you shouldnt use it whenever ive changed mediation or a crisisrelapse is occurring however its consistently been a lifesaver since i started smoking years agon__label__0 yes i have been using it for years to regulate my emotions it works great ive gotten to a point where im not entirely dependent on it anymore so that has been really nice the only con for me is that it makes me really tired and that it costs money loln__label__0 i medicate with cannabis it helps me deal with my racing thoughts and emotions however i had to try several different strains til i found the ones that worked for me i have found myself cleaning the house listening to music working on artwork feeling quite productive and happyn__label__2 ya it really helps clear my head when im agitated and irritable making it a lot easier to think logically it balances out the symptoms caused by my medications too the downside was that i became dependent on it and was blowing a good portion of my paychecks on it ive cut back a lot and mostly use it as needed with a recreational bowl every now and then where as before i was high literally all day everyday i still feel im able to function at my best when im lit but i cant afford to keep up with it and want to independent from itn__label__1 i wish it was available on prescription in the uk it would be nice to try something other than antidepressants and the liken__label__0 i feel it helps my insomnia anxiety and depression i dont like feeling emotionally depedant on it and worry about the damage im doing to my lungs thon__label__0 im sorry but anything you say after praising opiate and pill usage is nothing but empty and half baked at the worst its fucking ignorant you lose all credibility when you demonize pot but praise pill popping and cig usagen__label__3 nope take a ton of delicious pharmaceuticals and smoke cigarettes no marijuana though im a scumbag but im not nearly that much of a scumbag oomarijuana only impairs cognition which inhibits insight and selfawareness which is vital in pwbpd exacerbates psychotic symptoms and paranoia should someone struggle with that and is generally snake oil for all of its supposed health claims the way its being used for everything under the sun i believe it can also impair empathy which is the last thing we need just another pseudopanacea and i highly suspect the marketed medical benefits are largely bullshit i find it disgusting honestly its one of only a few drugs that i seriously judge someone for consumingstick to pharmaceuticalsmainly stimulants depressants mood stabilizersanticonvulsants maybe opioids here and there and moderation and nicotine and caffeine thats my opinionn__label__2 if i had money and the resources i know id be addicted to drugs as a coping mechanism glad its helping you so farn__label__0 this is the one downside for me too it can really be bad for my depersonalisation sometimes personally i find that it works a lot better when i completely avoid it if im feeling empty or on the verge of depersonalisation and instead only take it when im already feeling meh to good then it helps me feel even better and more importantly stay theren__label__0 wait so you do opiates but consider cannabis consumers scumbagsyoure worse than a scumbag imho such a nasty personn__label__2 pharmaceuticals are the worst drugs out theren__label__3 wait so you do opiates but consider cannabis consumers scumbagsyep correct i think the vast majority of cannabis consumers are extraordinarily disingenuous and theres little thats scummier in my view than being disingenuous about matters such as ones drug use i have a rather oldschool view on this i suppose in some ways nicotine is okay pharmaceutical uppers and downers and opioids are great marijuana is not snake oil at best harmful snake oil at worst with very dubious cultural associations and popularity indicative of cultural degradation and decaythough ive never selfmedicated mood stuff directly with opioids its just a nice side effect of having to take them for acute pain associated with electrolysis facial hair removal treatment youre worse than a scumbag imho such a nasty personim sorry you feel that way i dont think thats terribly fair just based on my having unpopular drug opinions but okay whatever im giving much and much less of a fuck these days and expressing my true views on things now that i know im going to kill myself in a few years so it really doesnt matter happy trailsn__label__0 me too but you cant call one subset of approved medical users disgusting and then not be thought of as also disgustingwhats your medical benefit to cigarettesn__label__2 approved medical users disgusting and then not be thought of as also disgustingsee the thing is i dont think marijuana shouldve been approved for medical as much as it has been i think thats based on very dubious research and was really just a loophole to get around prohibition hence what i said about disingenuousness and thats just one part of itsome drugs are better than others and some drug cultures are better than others so yes i can say that id rather spend time with a fellow pillhead than a pothead any day of the week because i find heavy cannabis users obnoxious most of the timewell cigarettes are obviously so toxic that their benefits are far outweighed but nicotine itself is demonstratively beneficial for cognition anxiety and fatigue with minimal detriment on its own cigarettes also contain maois that are extrahelpful for these symptoms in synergy with the nicotinen__label__2 most pillheads i know are nodding off all the time because of benzos or opiates both of which are highly addicting their preferred ways to injest pills are either popping multiples or snorting the tolerance increases quite quickly and they need more and more and they will go to lengths to get pills that they wont go to pay bills things that my pothead friends have no need for because it doesnt create a bodily withdrawal i know all types of cannabis smokers neither groups of drug users can be put under one stereotype have you not seen the evidence of it managing parkinsons and epilepsy and autism we cant do a bunch of in house research on it in america because of its scheduling so we look to other countries and israel is a top researcher this plant shrinks cancer cells and allows patients to eat i think its disgusting to deny evidence based upon personal assumptionsare you a flat earther and a climate change denieralso i didnt think it was terribly fair to label all users of one drug as disgusting thats what makes you disgusting you individually based upon this interaction not a group of vastly different individuals using a particular substance or doing a certain activityn__label__0 we have hung around very different stonerspillheads it seems pillheads in my experience are ate up non functioning members of society with nothing to offer i was one once upon a time so i know and stoners are just chill and easy to deal with most live normal productive lives youd be surprised how many closet stoners you know trust me its much more than youd think pharmaceuticals are the big risk out of the two in my opinion yes they have major benefits but just like youre argument about pot being used for anything under the sun medicinally pills are abused in the same way just with more extreme consequences i feel any pill used long term especially opiates and stimulants are horrible on your body plus the added risk of overdosing on them if i had to pick between a stoner or pillhead to hang w every day for the rest of my life itd be stoner no contest at least i know my shit wont come up missing that way also the road is rough compadre i know this all too well i am hopeful that in the next few years things will improve enough for you to stick around for a few more take caren__label__0 tried a few different ones but only one stuck the others either did nothing or fucked me up horribly that one has been really good and has helped smooth out my emotions its different for every person though so speak to your doc if youre thinking about it they should know the legal aspects be prepared for potentially a lot of trial and error before you find something thats right though but when you do find it it can be a game changern__label__5 i am currently on paroxetine as medication and it has really helped to even out my moodsthe first two weeks on most medications you are advised not to handle heavy machinery or drive a car personally i noticed that i was not as coordinated as i usually am after that things got better quickly now i have no side effects from the medsmeds are not unicorns and rainbows its just mellows things out stops the voices and gives you space in your headwhich medication is best for you depends on a series of factors but a psychiatrist or your gp can give you advice also dont be afraid to say hey this is not working for me finding the right medication is essential and everyone responds differentlyn__label__2 i totally understand i will just share my story so you dont repeat my mistakes in i was in incredible shape i ran marathons i lifted weights daily and i ate right i was however exhibiting symptoms of our favorite personality disorder i was prescribed abilify mg i was insatiable and had a very long commute to work i would hit a drive thru each way sometimes twice just to feel okay because i was so starving constantly the meds also made me tired so i stopped exercising at the time i was pounds i am now i am a six foot tall male so its not awful looking but my clothes dont fit and i cant afford new clothes i have stretch marks and i feel bad about myself the point of my story though is to warn you in i came off abilify cold turkey because i was fearing my fp would leave me over my weight gain she eventually left but not because i was heavier but because of my angry outbursts and insanity coming off the med i beg everyone reading please do not make this mistake tell the doctor do it the right way she loved me for me didnt care i was out of shape never even mentioned it now ill never see her again due to my actions when i was withdrawing from the meds and now my life is way worse than it was before i came off good luck to everyone it is a battlen__label__2 wow i feel you i had severe withdraw from anti psychotics too and im still compromised after being off years but its getting better way better it just takes time im sorry to you and op in the long run youre way better off not taking antipsychotics they make you fat and it will lead to diabetes and they make you super dumb after some years and shorten your life they are totally toxic check out the inner compass initiative if you havent already for withdrawal info and other life after meds stuff theyve been a good resource for me anyway good luckn__label__0 thank you for your insight i am meeting a new psych doctor on sunday video chat because of corona and im terrifiedn__label__0 are you still medicated or tapering whats the psych doc appt forn__label__1 i have been off meds completely for six months it is to restart because i am doing so poorlyn__label__3 yeah mos is the thick of it for sure youve made it so far though its a huge accomplishment ive totally been there its literal hell it gets better but it takes so long or it can everybodys different with how they recover i hope youll check out inner compass specifically the withdrawl project but i totally get why you want to reinstate i do peer support for folks in psych med withdrawl everybodys path is different ive got to go to sleep now but i can reply tomorrow if you want to chat further either way good luck to you also you will prob be more sensitive to meds than before so dont let the psych doc dose you up too high they dont know shit about these drugs you really have to be your own advocate in that worldn__label__0 i would love to talk more tomorrow if you dont mind thank youn__label__0 hi everyone we had some technical difficulties earlier and it caused a major delay with this ama were still figuring out our ama process as this is only our second ama thank you for your patience while we smooth out some wrinkles on our end edit this ama has now been rescheduled for april th at pm pacific time pm eastern time we will keep this post stickied and will unlock the post for dr k at that time thanks everyone psst i have unlocked this early for you guys feel free to ask a question if you didnt get to initiallyn__label__0 thank you for choosing to help those with bpd most people in the mental health field give up on us because were too intense to deal withn__label__0 is bpd considered a disability i dont understand why its not seen that way by some folks considering we have an overactive nervous system and often a difficulty dealing with the responsibilities of daily life due the disordern__label__0 hello have you worked with patients with quiet bpd if yes then can you describe any significant differences or things you might want to add im really curious about quiet bpd but its hard to find much information on it thanksn__label__0 hi dr k my bpd comes mainly from childhood neglect and as i have gotten older it has improved physical exercise has done wonders for me my question is how can i avoid getting overly attached so easily i have a fear of starting a relationship because i feel im going to become too obsessed with them and shatter if they leave my last breakup felt so traumatizing and exhausting even though it ended amicably i believe i am getting better but when it comes to relationships theres just this switch where my feelings go thanks for everything you do i love watching your youtube videos and love how straight to the point you are many blessings to youn__label__0 hello what is the most important step in achieving remission for people with bpdn__label__0 hey dralok im from india as wellive been diagnosed with bpd but i find it difficult to understand what problems i go through are genuine and which are a part of irrational feeling or thinking when i go through these bouts where something seemingly insignificant can take up all of my emotions and feels overwhelming i am unable to recognise that im spiralling is there a practical strategy to recognise this or to be calmer so i can think when my partner suggests to sit down or rest for a bit its even more unacceptable since i cannot accept that theyre taking it lightly any advice in the direction of handling the feelings is appreciatedthank youn__label__0 helloi have read numerous times on reddit especially on that one subreddit we dont talk about where close ones of pwbpd share their stories that its impossible to have healthy relationship with pwbpd that pwbpd are abusive mean cruel i want to know do you believe its at least partly true such thoughts break my heart but if true maybe i should just stop trying to get close to people as to not hurt them in the future and if its not true then how is it possible that someone will accept us pwbpd and understand our behavior how could we sustain healthy and happy relationship with others thank you and have a great dayn__label__0 how can pwbpd go about gaining the confidence they need to seek out healthy friendships and relationships i feel like im in this constant bout of insecurity that leaves me thinking i only deserve the people who are willing to tolerate me i really want to change my negative thought patterns associated with my selfesteem and was wondering if you had any advice for thatn__label__0 hello i have two questions if thats alrightmy first one is what should i look for in a psychologist or psychiatrist when i get turned away by some just for having a bpd diagnosissecondly how should i pursue careers i would want to work in when they could possibly turn me away for bpd like firefighter or policen__label__0 what do you think are the most important things for a person with bpd to know and do when they are entering a romantic relationship id like to be able to maintain a healthy relationship with my boyfriend and i know he struggles a lot as well sometimes with my problems so i want to know what the most important thing to know and do are for a bpd couplen__label__1 hello dr kthanks for taking the time to be with us and for all your effortsm diagnosed with bpd comorbid with aspdi just recently had a consultation and am looking into rodbtany borderline thoughts on this deviation from traditional dbt a personal perspective if you know about it and support it etcall my bestn__label__1 hello what would you recommend as best starting points for someone who cannot afford full on dbt therapy support any specific books or resourcesalso i watched your video on emotional processing and that has been a huge game changerthank you for all that you don__label__0 hello dr k im a big fan if you have any tips on dealing with emptiness loneliness and loss of purpose that comes when we arent in a relationship it would be great i think many people with bpd struggle with selfsoothing in a way others dont i was single for years and last year i had relationships that both failed im still grieving and my depression over that got a bit better but i forgot how to be alone and its difficult to manage i dont feel ready to date again but i also dont know how to be with myself by myselfthanks in advancen__label__0 deletedn__label__0 hi dr k i recently found your youtube channel and have been floored with the quality of content and the way you present things thank you for making the decision to switch to youtube instead of practicing directly with clients i believe your total impact on the world will be if its not already much greater this waypractically speaking and speaking as someone who really likes analogies it seems to me that bpd is essentially adhd cranked up to there seems to be quite a bit of overlap in presentation could you please take a bit of time to explore the relationship between the two disorders comorbidity differential diagnoses symptom overlap neurological similaritiesdifferences etci often wonder how many people with adhd are misdiagnosed as bpd and viceversa as well ive wondered how its possible to differentiate between severe bpd severe adhd and comorbidbutmoderate bpd plus adhdthanks for your timen__label__3 what are some other treatment options other than dbt i have adhd as well and find it so hard to convince my brain to do thisn__label__1 hello dr kfirst off im a big fan and also a fellow gamer watched most of your stuff and it helped me a lot through my therapeutic processmy question is gonna part mostly about millons quietdiscouraged subtype of bpd what has been your experience interacting with bpd patients presenting in this manner and as a patient fitting this subtypeeventho im mostly deemed in remission by my therapist im still having trouble integrating aggressive parts of my personality when im splitting mostly focused around furyrage so any suggestions would be greatthanks for all the aoe healsn__label__0 how long were you in south korea and what were your favorite experiences during your time there i love korean culture and food but i know mental illness is still heavily stigmatizedn__label__1 although this may not be directly related to bpd i have a question regarding therapy i started therapy a few weeks ago but i ended up dropping out because it was painful to confront my reality while i believe i can handle most of my issues alone i do think that therapy could be beneficial for me however the first few weeks were really difficult and i found myself feeling worse and more anxious than beforefrom your perspective as a therapist i would like to know what you think and what advice you have for mei have been following you for a couple of years and have had several coaching sessions i would like to express my gratitude to you and your family for everything you do and have donen__label__0 hi dr k what does hg do to make sure that their coaches are qualified for helping peopleim a pwbpd who has been very manipulated and gaslighted by someone a few years ago i found out that a lot of other women in the gaming community have experienced the same with this man apparently he was a hg coach too and it involved some clients from what i know he didnt have any degree in psychology or anything related he ended up being fired as a coach but it does raise questions in mewhat are the steps that hg take to make sure the coaches are qualifiedn__label__1 why do you think meditation practises and other techniques which usually are associated with spiritual practises are effective at treating symptoms of bpd do people diagnoses with bpd have the same opportunity for spiritual growth and eventually reaching a place where we no longer are slaves to our own thoughts and emotionsn__label__0 hello and firstly great work you are doing a good service for many people and it must be a fulfilling careerwhat would you personally reccomend for a person with eupdbpd with high functioning asd who spent most of their life and their entire upbringing society icolated and alone in a very literal sence with no real communication with anybody but a few adults to develop a better mindset and go down the road to recovery also should clarify this would be under the uks systemspersonally i have sought out professional help through the nhs and worked on myself through reserch including psychology and how to effectively communicate with people to try to make freinds and connectionsbut the medical system is slow and often brushes off most issues for mebasically just any general advice from somebody in your position with the wisdom and experience you possessn__label__3 any upcoming clinical trials for bpd medstreatments we can look forward to in the coming years young person with bpd here and im always keeping my eye out for promising optionsn__label__0 how do you set healthy boundaries in a relationship with having bpd can you tell me the key difference between paranoiatrust and abandonment issues and a gut feelingintuition i can never understand what im feelingn__label__0 hi dr k its nice to see you here ive been a follower for some time so ive been really looking forward to this ama its also the first that ive participated in i have two questions today and i hope theyre acceptable its said that bpd is developed primarily during early childhood but are there any cases of it developing later say early adolescence ive never had a solid idea of when and even how my bpd came to be based on the most commonly sharedagreed upon literature i find that i secondguess myself a lot due to having been frequently told that im delusional however that statement never really sat well with me given all the opposing evidence usually do you have any tips on how to tell if im perceiving things clearly or notas someone who wanted to study psychology in uni but couldnt due to mental illness it brings me much joy to see the hard work that you do and the care you show for it it can be incredibly difficult to find quality mental health professionals like yourself so i make sure to praise them as much as i can keep up the good fight dr k much loven__label__0 its very strange seeing you pop up on here all of a sudden just want to say youve changed the course of my life and i appreciate the hard workdo you think men with bpd are underdiagnosed and does it tend to display differently for men what can we do to be more empathetic for men with trauma who might act out in scary waysn__label__0 i dont have bpd but i just wanna say huge thank you for helping me understand my girlfriend youre a hero to men__label__1 is there a spectrum for bpd my therapist said there was i match out of criteria but i can also hold down jobs and friendships will some people have more severe behaviors than other bpd peoplen__label__1 hi dr k have been watching your show since my diagnosis in love the work you do and ive learned a lot of helpful mindfulness exercises from you post dbt and trauma counselling i am considered to be in remission i turned my life around in the last years for the first time i am in a longterm stable loving relationship with someone i could see myself spending the rest of my life with the issue im not sure how to address i my sex drive i believe its common for pwbpd to fluctuate between hypersexuality and hyposexuality ive noticed a pattern but i dont know how to fix it or address it in therapy my hypersexual periods seem to have occurred when i was single or in toxicunstable relationships whenever my relationships settle down or the more strong loving feelings i have for my partner the more i lose interest in sex its almost as though my sexual self is reserved for strangers and turns off completely for those i am closest to obviously i want to maintain sex drive for my partner who has a very high sex drive we have a good sex life but i find i have to motivate myself to do it now as i have low libido otherwise we are both kinky people but the old tricks that used to do it for me dont do it anymore i seem to work off my energyemotion through martial arts now rather than sex i want to reenergize my libido in a healthy wayn__label__0 possibly the only psychiatrist who has ever said that they enjoy working with patients who have bpd bit less of a therapy question but why do you think women are so much more likely to have bpd than men this is discussed a lot on this sub but ive always wondered what an expert thinksn__label__0 hi dr k love the contentive noticed a link between bpd and behaviours like nail biting or skin picking im guessing this is probably a kind of selfharm but in a way its a bit different since its not intentional is it considered selfharm what are the differences and in what way should it be approached compared to the common types of selfharmn__label__0 hey dr kthank you for doing this ama love your content on youtube with a good mix of eastern and western ideologies what meditation do you recommend for someone with bpd who dissociates a lot i have many voices or intents in my fragmented head many times i am unable to decipher which is truly me any ideas on how to prune from among these and find our authentic voice for someone with bpd who dissociates a lot and has a parallel reality going on in their head how do i understand my preferences and tastes in terms of careerhobbiespeople versus what is just a fantasy i guess this relates to the question abovethank youn__label__0 firstly i just wanted to say thank you so much for all the help that you have given to people from your contenti have two questions that i wanted to askis all that you need to do to deal with perfectionism simply to process the relevant emotions and allow yourself to digest those emotionswhat are the keys to achieving a healthy balance between work and life eg working vs spending time with othersn__label__0 f dx bpd cormorbid mdd ocdhi dr k are you familiar with the term fp ie favorite person if so how does an fp relationship compare to something like a codependent relationship would you consider then different or the sameanyhow i appreciate your time in the ama i have been watching your channel for almost a year nown__label__1 hi dr k im a long time watcher and have my aoe healing shirt on as i type this i have watched a ton of videos and read three books on bpd because i suspect my girlfriend of four years has undiagnosed bpd i am not qualified to diagnose her obviously but i have learned a lot about bpd and found that the coping mechanisms for partners of people with bpd to be very helpful to me she is not currently in therapy but has been back and forth on if she would actually ever go ive tried to encourage it but that usually leads to an argumenti have diagnosed adhd which leads to triggering my girlfriends bpdlike symptoms often easy example is me forgetting something and that makes her feel abandoned which leads to her splitting and not talking to me for a dayon paper it sounds like adhd and bpd could never get along i havent heard many professionals speak to this since it is such a niche example but i feel like bpd and adhd seem to be easily misdiagnosed so maybe theres more cases of this than we all would think anyway i would love to hear your thoughts on a adhd bpd relationships i assume it comes down to each person helping themselves individually by therapymedication but im curious if you have any further insights or opinions you mentioned recently that bpd symptoms tend to fade away over time and that is something that eases my worry about marrying someone who i can easily trigger if im not carefulas a side note we are currently the healthiest we have ever been but weve definitely had ups and downs thanks for doing this aman__label__0 hi thank you for your work what do you believe is the relationship between bpd dissociation is dissociation or even dissociative disorders common for pwbpd i only ask because i get dissociative episodes and the professionals i see hop around between labels for my dissociative experiences but ive heard my condition referred to as dissociative bpd is that even a thingn__label__0 hey dr k i seriously appreciate you doing this i have a few questionsin the context of bpd what are your thoughts on identity diffusion and identity issues the loss of direction in life where you constantly float from interest to interest but cant ever settle so those sort of topics and the general way to go from theremy second question is what are your thoughts on overcoming chronic loneliness and chronic devaluation of ones self that sabotages recovery and the journey of achieving self love and what can one do to find comfort and happiness in ones self in the long run to prevent relying on someone else to give you itthank you for everything and no worries if you cant answer all questions have a great dayn__label__0 hello can you describe a bpd episode i always hear this term being used but im not actually sure what it entailsn__label__0 is it possible for someone with bpd to have a healthy relationship with a favorite personn__label__0 do you think the crossover of bpd with autism adhd and cptsd is due mostly to misdiagnosis or comorbidity do you think the diagnosis difference between males and females is accurate or is one sex over or under diagnosedn__label__0 heya doc thanks for doing this ama and for all your valauable work you have no idea how refreshing and appreciated your post is im a koreanjapanese first gen raised in western society english is my first language i was diagnosed with bpd in my mid twenties and noticed that my symptoms presented very differently to my western counterparts i know that everyone present differently anyway but i was curious to see how much my cultural background had an affect on it for one the main difference i could see was that my symptoms were far more internalised than theirs were how do you think cultural heritage affects bpd presentation also do you see any east asian specific symptoms or presentations i think generational trauma specifically my korean side has a big hand in my diagnosis my mother and grandmother certainly have bpd or some form of undiagnosed pdmental illness ie korean hysterics and the cycle of abuse definitely led to my own diagnosis what are your thoughts around thisthank you all the information i have access to about bpd is through a western lens so would be great to get another perspective about itn__label__1 hello dr ki was diagnosed with borderline shortly after turning ive been told that borderline can not be diagnosed in your childhood which i dont understand because its caused by trauma throughout young years of ones childhoodas well as that ive been told a lot that my adhd plays a lot into my borderline and that taking medication for adhd potentially stabilises emotions how is that and why can adhd be mistaken for borderline aside from the manic episodes they have in commonmy last question is i self diagnosed with bipolar disorder before getting diagnosed by a licensed professional where is the big difference between bipolar and borderlinei know that people with bipolar disorder have longer episodes as to borderliner that experience rapid cycling theres two types of bipolar though and one of them is a rapid cycle type after having the disorder for a while how does that differ from having borderlinen__label__1 hi i had to do a double take cause i love your content didnt expect you here my ama would be what would you suggest to someone who has adhd and bpd and pcos i have super super bad chronic fatigue and im a personal trainer my life feels like im constantly fighting with a body that doesnt keep up i know youre not here for direct medical advice and im not seeking that but im wondering what your input is on the fatigue issues as well as how mood stabilizers might be affecting it i heard from some sources recently they can make adhd fatigue worse thanks for taking care of the bpd community online its appreciated greatlyn__label__0 your videos have helped me a lot thank you for all that you don__label__0 hiwhere does the stigma pwbpd are abusive come from is there any scientific truth to this thanksn__label__2 hello ive done a lot of dbt and been in programs but its only been helpful to a point im looking into mbt as an alternative option im curious what your thoughts are on mbt for bpd also how mbt compares to eastern psychology and medicinen__label__1 thank you for being here aside from seeing a therapist psychiatrist what can i do in my daily life to help myself develop emotional intelligence and overall wellbeingn__label__2 so first question i have i was recently diagnosed after an inpatient psychiatric stay i learned what i could from the few books the clinic had but it still hasnt clicked with me what is your human definition of bpdsecond question you mentioned eastern medications is this like herbal shit id really like an excuse to drink more teasn__label__0 why is bpd harder to diagnose at a younger agen__label__0 how do you deal with allconsuming grief caused by your own actions ive lost an immenselyloving partner through my outbursts and have been sumberged in selfloathing for the months since we both had communication issues so there was bound to be a tipping point but staying friends is hard when she doesnt want to even acknowledge that we need to clear the air in proper headspace i am ofc respecting the boundary but it can be extremely hard on my mental she is my best friend and the one who even still brings an abundance of joy into my life i cannot lose her at least help me find out how to clean up the mess ive made to the point where staying friends is healthyalso idk how much this matters but were both womenn__label__0 hello dr k do you have any tips for staying calm during an argument preferably something that doesnt take up much brain capacity thanks in advancen__label__1 hi dr k always been a fan of hgis it possible to reduce the hypersensitivity that people with bpd often experience or is it just something we have to live with and toleratecope for the rest of our lives i feel a lot of discomfort with everyday life because so many things can make me very anxious very sad etc i try to deal with them through methods i learn from dbt by trying to stop and pay attention to my feelingsbody or taking a break and do something relaxing or some meditation or some distraction however taking the time off to soothe these feelings is honestly timeconsuming and exhausting they come so often since many things or sometimes nothing set off large amounts of negative feelings and these strategies dont last long because they creep back in when i get back to everyday life namely worksometimes i just tolerate the bad feelings and try to get work done despite them one would think i should have gotten used to bad feelings or become less sensitive but somehow i dontn__label__0 do you think it could be considered unethical behaviour how a large quantity of psychologists try to tie in gender dysphoria to bpd and go so far as to try and actively gaslight trans people with bpd further increasing the issues of trust people with bpd have around the medical field and hows the best way to deal with this situationn__label__0 i was recently diagnosed with bpd after a er visit they put me into saphrine it was just less then mins with the doctor if money is not an issue where should i go to get a proper diagnosis someone that will spend more then mins with me any recommendations i am happy to do it virtually with anyone from any country so long as i can get a proper diagnosis i live in canada if that is a factorn__label__0 hi i dont have any questions so happy to see you on this sub just want to say i found your videos on youtube many months ago and i love them i have watched all your videos on bpd and even though i thought i had educated myself well on borderline i have learned several new things from hearing you talk thank you for making great educational videos on mental health and being respectful and kind you seem like a great personi love listening to sadhguru videos and i feel like that has helped my bpd a lot that and i love bharatanatyam traditional dance especially rukmini vijayakumar they both give me great motivation to move around and feel joy and so on you should check out her dances if you havent already i think you would like them in one of her newest videos she dancing under the ocean and its so beautiful and meaningful of a video i wish you well in life namasten__label__0 in one of your videos you say that healthy relationships often help symptoms of bpd but in my experience theyve made it x worse why may that ben__label__0 deletedn__label__2 hi dr k im a male with bpd who currently does not have any access to a therapist or group for dbt what are some lifestyle choices i can make to help me cope with my bpd until i can manage to get therapyn__label__0 how can i improve my situation if i have bpd and i cannot afford therapyn__label__0 what would you recommend for someone who has a maybe unhealthy crush on their psychiatristn__label__0 hey dr k love your stuff been looking forward to this podcast youve helped me understand my adhd a lot ive got two questions in case the first one was a lot what do you think of jordan petersons views that bpd is caused by inadequate socialization based on his views and the diagnostic criteria similarities is it possible that bpd is in at least some cases misdiagnosed adhd and if so would that mean that a person with adhds ability to reduce their symptoms is just healing of their trauma alternatively how do you determine which sources are reputable and helpful when it comes to a mental health condition as complex as bpd given the popularity of those like dr peterson saying that people with bpd didnt get properly socialized between the critical period of development agesn__label__1 my therapist is reluctant to diagnose me with a personality disorder weve only been together for months or so he has agreed that i have adhd and cyclothymia honestly i am pretty sure i have quiet bpd and that it was in remission while i was married a marriage where i could never give enough since i was widowed i was just shut down but now that i am in therapy all the old emptiness and fear of abandonment feeling inherently unworthy of love has flooded back in from those days before i was married i can be literally snuggling one of my kids and at the same time yearning for validation and love i am trying very hard not to pass down the maladjusted behaviors thus the therapy self love seems so distant and impossible and unreal i would be very interested in what you have to say many folks before me have asked for recommendations of books and coping mechanisms and i could use that too i am working on having boundaries but also honoring the boundaries of my family because the compulsion to ask for validation is very strong thanksn__label__0 hello dr k love your work its helped me understand myself and others around me so much better i am dating a man with bpd he goes to therapy and puts the work in to be as emotionally regulated as possible but when hes overwhelmed he wants to be by himself i respond by giving him some space to sort himself out hes a sweet soul to and very down to earth i can tell hes been through a troubling past past but hes trying to be and do better for himself regarldess of his good or bad days i would like to be in his life i have very many questions i would like to askhow can i generally show my support and care towards someone struggling with the disorderwhat are some relationship struggles that people with bpd facedoes bpd affect communication ie its harder to express feelingsdo people with bpd have shifting personalities or shifting moods neitherwhat is splittingis bpd developed from ones early upbringing or can it develop past adolescencewhat are some green flags and red flags when developing a friendshiprelationship with someone with bpdwhat are the differences between how bpd shows up in men vs women vs othersare there common triggers to avoid when interacting with someone with bpdi have many more questions and would love to hear from anyone who wouldnt mind sharing their thoughts research or experiences dn__label__0 hello just a fairly basic albeit obvious question why is life like this for us why why why whyn__label__0 what are the chances i may have dissociative disorder as well and what are some signs i can look out for if i do have itn__label__1 hi dr k i have been experiencing symptoms of bpd and im seeking therapy eventually when it comes to medication whats medication is a good stabilizer that could be taken w therapy to help even more thank youn__label__1 how do i have better sessions with my therapist how do i know im having an episodei find that my depression is at the forefront but my bpd is not always easily addressed im not sure if its because i cant tell what my bpd looks like really but its something im really looking at now because life should not be this hard im always either in too deep or one foot out the door ready to blow it all up because i had a bad week or so i thoughtn__label__0 hey dr k thank you so much for helping people who are struggling with bpd i am wonder how can i get better from bpd this has been a big struggle for men__label__0 why were you training to become a monk and why did you decide to go to medical school insteadn__label__0 i only have one question i have a history of a tbi is it possible that having a closed head injury has anything to do with my bpd and how would i go about finding this outn__label__0 hi dr k thank you for the content you have made about bpd you are very compassionate and sciencebased in your approach and i have a lot of respect for thatn__label__2 hi dr k i have two questions what is your perspective on using alternativeholisticnaturalintegrativeeasternfunctional medicine in the treatment of bpd and what is your perspective on the interrelationship between bpd and autism id also be interested to hear if you think bpd is always caused by trauma and if so how youd explain the cases where a person claims to have developed bpd without having had a traumatic childhood thanks for being heren__label__0 deletedn__label__0 hello i have one burning question how can i have a healthy relationship if i have bpdn__label__1 hi dr k how can bpd manifest in an year old individual with cptsd and possibly did i have diagnostic criteria and have numerous physical conditions as well me the individual has established with therapist i have alters that switch dissociative amnesia etcn__label__1 dr ki hear that there is a lot of success treating people with bpd are there any ways that friends or loved ones of people with bpd can aid them with their symptomsmy ex partner would have episodes of spewing hate and blame on me for everything i did wrong in their mind their eyes would seemingly glaze over and sometimes the episodes would last around two hours attempting to end the conversation would make things worse like threats couple hours later it was like nothing ever happened as the week went on there would be love bombing and because of the love bombing i never took things seriously i thought it was uncontrollable anger and saying sorry afterward until i learned it was bpd they broke up with me because i couldnt meet their emotional needs even though it constantly felt like i was putting them before myself im referring to them as i wish not to disclose mine or their genderi wish i could have known ways to helpa lot of the stuff i hear about bpd paints them as mean and crazy they can do a lot of hurt to others emotional abuse but they themselves are going through a lot of hurt and they need help and comforthow can we help people with bpdn__label__0 hi dr i love your channel hg i adore your humor too i wouldve cried through your entire video on relationships and bpd if it werent for you voice mimicking in which i cried and laughed simultaneously instead that video was incredible for me and i realized what i need in a relationship despite the fact i actively seek a sort of intensity thank you so much for that video it was eye opening and i gained a lot of insight and self knowledge as to what i need to heal i didnt know what i wanted even though it was at hand now i know better im also grateful for the hg subreddit mental health with understanding of gaming the subreddit i did not know i neededpeople with bpd myself included or other traumas or even just the average person often have a difficult time describingknowing what is love i do i love the idea of love do i love being loved do i love my projected fantasy etc what does a healthy relationship feel like if i dont know what i feel or how i should feel how can a person with bpd know what love is are people with bpd capable of giving this so called lovei personally find myself only comfortable around those who are a bit mentally unwell themselves but they are stoic yet empathetic and can withstand my emotional volatility which are i feel are qualities i need ive been trying to heal albeit slowly but surely but i find what i need to offer from my end is sensitivity gentleness and understanding another q what does the person with bpd need to do also ive read healthy relationships are a combination of openness vulnerability trust honesty affection etc but enough is never enough and more assurance is always nice lolthank you so much dr kn__label__5 hi dr k i didnt see this until now im in the healthygamergg discord and i felt so seen after you posted your video explaining what bpd is im found your youtube channel whilst looking into the psychology of tilt i previously played league of legends as an adc main i really enjoy working with clients with bpd ive found that they are some of the most exceptional human beings on the planet and it has been rewarding to help them integrate into society in a healthy way ive worked with a ton of folks in highpowered fields such as finance and medicine who have bpdits good to know that people like me in health care with bpd exist im a nurse because of the stigma with bpd and mental illness in general most people with bpd like me tend to hide our diagnosis from people at work it has led to me feeling alone suffering in silence i also believe that eastern psychology and medicine has far more to offer to help people with bpd marsha linehan and the development of dialectical behavioral theory was just the first stepi agree wholeheartedly dbt wouldnt have been developed without marsha finding out the mindfulness component which originated from zen buddhism was what was missing from cognitive behavioural therapy with mindfulness the therapist could focus on acceptance and change balancing out focus during sessions with the client like a seesawalso some cool stats most people think of bpd as a permanent diagnosis but research shows that people with bpd can get significantly better and in fact most do remission at year remission at years and remission at yearsthank you for mentioning this as well i always highlight this whenever people tell me that our diagnosis is a terminal lifelong condition that it is pointless to do therapy or seek alternative forms of treatment like ketamine infusion therapy when talk therapy isnt effectivethere is hopei hope you can do a collaborative video with dr daniel j fox sometime im subscribed to his youtube channel as well as healthygamergg regularly for increasing my mental health awareness he has highly similar focus in his messages about bpdmy question i am f diagnosed with bpd and anxiety since i married another gamer and we now have a child just over a month old im currently in the middle of doing intensive dbt and on a break from group skills classes because of birth still seeing my individual therapist weekly im scheduled to resume where i left off this augusti am worried that the demographic of people signed up for group counselling are younger than i am and wont be able to relate to the challenges im facing for example the challenges of being a new parent coming to terms with the upbringing i experienced from my own parents and the goal of fostering a secure attachment style with my child with this in mind do you believe healthygamergg counselling would suit me better in a group or individual setting moreover should i aim to seek counselling now along with therapy or would it be more prudent to finish a year of intensive dbt first before attempting counselling or perhaps even wait until i get into remission i would be grateful for any input dr kn__label__0 did this even happen or did the technical issues derail it i dont see any of dr ks replies to questionsn__label__0 hi dr k nice to meet you your videos on bpd are very helpful just afew questions how does a bpd individual not overly depend on their significant other despite the bpd me being aware that i am trying my best not to drag every insignificant emotion towards my so and miserably fail every single time its a repeat cycle of something upsetting happens that has nothing to do w my so finds a way to blame my so for my feelings of despair upset anger am aware that i am doing it try my best to not feel that way fails gets passive aggressive and unable to explain to my so whats going on other than its not ur fault how does a bpd individual stop feeling the extreme emotions of each situation and jump straight to the worst thoughts example so and i had a mini argument my first instinct is to run away cry by myself and imagine all sorts of scenario where he doesnt love me anymore and im not right for him and we should end the relationshipit is also incredibly hard to say im sorry for being like this and its my fault instead i am always looking at myself being the victim and not the perpetrator this results in my so being the first to apologize and wanting to close the argument by saying i love you im not sure whether it is a power complex on my end where i refuse to step down subconsciously and must win every argument but my logical and mature side which is trying is telling me that this is wrong this has resulted in me grooming my so that i will explode if he doesnt for example text me every hour if not i will be upset and we will get in a fight and rinse repeat the above situation this whole personality of mine is very upsetting and i have yet to understand why i am like this and am not sure what i can even do to help myself to improve and my relationship i am also not bpd certified but i do resonate with all if not most of the symptoms that come along with thisn__label__0 do you recommend any books like the subtle art of not giving a fuckn__label__0 hi dr kthank you for taking the time to answer these questions im sure im not alone in saying it means a lotyou mentioned eastern medicine in your post what kinds of eastern medicine would you recommend for pwbpd ive been having a hard time getting help i live in england and the nhs is kinda shit when it comes to mental health services and i am open to trying literally anythingn__label__0 this is so so true and so sad in my experience the best way to deal with someone with bpd is to just sit with them in their intensity what is so hard for clinicians is that we fall into the trap of if someone is hurting more do more but the best thing to do is not less per se but just stay as tranquil and supportive as you can over time ive noticed that my tranquility is what most of my patients need but it can feel like youre letting your patients down if youre not doing more and if it is too intense for you as a clinician you end up rejecting the patientwhich then makes the bpd worsen__label__2 which is part of the reason those with bpd might stop or give up on treatmentn__label__0 i think bpd could be a disability the criteria for disability and diagnosis are different and i think thats the way it should be we shouldnt automatically put people in the disabled column because they get a diagnosis at the same time i have worked with people who have bpd for whom it rises to the level of disability ive also worked with people who have been able to rise out of a highly active period of bpd and be incredibly successful its a case by case basis and more importantly a time by time basis just because it is disabling this year doesnt mean it has to be for the rest of your lifen__label__0 im not quite sure what you mean by quiet bpd but ive certainly diagnosed high functioning people with bpdthese are usually very successful people whose internal experience is incredibly painful they succeed at work may make money but every interaction can feel difficult and painful they hyper read into any interaction they assume the worst of neutral interactions any time there is some sort of conflict or disagreement they assume that the other person is correct they try their best to be what the people around them want them to be even when it hurts them even when things go well they cant take pride or relax but rather focus on when the house of cards will fall apartbasically put together and even enviable on the outside but the subjective price is super highn__label__0 not dr k but im in the same boat totally normal with friends but others nah i was talking to a friend recently and telling him how attached i get and he said bbc thats the dopamine rush you get at the beginning of a relationship i think hes right because for me it goes away at the five month mark im like oh ok everythings safe now and i start to pull away and explore my life i know dopamine chasing is an issue i have so now i think that switch has something to do with dopaminen__label__0 lets think through it this way if your bpd comes from childhood neglect your mind has lots of data that attachment leads to lots of pain what we want to do is give your mind new data from healthier relationships the more data we give it the more it will start to understand that relationships dont need to be feared its ok to get overly attached even when it is painful each time you get overly attached if the person isnt abusive youll calibrate towards normal and paradoxically if you expect and accept that youll get overly attached thatll help you get less attached the last thing to remember about relationships is that when we have bpd our identity of ourselves becomes defined by a relationship this is why breakups are so traumatizing we dont lose another person we lose ourselves when i work with people with bpd i try to help them develop an identity of themselves usually through meditative practices the more your healthy identity develops the less traumated attached youll getn__label__0 developing a healthy sense of selfn__label__0 this is a very common problem and a great questionif we look at the evidence based mindfulness techniques for bpd they are usually grounding techniques things like ice diving when you dunk your head in a bucket of ice water self injurious behavior or cutting also accomplishes something similar but the meditation is far healthier utilizing these mindfulness techniques in the moment can be really helpful the challenge is that using them when you are out of control is difficult so how do you fix that learn how to do these techniques when you are not out of control then start to use them when you are slightly upset then moderately upset level up until you can handle things when youre out of control you dont learn how to swim in the middle of the atlantic ocean you learn in a kiddie pooln__label__0 i feel this too great questionn__label__0 xbthe first thing to remember is that no human being is static so is it impossible to have a healthy relationship with a pwbpd it may not be possible in this moment is the person with bpd ready to engage in a healthy relationship they may not be at this moment also it is very possible that the reason that the relationship didnt work out is also because of the person without bpd having certain problems or not being able to meet their partners needs it takes two to make a relationship work and it usually takes two to make a relationship failand what happens on the internet is that people will take individual cases and extrapolate them outso id say that you can absolutely have healthy relationships with bpd in fact i want to say that the majority of people with bpd end up in healthy relationships the challenge is that it takes some time to get theren__label__0 the challenge is that in bpd the person with bpd often uses relationships to fulfill other needs using sex as a substitute for connection relying on the esteem of someone else to substitute for self esteem and if the relationship has to carry all this weight it is hard to sustainn__label__1 hmm this is a bit tricky i see a few threadsleaves me thinking i only deserve the people who are willing to tolerate methe first weird thing is that this is true we dont deserve any particular persons company whether you have bpd or not the only people that hang out with you are the ones that will tolerate you this is true of my romantic relationship and my friendshipsthe tricky thing with people with bpd is that they often select the people who treat them poorly or will prereject people who are healthywhen someone is abusive towards you they usually try to keep you around abusive people are lonely and will hang on to anyone that tolerates their abuse this is why they chase people down who try to leave even though they will tell them to gtfo so in bpd there is a strange security with an abusive person if i can handle the abuse theyll stay so look for this in your own interactionstheres also this element of i think im shit they think im shit so we all agree and theres no surprisesnow lets look at a healthy relationship i think im shit they are treating me ok it is only a matter of time before they find out im shit and then thatll really hurt because abandonment really hurts so the best thing i can do to protect myself from that hurt is to not get attached int he first place so im going to steer clear of them because theyll end up rejecting me anyway because they are good people and im not goodwe sort of call this self esteem but in my experience understanding that it is an issue of security can be helpful the crazy thing is that abusive relationships are certain and healthy relationships are foreign and uncertain so we gravitate towards what feels safe which ironically is abusiveso pay attention to how you select who you hang out with notice that there are some decent people who you may avoid this is the key thing that needs to shift in a weird way you are taking the decision away from them by prerejecting yourself they get to choose not you so give them the choice offer your friendship think about relationships as an offering given freely and they get to choose sorry for the wall of text hopefully it makes sensen__label__1 for question look for psychiatrists or psychologists who are open to working with bpd or even specialize in it theres a fair amount of us i think bpd is made out to be way scarier than it is often times in clinical training we see the most severe cases of bpd inpatient and thus we assume that outpatient will be similarif they dont want to work with you thats ok some people want to become surgeons some people want to become psychiatrists some psychiatrists like working with bpd or addictions or depression or ocd everyone has a talent and a preference just look for someone who wants to work with you is comfortable with bpdas for the second apply anyway im not sure what kind of disclosures you have to make for fire or police but ive worked with both populations and there is a lot of mental illness you cant control whether they turn you away or not but if you want to do something go for it also it helps to have your bpd in a stable place and hopefully a good support system in place to help you handle the rejection like a therapistn__label__0 we made a video recently about how to have a relationship in bpd some of our more memefriendly content the most important thing to recognize as a person with bpd is that time is on your side the more you withstand the relationship the better off youll be the second big tip that id have is that positive emotions screw things up just as much as negative emotions we always think about negative emotions as the problem in relationships and thus we try to control them meanwhile their positive emotions will set the relationship up to fail deeply in love and your lease is running out dont move in together months into a relationship met your soulmate that doesnt excuse their behavior love this person so much let them leave if they want to trying to trap them will only drive them awayn__label__1 rodbti dont have any personal experience with rodbt but have some experience with dbt and open dialogue for psychosis id say give it a shot and it seems like it leans into the acceptance more which can be healthy good luckn__label__3 hmm id say that meditation training and even support from spiritual sources can be helpful ive seen a lot of mental illness in ashrams and ive seen mixed results in some cases people get taken advantage of but in others people can become drastically better lets remember that dbt exists today because dr linehan sought some degree of spiritual training and support so if you can find a place that is safe and focuses on meditation training often times these people dont charge for anything id go with a friend though just so that someone else can be on the lookout for potential of abuse the other thing id recommend is asking people who offer dbt for some amount of service at a reduced price or even free care thankfully most of the therapists i know offer reduced or even free rates you can also check outn__label__0 haha i asked almost the same thing is the episode youre referring to the one called how to process negative emotions i loved that onen__label__0 i wish i had a better answer for this but ill speak from the heart not sure if itll make sense it is easy to be filled with loneliness when we are trapped inside four walls the loneliness is like an object a feeling that fills us up if you really look at it the loneliness isnt absence but a ball of emptiness it is easier to be filled with yourself when youre engaged in some difficult task usually in isolation like hiking or rock climbing or wood working or painting spend more time fully engaged with the self in some task that requires the totality of your concentration and then youll feel full of yourselfn__label__0 hmm the two main features i would try to describe are emotional lability people with bpd literally experience more intense emotions than the normal person so it is like an amplifier of emotions both negative and positive you feel deeply in love and youre devastated by rejection my take on bpd is that it is a core lack of sense of self if we think about who we are when i was years old i was still me even though my body is different i was me before i was a father and after i was a father im still me xbso most human beings have a sense of transcendent identity we look different we talk different we become rich or poor we become married or divorced but were still mein bpd that meness is missing so who we feel like we are is defined by our circumstancesn__label__0 thank you for the feedback in my clinical experience the emotional dysregulation is the biggest overlap between adhd and bpd theres even some discussion within academic psychiatry about the discovery of a new subtype of adhd emotional dysregulation well certainly add the overlap of bpd and adhd to our list the list is pretty long so not sure when well get around to it but definitely worth looking inton__label__0 schematherapy ifs or act is also an optionn__label__0 i have adhd as well and find it so hard to convince my brain to do thishow so what difficulty do you run inton__label__2 hey i got bpd adhd too and bad all of my dbt exercises came from my own discoveries like art the gym writing etc you dont need to have the traditional dbt exercises for them to work my therapist is really happy with that so we mostly just go over everything else therapywise together in sessions and what my reflections from own practices dbt doesn__label__3 what a great question props to you for working a therapist and moving towards remission man im smiling so much i love working with people who struggle with anger im excited for you which may be weird but this is clinical work that has been very rewarding for my patients so i hope it will help you learn and grow as well fury and rage when you split is necessary if fury and rage dont have a home with you when youre well my guess is that you think fury unwell and should be avoided fury and rage are to be coveted parts of ourselves treated with respect theyre what help us fight for life so let them in to the healthy part of you its ok to feel angry even be angry with others and voice that to them with compassion let your anger be information if you are being mistreated you will feel it but if you set it aside for the unhealthy part of you you will become a doormat the mistreatment will continue the anger will build up and you lose control and split with fury and rage then we begin to fear it and thus it becomes hard to integrate let yourself be angry with those you love and do so with compassionn__label__0 i only spent a few weeks in south korea but would love to go back my two favorite places experiences where naksansa temple in gangneung and hwanseongul when i went to hwanseongul it was like irl dwarf cave huge endless so big nothing else like itn__label__0 i love this questioni think that the more we go into deeper spiritual practices the more benefit people with bpd will see the key thing about some spiritual practices is that they help us discover the true self this is precisely what people with bpd are missing interestingly enough i sometimes wonder if people with bpd are the most karmically spiritual what i mean by that is that most people have a karma where they arent forced to learn meditation they can go through their lives bumbling along being secure in themselves and are just sort of chillin but people with bpd are forced into learning these skills their karma demands it and thus they end up on a profound spiritual path which is what ive seen in my practice putting the bpd in remission is just the tutorialn__label__0 n__label__0 er processing emotions is a big part of perfectionism but if you want to really solve perfectionism it has to do more with the ego why do you need to be perfect in the first place once you realize you dont need to be perfect then perfectionism goes awayn__label__0 hey not dr k but i am an adhder in a relationship with a pwbpd we seem to have similar issues as you are facing my undiagnosed adhd triggers their diagnosed bpd symptoms making them feel neglected and rejected and their bpd symptoms can cause me to feel rejected and ignored its a balancing act we are still trying to figure outn__label__0 i dont know if this was answered but ill try to answer it as i had the same question a year ago the answer is no at least not without years of therapy the reason being is that the fp to a borderline is a toxic codependent relationship no relationship can be healthy when one person expects the other to be the center of their world and pins their happiness and wellbeing on them as a person with bpd you have to learn to care and love for yourself before you can have a chance at a healthy attachment and relationship make yourself your favorite person and not someone else hope that helpsn__label__1 what a fascinating question im gonna take a stab at this but this is somewhat spitballing and i dont have a ton of clinical experience with koreans with bpd but i did grow up south asian and certainly have family members with pd so lets think through this what are the core features of bpd on an internal psychological level lack of stable internal identity fear of abandonment emotional dysregulationso when it comes to a cultural manifestation what are the features of korean east asian south asian culture that are different from the west east asian and south asian cultures are more community oriented face and public displays are very important are more hierarchical less independent how does someone with bpd meet their emotional needs they lack stable identity so they live vicariously through their children if my child succeeds im a success if my child fails im a failure so putting a lot of pressure on their kids demanding a lot from them if im afraid youll leave me because im abusive im going to become incredibly controlling no friends no dating or if you date im going to hate on anyone who fosters your independence you stay with me always and if you go off to college in order to keep you close ill express whatever it takes to keep you close ill cry ill throw fits ill find excuses to bring you home ill find excuses to come out there given the importance of face i can accomplish a lot of my goals through histrionics if i make a public display people will give in everyone will want to keep me happy so i dont embarrass them ill also martyr myself if i feel abandoned its all your fault look at everything ive done for you psychosomatic illness if my behavior drives people crazy as a last resort i can get sick thatll make people love me care about me and remember if people are displaying symbols of love and affection that wont make me feel abandoned if im feeling abandoned ill call you because im having a heart attack and then ill know how much you love me the more inconvenient it is for you to come the more ill know you love me so ill call at the most inconvenient times your so is proposing not today theyre not im having a mi so fly back from canada or wherever the hell you are because i need you because im dying now the scary thing is this sounds like an awful lot of people i know so maybe bpd just masks as the most extreme things of culturally acceptable behavior controlling vicarious living etcn__label__5 lotta great questions lets go through a few of themhow does stimulant medication help stabilize emotions stimulant medication stimulates our frontal lobes which can inhibit our emotional circuitry when we get our emotions under control our frontal lobes control circuitsare slamming the breaks on our limbic system emotional circuits stimulants strengthen the brains ability to regulate emotions and impulses as for the question of bpd and childhood diagnosis this gets a bit tricky to my knowledge there is no age requirement for the diagnosis of bpd in the dsm that being said i would be reluctant to diagnose a personality disorder outside of conduct disorder in adolescence simply because personality changes drastically during adolescence we think about bpd as an established personality but personality is so fluid throughout our teenage years that the dust hasnt settled which makes a diagnosis potentially problematic that being said there is very good evidence that early intervention in adolescence is really important at helping kids so even if there isnt a diagnosis of bpd i think it is reasonable to help a kid with a traumatic upbringing the treatment may be very similar to treatment for bpd whether there is a diagnosis or not such as dbt mindfulness psychotherapy etc last question is what is the difference between bipolar disorder and bpd bipolar disorder is a mood disorder where moods persist for some amount of time weeks to months and in the case of rapid cycling still weeks iirc the definition of rapid cycling is at least episodes in year in bpd we see a lot of emotional lability over the course of minutes to days the other big difference is that the emotional lability in bpd is often heavily influenced by external circumstances whereas with bipolar disorder it can even be completely independent of those circumstancesn__label__6 ahmm what an interesting clinical presentation if i was teaching a class and we were reviewing a case heres how i would teach itso a few general things mood stabilizers can absolutely cause fatigue to be worse so what can we do as clinicians patients use mood stabilizers especially things like lamotrigine to help manage emotional dysregulation so if mood stabilizer is causing fatigue one thing we could do is build up nonpharmacologic skills meditation dbt to manage emotional dysregulation or psychotherapy to manage the roots of the emotional dysregulation once we have those on board you can pull the mood stabilizer down or off this should help with the fatigue i would then ask the class what other considerations are there in a patient like this what would you want to rule out optimizethe student who says people with bpd and adhd are both prone to substance use and substance use can lead to fatigue over time so id want to check for their level of substance use and ideally help them remove stimulants and sedatives from regular usealso want to make sure pcos treatment is optimally managed and lastly what has direct benefits for fatigue we want to make sure we do a good differential cbc for anemia checking tsh etc and optimize those things most students should get to there on their own then id ask my last questionafter we do all that are there any evidence based interventions we could use to improve adhd bpd and fatigueand the answer is mindbody practices like yoga or tai chin__label__0 the media portrayal of bpd is often quite negative the crazy exgirlfriend is usually a caricature of bpd people with bpd can be abusive just like anyone else we also know that people who were abused are more likely to be abusive so i wouldnt think of it as people with bpd are abusive butpeople who were abused are more likely to be abusive people with bpd are more likely to be abused i havent looked at studies examining whether people with bpd are more likely to be abusive specificallyn__label__0 i would see any mental health professional in your area a diagnosis of bpd after mins sounds highly unusual you usually need someone who understands that this is a baseline pattern for you and not an acute situation any good outpatient mental health professional should be able to do thatn__label__0 thank you for sharing your journey im grateful that our videos have helped you in some small way i cant wait until research starts looking at things like dance and other interventions for problems like bpd super curious what happens in the brain and body when you dance or even watch videos good luck to you on your journey and namasten__label__0 healthy relationships can sometimes be very confusing for people with bpd a healthy relationship can trigger fears of abandonment which can be difficult to tolerate and make the experience worse cant be afraid of abandonment if theres no one to abandon you the really harsh irony of bpd is that relationships are often times really hard but are also really helpful frequently a clinical relationship is a good first stepping stone to establish some degree of connection and work on abandonment with solid boundaries so that the patient feels safe if you can learn to trust your clinician you get a roadmap to trusting other peoplen__label__2 if you already have an appointment i would go ahead and tell the clinician basically what you said in this posthello dr soandso i understand that this is treatment for anxiety but i have recently been wondering whether i could have bpd ive had treatment for depression and trauma which both felt helpful but also felt incomplete any thoughts on how to approach this situationn__label__3 i know this can be hard but therapists will frequently see patients at reduced or even no cost most of us are in it to help people and many therapists have the luxury of taking reduced fee or free clients secondly meditation and mindfulness have been shown to help people with bpd so you can start there it isnt a substitute for treatment but has therapeutic value lastly theres some evidence that a stable relationship can help stabilize bpd but sometimes thats out of your hands so if you can ask around to see if someone can take you at a reduced fee aside from that meditaten__label__2 ask as many questions as you want ill get to them as soon as i can im not too familiar with jordan petersons views on bpd or what context he explains them in in general i think peterson is quite clippable especially on the internet ive gone through his whole course on personality and i think it is excellent we have pretty good data that bpd correlates with adverse childhood experiences aces and early life trauma it is possible that inadequate socialization is one example of this as for misdiagnosed adhd i think there is some overlap in terms of emotional dysregulation and it is possible that the two are misdiagnosed on occasion ive had some patients who can achieve remission from adhd symptoms with stimulant medication and that doesnt make sense if the source is traumatic because well stimulants dont cure trauma i do think that most people with adhd end up with trauma of some sort the yt video explains this and theres more detail in dr ks guide determining which sources are credible for mental health info is a huge problem id start by looking for some degree of clinical experience the second thing is stuff that resonates with you there is a lot of varied clinical experience and clinicians will come to different conclusions we also know that finding the right therapist is really important even if all of them have the same degree the last thing is that a reputable source will likely be wrong on somethings and almost always incomplete thats the nature of the internet the more indepth you go the less likely it is to be viewed so all of us struggle with reductionism deep dives never get watched so we have to try to simplify stuff when you simplify you get closer to being wrong the last thing to consider is that even if it is a reputable source is what they say evidence based i try to do my best to be clear that i sometimes make recommendations that are based more on my spiritual training than medical training and that this isnt evidence based so sometimes youll get prominent medical influencers wholl take a stance on something but they may not take a stance based on science or even their clinical experience so be wary of thatn__label__0 thank you so much for your answer i appreciate it and if you search up quiet bpd you get results like people internalizing their feelings instead of snapping on others and hiding their true feelings lastly this sounds so much like me but im pretty young to get diagnosed anyway so im not going to read much into itedit i think the best word to use instead of snapping is splittingn__label__0 this is exactly how what im like im a graphic designer and i i think in chose this profession because i dont have to interact with people most of the time but over time i have found that i get most of my validation from work and thats what makes me try so hard and yes i also implode instead explode when i splitn__label__0 this is why breakups are so traumatizing we dont lose another person we lose ourselvesrelatablen__label__0 no its the how to move on in your life processing emotions one so good hahan__label__1 thank you so much that really resonated with mealso made me tear up a littlei do think furyrage is unnecessarybad when im not splitting and ive been avoiding it strongly thats likely whats causing an accumulation and therefore reaches murderous rage levels when im splittingboth me and my therapist has missed this so far but you came to the rescue i find asking for help to be almost always a good thingkeep up spamming those aoe heals cheersn__label__0 okay got it thank you again for the help dr k also im not sure if you missed the second questionn__label__0 thank you doing my best with the cards i have been dealt i try to do good deeds everyday and be productive have adopted lots of animals and give them much affection and want to give them a good life they mean the world to me i didnt give a shit about my life until about years ago but since then i have found a lot of passion in life and i know that even though there are so many horrible things happening on the planet every second i dont let those thoughts consume me anymore and try to focus on the good things and the things i can make a good change for wish you and your team the bestn__label__0 thanks for sharing and good luck to youn__label__0 sadgen__label__0 deletedn__label__2 funny you link them i actually did adhd testing and apparently i might have it except some questionaire i filled towards the end about my childhood dont even know if i ticked correctly after all the testing said i dont so now they are also considering medication for it but insurance would not cover it because i dont have the dx so idk if i can afford adhd medicine i get therapy but not a full dbt program it feels like its not enough to control the emotions but yeah maybe i need to look into it moreill consider guanfacine but from what i know it had never been safety tested for adults and since it affects blood pressure might be worth to consider strattera probably is better studied but its freaking expensive toon__label__0 deletedn__label__2 thank you for your in depth reply i think my therapist is focusing on mindfulness lately not so much the other two modules and re additudemag its banned on radhd for a reason i dont think they give any sources why these medicines would be best mindfulness does work when you decide to use it but yeah i first have to get to a point where i dont hatefully split on myself where convinced of my own awfulness like it can take a couple hours until i am able to finally apply a mindfulness technique when everything has been set on fire already even when i know i didnt do actual badlike even the slightest social interaction these days is too much and shit but yeah if my doctor thinks it should be an adhd med then ill rather try that than another antidepressant if it takles rsd without turning everything else to shit im sold even if i have to pay out of pocket lol just such a hassle to get these medicines like i could get an antidepressant from my gp but that really makes you dependent of a psychiatrist especially with a diagnosis like minen__label__2 im on lithium and ive been on it for a few years now for depression this was well before i was diagnosed bpd with lithium being toxic i believe it can be if youre over the therapeutic limit in your blood its something your doctor will monitor and make sure youre within it i personally didnt have it affect my weight gain i have other medications i want to blame for that but peoples bodies react differently hopefully for you it doesnt developthe only real side effect ive noticed is the tremors i get through my arms and especially hands it can get bad enough where i will spill most of my drink from a glass and at best i cant write or struggle to put toothpaste on my brush ive read it was meant to be temporary but ive had it since first starting its something ive accepted to deal with because lithium made a lot of improvement to my mood and im scared to hop off itall that aside make sure to speak with your doctor about all the concerns you have because its your body that will have to deal with any other effects its good to have things clarifiedn__label__2 seroquel for outrages it sedates me and for suicidal thinking whenif it becomes too intense ativann__label__2 they dont sell ativan in my country bc of druguse i will try serquel again had forgotten about that thanksn__label__2 i would love to know the answer to this i have had issues with every medication that i have taken currently taking wellbutrin and it was okay until we upped the dosages which my dr says i have to do to get any affect i want to step back down and see if the nausea goes away i am glad efferox is working for you that one put me into a nasty tailspin i find it so fascinating that same pill can effect people so differently good luckn__label__1 when i first started lexapro the nausea was debilitating i bought a thing of nauzene at walmart gor it works within minutes and works for several hours for sleep i would take the long lasting dramamine and that would help a lot too ginger and lemon tea was also amazingn__label__0 do you take it with or without food try the oppositen__label__1 i agree its crazy how different things affect everyone differently ive tried wellbutrin and it worsened my symptoms but hopefully the dosage works out for youn__label__0 ill definently try that once i get paid and the ginger tea ive tried peppermint but it makes me worst so hopefully thatll work better thank youn__label__0 ive done bothn__label__0 good luck and if nothing is within reach the only thing that helps when theres nothing are full deep controlled breaths until its not so unnerving bc i know for me when im nauseous my anxiety level is up too which makes the nausea worse and then its an endless cyclen__label__2 i totally feel you i hate changing meds i had some guidance with my gene testing as to what meds would work for me every time ive switched over the last years and cymbalta was the worst withdrawals even when going slow taper i still get brain electric zaps dizzynausea and more depressed im switching from zoloft to fetzima over the last weeks and i wanna choke and kill a mutherfucker someone else or myself the heat in the gut the feeling out of your mind its bearable right now i have also been on estetamine nasal spray twice a week for a month i have not seen a lift or lightness i know bpd takes coping and emo regulation skills to help the ketamine only helps with the blues but for fucks sake i tried to peel my skin off after i self harmed last week its a rage thats unbearable my husband even had mentioned to my psychiatrist that he was concerned when i get mad he thought i was gonna smother him hahn__label__0 ive heard of gene testing but i also heard its so costly i hope one day i will be able to do that if i survive through all this the brain zaps from the withdrawals are awful i tried to not take it every day and it was so bad i was going to cut a bit ago but i stopped i was laying in bed thinking about scratching myself until i bleed so i got up and broke my razor to use the blade but i stopped after a little bit bled a little bit my husband texted me saying that his advice is that none of my future relationships wont last if i dont seek help he also told me to learn how to deal with my problems on my own and told me that he doesnt see us lasting i ended up taking mg of trazadone because quite honestly i dont feel like i want to wake up when i fall asleep i feel trapped with this painn__label__1 the gene testing was covered by my insurance thru my husband luckily i know a lot of people dont have it sadly bummer to hear about your husbands thoughts of you yes we need support and help psyco therapy and dbt best for us no we cant do it alone my hubby and i have been together years and still its hard for both of us i actually didnt get diagnosed until years ago he told me the other day that when he saw a shrink years ago when he was going thru a tough time after his heart surgery that after he told his dr about me the dr told him hmmm sounds like your wife has bpd be careful with that one its a nightmare we are the ones they warn people about dont go out with her haha my husband never said anything till now so its like he always knew how bpd ers are so he knew how to deal with it he never engages gives me space and just listens of course sometimes he gets mad too hopefully the goal of feeling better and living a life as best we can will happen for you and i someday but it sure as hell doesnt feel like itn__label__0 i hate reading that other ppl with bpd can smoke weed because im jealous i absolutely can not smoke because i start thinking about my self perceptionn__label__0 i smoke when i need to understand things so to read books watch instructional youtube videos and make plans for projects or outings if im not stoned i skip sentences or zone out and come away missing big parts of what i need to know i dropped out of college with a pile of incompletes the first time while sober i graduated with a in a stem program the second time stoned for everything from day so no one knew the differencen__label__1 i self medicated all my life and nothing ever really changed i just kept on doing it until a couple of years ago now i walk ever day take vitamins meds for my adhd no meds for bpd i fast about six hours every day drink water cut out caffeine nicotine alcohol and cured meatsnitrates i feel kinda boring sometimes but i can at least feel that first year wasnt that fun its a lot easier to control my reactions to triggers now before i felt more like i was just blocking themn__label__0 every day all day weed is what keeps my temper and my tongue under control loln__label__0 weed makes my bpd worsen__label__2 i dont use any drugs or substances or drink im on bpd raw dog moden__label__2 never my dad did alot of drugs even when i was a kid i learned to be high functioning and stuff everything down i did have a bad relationship with alcohol alcoholism runs in my family i have been sober since may may was a bad night and the next day i told myself it had to stopi now use art therapy journaling yogameditationchanting physical activity walkingstrength training and lot of therapy to manage my anxietyn__label__1 i smoke super regularly ive said it a million times do any of yall like recognize my un shits crazy but im also autistic and it takes the world from to a niiiice or lower if i really need it keeps overstimulation at bay slows down my brain so i dont overthink as much etc alcohol is the thing i need to stay away from makes me too weepy and cynical loleta i used to take antidepressants but dont anymore weed isnt a replacement but its a supplement im also not chronically depressed anymore lol yippeen__label__1 yes i think weed saved my life sometimes bc i stopped sh ing when i started smokingaround years old when i wanted to sh i would smoke and be able to calm down just like any med it has side effects though trying to cut down use now that im more stablen__label__0 i smoke on and off i am also a heavy tobacco smoker so puffs from a join incapacitate me for about hours cant have weed in the house because on weekends i start smoking at am if i have it but indeed weed is the only thing that makes life bearable for men__label__0 yes dailyn__label__0 i have tried it once but it just wasnt for me made me more paranoid but im not against someone using it if its specifically to improve symptomsquality of life i dont think theres evidence its good for the long term thoughn__label__1 yes and manage two dispensaries and go to cannabis business college you can manage cannabis and daily life but you also have to be very self aware of the fine line between medical use and addiction tendencies from reliance no meds have worked for me besides just cannabis and natural psychn__label__1 i smoke marijuana daily and also take wellbutrin and i exercise two days a week a combination of running and weight trainingn__label__0 i do it makes me feel like a personn__label__0 i do weed helps me a lot for when i care too much which is all of the timen__label__0 not any more i used it and alcohol to numb the too intense feelings it made everything worse longer term totally sober now and definitely coping better with everythingn__label__2 it made my suicidal thoughts and attempts worse and fucked me up for life permanent generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder now not worth fucking with weed or drugs when you already have fragile mental health i wish i valued my mental health more when i did it so i could avoid thisn__label__0 i dont smoke but i absolutely eat some gummiesn__label__0 i started maybe a year and a half ago because i felt like i had a bit more control over my mood with it and it helps me a lot with that and with eating moren__label__1 i smoke every day but edibles are truly my shit and it helps a lot with anxiety and resetting my focus when my brain starts doing too much ive been off meds for years and weed has been the best alternativen__label__5 weed is my medicine it has less side effects seroquel was awful for me after being on and off over meds i can definitely say weed helps me the most im able to keep a clear head and practice my cbt and dbt in real life it eases the edges off my anxiety and depression enough that they become tolerable even approachable im sober from alcohol years as welln__label__1 i used to but my therapist told me i shouldnt do it as i take pills for my disorders so they might not work at their fullest if they interact with weedn__label__1 i have my medcard because my state hasnt legalized it yet and i decided to quit all my medicine i was on antidepressantsanxiety pills plus migraine medicine plus taking antiinflammatory med the reasoning i told my doctor was that i was tired of being a test subject because i was spoon fed new antidepressants since i was weed saved and changed my life doctor was happy that my quality of life has gotten so much bettern__label__0 hell yeahn__label__0 i have been a heavy cart user for like years now its really done a number on me and not in a good wayn__label__3 i used to but im completely sober now i realized that it was just masking my issues and stopping me from making any real progress psychotherapy doesnt work either when using drugs since i got sober ive been able to get into remission from bpd ill definitely never go back to smoking or using ever againn__label__0 yeah for like years works great sometimes i know i need a break when i start smoking like grams a weekn__label__1 ive learned that no therapist could ever help me so i found ways to self medicaten__label__0 yesn__label__0 yesn__label__0 if i didnt have my carts id probably go crazyn__label__0 its my escape it calms me down but if something mejor happens while being high then i feel it moren__label__0 its my me tal medicine but oh so much more than it is that it helps with a decent amount of my heds stuff and thats a bitchn__label__0 yes it keeps me from going completely off the deep end most days and i emphasize most because sometimes ill just be high and crazyn__label__0 i like molly moren__label__0 i consume a hit of thc tincture on a near hourly basis i used to smoke but i have asthma so it was not good for me normal edibles do nothing for me so i moved to tincture and havent look back it is not as fast acting as vapingsmoking but it still maintains the high i need to stay stable best i can just keep taking it to keep me going i do know i have an actual physical addiction to it if i dont use i shake and get the sweats i honestly could handle the withdrawal symptoms if it didnt also change my emotions after not taking enough i havent been sober for more than days once when i was in the psych ward since when it became legal heren__label__2 it helped me and drowned me at different times of life when i was suicidal i got dependent on weed and there was least productivity in my life but now that im taking medications i use it like a recreational thing and it helps me with my minor mood swings sleep nightmaressleep paralysis and many more the difference is now i dont exploit it but use it very consciously and its the best thingn__label__0 non__label__1 on stuffthatworks the nd listing below dbt is cannabis lmao i smoke weed for the most part everyday the only thing that actively helps me not turn into a monster when im spiraling or upsetn__label__0 yep i used it to replace alcohol successfully for years but now i drink a lot too so i need to get that sorted its one addiction after another for me and weed is the one that i seem to be able to manage some days it can make my anxiety worse but thats normally when im physically unwell or i have drank alcohol as welln__label__2 im so happy to see everyone being so open and honest about this topicive been on and off different meds now ive been on and off therapy and out of everything weed is the only thing that hits a wellness spot in my brain almost like a switchwhen im high its like a cloud lifts out of me im not calculating nor planning everything im not frustrated by things outside of my control money other people the weather etc i dont need to convince myself to do chores or things that would benefit me like exercising or cooking a nice meal i just flow i focus on what i am doing at the moment and i flow from one thing to another without resistance it tunes down all the intense feelings that come with bpd especially frustration anger and sadness it also helps me with something which i dont know if its a bpd thing or a me thing which is always outlining the things i need to do and stressing out about not having time or dreading doing any single thing like i said above i just flow dishes need doing i go there and do it im so much more productive and also i feel so much like my essence the me i really am if that makes sensei am vulnerable and authentic and happy i enjoy my own company a thousand times more idk weed just gives me something medication hasnt been able to give me which kind of sucks because i dont want to depend on it but i dont know what else to tryn__label__0 i dont im scared to active shizophrenia if i got the genesi rarely seen stoners being stable in the long run so i avoid itand also dulls the mind and in long term make you lose iq points or somethingn__label__0 no but i have taken delta here and there because the dissociative effect isnt nearly as strong as with delta smoking marijuana is just awful to me derealization is what triggered my panic attacks back when i had panic disorder and agoraphobia even though derealization no longer has a terrorizing effect on me anymore it is still extremely unpleasanti cant handle the head high and sometimes just a couple pulls off a bong or joint gives me that shaky icewaterrunningthroughmyveins sensationand when a strain is very low in thc it just doesnt do much for me body nor painwise hempderived cbd with no thc also has no effect on anythingn__label__0 ever since i had an episode because of it i had to stop because it started triggering me so much anxiety and spiralingn__label__0 i use delta legal cannabis in most us states edibles and tinctures it helps ease my anxiety and cope with mood swingsn__label__0 only thing to help men__label__0 using almost daily my entire adult life smoking eating vaping microdosing small amounts of edibles for anxiety the past few years microdosing has done wonders for my bpd because it calms me down while keeping a clear mindn__label__0 weed makes my anxiety worse and i used to smoke joints a day i financially cannot do that anymore and ive been cutting down to smoking flower about times a week and my dab pen also times a week so i get high maybe times a week my anxiety has greatly improved butttt my eating disorder from years ago has emerged weed was the only way i was able to get myself to eat without thinking so hard about all the consequences and calories now im back with my eating disorder brain and its a daily battle trying to eat without feeling guilt and shamed for my bpd weed has also helped but not heavily if im in an episode the last thing i want to do is go smoke weed and help myself calm down i like to wallow in my sadness or anger until my eyes are too tired to continue crying and im so dehydrated my head hurts i just end up putting myself to sleep but sometimes i am able to walk over to my rolling table and roll a joint it almost always calms me down and makes me laugh off my episode like the crazy bitch i am then i think damn my brain is really whack and i should probably not depend on weed to mellow it out so idk i think my times a week smoking is good for me i cant afford to smoke a lot anymore anyway so i am doing alright with that and like i said my anxiety has greatly improved especially the anxiety i would get when drivingn__label__0 removedn__label__0 i have a deep love for weed but i cant handle it ive always gotten way too in my head and dissociate no matter what strain quality or quantity i start thinking everyone around me is bad or using me or sees through me i become too aware of myself that i cant focus on stuff going on around me it also confuses me because i cant distinguish whats real or perceived during my observations under the influence buuut once in a while i love to do it home alone and remember why i dont do it for looong periods at a timen__label__0 i used to a lot in midde school but ive stopped mostly bc it gives me panic attacks sometimes id rather buy weed from a dispensary so i know what the strain is and all that but like im not and i cant smoke in my house id probably get a cartn__label__0 i love love love weed i smoke it every day but currently on a break because of healing from a surgeryn__label__0 years its like getting my emotions dressed for the dayn__label__0 i dont use regularly anymore now that ive moved back in with my parents but i used to take an edible a few times a week whenever i felt my emotions getting too much looking back on it though because it takes hours for edibles to start kicking in for me im pretty sure the part that actually helped me was just time now what i do is tell myself that if i try self regulating and i still feel like shit in an hour or two ill let myself take an edible and i always end up feeling better within the hour i still use weed for fun every so often but its not nearly as much of a coping mechanism as it used to be for me haha it doesnt help that i have a very strong predisposition to addiction so i got dependent on it to function when i used it too oftenn__label__0 religiously for almost years now turning soon and i debate if it makes me paranoid or feel weird these days but its how i cope and has been since i was liken__label__0 i smoked a lot in my adolescence from about until it honestly never really helped me feel any better sometimes it made things worse there would be times where i would get too high and get stuck in my own head unable to turn off my thoughts they were always dark and so loud but i just kept smoking i couldnt stop myself i didnt even like how it made me feeln__label__0 i smoke everyday as a way to escape and cope from the real world when im high it makes me feel calm relaxed and i actually enjoy myself when sober its a constant barrage of anxiety and depression i also drink too for the same reason but i try to lean towards smoking more i like it more than drinking tbhn__label__0 i used to be a huge stoner for a couple years now i cant smoke without going into a panic attack after a few hits its ruined for men__label__1 i smoked for years im february i went to rehab for marijuana and finally quit and i have never felt better it was my th time at rehab i should get a punchcard and my th should be freefirst time was for coke were for oxy i couldnt be happier now i have my adhd anxiety meds prescribed and i microdose for depression which has helped so much i also tend to oversharen__label__0 i used to be heavy smoker now it skyrockets my anxiety it also contributed to me becoming lazy and boring person so now only from time to time and i want to make myself space to do something cool on itn__label__0 ive smoked weed since i was and im now but i think being able to self medicate has helped me so much and i definitely can relaten__label__1 yes it helped get me off benzos after years of taking themn__label__0 it helps in almost every way one way it doesnt help for me is it triggers the munchies and i have a tendency to binge sometimes so the weed exasperates the binging i think it can make me a little introverted at times as well but at the same time it eases social interactions so its not a net negative sociallyn__label__0 i do its the same for me as soon as i take one hit i can start to feel my anxiety and other symptoms lessenn__label__0 yup started around have had many yearormore long breaks once to test if it was the source of my issues my issues are the exact same on or off of it ive smoked maybe months of this year in total but if it was i doubt itd make a difference for me personallyi prefer hash or vaping feels clearer and dont like to get too high sometimes i make ediblesi enjoy it i can see how the experience varies for peoplen__label__0 i used to smoke a lot but then one day when i was smoking my niece started talking to me while i was high and i just had this sudden crushing depression hit me then after that any time i smoked i would get massive panic attacksn__label__0 i smoke it and it really helps me i can get motivated to clean my house and feel quite good about myself and i sleep so much better toon__label__0 if any of yall are the type where weed causes severe anxiety i discovered this stuff called rick simpson oil and it has changed the game for me i take the stuff every single morning and it has helped me so much it doesnt give me that same anxious paranoid feeling that smoking flower does it almost just quiets my brain and makes me feel very peaceful would highly recommend to anyone dealing with anxiety racing thoughts rage etc its really helped men__label__0 im a year old male and i use hemp derived thc daily for my bpd symptoms as i live in a illegal state that shit has helped me tremendouslyn__label__0 yea it helps with my self harm but it makes depression baddd after a while like i cant feel anything anymoren__label__0 it really calms me the fuck down and gets me in my element im happy and im not overthinking or spiralling into self sabotage i used to take it every day but due to circumstances now very occasionally i wouldnt smoke like i used to if i could again but i miss it so much it also helps me focus if i take a lil bitn__label__0 every day it helps ease my anxiety going into work and helps me to not think about how much i want to de after worki know its not good to block your emotions but id rather smoke like a chimney and not cause myself harm than stop and not know how to manage my crippling emotions i am in therapy and working on how to regulate myself without weed but im not a doctor so until i learn those skills its all i have to helpn__label__0 yeah i usually do a gummy a night on weekdays a little more on wknds ive had my card for close to years too i love it its helping me quit drinking too which is huge for men__label__0 yeah i knew it was a problem ie doing it but i did it anyway now im back to doing it after months sober i do think my mental health was better in the sense that i didnt wait for the day to end just to get high but other than that i was a mess then and a mess now a loselose loln__label__0 i take edibles but i dont smoken__label__1 ive been smoking pretty consistently for the past ish years it takes a decent amount to get me anywhere now i take my meds every day and so therapy as well but it really does help so muchn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 everyday and honestly i wont say it doesnt have its cons but it really gives me some peace of mind and useful reflection moments works well specially at the end of hard daysn__label__3 i cant my antidepressants and other medications make me get serotonin syndrome i got it when i smoked for the first time in a while it was horrifying wish i couldn__label__0 oh im a really bad stoner i get it friendn__label__0 yesn__label__0 ive been smoking weed since i was sixteen diagnosed at seventeen by a psychiatrist and am now and i still feel like its the only thing that kind of helps me regulate initially i started smoking for pain management as i had my first laparoscopy at fifteen to diagnose my endometriosis but once i noticed how it made my moods stabilize its like i never looked back i will say that it has made some of my experience with doctors kinda shitty because theres constantly weed in my system which looks bad to them i guessn__label__0 i used to smoke weed i stopped last novembernot by choice lol and im waiting for it to get legalized where i live now so i can go back to smoking itn__label__1 yes so happy since december ive been getting legal medical weed in the uk and its really proper stuff like green sorbet and gorilla glue cant wait for the prices to go down though i wish more people knew this was an option in uk as with using it as medication i couldnt stand being stood up or lated by dealers anymore its so good you can even bring it on holidayn__label__0 im a medical marijuana patient loooove weed it helps a ton with my cptsd and just coping with a lot of the emotional intensity of bpd it also helps my pain from chronic health issues i have too i smoke all day pretty much most of the time truly a miracle plant for men__label__0 weed has truly gotten me through some of my worst times but i honestly really want to quit i smoke everyday and while i feel like it helps my anxiety i also feel like it makes me dissociate more and not engage in as much of the activities that actually make life feel worth living i kinda of just want to keep some emergency weed around for those moments im really feeling out of control with my emotions and not use it otherwise loln__label__0 been smoking everyday sincen__label__0 i do had to learn the hard way that some strains are like fuxking medicine made of gold and some strains can literally induce psychosis it might sound lame but i take it way more seriously now was kind of just an avoidant stoner before and it seems to work definitely an interesting line to walk but for now its excellent harm reductionn__label__0 nothing has helped me the way weed does ive been struggling for years and only that has helpedn__label__1 weed is not the solution its a cyclical coping mechanism that comes with a downside ive smoked weed for years a lot and it took about years to figure out how to do it rightwithout isolating from friendswithout ignoring hygienewithout ignored exercisewithout ignoring a good dietif you think youre struggling with any of those things you should consider cutting back to just before bedtime and focus on dbt to get through the rest of the daysucks to hear that ive learned the hard way that weeds not the solution its a coping mechanism once youve learned dbt skills and how to handle your weed then you can pick and choose what days or periods of time you go crazy with weed but i do recommend taking a good look in the mirrorn__label__0 i hate weed it gives me horrible anxiety and derealization i used to use it to help with sleep take an edible right before bed so it would hit while im already asleep and keep me asleep idk if my digestivedetox system is fucked but i would wake up still high so i had to stop cuz i was showing up to work highn__label__1 i have for the past like years usually at least timesday its like a reset button for me its not fantastic but i used to drink a little too much so its one step at a time yknow my personal goal is to be able to live drugfree comfortably whether or not i can casually use doesnt matter to me but smoking has helped me a lot without it the past years of my life wouldve genuinely been wasted from feeling wayy too much and not being able to deal with it i smoke for the numbness so that i can keep living for a while without emotions getting in my wayn__label__0 there was a period of maybe years where i smoked all day everyday during the pandemic before i realized i had bpd i recognized that weed quieted down a lot of my inner turmoil it was interesting because id smoke with my bf and he would get high and i would just become normal hopefully that made sensen__label__0 nope causes my anxiety to skyrocket to uncontrollable levelsn__label__0 i am a regular smoker and pretty much smoke all day every day except for at work but thats in the works lol i honestly feel like in certain episodes weed really doesnt help me like it helps other people i wish it did but im having to learn and force myself upon different coping mechanisms because of this i also think it heightens my paranoia slightly which is what helps episodes and meltdowns happen sometimes we have a love hate relationship weed and in__label__0 socially not habituallyn__label__1 i have adhd bpd and autism and i suffer a lot from an unstable sense of self which the weed helps but at the same time doesnt help im definitely calm enough to react and be constantly full of rage and adrenaline and misery but im constantly shifting identities in my head and i dissociate a lot imagining future conversations with people just unconsciously until i zone back to reality then when there is no weed im just miserable dont even want to wake up just keep skipping the days until i can buy weed again so for me weed is helpful it is to some degree a medicine for me but my inability to function without weed is quite unhealthy for me at this point i have tried to get quetiapine which i have been prescribed in the past and it works amazing for me but it caused constipation so i stopped taking it but for me it has been the only thing that has allowed me to be functional and clean and do everything i need to do in a day and do it calm and with rational consistent thinking and processing because my biggest issue aside from adrenaline rage mood swings and just being quite numb a lot of the time so empty like an emotional silence my biggest issue is processing and memory i can talk to somebody and an hour later ill know ive spoken to them but no idea whats been said i wont remember much because my mind is constantly thinking thinking thinking unless i am numb in which case its silent and almost robotic and controlled thinking analyzing people studying their motives why do they exist the way they do my head is a scribble of a mess but weed shows movies and games are my best distractionn__label__0 i dont currently drink at all but i do smoke daily still i havent noticed a difference on days i dont smoke vs days i do and neither do those around me i just prefer it to help with pain and anxietyn__label__0 yesn__label__1 i do ive been consistently smoking for about three years now ive found it has helped me so much more than the countless of prescriptions ive tried to take it feels healthier to take medicine from the earth rather than chemicals compacted into a pill i never liked how i felt on antipsys but after i got into smoking i dont need medication anymore i guess it varies from person to person but ive felt more in control of my symptoms the past three years than i have my entire lifen__label__2 used to got severely addicted to that in addition to other drugs yes you can get addicted to weed spent four years in hell got sober two years ago im never turning back not even for a second weed is poison for my brain same as all other drugs sure it can help some folks especially those with chronic illnesses but it sure didnt help men__label__0 nope it makes me have panic attacks and feel weirdn__label__0 i do i see it as a tool im chronically dysregulated and need serious help to chill out while i learn how to selfregulate its quite a process as an alternative to pharmaceuticals while im getting there i love it always did enjoy it and now they send it by urgent courier officially what a time to be aliven__label__1 its the perfect mood reset and has helped me more than any medicationn__label__1 yes it is my medicationn__label__2 yeah i think it helps especially with the side effects of my adhd meds helps with sleep and stimulates appetite affects everyone different though so what might help you might make someone else feel terrible do what you gotta to get thru i reckonn__label__1 ive been smoking weed very consistently for about years im on antidepressants but it doesnt do anything i was on that for over a year before i started smoking it also helps me feel less anxiety and calm down the mood swings i dont recommend it for anyone with bpd but different strokes for different folks do what you feel is necessary but please be smart peoplen__label__0 yeah i been smoking everyday for like years lmaon__label__0 yeah if im having a heavy mood swings i just know to stfu and roll upn__label__0 yes but at this point its become a problem for me and id like to quitn__label__0 i smoke a ton and so does my friend w bpdn__label__0 i smoke but im trying to cut back and its been working sometimes depending on the strain it can make me super paranoid and almost dissociative so i tend to stick to indica because it helps me relax i really only smoke now to help sleep because i have bad insomnian__label__0 yes and id be way more insane without itn__label__0 i know i don__label__0 its my medicine too especially during a split or breakdown makes me stop caring a little and stops me from overthinkingn__label__0 i smoke weed and i find its either amazing or im erraticparanoid and i can never tell which one its going to ben__label__0 no i used carts pretty much all day every day for about a year or so until i got pregnant it completely shot my memory and i swear im so much dumber than i was before valedictorian of my high school free ride to college and now i barely have basic knowledge of most things i wish i had never touched it plus i used it periodically while pregnant and i still get paranoid that i may have messed my daughter up somehow but i did tell myself i would never let her see her mother high years later and still havent touched it it made me lose all feeling and was too good so i became dependent on itn__label__0 omg i wish it worked for me everytime i smoke it makes my anxiety and paranoia way worsen__label__0 yes everydayn__label__0 ive been smoking weed every single day for the past yearsn__label__0 i can smoke around myself and people im extremely comfortable with and i get this effect but if im at a party or feel like i have to mask my bpd symptoms go insanen__label__0 no it makes me anxious overloaded makes my tourettes worse and i feel like sht when i sober up from it but im also autistic and have did so i cant say its just because of bpdn__label__2 i used to get high all day everyday for like years but i got completely addicted to the point of getting high before finals high during job interviews high going to family and friends weddings and a lot more situations where i shouldnt have been getting high but i couldnt stop myself from doing it it also eventually started to lead to an extreme increase in my mood swings and si which left me very unsafe i went to a dual diagnosis rehab about a year ago which was for treating both mental illness specifically specialized in bpd treatment and addiction and there has been a significant improvement in my life and bpdthis is not me judging people who get high or saying people shouldnt be getting high because i think most people are perfectly fine smoking a shit ton of weed its really just me telling my experience with it since you were asking whether people usedn__label__0 smoking daily with bpd it doesnt take care of my anxiety but helps with appetite and sleepn__label__0 yes it helps me relaxsleepn__label__0 years as a daily smoker yes it does help however my advice would be to try to develop healthier coping habits as well i did not and now i am heavily depressed because i cant function without it but at the same time it prevents me from achieving almost anything as i have spent almost a decade training myself to be so stoned i am numb to my emotions i dont really know how to achieve anything else its gotten to a point i realised the last few years i have only worked to afford my rent and weedmedicine i am used to struggling to afford groceries because australia has really high rental prices my tolerance is so massive im spending minimum aud a week on weed alone it really is quite fucked up so yes take advantage of the fact it cant actually help alot with bpd i just hope you are able to do better then myself at regulating itoh and the worst part when it goes dry and i cannot get it my bpd comes in with a vengeance to the point i start getting very bad thoughtsn__label__1 i smoke waaay too much for my own good been doing it for the last years helps me more than any meds ever didn__label__0 yes totally and unfortunately due to the fact that i study i cannot allow myself to smoke bc then i cant focus so its kinda double sided bc it helps a lot but i cannot smoke as i wish bc my abilities are limited so i smoke every weekend and some nights in the week after im done with everything but i had to train bc i had smoke for years straight without any limit and i was a messn__label__0 i smoke everyday and it helps me reallllyyyy goodn__label__0 i smoke a lot of it and i know people say it doesnt help etc but i feel as though it completely eliminates my anxiety symptoms aswell as bpd ive been diagnosed with various other things such as agrophobia but a few puffs on a blunt and i can leave my house with little to no anxiety when i used to have panic attacks a dayn__label__2 cw mention of self harmi used to be near enough permanently high until i explored with my therapist that excessive smoking can be another form of self harm which i have always struggled heavily with when i looked at my life under that lens i basically did replace cutting with drug useso now i control it i go smoke free like of the time now with the small reserved for absolutely awful days where i just need a respite from spirallingoverly heavy emotional moments and also social situations with other friends that smoke it equates to me roughly buying once every ish months having a few days where i partake and then going smoke free for another monthsn__label__0 i smoke i keep it at a low intake what i cannot do is drink alcohol today is my month sobriety from alcohol weed used to make me super paranoid but i am used to it now started at am now so a couple hits will do and i feel closer to myself less irritable honestly it helps me connect with children better and i am more present i suppose setting intentions beforehand also helpsn__label__0 ive been smoking for the past years it helps keep my emotions in check and im not as fast to respond so i get a bit of extra time to think about what im doingn__label__0 weeds great sadly very hard to get in my countryn__label__0 weed is the only thing that shuts my brain off i first tried it when i was to help with chronic pain and nausea and was pleasantly surprised when i noticed i didnt have a constant internal dialogue telling me what a fuck up i am a lot of the time when ive smoked is the only time i can let myself feel my feelings for my partner too which is something ik i need to work on while sober but until we get there this is my solution loln__label__0 i smoked all day every day from i was often in a haze didnt deal with my emotionsissues i would just smoke and numb myself when i got pregnant i stopped and i started back after my daughter was born i just limit it to after work it helps me actually relax vs my mind racingn__label__0 daily even if it makes me anxious and in my head sometimes prefer it over sobriety where i cant relax or concentrate on thingsn__label__1 i smoke weed often as well about grams a month usually at night before bed to relaxi also have adhd and bpd so it helps me with a lot of anxiety however im trying to cut back as im trying out adhd meds currently honestly weed never helped me focus but it never really gave me anxiety either so i guess you win some you lose somen__label__0 constantlyn__label__0 i was a heavyyyy smoker and thought that weed helped reduce my bpd depression symptoms it wasnt until i quit that i realized how much worse it made my mood swings and depression my mood is pretty stable now i feel less insane lol and im able to better maintain my relationships without using weed so frequentlyn__label__2 its a tricky subject because people have such strong opinions about it on both sides whats unhelpful and annoying though is when people have no problem with someone being on an antidepressant or any other daily pillmedication but then say that marijuana is harmful or has no longterm positives or whatever if its making you lazy and useless then for sure find something else however if its keeping you from unaliving yourself or keeping you focused on therapy and healing or lifting you out of the spiralsplitting then smoke away my friendn__label__1 weed helps me more than any drug i triedn__label__0 its good for anxiety yes but i try not to depend on it too often or make it my whole life cuz i tend to get addicted to things very easilyn__label__0 i do it makes me feel something positive and its mildly euphoric relaxing and a mood lifter i work help desk in it and its stressful for me i love solving technical problems and helping people but i have to deal with people on the phones all day and its mind numbingly drainingi originally started with edibles to take the edge off and so i could sleep it graduated to flower as a post work relaxer after work i want my mind to go blank and to sink into whatever furniture im sitting or laying on ironically its also helped me not overeat which had been a problem for the last decade or solistening to music while high has been nice as welli have to take breaks though if i smoke everyday for a week i start to feel brain fog which isnt fun when you already get bpd brain fog from time to timewith that said with thc everybody reacts differently do extensive research before messing with any psychoactive substancen__label__1 smoking weed never felt good until i did a bit of research and got a vaporizer i didnt wanna encourage anything haha but i have much more control over how it affects me now the different parts of cannabis react to different temperatures and a common cigarette or joint burns at around degrees c sry dont know fahrenheit should be double i guess but thc for example is released at celsius and its the most psychoactive so i avoid it cbd is released at and thats the temperature i usually smoke weed at and it calms me but i use it for clubbing or having sex as well since i dont drink i dont like the feeling at all when i want to sleep i smoke at c and i can go to sleep pretty much immediately doing the research definitely changed the game for me because initially i was thinking about trying out medication amd found weed to be a good or better option for me since it feels more natural i had some bad trips when i smoked joints especially with tobacco and it never happened again after switching to the vaporizer maybe thats something to considern__label__0 it takes some time to get used to the high obsessive thoughtsn__label__0 it used to have an absolutely horrifying effect on me like seriously it made me dangerous to others and myself i was in a really dark place to begin with teen hormones feeling lost and being dependent now im a bit older i can depend on myself and i also got a lot better it still worsens my anger management problems it makes me numb and demotivated so its still not positive but overall it has a much lighter effectn__label__0 i feel very very similar do you have adhd ive always felt weed made me more productive because of my adhd not bpdn__label__0 no lie me too when i smoke i am able to focus more and think straight and not end up doing something i might regretn__label__0 i feel kinda boring sometimes but i can at least feel thatouch that cut me deepn__label__0 i do almost all those and smoke weed in the evenings in the past two years ive walked miles volunteer walking dogs at an animal shelter and biked milesit has helped me get through some of the worst parts of my life at some point though i may need to change these parts toon__label__0 cosign on all of this i literally selfmedicated with weed alcohol sex all at different points in my life i got off of everything its an interesting way to live especially since we feel emotions so strongly no longer having that crutch but to your point id rather feel than numb its hard but its what is right for men__label__1 this is the best way to help it ive got heds playing into the mix of everything and that isnt fun i am trying to get into a waiting list to get diagnosed because that will give me a much easier time getting all the stupid stuff diagnosed and proper meds if i go to doctors now ive heard enough stories of people getting a bunch of bs meds before stuff helps and before they get a diagnosis half my frustration comes from the way my body feels at times psychology and physical health correlations are weirdn__label__0 do you think your happy though im worried id do all that and still just feel emptyn__label__0 my bf made the same change turns out he realized the weed made him useless and now he doesnt even want anymorehe started therapy seriously and things are getting bettern__label__0 hahahah me toon__label__0 doesnt stop me from smoking it everydayn__label__0 hown__label__0 samen__label__0 you have my upmost respectn__label__0 congrats on your sobrietyn__label__2 me toooo i get soo depressed if i drink my adhd adores weed and the effects and i reallllly relate to the thing it really brings my reactions down to a very understandable level hahaha im on antidepressants and smoke im always interested in maybe weaning off my meds though especially latelyn__label__0 thats so interesting i enjoy weed but only in the right setting i have to be in a good mood before doing if not i get very paranoid and overstimulatedn__label__0 thats amazing ive felt that with similar issues its calmed down my nervous system so i dont wanna do dangerous or risky thingsn__label__0 i feel you i always have atleast g in the house but ive tried to stop smoking in the morning i tend to wait till about pm now if its a day off that isn__label__2 same for me substance abuse is one of the symptoms so obviously a lot of people have had a similar experience i was wondering whether you ended up going to treatment or if you just got sober on your own i went to rehab for months a little over a year agon__label__0 i agree here it brought on my first panic attack gotta be careful with weed you may not even know you are predisposed to having a bad reactionn__label__0 i gotta get some edibles two years of a pipe has really ruined my lungs i agree it helps my focus soooo muchn__label__3 me too seroquel was hell escitalopram is my current and i love it seriously impressive that youre six years sober doing that with anxiety and depression is extremely honourablen__label__0 also it helps my processing disorder plus my adhdn__label__0 yeaahn__label__0 same getting addicted to carts ruined my fucking life and made my bpd much worse thankfull i finally went to rehab last year and things have been so much better sincen__label__0 thats great to hear how does it feel to be in remission do you still have intense emotionsn__label__0 hahahahah best way you couldve put it fully agreen__label__0 interesting i started using weed to deal with my eating disorder too but not to eat more in fact it made things worse for my ed at times because im bulimic and munchies caused the absolute worst fucking binges for me the constant thoughts about calories how i needed to weigh myself literally fucking times a day and telling myself how ugly i was were overwhelming and when i smoked for the first time it was the first moment of any peace and quiet in my head since the eating disorder had started which is why i became addicted to it instantlyn__label__0 of course not for everyone tho weed affects people so differently and definitely can make things worse for some peoplen__label__0 that doesnt sound very healthy please be careful its still a substancen__label__0 aww thats really frustratingn__label__0 being properly medicated is something i wish everyone had im sorry it took all that for you to end up in this place but its impressive that you did d im always in awe of anyone who overcomes any addictionn__label__0 me too not legal so im wasting so much money on priced up dealersn__label__0 hopefully one day i can get it to a nice healthy amountn__label__0 this is actually super helpful and interestingn__label__0 is cbd effectiven__label__0 how are you avoiding the vapors that come off at and only inhaling the vapors produced atn__label__1 the therapist i see says i dont exhibit any adhd symptoms hes offered to send me for psychiatric testing but at this point theres still bigger fish to fry than needing to be stoned to follow a recipe for dinner for context i smoke about a gram a monthn__label__0 its a trade off right i want to feel everything but nothingn__label__0 i would suggest taking a break to see how things feel if everything goes to shit you know its a false prophetn__label__0 its really nice to not feel alone if only for a moment ty for thisn__label__0 i dont understand it still but bpd really does cause actual pain especially tied to the favorite person mine actually hits my stomach like clubber lang eating yogurt daily helpsyou could probably do more good for yourself by learning about it and testing stuff out far as i know there is no medicine for it well at least that drs are willing to give you i have to address it with weekly visits one crap insurance its like a a month not counting the dr visits ive done more on my own honestlyn__label__0 for me i thought i felt happy stoned all the time but in reality that was never happiness it was just silly laughing and did feel good i always get back to normal and made no steps to getting better i got fat i didnt read anything that was helpful hell at that time i didnt even fully understand bpd because i never bothered to research it was just words that were as useful as ymca to me i noticed at some point pot became a hobby for me i could tell because once i stopped i had all these useless devices around that cost me money i got new hobbies that fear of being a zombie is ironicn__label__0 im really glad to hear that i worry about telling people what works for me them trying it and it going really bad ty for posting thisn__label__0 it can make you anxious or erratic after continued usen__label__0 for me its because it makes me isolate which just leads to feeling even more lonely and causes more sin__label__0 thnxn__label__3 i have adhd too and a therapist once told me there is a trifecta of drugs that hit us differently and relieve our symptoms but due to that are much more addictive to usweed cocaine and alcohol i have struggled with all of them and often it was a combination of all three ive now cut out cocaine and alcohol completely thon__label__0 very valid if i get overstimulated while high i definitely get pretty miserable myself i try to check my mood before i smoke but its also very second nature to me so that doesnt always happenn__label__0 yep unfortunately i ignored the signs and the rising anxietysmall anxiety attacks and then i had a massive panic attack while very stoned and my entire world was flipped upside down in one night i just dont think people with psychiatric disorders should touch anything psychoactiven__label__0 thank you so much im so i had plenty of years drunk and horrible im so glad you found a med that works for you its such a helpful tool its taken quite a few years to learn to balance all the thingsn__label__0 yes i can understand your side of it as well when i was deep in my eating disorder anorexic i was barely eating at all and it did help me eat more and the loss of control over the munchies definitely affected my mental health negatively and made me feel ashamed everytime id eat too much after smoking but with time i was able to get back to a semi normal eating routine sometimes cutting a lot if i wasnt smoking as much and sometimes eating too much and throwing it up because i felt guilty weed still helped me stop depriving myself and saved me from hospitalization when i first had an eating disorder of course as most people with eating disorders i went back to it multiple times my weight has never been consistent throughout most of my life now that i dont smoke as much i do eat less than the average person id say but it isnt to the point of disordered eating and i dont feel the need to count calories or control every little aspect of what i eat sometimes i eat a lot and feel ashamed and throw it up but not nearly as often as before i do think the weed had an overall positive affect on my ed but it also made me feel so out of control at times so i understand what you meann__label__0 its alright i can live without itn__label__0 thank you honestly i live in a place where people dont believe in mental health or addiction and whenever someone validates my feelings absolutely love itn__label__1 my favorite dbt skills are carrying rockscrystals that reinforce positive thought about myself literally inception the idea im a good friend lover etc safe space visualizationand breathing techniques for when i feel suicidal or want to punch my own face inn__label__0 you wont get high but it does naturally make you less anxious if you dont like the thc high id highly recommend smoking or taking cbdn__label__0 what for what exactly do u mean by cbdn__label__2 incredibly effective for any sort of trauma treatment like bpd some people i know even get prescribed cbd treatments for physical pain like back issues if just relaxes the mind and body naturally without feeling intoxicated at alln__label__0 tbh i dont know how it works either haha but from what i understand its that above a certain temperature everything gets burned while beneath it mostly certain cannbinoids of course its not but i feel immense differences depending on the temperature i use theres lots of explanations on the internet though i just didnt get into it that much since it worked well for men__label__0 oh wow im about g every two weeks maybe less psychiatric testing is always good to rule out stuffn__label__0 i felt the same when i read your original comment we are strong and we can get through anythingn__label__0 bpd is a small part of my puzzle i just hit enough markers for diagnosis and not strong i have bursitis and other similar issues in my shoulders and hips and get mcas flair ups and such i get nerve pain and pinched nerves and so on ive spiralled bad enough to inflict pain but it is a different kind of pain in comparison i know i have eds and just lack the diagnosis half of my family is diagnosed and my brother is now going in for diagnosis and thats why i know there is a waiting list with less than a year wait timeif i went through and thought about it ive got a decent list of suspected health issues to get diagnosed in my personal opinion what got me a bpd diagnosis is the cumulation of other neurodivergent condition mixed with medical condition resulting in fatigue joint pain muscle achiness and nerve pain adhd and so on so forthyogurt does help i dont have it daily but i have had times where i am obsessed with just eating yogurt for weeks at a time it also helps with gastro intestinal stuffn__label__0 hey knowledge is power you know what you do might not work for others but if what they are doing doesnt work either in my point of view its worth the shotedit typon__label__0 this i can use it very sparingly but back when i used to smoke it everyday all day it ended up with me going to the psych ward everyone is different thoughn__label__0 i know someone with a very similar experience im greatful i tried it despite the risks as it really has changed my life but its always something people really need to be careful of but even then you cant control a reaction like that so sorry you have to deal with it still to this day i have a similar issue with lsd messed me upn__label__0 im wondering how you were able to get to a point where you stopped counting calories and werent trying ro control every little aspect of what you eat because as hard as i try that way if thinking is automatic to me because of how deeply ingrained it is so i just cant stop itn__label__0 thats so great to hear my country is definitely one of those too being validated and heard is seriously the best hahahan__label__0 cbd is what is inside of weed it produces the calming effects without the head or body high effects is not addictive many countries around the world are finally recognising its health benefits so those with conditions such as bpd or ptsd often get prescribed cbd oil which you just have a drop or so of daily to keep yourself calm through the daythc is what makes you high and fuzzyparanoid depending how you are with weedn__label__0 yeah so its more to contain the spiraling thoughts by making the action a mindful activityn__label__0 and we can do it feeling the bad and the goodn__label__0 adhd as well fun fun nerve pain is the worst and im sorry youre affected by it i really wouldnt wish it upon my worst enemy i have many of these issues as well heres to hoping this is actually all a simulationn__label__0 ty im so classic bpdadhd i just always feel like im full of shitn__label__1 yes i know that lol thats why i talked about it in my reply but i still dont know what the question was about did they mean if it helps my bpd or if i use cbd cannabis which is the only kind of legal thing in germany and if thats enough for self medication thats just what i was confused about oh and youd never get cannabis prescribed for bpd in germany youd only get it prescribed when you have decades of unsuccessful medication for chronic pain issues but we can buy legal cannabis anywhere its without thc because here the thc itself is illegal not weed per se but consuming this weed is still illegal its so stupid its sold as incense because its legally not a food very stupidn__label__0 that is super confusing ahah least it seems your country has many loopholes if i am understanding correctly ah right i thought your question was asking what cbd was i cantwont comment if it will be enough to medicate you usually its taken in combination with therapy depending on what its needed forahh yes i have heard germany is not a fan of the weeds lol here in australia i know someone who gets a large amount legally mailed to their door every month just because he has a back conditionn__label__0 oh man that would be lovely haha its pretty stupid honestly the legal weed is way less potent but also much more expensive politicians have been talking about legalizing for years but nothing happens so yes until then we use the loopholes hahan__label__1 its good you havent give up it took me years to find the good combination of meds that actually help me im afraid of the day i become tolerant to them and having to find a new ones but i will not give upn__label__5 ive been on wellbutrin xl for at least years well for years and upped to past year does nothing for me now unfortunately i i also have treatment resistant depression so ive been through every antidepressant class since right before prozac was invented years ago i had deep brain stim surgery with meh results and staph infections as a result of the hardwarebut im having ketamine infusions on a weekly basis to pull me out of an acute depressive episode and my dr is putting me on ketamine maintenance infusions every weeksits really working well my mood is steadily improving anxiety is decreasing and my sleep is improvingdont know if this is an option for you its expensive but so is remaining depressed unemployed and eventually suicidal which was me mos agon__label__3 there isnt even real prescription stuff to treat it you can treat accompanying stuff with meds depression for example but bpd does not have a known medication to treat it there are some reports that some medication helps some people but its not a given and you absolutely need to see a doctor before taking such thingsn__label__2 try looking into cbd it doesnt help with bpd necessarily but it helps with my anxiety and my overall mental state my brain isnt as chaotic on the days that i take it and my low moments arent as low as they generally would be i refused to take meds again after developing one of the side affects from abilify but when my friend died and then my brother was killed a week later i fell into an extremely dark place my friend recommended cbd and ive been using it since it isnt a miracle cure all but it definitely made my overall mental state and physical its helped with pain from injuries i have better than it is without taking itn__label__3 without a prescription i dont think so its usually a case of trying things like antidepressants anxiety meds mood stabilizers or anti

see your comment earlier not on this account a lot there is medication for both anxiety and paranoia i do not know a lot about them other than all the ones i know require prescription some of them are

mom id love to be a zookeeper one day though i love animals loln__label__1 im a child and youth worker and currently i work in a group home for teenage boys age i really enjoy what i do rn but i also am very passionate about this field in general i wanted to be a part of this field so i can support youth when i was a kid i wasnt supported well by the adults in my life so going into this field i wanted to be able to support youth who have felt the same and who need an adult to really care about them in their lives where i work now can be intense at times i work directly with youth who come from trauma and who have mental health and learning disabilities i feel like my bpd can be both a blessing and a curse in my current setting its a blessing because i know first hand what its like to have trauma so i feel it makes me more able to empathize with our boys many times the kids will say we have no idea what its like but there have been so many kids ive met in this group home where ive connected on similar situations ive been in i used to be a very angry child too and so i feel like this makes me able to understand the kids on a deeper level the bpd can also be a curse sometimes the jealousy of not knowing if im a good enough worker issues between coworkers can sometimes trigger me and tbh even working with the kids can be intense at times which has triggered my bpd they just know what to say that punches ya in the gut there are times i have full blown cried because of how a client has treated me but all in all i really like what i do even the harder moments ive met so many different youth there and have really enjoyed being able to support and hangout with them and be a part of their lives and tbh i do feel like my bpd does affect my job sometimes and thats okay where i work mental health in the workplace is supported really well and everyone there is a great support system i also genuinely feel that no matter where i would work in this field my bpd would affect it these days ive gotten really good at regulating my emotions identifying my triggers and allowing myself to feel what i need to feel which makes work easier there are days where im sure it might be a little more obvious to the boys that im not on my a game or that im a little off but i feel my bpd has been extremely manageable where i work ive had jobs in this field in the past as well where i felt my bpd was more noticeable at work before this job i worked at an after school program for elementary kids and i loved it i worked there for years before i ultimately got fired bc of new management and the new management not supporting me in a time i really needed support and my bpd was the absolute worst at my last job there have been things that frustrates me like overstimulation but tbh i do think that my bpd affecting me at work is more manageable when the management there is understanding of staff mental health im allowed to feel upset and process it rather than just shove everything down before i got fired at my last job i felt supported before new management took over but when they did it was like i wasnt allowed to have feelings emotions i had to get over it and work is more important etc overall i really do enjoy working with youth and feel this has been a job and career has been beneficial along with able to help my bpd i love what i don__label__0 marketingn__label__0 i work fulltime in marketing and communications i honestly dont think my bpd influenced my career choice ahaha who knows my bpd can one hundred affect it though if i dont keep it

regulate my feelings a bitn__label__0 i study medicine ofc theres times where i feel extremely overwhelmed and right now im having a sucidal phase but theres so much that i learned from studying medicine that helped me understand myself better take better care of myself and be empathetic of what i went through and what emotions i experience instead of punishing me by starving myself or hurting myself or just simply trashing the person i am in my head i try to be more understanding and think about the cases we see in the hospital and how i need to continue to do what i always wanted

for a related field though not the exact same i think that its definitely possible to achieve your dreams even if you struggle with bpd so long as you again help and support that you need and allow the institutions you studywork at to be aware of any accommodations you may need in place this is under the assumption that this is possible where you are working and where you live of course

military didnt let you go after being diagnosedn__label__0 i did years before medical discharge years ago at the time i was diagnosed with ptsd depression anxiety had a bpd diagnosis months after leaving it explained a lot i find the military was actually a really good place to have it probably as i was raised independent and pretty much emotionless all the best brothern__label__0 i had many years in too until i had a crisis it went from good to the deepest darkness ive ever feltn__label__0 also a stripper its the only job ive ever been naturally good at and the longest ive ever kept the same job getting really tired of it though and need something thats recession proof so im trying to start my own tax business now dealing with the self doubt trying to start a business is really hardn__label__0 i used to be a stripper i also have worked as a sex worker i agree with you about not just bpd but all the cluster bs being common in that fieldn__label__0 congrats youll do amazingn__label__0 would i be able to talk with u and pick your brain im very interested in researchn__label__0 same i work rd shiftn__label__0 this is something im interested in how did u get there and any advice on how to get there i wanna major in finance because i want money but motivation is really hard for men__label__0 can i please work for youn__label__0 this is the dreamn__label__0 lemme inn__label__0 samen__label__0 what schooling and experience did you do to get into this field if i may ask im at a crossroads personally right now career wise and i want to just make a change i have a biomed undergraduate degree that i finished in but im guessing that i need another bachelors at the very least to get into this field plus different certificationsn__label__0 how you get the job and whats the qualificationsn__label__0 same here other comorbiditiesn__label__0 wow it actually worked for that u r lucky for me it just put me to sleep emotionally and anxiety wise i still felt the same i do have insomnia tho so it was useful for thatn__label__0 same i think for me its that theres distance literally and figuratively i split on them sometimes but i dont have to see them every day and the social interaction is superficial enough that i can mask how i feeln__label__0 how did you get into uxn__label__0 could you explain the benefits a bit more im thinking about possibly considering disability or something similar because im very horrible at holding down jobsn__label__0 im currently in my claim for mine i also have physical disabilities too tho i was literally thinking the other day that i dont think i could honestly work another day in my life i get so anxious and the people that talk to me are so disrespectful id literally end up slapping someone nowadays for talking to me like thatn__label__0 omg ive had this happen to me too and once when i worked in a store and they quickly wanted me off the salesfloor because i was crying cared more about how that looked than how i feltn__label__0 how did you have the strength to finish your masters because im losing my fucking mindn__label__0 how do you become onen__label__3 im a bartender as well i do the same and i think tha because of these same reasonsaspirations is why ive gotten more comfortable dealing with people outside of a bar situation so side story i have been diagnosed with bpd before never gotten help it took an fp to ask me if i was borderline to make me realize i needed help it took another customer that has been in the mental health field to give me the help to find therapy and help me to admit to myself that i am a toxic person at times but i can get better it was a hard pill to swallow i wasnt receptive to treatment and i was resentful at first i am so glad that these people came into my life and approached me because i wouldnt have gotten help i would still be ignorant of what bpd really is nor would i have even thought of it i have been shamed and dismissed so often its hard to ask for help i am also now admitting to myself that i can be very toxic my drug addiction was a big way to stuff a lot of my bpd symptoms like the fp the paranoid hallucinations the splitting im finally in therapy and getting testing done to see if i am also npd or another cooccurring diagnosis i jokingly tell my customer that they are a job perk because i have gotten a few tips to handle coping that i didnt have beforen__label__0 is there a title for your job that is purely to convince people to spend moneyn__label__0 but i want to learn how to bartendn__label__0 thank you for sharing that im glad you have such a lovely memory of someone caring about you to remind you that you matter and its not ok to hurt yourselfn__label__0 that pulls at my heart strings because ive had similar experiences with clients seeing bandages not from self harm and commenting so i feel for you and the guilt you must have felt in that moment our clients are some of the most misunderstood people out there but they are generally so caring and do have a connection with us in their own way im happy to hear you are doing better and that you have an awesome jobn__label__0 thats awesome good for you family therapy wont be easy but i think having a background in bpd will help understand some of the situations youll encountern__label__0 thank you im hoping to be a psych np one day and be as good as mine im going through school right now and learning about mental health and bpd is my passion im currently doing a project on bpd right now i want to help other people going through mental health issues with my own experiences but sometimes depression and bpd can make it hardn__label__0 i definitely feel some of that like i need to put others before me or if i care too much of myself other people will see me as selfish and not like men__label__1 she probably feels like she doesnt know how to do her job correctly and that is vital for a nurse who is giving medicationn__label__1 please dont be afraid by what i said the two jobs i had before in nursing was a retail pharmacy job and another at an urgent care and both were just too much stress for me and then i worked as a psych nurse which wasnt a good idea given my mental state i say that about my current job now but once i get to the nursing part im learning about tech duties right now its just assessment and meds and will be less of stressing out over screwing up when putting people on the dialysis machine or getting blood all over the place because i didnt put enough pressure it was all about finding the right environment for me and just holding on until i can be a nurse just because i had a hard time doesnt mean that you will i think you should still pursue being a midwife i think that even if there are hardships youll find it worthwhile when you get to your goaln__label__1 im pretty good at separating work from my feelings occasionally an alleged subject will yell at me in a way that is a bit triggering because i want to take it as a personal attack but i work on separating work my feelings in a healthy way in therapy my work pays for my therapy so thats always a plus its definitely a learning curve but my therapist had helped so muchn__label__0 thank you for what you do im interested in becoming an emergency dispatcher im already in the medical field in my country there is quite strict psychological assessments did any diagnoses affect you when getting this jobn__label__0 ive always wanted to do this how did you manage to get the jobn__label__0 its dependent on different factorsi got diagnosed with bpd after being in for yearsi can argue that im able to do my job even with my condition since ive been doing it for years in a very high stress work environment normally bpd can initiate you being chaptered out if they find your condition makes you unable to perform your duties the decision can pretty much change depending on who your psychologist issome people get the boot right after diagnoses others can continue in the service if they show they can manage its all kind of dependsn__label__0 ive done this too and omfg emphasis on recession proof when that bullshit hit every club was like a ghost town and i was thinking back then that there was some kind of epidemic i was basically working for free and still expected to pay the house fee those bastards refused to consider lowering it to accommodate glad they got sued later for even operating that way in the first placen__label__0 yeah absolutelyn__label__0 ive worked retail before its insane lol especially this time of year but if u want some retail employee humor and find minutes to laugh u have got to watch this youtube videon__label__0 deletedn__label__0 just kind of worked out that way i was at a small tech startup where i basically did every kind of writing they needed from there i was able to specialize more with each jobn__label__0 i get universal credit and dla and yeah definitely go on benefits cos living with bpd is a nightmaren__label__0 the main step is finding a good and successful disability lawyer to take your case but your doctors have to be the one to support your claim that you dont have the ability to work because of your problems be concise in how many daysalso hours help too in a row it affects your ability and also the scale of how bad it is more often than not youll have to refile for disability after waiting months for the first disapproval its a lengthy process so make sure youre somewhere you can stay safely while you await your answern__label__2 i was doing my masters part time it took me yearsi was also working multiple jobs one fulltime and couple part time on call type jobs to ensure a roof over my head i was so busy that every hour counted i worked as a first responder at the time i remember wed have a client od and die and id be like to my work team hey guys i gotta go submit an assignment ill come back to debrief in hours but every semester end i would have cathartic breakdowns i would feel like i had nothing a void that i was drowning in tons of anxiety i ddnt know what to do with nothing weeks of not having school even tho i still had work not having school just felt so hollowit got better towards end of year being able to cope with the break of it id also stopped using hard drugs about a yr before grad school so everything felt so raw and counselling program makes u do so much inner work in some ways what i was studying and reflecting was stabalizing and stirring at the same time i am sending u all the good vibes to help u get through itn__label__0 a pharmacy technician or a phlebotomist retail pharmacies are the way to go no school just on the job training thatll allow you to move up take a course through your local college they will teach you the basics then theyll put you in a phlebotomy internship programn__label__0 i feel the same way about people ive met through work i think in the industry most bartenders suffer with mental health problems too so its much more comfortable to talk about those types of things and bond with each other youre soooo lucky to have such a good customer like that my place doesnt really have regulars but honestly the trials and tribulations of hospitality are a huge help with growing with your bpdn__label__0 marketing loln__label__0 huh i never would of thought honestly i assumed based on my understanding with how my gf is that it wouldnt be at all possible for someone with bpd to make it through the military but i could see how the structuring would work to help stabilize thingsn__label__0 i wasnt dancing back then but after covid i learned my lesson and realized i need something more reliable i didnt plan on doing this forever any ways but originally planned to go into interior design to get out of it but realized that im gonna be in the same boat again if theres another recession or pandemic so i need something more stablen__label__0 whats ngmi i have a dying urge to succeed i need money and i know it doesnt solve my issues but it would certainly help and ive had this drive to be successful my entire life im extremely goal oriented its just a matter of making myself do work for my majorn__label__0 oh im so sorry to hear about those hard times you are so strong ohh i need to do mine in months until june thank you so much for the kind words and wishing you the bestn__label__0 oh lmaooo very cheeky way of describing that job ahahn__label__0 gifgiphyrausohoirycgbdownsizedn__label__1 the illness isnt his fault but choosing to be unmedicated pretty much is on himeverybody has limits your feelings just mean you are reaching yours and you shouldnt have to deal with this abuse eitheryou need to figure out a mental health plan for yourself selfcare and self soothing lists maybe a therapist or counsellor to talk out your feelingsyou need to care for yourselfn__label__1 i wouldnt blame yourself for this just because he may be doing this mostly because of his mental illnesses doesnt mean that its okay i think anyone would start to hate someone whos done all that stuff thats pretty bad how he wont take his medication i hope he someday does get helpn__label__0 deletedn__label__2 i hear that too and its true that im trying to selfmedicate and sometimes that leads to having too much in my system would also never happened if my doc wouldnt have stopped to subscribe me lorazepam after yerars because benzos are evil has become kind of a mantra in medicince over the years probably triggered by all the overreacting withdrawalstories i had more issues with ssri withdrawal and i was functioning on a lowdose very well it helped me way more than any other shit i got subscribed or tried out myself but thats the way it is and i have to find new methods maybe a new substance the journey goes onn__label__3 i tried to kill myself a few weeks ago and now i am on some good shit latuda and lamictal were bad on me though now im on abilify celexa topamax and gabapentinn__label__1 good luck to you and your journey bud the path to find your medication in mental is tough you are literally a guinea pign__label__1 its bullshit diagnosed with anxiety disorders with depersonalization and couldnt get a benzodiaphamine even tho there is clinical evidence klonopin works for anxiety with dpn__label__0 deletedn__label__1 there is no dbt groups near me there is a solutions focus and a womens trauma group i just found out about my cousnelour said the solutions group has a bunch of men which im fine with but i dont think the womens group will want to deal with a woman that has beaten on people herself xdn__label__6 alright im going to start with my experiences move into what your doctor is probably thinking and if you say fuckall to those two topics i have four questions that will help us figure out what it is you need from treatment and then we can talk about some ways you can get those things i can share with you as someone who was suicidal on a daily basis and who selfmutilated extensively for a good six or seven years that none of the many medications i was placed on prevented me from experiencing those emotions and some of them actually had some strangely powerful influence on how much pain i could take my carvings got more elaborate or deeper how much flat affect i experienced or even how frequently or intensely i dissociated from myself i think your doctor might be hesitant for several reasons medication is not a solution to borderline whereas someone with a strictly biological issue like bipolar disorder legitimately needs a chemical to regulate their neurochemistry our issues stem from maladaptive thought patterns and a lack of effective coping mechanisms what that basically means is no one taught us how to deal with really hard emotions and its amplified by the way our minds work i know that shit gets overwhelming man when youre in the moment it feels so fucking awful that you cant take it and you dont know what to do you want it to stop please stop it hurts so much please anything to make it stop anything and you end up reaching for that knife unfortunately medication is not going to take that away from you but cognitive therapy will so thats a big upside d if youre suicidal starting on something like an ssri will increase your chances of killing yourself like i said taking that pill will not take away the hurt youre experiencing with that amount of suffering comes a certain degree lethargy i know when i was suicidal i spent a lot of time laying on and staring at the floor lets say youre three weeks in to an ssri regimen and you start feeling increases in your overall energy then something bad happens now you have the same overwhelming feelings and drives but theyre coupled with this new found physical energy you might go for it with gusto and really hurt yourself maybe even check out thats terrifying we dont want to lose you and thats definitely something your therapist is considering psychiatric medications have a lot of side effects weight gain weight loss sleepiness insomnia constipation jitters more anxiety dizziness getting sick to your stomach loss of libido anorgasma its not too fun and the effects last a while id say a safe estimate of the number of medications i have been placed on is at least fifteen which is an exorbitant number and none helped with my symptoms i can get more into that if you like but it seems like youre trying to find something that will help take this pain away from you youre not on an easy path this stuff is nearly impossible to deal with and your therapist not being of much help is bad news bears so lets start with a few questions so that we can figure out what you need from therapy and what you can do to make sure its given to you if you woke up tomorrow and all your problems were gone how would your life be different if your doctor did provide medication what effect would it have and how quickly would it have that effect besides prescribing medication what are the things youd like your therapist to do that he doesnt is there anything else bothering you that youd like to talk about anyways i hope youre safe doing okay and hopefully havent felt like you need to cut today were here for you i want nothing more than for you to be lessened of some of this burden and hurting i look forward to hearing back from youn__label__1 why dont you get a new therapist he doesnt sound like much of a helpn__label__0 if it was my choice i would drop him in a heartbeat but hes the only one i can get at the current moment and if i had free will which is why i cant drop him i dont have a say in it i wouldnt go at alln__label__0 is he even able to prescribe medicine as in is he an mdn__label__1 good point you said psychotherapist not psychiatristn__label__5 psychotherapists are not psychiatrists they do not prescribe meds yes some states require phd but psychotherapy is one of the most intense long term and dense therapy there is i suggest keep him these folks are trained to see if you do need medication maube he feels like youre stronger than what you think you are obviously you been with him for a year i agree with what the other person said above these are points and questions that do confront our illness we bpd do not have the requirement to be on meds theres no meds out there that specifically stops you from cutting or having those intense emotions im diagnosed bpdbipolarand ptsd so im getting meds for the imbalance in my brain racing thoughts manias flashbacks and anxiety and guess what my meds are seizure med for my bipolar heart med for my anxiety and therapy for my depression they dont have to give me psychiatric meds since other meds could help with my symptoms remember its the symptoms they try to treat manias and mood swings not the illness itself unfortunately theres no meds to stop self harm and suicidal thoughtsn__label__4 just to be clear therapy is short for psychotherapy so when you say psychotherapy is one of the most intense long term and dense therapy there is that int exactly accurate psychotherapy could be anything from a fivesession cbt treatment to a tenyearlong analysis in the tradition of depth psychology people often just shorten psychotherapy to therapy because its easier to say just wanted to clarifyn__label__3 you are right i did confused it with psychoanalysis since i was thinking of slavoij zizek at the time i was reading this post and part of it too is my lack of understanding with the differences of practices cbtdbt and all other kinds of therapiesi was under the impression that if they are psychotherapists they gone thru masters and phd and in alot of instances alot of therapists are just certified social workerscounsellors pardon me for that but id like to know how did your point helped the ops concernn__label__0 when i see people misuse terminology on this subreddit i try to respectfully correct them so that confusion is minimized theres a lot of confusing terms within the field of mental health and as a mental health professional im in a position to make things a bit more clear for people who already have enough to worry about the way you said that makes it seem like you took offense so i apologize if thats the case i tried to make it clear in my comment that i was simply correcting you for the sake of clarityn__label__0 yea you did it was very helpful and respectful it would just be more constructive if there is some advice for the op i understand that you have a moral responsibility on correcting folks with terminologies but i didnt see any constructive move for the main concerns that the op is asking but clarification gladly taken and id like to clarify too that however you interpreted my question is not my responsibility nor do i have to entertain accusations as a person in the mental health feild its a disappointment that my question is taken as an offense im sorry if it came out offensive but i didnt see how your correction helped with the main issue on the postn__label__2 well here in brazil theres usually a small document sold with the medication containing all the side effects your doctor probably was a douche for not disclosing this kind of information with you also sometimes we need to see the trade off for medication if everything else failsn__label__1 i used to take risperdal as an adolescent and never had any problems or strong sideaffects with it really you know besides the generally concept that is to make me feel numb and like a zombie although i have heard from others who have taken it that it is capable of doing so much damage mentally and physically to the right person with this being said i heard recently of a huge lawsuit against the company who produces risperdal kind like those commercials you see with yaz or yasmin i think its attorneys that are looking for recruits so if you have a solid case i really would try and get some money out of itn__label__1 i once tried antipsychotics never again if you want to feel like shit there are what you wantn__label__0 i was a minor at the time the medicines were prescribed and im basically still forced to take it to this day i was never told id gain weight or get diabetes even though my mood has improved i still feel very hopeless at times because of the way i look and how other aspects of my health are decliningn__label__2 im a woman and i tried at least different law firms to pick up my case against the people who make risperdal they all said the same thing were only taking male clients who have experienced severe side effects like gynecomastia they all really wanted to take my case and seemed extremely interested in it but in the end it did not pan out with a single firmn__label__1 i gained lbs got diabetes and hypothyroidism from risperdal my hair fell out periods stopped for a year developed severe permanent twitch in my jaw was lactating while not pregnant they never checked my prolactin levels i went to the doctor very sick and im glad i did because that crap almost killed men__label__0 im so sorry you had to go through that my mom doesnt care what this pill is doing to my body she says because the doctors told me to take it i have ton__label__0 that medicine is toxic i really would not recommend taking it for very much longer i would address all of the symptoms youre having as well as some of the research and patients symptoms that youve read and heard about make sure they are keeping up with your blood work your prolactin levels should be checked at least every weeksn__label__2 if youre not a minor now you can discuss changing medication with your doctor just because a doctor told you to doesnt mean you have to you are not their slave you are paying them to make you healthy and they arent doing their job if they are making you sickthere are other medications out there that isnt the only choice to help you if its causing problems discussing changing medications with your doctor is beneficial for you i had to go through several before finding the right one for me because a few didnt work one caused an allergic reaction and one caused suicidal motivation just because a doctor gave me those did not mean i had to continue taking them if i had id be deadif you are a minor you may be able to discuss it as well im just not sure on thatn__label__0 thats rough is there a reason youre stopping cold turkey instead of tapering downn__label__0 i can help you with subs immediatelyn__label__0 unexpectected lack of access i will get back on asap but in the meantime i dont wanna completely lose my shitn__label__1 i would advise to do what you can to get off the benzos a little suffering now will save a lot latern__label__0 its going to be okay try to get something to eat if you cant thats alright drink a glass of water if you can too its ok to be sad angry confused about life take a shower if you havent already today and try to take your mind off your thoughts with something like netflix tv a book etc youre not responsible for whats happened to you but youre responsible for how you react to it deep breaths youre going to be okayn__label__3 no one even any medical professionals on this subreddit can prescribe you a medication that will work for you its simply not in our jurisdiction i hesitate to even say we could recommend whether or not you should go back on medication all i can really say is that if you wish to go back on meds please talk to your psychiatrist or physician about them there are many many medications and combinations of medications out there but it is a process to see which are the right ones for you ive been on three or four medications before finding the right fit for me i need to be medicated because i have chronic panic attacks for no reason but my quality of life is not impeded by my medications back when i was on a different medication i was experiencing nsfw warning sexual dysfunction i wasnt as sensitive as i used to be down there and i brought the issue up with my psychiatrist i said it wasnt a big deal but she said that i shouldnt have to deal with that symptom and she came up with various solutions for me that ended up helping do consider being open and honest with your physician they for the most part want the best for youn__label__3 ask to try out a different kind of treatment i was put on some kind of antidepressant that made me literally nauseated for a whole week vomiting and constant paintiredness i couldnt do anything barely get any sleep honestly not worth it ask for a new treatement and try out different options before settlingn__label__3 it can depend on how your symptoms manifest some bpd people have psychosis or their symptoms might be exacerbated by a disconnect from reality or maybe they have a dopamine excess that causes other symptoms and antipsychotics address that imbalance some bpd people may take medications for anxiety or depression instead if thats how their symptoms manifest the mostbut bpd isnt directly caused by a chemical imbalance thats one difference between personality disorders and other disorders like bipolar having a chemical imbalance or a mood disorder may make someone predisposed to bpd but theyre not quite the same thing there isnt a bpd medication that you can take just like how there isnt a pill for ptsd or trauma in generaln__label__2 im taking quetiapin too for the night it helps me against panic attacks anxiety and delusional thoughts the first time i took it risperidone this medication gave me a huge improvement because im finally able to sleep without waking up in pure panicn__label__3 as another has said bpd can come with psychotic features the psychosis needs to be treatedwere not treating the bpd directly thats what psychotherapydbt are for were treating comorbid symptoms that come along with or comorbid disorders commonly depressionanxiety for examplen__label__3 for quetiapine and bpd its more often than not prescribed as a dampener it dampens emotions and makes you pretty out of it so less likely to act out or harm yourself the dayslong sleeps also add to that it makes you drowsy so helps you sleep too i think they often use it as an alternative to benzos despite the side effects being pretty horrendous in comparison imoeta ofc its also prescribed for actual psychosisn__label__0 omg you get sleeping all day long from that med too my doctor literally gave it me for emotional flooding on my prescription and to take one or two i told her when i take it i sleep for about hours she went huhbut still says i should take iti didnt want to be knocked out for hours i just wanted to be able to not be in mental anguish and not in animal crazy emotional mind unable to use skillfull thinkingn__label__0 deletedn__label__1 olanzapine has helped me more than any other drugn__label__1 the word antipsychotic doesnt do it any favours because stigma sucks like my partner is technically on antipsychotics but theyre for a sleep disordern__label__1 i have bpd and bipolar getting tested for adhd as well and i take an antipsychotic a mood stabilizer and an adhd med these combined meds stop most of my impulsivity and help my mood a lotn__label__1 antipsychotics let me analyse my thoughts before i act on them instead of believing them immediatelyn__label__5 antipsychotics also function at lower doses as mood stabilizers i was on quetiapine abilify but also zoloft and some other ssris for quite some time not all at the same timen__label__3 im prescribed flupentixol and i get it because i self harm quite bad have very intense low moods i also have quite bad pyschotic episodes that often occur in very public places it makes me more relaxed and helps me put some distance between me and my feelings unfortunately it also makes me really tired and sometimes i need naps a day from what i understand its quite uncommon for people with bpd to be prescribed antispychotic medication and ive never met or heard of anyone else taking what i take for what its worth if the flupentixol doesnt work the next medication i am being offered to try is quetiapine however i have met other people who have been prescribed that unlike flupentixol some doctors decide that there simply isnt enough concrete evidence to prescribe and so offering prescriptions arent all that common others are more comfortable prescribing medication in order to treat specific symptoms myself i am prescribed my flupentixol because i have bpd and ptsd and since they make eachother worse my psychiatrist is keen on offering me as much reprieve as is possible which i am greatly thankful for sometimes people need extra help and medication can be a helpful way forward when you need immediate results that therapy alone cant give you here and nown__label__4 fuck that hits home they gave me quitiapine as a regular med even though its only for crisis the last time i took it it triggered epilepsy i only took it for a crisis too i had been off it for a good while by then its horrible its zombie meds like you have the same feelings but they are miles away along with all your other emotions luckily i got a new therapist who is a specialist and is actively giving the treatment required not to shit on my old one but she was in no way apt for personality disordersn__label__4 i dont know because you cant treat a personality disorder with medications just symptoms like depression anxiety or ocd bpd can be effectively treated with therapy dbt particularlyn__label__1 quetiapine helped my mood and helped me sleep at nightbut the weight gain side effect sucks never going back on itn__label__1 my doctor prescribed the exact same meds to me and tells me frequently to take them when i talk about relapse and big feelings i believe her logic is cant hurt or kill yourself if your knocked outn__label__5 my psychiatrist actually took me off all my meds except for my antidepressant effexor and lorazepam as needed since bpd isnt something that can be treated with meds im not really sure if its been beneficial or the opposite something i definitely need to address next time i see himn__label__1 i take two ssris two anti psychotics an anti convulsant and a stimulant trintellex trazodone lamictal rexulti quentiapine vyvanse im titrating off lamictali have still have some psychotic episodes for sure as well as auditory and visual hallucinations at times of stress i think my psych is just throwing things at the wall he listens and writes things down but offers little insight have seen him raise his eyes a few times thoughlolhonestly without them i think id be in legal trouble i have a hard time letting go its helped me in crisis far more than mindfulness ever hasn__label__3 i had a psychiatrist who prescribed me risperdal to help with my anxiety i did my research and found out it was an antipsychotic and told my doctor i felt that it wasnt a good fit i suggested putting me back on paxil my gp had me on it a few years before but my parents stopped paying for my script because id had a good response to that instead she wrote me a new script for abilify and once again i asked why she was putting me on an antipsychotic when i really just wanted something for my anxiety she ended up springing a new psychiatrist on me at my next appointment and i stopped goingn__label__1 ive tried every med under the sun but wellbutrin is the only one that works for men__label__1 because we have delusional thoughts lmaooo but in all seriousness lamictal is a lifesaver med for men__label__1 all hail lamictaln__label__3 well bpd isnt like other personalty disordersit may not be a personality disorder at all at least thats what some research might suggest its up for discussion atm in the fieldthats why in the upcoming icd all personality disorders are mirged into one diagnosis all besides borderline which gets an extra indicatorso yeah taking meds like antidepressants antipsychotics mood stabilizer neuroleptika is a thing with borderline though none of them work against borderline directly but only against certain symptoms and are prescribed on a case by case basis according to which sympomts haunt the patients mostedit all the other personalty disorders are mostly abnormalities in behavior and so prescribing meds isnt a valid solution since patients arent really able to work on their behavior if said behavior is suppressed by medsn__label__4 i take lamictallamotrogine as a mood stabilizer its an antipsychotic antiseizure at certain doses it correlates with symptoms of bptype medication is to treat symptoms as well as disorders people with bpd who tend to be high anxiety may still benefit from a prescription same as someone bpd major depressive disorder there is no one size fits all however x which unfortunately means you have to experience a few different medications or mixes until you find a working equilibriumn__label__2 im on two antidepressants and while i dont feel suicidal anymore i have almost worse psychotic symptoms idk if i want more meds thon__label__1 cipralex seems to be working very well for me personallyn__label__2 so i take celexacitalopram it helps me control my moodsemotions when i dont take it everything is the end of the world i can get stuck in any mood for days anger and lots of crying it helps me so much i dont know how it would effect other people with bpd thon__label__1 i used to take it during episodes of immense panic stress and aggression etc to calm down my therapist and i have been working on me taking it less and less though managed to get through my first intense episode yesterday without it yippien__label__3 i was prescribed seroquel cymbalta and guanfacine g for bpd cptsd all types of depression and anxiety seroquel puts me to bed and levels me out and i usually wake up groggy i recently went down to mg seroquel and im waking up a lot earlier than id like but once im up and going ive got energy yk when i was hospitalized they started me on mg and as pound teenyoung adult it took me out like i was hazy and in a trance until they got me down to i have the tolerance for it now and its one of my most valuable medications bc if i dont sleep i get unhingedn__label__1 benzos babyn__label__0 they put me on invega shots and it destroyed my life ive been taking them for a year before i started to read about it and realized it blocked my dopamine i was dead inside gained a ton of weight developed anhedonia and was in a huge brain fog now i went to another doctor who prescribed me adderallfor my adhd and it made everything so much bettern__label__2 what are these day naps you speak of i am on quetiapine and miratazapine both sedating and never get a good sleep i have to take diazepam to get a few hours sleepn__label__3 oh no quetiapine i was on that for days and i stopped taking it instantly ive never felt so messed up i also researched the drug and its supposed to help patients with schizophreniamy doc put me on ssri escilitopram lexapro for short and its helped with my depression and anxiety it still helps me feel normal if that makes sensei also take propanolol only when needed which is amazing for panic attacks and heart palpitations bad anxiety and angina heart issues i was given that because i had anger spouts and i couldnt calm down lol turns out the ssri mainly helps so i dont usually use propanolol but its there when i need itn__label__1 im taking one rn seroquel that was prescribed back when i had a bipolar diagnosis still helps me balance mood so we kept itn__label__1 antipsychotics also help with repetitive thoughts i want to die he doesnt love me etc and impulses such as self harmn__label__3 yea as of right now bpd treatment is just symptom treatment where bipolar or other mood disorders is a specific chemistry balancing medicationn__label__2 pretty much spot on they call it offshelf prescription for ptsd they sometimes use a blood pressure medication called propanerlol my doctor once said in an orgy of poor biological planning the center of the brain that controls anxiety is right next to the one that controls blood pressure so if we treat one we usually get some impact on the othern__label__1 theres actually a blood pressure medication that i take for my ptsd nightmares that helps me forget them and not have them rerun over and over all dayn__label__0 ah makes sense but its also pretty frustratingn__label__0 one of the diagnostic criteria includes stress related paranoia which is a delusion delusions are part of psychosis it is also not uncommon for people to report hearing voices during episodes which is a hallucination which is also a part of psychosis you can have delusions without hallucinations but only rarely hallucinations without delusions because the belief that the hallucination is real is a delusion itselfedit added the word also to clarify my meaning and a bit of extra wordingn__label__0 as someone who is diagnosed werent chemical imbalances that end up in possible depression just this past year debunkedn__label__0 chemical imbalance has now been debunked as a total myth and a theory that was widely touted in mental health but never backed with any data id stop perpetuating itn__label__0 i also take quitiapine to help me sleep although it only sometimes helpsn__label__0 thisn__label__2 in my case it was exactly that i got addicted to benzos and along came the quetiapinei love this approach of it being a dampener its exactly like that for me and thats what my doctor explained toon__label__1 hey ive been on quetiapine for four years now yes it will make you sleep for ages at the beginning it has a sedative in it i think the basic idea is that if youre asleep you cant have an episode i used to sleep around hoursmg knocked me out at the beginning but you get used to the sedation if you take it everyday after around weeks on it it stopped making me so tired four years later and i now take mg daily i cant sleep without it i sleep around hrs a night and it really helps with my angerparanoiaquetiapine has really helped me but its a double edged sword cant live with it cant live without it good luckn__label__0 samen__label__0 hard agree olanzapine changed my life for the better i gained a ton of weight on it thoughn__label__0 it was like a holiday for a monthn__label__0 that shit made me gain kgs in a month and nothing elsen__label__0 i too have bp and bpd and recently saw an adhd symptom checklist while i know theres a lot of comorbidity yikes do i have almost every single symptom just made an appointment with my psychiatrist it would explain a lotn__label__1 i have all of these tooif you feel comfortable sharingwhich meds are helping youn__label__2 can i ask which adhd and antipsychotic meds youre taking my psych is pretty handsoff and generally lets me try whatever i request but i still havent found anything that helps much the most recent is adderall but besides kind of quieting my inner monologue i havent seen much help anywhere else and was really hoping finally trying to treat my adhd would make a huge difference in the daytodayn__label__1 i was prescribed flupentixol as prn but due to my health anxiety and after reading the side effects leaflet i have decided not to take it was wondering what dose youre on and if you have any side effects and if i should be worried about some of the side effects mentioned like blood clots and tardive dyskinesia and heart racingn__label__1 what do you mean quetiapine is only for crisisn__label__0 yea i honestly feel like thats the reason they prescribed them to me as welln__label__0 im really sorry youre going through thatn__label__1 this is not an antipsychotic lamictal is an anticonvulsantn__label__0 same here my moods were so much more regulated and less up and downn__label__0 here heren__label__3 no cluster b personality disorders are the serious ones as they are disturbed at a deep deep level cluster a and c are more behavioural all cluster bs are actually borderline types including psychopathy and narcissism there is treatment but its specialized therapy not dbt which is just emergency behavioural work bpd can be cured with enough time and moneyn__label__0 its an anticonvulsant not an antipsychotic because it may lower fear and panic it might help with psychotic features but its not an antipsychoticn__label__2 ugh citalopram did nothing for me and made me way worse sertraline makes me just flat which is fine its kind of like disassociating most of the time which i prefer to the lows it also means i kind of just have suicidal ideation vs actually trying and think about hurting myself vs trying so i have time to think before i act ore often than not the real me does come out if i have a drink though panikn__label__0 i take guanfacine its a non stim adhd medn__label__0 im so sorry for me quentiapine makes me sleep hours a day and sometimes when i dont have therapy through the day i am able to sleep for over hoursn__label__1 im on ssri sertralin quentiapine and alprazolam idk what it feels like to be normal but i do agree that sertralin has the lowest effect on my perception of the worldn__label__1 i get worried i will have to be on meds for the rest of my life as my genetic testing revealed that the reason for my strong depression symptoms is the fact that my serotonin receptors dont let in as much serotonin as it should hello adhdn__label__3 the only treatment for bpd that ive found is specialized therapy but no medsn__label__0 offlabeln__label__0 propranololwe also use it as concurrent therapy for akathisia inability to remain still compelled to keep moving symptoms that can come with antipsychotic usen__label__0 prazosin my one true love that stuff has been a miracle for my nightmaresn__label__0 ive just started on prazosin few days ago how long does it take until you feel the difference does it make your dreams mildern__label__2 whys it frustrating the side effects or the fact that youre on antipsychotics at alln__label__0 a delusion is not a hallucination a delusion is a belief in a thought or feeling that has no rational basis for instance believing the government is watching you because they know youre on to them thats a delusion hearing the government spies you believe are watching you talking about you in the next room is an auditory hallucination delusions are often much harder to recognize than the example i provided for years i was convinced that people talked badly about me behind my back all the time literally believing that my bullies were obsessed with saying horrible things about me even when i wasnt anywhere near them thats a delusion zero basis in fact lots of basis in that stress based paranoia took me a long time to realize i was in fact delusional and while it can be a symptom of psychosis you dont need to be psychotic or near a psychotic state to have delusional thinkingn__label__2 so i am learning my comment is a laymans understanding and a pretty big simplification perhaps its more technically accurate to say that bpd symptoms cant all be addressed using neurotransmitter medicationsn__label__3 thats good to know is there a proper term for describing conditions that can be treated with neurotransmitter medications perhaps just deficit or excessn__label__0 you cant fall asleep or you wake up a lot i hope you can speak with your psychiatrist about itn__label__0 try lybalvi it introduces samidorphan which is supposed to help control your weight im on lybalvin__label__1 lamictal vraylar and stratteran__label__1 lamictal vraylar and stratteran__label__2 i take mg which is divided in a mg dose in the morning and a mg dose in the afternoon i personally havent experienced any heart racing or extra pyramidal side effects tardive dyskinesia agitation dystonia etc i also havent had any blood clots my prescription is to take it every day twice a day yours is the first time ive heard of a prn prescription for flupentixol ultimately if youre really not comfortable taking it i wouldnt bother as youre going to by hypervigilant about your bodily sensations being side effects all i can say is its not that bad in low doses and the worst thing they have ever caused me is to be tired they have helped me with being more calm and being able to take a step back from situations and i also have less reaction to negative events that being said i imagine you were prescribed it for a reason and like any medication especially psychiatric medication they can cause some unpleasant symptoms which become more obvious with increasing dose and time spent on themn__label__1 well at least in my case although it triggered my seizures so im never taking it again basically the doctor just palmed me off with the nearest thing they had available and didnt bother to investigate any further i stopped taking it regularly as i was sick of being a zombie and only took it when i was in an episode to restabalise myself with medical advice when i was really bad but now im never touching the stuff again i hate it luckily i have a good therapist now who specialises in personality disorders and gives me homework that is actually useful she is also a forensic psychologist too and thats properly interesting haha shes a legendn__label__3 i am aware i was answering why it gets prescribed but thankfully a different type of meds has been helping me for years one that gives me way less side effects than antipsychotics did shouldve clarifiedn__label__3 as far as im aware reffering to icd standards psychopathy is classified under f antisocial personality disorder and narzism is classified under f other specific personality disordersthat being said they are serious disorders and need treatment most of the time though narcist rarely suffer from inner distress that being the reason why the often dont reach out for help sadlyconcerning therapies there are a bunch of possible therapies dbt being one of which are proven to work by scienceconcerning the word cure please just dont borderline is often caused by former trauma and often comes with flash backs and so on that shit will never end there is no cure there are very good therapies to learn to deal with this shit short term and long term but is wont go away all that can happen is that someone with bpd doesnt experience enough symptoms severally enough that a diagnose can be given thats not really cured thats just the bpd symptoms not being as bad as before they learned to live with it but i distance myself from calling this a curen__label__1 dbt is not emergency behavioral work there is exactly one module dedicated to distress tolerance getting through an immediate crisis the rest are everyday mindfulness interpersonal and emotional regulation skills that literally the entire world could and should benefit from learningn__label__0 yupn__label__0 damn luckyyy i sleep for hours wake up and repeat for around hours haha sometimes watch telly for a bit inbetween or have a cig wont be too bad once i give birth bc will have to be up for baby so maybe thats why they kept me on mg so i dont ignore baby accidentallyn__label__2 oh thats so good i found that the second day i was on quetiapine i freaked out on a worker while i was at work and i completely freaked out and that was the first time i actually spazzed on someone sometimes i think these meds dont help me they just make me a different person i dont remember what its like to be normal although i do remember how i was before i was on all the meds and before i got depressed i was finen__label__0 i used to get really down on myself with that same worry but recently my mindset is like who gives a crap if i needed glasses or insulin or an inhaler for the rest of my life it would be the same thing just a funky thing my body is doing that i need medical assistance withn__label__1 your brain doesnt work like it should it is an organ and your particular one has some issues its no different than having a pancreas that doesnt work or blood pressure that doesnt regulate itselfyou need meds so the body part works like it should why stress about itn__label__0 that as welln__label__0 thats the one all i remember is that it ended with lol which made laughn__label__0 i just had my second nightmare after about a year of living away from my family home which was the cause of my cptsd and bpdn__label__0 is it weird that it just makes me have the same dreams over and over againn__label__0 its like any other psych med gonna take a couple months for full effect its why dosage is changed very gradually and it doesnt make the nightmares and less bad just helps me not remember details of it basically my sleep quality isnt any better but i think about the dreams less oftenn__label__0 both i thinkn__label__0 thank you for pointing that out and the explanation i know that i just forgot to include the word also the info you have shared will help others understand the concept bettern__label__5 psychiatric medications can treat symptoms not effect cure cure is long term psychodynamic psychotherapy note that for every symptom treated something else is compromised i wouldnt bother trying to describe what the meds are doing beyond symptom suppressionn__label__0 mostly it doesnt help me fall asleep i normally wake up at least once or twice a night toon__label__2 lamictal and vraylar are my med combo too mood disorder bpd anxiety depression and cptsd theyve seriously helped so much im so glad theyre taking me off of my effexor finally i missed my orgasms loln__label__4 im not going to enter into debate here save to say that i suggest you look into more in depth reading dbt addresses symptoms very effectively better than medication but to resolve the disorder proper psychodynamic psychotherapy is required yes deep cure of the underlying disorder is possible nope its not easy and yes its beyond the scope of hope for most however as far as symptoms go if you are just looking at it on that level you can go into remission as they call it and no longer meet the criteria for the disorder but thats not cure if you want a real cure look up the work of otto kernberg and james masterson if you can find a therapist who knows how to do this therapy youll be able to healn__label__0 wish we could go back to those timesn__label__0 thats a great way to look at itn__label__0 thats how you know its related to blood pressure ends in ololololololn__label__2 it also depends on your quetiapine dose as welllower doses you get more of a sedative effect with the drug higher doses the sedation lessensn__label__0 thank you for being kind with your response and understanding it was just as much for everyone else as for you though i realize now you didnt need it i know for the longest time i didnt realize i was delusional because i thought that it was a lot more hallucination like andor somewhat schizophrenic now that i know the difference and how hard it can be for a person to realize theyre delusional i try to make sure to the correct info gets out there so others can hopefully get the help they needn__label__0 maybe you need a different dosagen__label__0 haha and cool thanks for weighing in lactimal has been a lifesaver but its not quite enough im going to look into these other two i really want to help something to help with my fight or flight paranoia and splitting in relationshipsn__label__1 i believe good therapy will do the trick i hope one day i can come off antidepressants for good i wish you luckn__label__0 is that true if so thats going to be my new name for high blodd pressure the lolsn__label__0 it is if it ends in olol it is related to bppsych nursen__label__1 im depressed and suicidal on or off my medication tbh idk mann__label__1 sorry this is kinda off topic but do you guys get that numb zombie feeling when you take meds i just thought about it like shit what if thats just what normal people feel like its numbing to us because were so used to having an overactive mind that when it finally settles down to a healthy amount we think of it as being numb and empty okay that was just a shower thought and i now remember all the other people who do have success on meds wait but what if theyre just more adaptive to being numb ok im finishing my shower nown__label__1 i stopped anti depressants cold turkey and quetiapine an anti psychotic cold turkey i think the quetiapine affected my brain negatively weed stopped year ago after smoking daily for years it started giving me anxiety im clean off all other substances for month tbh i dont know how i did itn__label__1 im so scared to go off meds even if theyre only working placebo now ive been on ssris for like years i went off once and was having psychotic episodes either from withdrawal or bpdn__label__1 havent been on medication for years still kicking assn__label__2 i take lexapro and ive found it to be extremely helpful for managing my episodes of anger a lot of people say antidepressants make them feel numb but in my case it gives me more control over my emotions when i was not medicated i didnt feel like i had any control over my reactions sometimes but now i can actually choose how i respond to situations i also smoke more weed than i should which makes me calmer but also less productivemotivated than i would be otherwisen__label__1 im finally going off my meds bc they never did anything for me and im done trying them im also trying to at least take a t break bc ive been using my cart to relax and sleep at night but with constant use i think it makes me feel more depressed and anxious im not sure if its only bc of the smoking or just bpd or potential pmdd explains my usual low mood a week before my period starts so i somewhat relate in feeling low coming and going in waves sometimes i still feel shitty even after my period starts so idfk anymoren__label__0 deletedn__label__1 i stopped my antidepressants not long after i started them mind you this was years ago i felt they made things worse it is very common for depression to come in waves because so many things affect it your hormone levels changing can affect it the weather stress how you are feeling physically etc there are a lot of factors that can make you feel more or less depressed or make it last hours days weeks years this time of year is especially bad because of sadn__label__2 i have been off all medication for many many years i am not advocating it for everyone but i hated how medication made me feel and much prefer just being who i am and learning to navigate my challenges as they come medication never helped me anyway it just left me feeling numb and bored and too lazy to care and basically took away all joy as well as the blunting my negative emotions life wasnt fun or happy anymore ever justdays and days of mild contentment at best and i couldnt live that way plus meds made me fat and i know it isnt a socially acceptable way to feel but id rather be dead than fatn__label__2 there is no medication to treat bpd so im not surprised youve been fine without itn__label__1 i went off my meds cold turkey in spring last year had a pretty rough half year with high highs and low lows eventually ended with me being hospitalised and convinced to go back on them i still get the urge to stop taking them even though i know they help me but this fair im doing okay taking themn__label__1 all this comment talk of being off meds successfully is actually encouraging i have horrific constipation and other gi issues and im sure its from being on a pharmacy natural health is so balancing but im not ready to change anything yet maybe next year if this year stays even keeln__label__1 i did this too a few years ago going off all my meds cold turkey was the best thing i ever did i became much more in control of my bpd and it felt like a fog was lifted not recommending it at all because everyone is different but i gained much more clarity and am thankful i went thru it hoping you have the same experience opn__label__1 wellbutrin is the only thing thats been remotely effective in minimizing my symptoms but also i can tell you this i used to be a heroin addict seven years clean my entire life is filled with things that arent even remotely close to substance abuse and the elements of that lifestyle but the thoughts never really go away they might be really dull they might be out of nowhere and right at the front of my mind but the thoughts dont invoke a behavior anymore i just simply acknowledge them and move on the analogy here is bpd ameliorating the symptoms of bpd is largely behavior change and doing the very opposite of what the entire disorder is characterized bymanaging our emotions it really just all feels like a mental gamen__label__1 after months of no meds i ruined my fucking life punched walls er beds moved back home dropped out of school lost my job i didnt realize i was going to flip my lid when i did back on it feeling a bit more comfortable confident and capablen__label__1 i stopped taking my medicine the same way because i was too tired to taking meds and i had extreme withdrawal for almost a year and i was in pain everyday i was more depressed and anxious than i ever was so i started working out more and more there were times when i was working out in the middle of the night to get rid of the anxiety and i kept a log of things that seems to trigger my anxiety for me it was mostly coffee and eating unhealthy and i tried to reduce the triggers as much as possible and that helped also i just kept reminding myself that this will pass and all the good things that have ever happened to me or would happen in my future hope this helpsn__label__1 quit my meds cold turkey in june or july last year glad to be off them but i feel like i gave myself some sort of brain damage my coming off like that ive been having intense mental breakdowns over the last few months and my friend reminded me that im off any meds i said its been half a year since i quit but they said it could be hitting me now too the immediate withdrawals in the first few months were awful dont get me wrong but i feel so strange i havent been unmedicated in almost years so idk how to cope it would make a lot of sense if i have hurt my brain by quitting cold turkey after being on something for years still smoking though taking a break in a few weeksn__label__3 ive never had drugs i drink alcohol maybe one glass every months i havent been on medication for almost years now i take some oxazepam once or twice a year for panic attacks or flashbacks love ptsd my mood swings come and go in waves depending on my menstrual cycle and whats happening around me if i get triggered a lot my mood swings are worse they do change in how suicidal i get rn im not in a good place but im not suicidal when i wasnt in a good space last month i was suicidal tho so yeah i can relate to the wavesn__label__5 as someone who has bpd major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder it took a bit to figure out which medications worked for me also there is no medication for bpd only dbt i mean there are some meds that can help with manic episodes like quetiapine which does wonders for me but there is no magic medication for dbt and with dbt you have to be committed to doing it otherwise it will not work i did it twice and the second around helped me a lot i take bupropion quetiapine and zoplicon its about finding what works for youn__label__1 i dont for sure have bpdi meat the criteria of the dms for it but have not ben dignosed by a doctor but have picked when i have diagnosed i wont be taking meds im bipolar so this is something i have experiencedn__label__2 i know everyone is different but for me personally i needddd my meds last time i went off them i attempted to kms i had stopped pristiq which i now still take but they added lamictal and that has been a game changer when it comes to suicidal thoughts for me at least dont get me wrong im still a mess but at least it keeps me alive while i work on therapy and stuff and makes life a bit more bearablen__label__0 i feel like this all the time not sure if you are male or female but for me i can pin it down to the stage of my cyclen__label__5 if you have the chance id recommend finding a therapist trained in emdr therapy that has done so much more than medication ever did and clearing the log jams seems to make my meds work better might help you too since youre treating naturally it could help puts therapy on turbo mode hurts after things come up but bpd is heavily linked to trauma and i think we struggle to process trauma the way others do with just talk therapy best of luck and yes i think those thoughts are symptoms just like a cold thats a good grounding thought mental health is healthn__label__2 i have suicidal ideation even when i feel good lol but i recently switched medications and my mood is less stable also way more prone to anxietyn__label__1 i stopped smoking pot on top of my meds and now it takes me hours to fall asleep instead ofn__label__0 is it worth staying off weed helps regulate my emotionsn__label__3 medications only help with symptoms not the disease itself cognitive behavioural therapy dbt really helped me and continued therapy if you can afford itn__label__1 i felt better when i went off my medication but i also went off everything because i got pregnant so mitigating circumstances my daughters almost and i do still have bad days but its never been anywhere near how things were before her she just came and asked me to pick her up and wrapped her whole body around me and said i love you mommy standing here rocking her and cooking lunch is better than any medication i ever triedn__label__3 yes you are most likely going through paws post acute withdrawal syndrome pretty much all drugs and meds will do this when we quit its even more intense for us since we experience our emotions more intense than mostn__label__1 my meds did nothing i was due for a refill about years ago and kept forgetting to get themnever went back oni feel no different ive been doing better in general but i genuinely attribute that to radical acceptance of a lot of my situation and relationshipsn__label__1 im trying to meet w my psychiatrist to give me more natural remedies my pcp just freaked me out about the long term effects of the medication ive been taking for a long time like they make me feel better right now but apparently theyre not good to take for a long time lol so what am i supposed to do ive tried so many different cocktails and this is the only one that works for me so fuck me i guess loln__label__2 i went through several different types of meds for a few years until i realized that a lot of the side effects were making things worse for me mentally i stopped taking meds about a year ago and ive been so much better granted ive also taken a lot of steps to feel better mentally and physically therapy working out i still have my moments but im a lot better off than i was on meds things are different for everyone but for me meds did more harm than good in the long termn__label__2 ive been off meds months ago cold turkey cause it didnt make much difference other than shitty side effects im still depressed as shit but trying to work it through therapyn__label__1 i also did the same thing i was on meds for months but couldnt financially keep it up and ive had the longest depressive episodes and very short manic episodes i feel like ive been splitting too much too and little things sets me off more frequently i lost energy as well its been difficultn__label__1 me too literally exactly me too my herbal meds are weed thon__label__2 ive tried many different meds over the years and none of them did anything but drain my bank account and give me side effects ive been off everything for over and year and my symptoms are exactly the samen__label__0 suicidal and constantly on n off maniac mood so far not using alternatives substancen__label__4 im off my meds cause theyre antipsychotics and the reason i dont like taking them is because i have an eating disorder weight gain is a very common side effect of them i mean i literally asked my psychiatrist for nonfattening antipsycho pills she laughed in my face said they dont exist no yea im not taking them idk if they work but ill never ever find outedit i smoke weed tho still which doesnt help me at all bc it doesnt get me high anymore basically the only way i feel even a little okay is alcohol or other drugs but lately ive noticed that i just feel really angry or sad on those now idk wtf to do probably take my meds han__label__1 same i keep going on and off all my meds i cant decide if i want to take them or notn__label__1 if its coming in waves it sounds like youre experiencing the same random highs lows like anyone with bpd would maybe try new meds i know it took my a long time to find a combo that worked but it controls the highs and lows a lot more and my lows i can come out of instead of living in for daysn__label__8 i stopped thc after yrs of all day everyday use last sept and started meds and have quit meds times since then post acute withdrawal from street drugs is a real deal can take months up to years for the brain to start firing and making chemicals again the right way ive been very depressed since started wellbutrin today which seems to have a possible advantages over ssris and snris i also use busparbuspirone for anxiety which i dont mind being onn__label__1 because medication doesnt stop depression its not a magically cure all until you do the mental work it wont get bettern__label__0 yeah but i just switched to cymbalta so ig well seen__label__0 this used to be me but lybalvi helped me a lotn__label__0 i feel u also i love your usernamen__label__1 sorry if invasive but do you take sertraline sertraline made me feel even more numb and depressed and devoid of emotionn__label__1 normal people dont feel numb they feel everything they just know how to manage and regulate themselves we dont hence why some need medication i have bpdn__label__2 i never noticed numbness the opposite actually meds are sedating for me though and i feel drugged and cant stay awake i also feel hungry constantly even if i just ate a mealn__label__1 i had to quit trying medication to fix my brain all of it makes me numb i would rather cope and work through being insane than be numbn__label__1 yeah i can relate lol meds make my brain silent or at least more quiet and i can only assume regular people live with a quiet brain all the timethe times i felt actually numb from meds my meds where too high tho usually its just my brain calming down from medsn__label__1 honestly being on meds i know im not the same person lol i feel more boring but in a way i guess thats good like meds made me realize wanting to kill yourself is an alarming feeling that i had normalized when i used to say to my ex i wanna kms and he would bug out i thought he was the one overreacting i would be like its not that serious like yeah i mean it but yk i dont have the balls to actually do it all this to say yeah numbing your brain might be what normal people experience unmedicated i used to hate people like how i am now but i realized its also probably why i got involved with so many crazytoxic partnersn__label__2 i find it just kind of hard to feel anything i have less empathy all around on my lexapro i think this is just how i am going to have to go through my life i hate it but i think that is just going to be my reality because is so much more manageable than the episodes of break down freak out crying running in front of traffic drunk and major paranoia i would go throughmy meds also help with my anxiety but yeah i feel quite bored a lot of the timen__label__1 no it means ur meds are wrong ive felt numb and ive felt how i feel now seriously let me stress your meds are wrong you should feel a way you never felt before its subtle but its also stable and satisfying not numbn__label__2 i felt that way with zoloft and a lot of others trintellix is the only one working with my lamotragine it sucks its ruinously expensive without pulling every meds trick in the book with discount cardsn__label__3 meds and drugs numb us down i dno ive seen lots of people before and after meds and i always find them to be very dull after meds also like most drugs they seem to work for a couple years ok then they go downhill meds are a bandaid not a cure our minds are trying to tell us something and i believe if we let our mind tell us our symptoms may get bettern__label__1 i noticed that i cant cry a lot when im on meds it sucks being sad but at least i can get my emotion out nown__label__1 what did you feel about quetiapinen__label__1 omg quetiapine made me mentally slow and numb i feel youn__label__1 i liked olanzapine a lot but i felt as though i instantly gained weight for some reason i cant bring myself to take meds because i dont want to deal with forgetting to take them or if some reason i cant get them anymore and have some psychotic break idk probably not logicaln__label__0 removedn__label__0 i took ssris for years and recently came off them was a bad idea on my part i need them desperately and i havent been able to find a doctorget in as new patient so ive been having an extremely hard to remaining stable for the last ish monthsn__label__0 what do you taken__label__0 what did you seen__label__0 definitely not trying to armchair diagnose but have you heard of pme premenstrual exacerbation basically where other conditions get worsened before the start of a period could be an interesting research topic for you if youre thinking in the direction of pmddbased on severity of symptoms and the worst of them lining up with my period my doctor thought it was pmdd until i started tracking symptoms in more detail and it was clear that it wasnt only restricted to my luteal phase thats when i started a lengthy diagnosis process for other things and bpd is one of the things that came outn__label__0 my obgyn told me to skip the break week from birth control it helps a lot i havent had a period in almost years and my moods are way more stable its surreal but theyre just sugar pills to make women feel more normaln__label__0 i log the days that i feel extremely depressed and its always worse before my period

thank you it helps a lot im trying to exercise more and do yoga so that it becomes my new goto coping mechanismn__label__0 bi polar and bpd have a lot of overlap are your moods triggered by events in life or are completely biologically cyclical thats the difference that was explained to men__label__0 get some melatonin pills those helped me a lotn__label__0 congratulationsn__label__0 honestly i just stopped because it turned me into a sloth and it wasnt as fun anymore but if it really helps you then its not a problem enjoy it for men__label__0 awww this is cute im happy for youn__label__0 i

prescribed it when i first started i was mostly numb we kept increasing the dosage until i was eventually so drugged i would laugh to myself randomly throughout the day bc there was simply so much happiness in my brain despite having absolutely no thoughts at all i knew i had to get off it was weird being happy with no feelings like idk how to explain it it felt so fake even though i was

thats never going to happen how much are meds where you aren__label__1 antidepressants werent meant for life long use in the first place the intent was to medicate alongside therapy until youre healthy enough to wean off but yes i agree its a bandaid solution and more attention needs to be put towards mental health and actually solving the core issue i watched a video recently and im just paraphrasing here but it essentially said no amount of therapy can cure systemic issues oh i found the actual vid here its my first time hearing about it and like dam so truen__label__0 ive been on my for several years now im fine with mine the only change ive done is replacing trazodone for zoplicon for sleepingn__label__0 omg you just reminded me of that as well literally feels like dissociating

i read here that a lot of people do well on lamotragine though so it may have just not been for me im currently on escitalopram and wellbutrin with clonazepam prnn__label__1 i hear whispering see objects and people out of my peripheral view inner voice is so loud too the main issue was my reactions of screaming and inability to work etc i cant afford to not work where i live because rent and food is so high here so i went right back on medication againn__label__0 same here i chose an year hormonal iud twice i havent had a period in about years plusbefore the iud i used nuvaring and just left the ring in the fourth week that worked well but nuvaring has to be refrigerated and im bad at remembering to go to the pharmacyn__label__1 yes if youre experiencing psychosis you can take antipsychotics but thats for psychosis not bpdn__label__0 both but i meat the dms criteria for both and spaiitcly have episodes that wolud spisitic to each disorder vers one i have done excessive studyingn__label__0 i hear you its tough getting off any substance you can do it stay strong i do think things will improve in timen__label__0 have you tried cold plunges and sauna it honestly helps me so much with depression when i get it and honestly when i go every day i just feel in a good mood all the time its when i skip it that things get bad again even just a shower as cold as it goes for seconds a day can make a huge difference and since pwbpd have have down regulation of the endogenous opioid system natural opioids in brain this can help a ton for us because it releases the natural opioids in our brain which i believe also gets it flowing better in generaln__label__2 i agree my new therapist is rly helping me and if things get really really bad i might try medication again as long as i dont end up in the hospital i guessn__label__2 im on different meds but the sertraline sucked everything out of me felt like a zombierobot frn__label__0 god i relaten__label__0 i get what youre saying but i guess i wouldnt call it numb like i said they know how to regulate themselves so they feel everything their emotions arent as overwhelming for them like it is for usn__label__2 actually when i got on the right meds i was shocked that i had an excellent sex drive in fact too much for my current partner but weve mellowed into a nice flow for the both of us but thats the thing everything has felt very normal ive been stable on the same meds for years now i religiously take my medication but i often forget im ill at all bc i function so regular ive learned more about myself in the past years than i ever did in my entire life i struggled with mental illness since elementary school i learned im driven hard working and productive which i never thought of myself before being stable and yes the sex drive i got very into bdsm and even into a swinging relationship for a year i eventually leveled off and cooled down thoughn__label__0 trintellix is if you raw dog with no insurance got mine down to but once deductible is met itll be i think fmln__label__0 il check it out thankyou so we may need systemic therapy thann__label__0 hey thats good to hear i think like anything it may depend on the person and as with any healing solution theres always some risks its just been my experience and what ive personally seenn__label__1 hm i had a psychotic breakdown i was working meanwhile eventually worked my way through it by interpreting most of it now i still have psychosis but i know what it is i learnt to live with it i know it can be overwhelming im just curious if our experiences are were similiar mine are mostly subconscious material repression trauma and compensation i dont know i havent been on meds for years and never to return i rather work my way through i wish you strengthn__label__2 im on antidepressantsantianxiety meds theyre not for bpd exclusively but they definitely reign in some of the awful overwhelming feelings that come with it like takes the edge off mood meds for a mood disorder is how i look at itn__label__1 quetiapine and rexulti keep me from getting violent son__label__2 right the idea isnt to cure bpd its to manage some of the negative symptoms other example i have epilepsy theres no cure i take a medication to stop the seizures they dont treat the other aspects like fatigue anxiety etc they just treat the most severe part of epilepsyn__label__0 this is a super helpful article its putting things into perspective for me thank youn__label__3 lamotrigine literally saved my life im on a really high dose mixed with anxiety meds and sleeping medication and it literally has changed my lifen__label__0 hmmm how about this would you agree that a normal healthy person can walk up flights of stairs without getting tired like someone who regularly works out and is generally active in their day to day life i would think so but i personally am underweight desk bound and dont regularly exercise at all really if i were to climb flights of stairs it would be exhausting but just because i felt exhausted going up the stairs doesnt mean that the flights of stairs was actually difficult to climb it is only perceived as exhausting and difficult because i am not an active healthy person in the same sense just because i perceive the transition from an overactive state to a healthy regulated state as numbness doesnt mean that regulated emotions in healthy individuals are genuinely numb its about individual experiences and perspectives much like how climbing stairs might feel exhausting to someone less active even if its not inherently difficulti am also not going to comment on what healthy regulated people feel or dont feel since im bpd and have not felt what a normal person has felt whether they feel everything or not is not known to me and the topic of feelings itself is subjective by nature i can only talk about my own experiences which is what im doing edit oops sorry i accidentally pasted my response over my previous reply and didnt realise until after i deleted itn__label__0 oh my god im so so sorry thats completely fucked up heres me thinking my sert was expensive i was expecting like but your government hate yalln__label__0 we need systemic issues income inequality systemic racism housing crisis etc to be addressed in order to heal i think the first comment on the video summed it up well many peoples mental health problems are actually rational responses to being in a terrible situationn__label__2 it totally is and i wholeheartedly agree with you i do feel tho that there are risks with quitting cold turkey meditations especially with quetiapine it took me years to find a good doctor and therapist to trust and find the right combination for me i honestly believe that if you can find them then it makes all the difference in the worldn__label__0 hey i hope it helps your welcomen__label__0 this post has been marked as a venting post please be aware that the op may not

without it being the dangerous parts i am wishing you the best and i hope you can take comfort in knowing youre not alonen__label__0 deletedn__label__0 i wish it would numb men__label__3 thinks for your reply i dont know exactly what kinds of meds she took but she definitely takes a mood stabilizer she uses weed once before going to bed during the weekdays and couple of times on weekends how long should she try a certain kind of mood stabilizer to know if it suits her or not at least a week or do you know straight away on the first day it could work to try the mood stabilizers during the day and weed at night if it was legal to use cannabis for medical use do you think changing a therapist could help her find a better medicine for her thanks againn__label__4 has she done any form of therapy i have successfully been off my meds for a year at this point and a lot of that is due to having the tools from therapy to cope with everything instead of medications you are right that telling her to go back on meds would likely not be met with a good response as her reasons for going off them are very valid i know you said she thinks this stuff is happening but she knows her body and if meds are making her lose her intimacy she knows that and doesnt want that same with hormones and medical stigma so i would suggest continuing to support her in her decision and when appropriate mention therapy dbt is usually recommended for people with bpd to help her be more stable and herself but without the needs of medsn__label__2 it takes a long time to stabilize after coming off medication and being a woman can take even longer certainty less than a month is not enough time for the brain chemistry to go back to how it should be as the other commenter said the dbt is the most important aspect for prolonged bpd control anywayn__label__1 going off of meds is stressful as hell especially the older you get not only that but its also tough reaching your mid s because of hormone fluctuations that come with pre menopause she definitely needs patience from you and to remain in therapy ssris do help a lot with the mood swings and anxiety and i hope she considers them she might have to hear that from someone whos in a similar position as hern__label__2 bpd dbt meds help symptoms wont get to the nitty gritty of it all she also needs to want it meds or therapy to work ask her to find more info from psych they should have provided her with thorough evidence backed info but i realise this doesnt do it for everyonen__label__5 i also struggle with the medication stigma it might really ease her mind to try genesight testing your psychiatristdoctor orders it you swab your cheek and mail the swab back you receive a detailed report of which mental health medications of every class you are able to metabolize properly meaning those meds that will give you minimal side effects and only the very commonpredicted side effects i am a woman who lost sexual function while taking propranolol and when i got my report back propranolol was listed as one of the medications that i cannot metabolize well thats why it gave me such negative side effectsbeing weary of meds myself my psychiatrist prescribed me a beginner med i currently take buspar for anxiety symptoms of bpd its not an ssri it has a much much weaker and more localized effect on serotonin it only increases desire for intimacy its often prescribed to counter the sexual side effects of other medications not all meds are the same finding a good psychiatrist who she can be open with about her fears and who will listen could change the gamen__label__0 been here before my wife same thing she will stabilize after awhile you have to realize and her also that this will level out stick with it try not to argue but listen when she is not angry just simply ask what can i do to help you sometimes i have to put my needs on the back burner in order to help my wife get through some stuff it was probably a little more than months before things calmed down everyone is different so who knows an exact time frame or how her body will cope she will also have to do some work on herself as well if she can do that things should be fine after a bit just know it is a volatile time right nown__label__1 i also refuse to take meds because i dont like the impact on my health body and motivation i dont like feeling numb and i dont like not feeling desire i also wont take meds just so that i become easier for other people im a deep feeling person im hard to love but i wont take meds to be less for anyone elsen__label__2 ime meds barely do anything and often make it worse lamictal was awesome for day then it sucked and is a nightmare to come off ofn__label__3 good questionshes been in therapy for ish months ic mc that has helped a lot and she has a great therapist things have just worsened since she stopped meds she has trouble communicating things are blown out of proportion misinterpreted turned negative then she gets stuck on it when ask her to say back things im saying she stays stuck on what im not even sayingwhen i say she thinks the meds make her gain weight her weight is no different than before this medication its fluctuated throughout the years but she looks good she said shes gained some weight since going off the meds thats most likely from recent changes in diet exercise same for lack of desire for intimacy that was the same prior to medsn__label__1 thank you for this my wife took the genesight testing and we got the report it does help filter meds although she says she wants none of themn__label__1 thanks for your perspective how do the meds impact your health body and motivation do you see any positive impacts to yourself not others it sounds like you acknowledge the benefits to others im interested the specific pros cons to yourselfn__label__1 i get this so well like i love the feeling of impulsive rush and i feel like if i go on meds i will be so monotone but if you are starting to experience super low emotions that are affecting you very negatively trust me that talking to a doctor and going on meds is probably better than few moments of extreme happiness being able to kind of get your shit together on meds seems more ideal in the long run good luck friendn__label__1 a natural way to do it is with htp it helps stabilize more naturally and it makes up the elements necessary for the body to produce more serotonin when given meds for serotonin balancing it forces more serotonin to stay in the receptor sites but does not get the body to produce more in fact the body can use up more of the precursors on meds and then they raise the meds to make it work moren__label__0 i used to feel that way but im also bipolar and the mania developed into psychosis it was terrifying also i made terrible terrible choices manic that took years for myself and others to heal from are my emotions duller now yes but i have a pause button i have self control things i never had before and i choose to sacrifice the intensity for stability so i can be the best version of myself for my family and men__label__1 not a doctor but i think lamotrigine im on it i should know this functions differently as a mood stabilizer by bringing up the lows you can ask about it its worth considerationn__label__1 i am in therapy and about to start dbt sessions soon but my copay tripled after we switched insurance this year so its been difficult to stick with itn__label__1 i was on an ssri up until last december it helped me at first get out of a really bad depressive state but eventually it made things worse i have been in therapy for a while now and should be starting dbt therapy this month as well i am doing well but still want to do better i will check out htp thank you so muchn__label__0 it wont actually do anything giving your body the materials to produce serotonin when it doesnt want to produce serotonin anyway is like giving a kid a pencil that doest want to do his homework and expecting the kid to just start doing itn__label__0 youre welcomen__label__0 so you think its a matter of willpowerwhat solutions can you offern__label__3 no its a matter of human physiology the whole thing with clinical depression is that it interferes with the ability for serotonin production and it to stay circulating ssris and other classes of antidepressants are currently the best treatment my analogy kind of sucked sorry for the confusionn__label__0 if your referring to cortisol level inhibition that is a different anglen__label__3 there is nothing unique to bpd in regards to how we respond to medications meds can change your mood though and i would be sure and share with your doctor if you are continuing to feel uncomfortablen__label__3 i did really well on paroxetine paxil it was very fastacting i had some relief in hoursthe first night was rough though it made me astoundingly suicidal i had to ask my roommate to keep an eye on me i dont recommend starting any mental health drug without a buddy nearbyn__label__0 you can also take beta blockers for anxiety i take mg of propranolol daily mg x four times a day some people take anticonvulsants for anxiety as well i take mg of gabapentin as a mood stabilizern__label__2 the huge number of anxiolytics is confusing for example hydroxyzine is one people never mentionthings like gapapentin seem scary benzodiazepines are addictive beta blockers are only for physical symptoms azapirones existit strikes me that some of these agents seem to be as effective as say antidepressants andor benzodiazepines but are almost never mentioned whywhat are your experiences with propranalol and gabapentinn__label__8 i think that some doctors just dont prescribe certain medications because they sort of have a go to choice for medications which for a lot of doctors is antidepressants or benzos i also think that those other meds dont always work as well they have less of a chance of success according to studies and doctors tend to go with what they know works for example my family doctor was olderand i got prescribed propranolol initially for panic because at that time there wasnt a lot of antidepressants that worked well for panic and he wasnt inclined to give me benzos i had to fight to get themand it took like years of fighting with him so doctors tend to not really go far off what they know and are comfortable with you really have to look to find a doctor that will work with you to find medications that work for you especially if you have drug interactions allergies conflicts etc my suggestion to you is to tell your doctor if you are comfortable with them and theyre not an asshole why you are trying to find a work around medication for your anxiety if they are a good doctorthey will explore other medications you can take and hopefully you find a combination that works well for you you could also inquire about any kind of anxiety group therapy opportunities those can be helpful as well i found the book simple solutions to panic really helpful it had a lot of exercises in it to sort of help you get used to the physical symptomsi take hyroxyzine as well for allergies i quite like it actually it has minimal side effects for me it doesnt make me overly tired just resolves my allergy issues i have contact allergies to something that makes my skin blister i also spoke to the doctor about it for anxiety because clonazepam is addictiveand another doctor had implied to me that hyroxyzine was also addictive my family doctor said it had no to minimal potential to be addictive and felt it would be fine as a regular anxiolytic i just never really pursued getting a dosage for that as my anxiety was pretty much under control as of that point gabapentin is fine for me it makes me a bit sleepy for my evening dosage but otherwise its fine ive had very little side effects from it besides sleepiness pros include that it reduced my migraines regular headaches to with the propranolol which was a huge win and it also seems to be stabilizing my mood decently cant go wrong with that eitherpropranolol was the first panic medication i was prescribed ive been on for like years so i cant really recall my initial experience with it other than dizziness and sleepiness initially which eventually went away i never found it helped me overly with my panic i just kept taking it because it helped me with my migraines initially when i started taking it and i would have a panic attack it would feel this sort of odd sensation around my heart now i know its because it blocks adrenaline to your heart but eventually that sort of faded and i needed clonazepam to manage my panic at that time i took mg of clonazepam for a long time actually mg four times a day and sometimes more on really bad days probably close to years to function it never made me tired or doped up all it ever did was stop the panic attacks eventually i started lowering the dose over time i came off it really slowly probably over months to nothing now i take it as needed which isnt very often i suspect its due to the gabapentin propranolol combo but i couldnt be sure im sure that learning coping skills also helped hope that answers your questionedits expanded on my original answern__label__0 i did really well working at my local library despite having some painmobility issues and pretty terrible mental health my likely bpd symptoms werent at their worst but they were certainly present i just got to listen to music or audiobooks and shelve books for hours it may not be a perfect fit for you but its something to consider the hours were also pretty flexible which helped a lot honestly i found it super calming when i was angry or upset and i only really had to interact with other employeesn__label__0 no matter what the job we need to keep the bpd underwrapsn__label__0 well yeah but some jobs may make it easier and some are mc donalds drive through servicen__label__0 loln__label__0 i hope this isnt true because ive been considering trying an ssri recently i used to do so much mephedronen__label__1 it feels like my receptors are so used to balls serotonin that they just dont react much to serotonergic psychopharmacoceuticals everyone is different even on the same drug and dosage so i cant speak to how ssris would affect youmephedrone is a terrifying drugn__label__0 just dont get offended and realize the man is making a joke and being insensitive be the better person heren__label__1 ive done it im a former substance abuser who just quit smoking weed cold turkey i sometimes take whatever medication or medicine that puts me in a sleepy state i have problems with benydrl sometimes most people take pills to help them sleep but it doesnt work on me anymore and i end up takingn__label__0 yeah i take vyanse which is a stimulant everything is suddenly super funny and awesome and you can feel content with just sitting on your ass doing absolutely nothing important for five hours if you take a higher dose than youre prescribed that is since your body gets used to the substance i dont want to overdose or even get too high i just want to feel fucking calm and content with myself its way better than a year or so ago even though im not high from the vyanse anymore absolutely but god do i miss feeling the cloudfloating kind of chill happiness and self confidence i got in the beginning it was like nothing mattered but in a good way now that im more myself again after getting used to my dosage sometimes nothing matters but in a bad way as in an existential crisis way whereas the chill carefreeness when im high makes me forget my existential crisisn__label__0 when i went through my first breakup with my fp i went actually insanepanic attacks obsessive stalking and all the good stuffn__label__1 i suspected i had bpd like a two or three years ago and brought it up with a therapist i used to see who happened to specialize it she agreed that i do have it but oddly pushed me to not get diagnosed i was never too sure why she just kept saying why do you need a diagnosis ill help you without one which i kind of understand but it is validating to have official paper on it the therapist i see to this day doesnt agree with that suggestion because i dont get in trouble with the law i wish i got diagnosed when i could haven__label__0 i was now i was diagnosed in the psych ward i suspected i had it i didnt even mention bpd to the doctor and he said everything youve been saying sounds like borderline personality disorder and i was like i knew it i fucking knew itn__label__1 i was diagnosed last year when i was and honestly when i tell you the struggle i had getting any doctor to believe i wasnt just depressed with low mood or anxious its so difficult to be taken seriously especially when you suspect you might have it keep pushing and eventually they will take you seriously or understand your therapist might not be right for you it sometimes takes a while to find the right onen__label__4 i was diagnosed at years ago i didnt feel understood by my therapist or psychiatrist at the timei felt like as someone with a bpd diagnosis my concerns werent taken seriously i had a very hard time getting anyone to evaluate me for adhd which i also have because they thought i was drugseeking and i wasnt screened for ptsd at the time either or evaluated for autism even though both my parents have it as do i so i spent years being treated for only part of the problemn__label__0 i was and overdosed to get out of work i did it right in front of customers with a smile on my face and left in an ambulance i didnt want to call in sick because i would feel too guilty i ended up getting serotonin syndrome needing iv a heart monitor etc i stayed in the mental health ward for a while afterwards and they asked me if i regretted what i did i said no they diagnosed me with bpd and in the doctors notes said it was likely id do it againit was worth it for the unpaid week offn__label__0 my ex a couple of years back mentioned possibly having npd i remembered reading about how people with npd would seek out people with bpd im not sure how true this is but not my words and i started doing my own research and it all clicked finally got an official diagnosis this yearn__label__1 i was venting to a friend who knew a lot about bpd and he mentioned to me that i should look into it when i started reading about it i realised how relatable everything was and when i read other peoples experiences i finally felt heard and seen like i wasnt alone i think i was maybe at the time and it was a huge relief to find these communities the more i learn about it the easier it is to understand myself and work on coping but also having friends in the community that can help ground you when you really need it is helpful therapists have never seemed to truly understand me like my friends can but thats not to say they cant help they have good strategies and techniques and ideas for coping but you have to go through many to find someone that works with you in the way that is beneficial for you because you are talking to them about intimate details regarding your life you also have to be able to vibe with them on a level im also more of the quiet bpd type and you are very valid in your thoughts and feelings dont let anyone tell you otherwise when your symptoms are hard to explain you just have to start anywhere say a few words and spark the convo and usually they will guide you through the rest the more you do it the easier it will become to identify your feelings sending lots of love to youn__label__1 i am i cheated on my ex and completely sabotaged a relationship that i wanted forever i sought therapy and am now on meds but the guilt and regret of how i could have changed all of my actions and emotions eat my alive everyday i split so hard on him everyday i want him back i wish we could start overn__label__1 how did you find out you had bpd a friend told me i have similar thoughts and behaviour to his friend that has bpd i brought it up with my therapist and after some questions and questioners i was diagnosed how old were you and do you feel understood by your therapist i dont really feel understand by anyone but i feel of the therapist ive interacted with he gets me the mostn__label__4 i was admitted to the psych ward worst stay by far then got discharged and referred to an outpatient program the psychiatrist i was referred to proceeded to tell me that i did not have depression even though i do and have been told by multiple other psychiatrists i do and told me i have bpd but was not going to diagnose me with it told me my medication was not helping me and would never help me ive been on meds since i was and yes they do help me and got me off of seroquel which is what they put me on during my stay at the psych ward he said the only thing it would do was make me fat he then told me the only thing that would help is dbt which works but i also did dbt in the past as well and said that therapy would not help and only the dbt program which would cost around a week and was a private program which would not be covered and i would have to pay out of pocket but apparently my city did not provide that type of program later i learned they did provide that program told him i cant afford that and he told me well you could look up mindfulness videos on youtube i was in a lot of distress after the appointment for obvious reasons he basically told me nothing would help me except that program and discharged me from the outpatient program because it would not help me about a year later i was admitted to the psych ward again different city and met my current psychiatrist who diagnosed me with bpd the kicker is that he also put me back on the seroquel and guess what it actually worksn__label__0 was completely unexpected i was getting tested for other mental illnesses and after the full exam my bpd markers were high i only knew of one type of bpd so i thought it was a mistake until i learned about discouraged bpd so i found out several months ago i am quiet type like you so i understandn__label__0 diagnosed at after my mh crashed on the after having an emergency operation and critically ill in hdu for several days previously doctors had said it was justdepression and anxiety and i was overthinkingn__label__1 i was ive struggled with mental health for the majority of my life many doctors many meds many different diagnoses i kept trying to explain what i was going through but the answer was just try another new med and its just anxietydepressionbipolar after a suicide attempt i was sent to a hospital and saw a nurse practitioner specializing in mental health we talked for hours and he shared with me that what i have is bpd id never heard of it before then i truly belive if i never received that diagnosis that day i wouldnt be here to tell it now he helped me get into a high risk program which specializes in bpd after a year of weekly appointments i finally am feeling more me than i have in so longn__label__3 i was at the time years ago i was seeing a therapist regularly when we had to start due to her having a baby she never once mentioned bpd nor had i ever heard of it until i got a letter in the mail from the clinic stating they have referred me to a local hospital for bpd diagnosis and treatmentits safe to say that this wasnt the best way for the therapist to do things but im still grateful that i was able to get the help i needed at the time however i did find that after treatment and diagnosis it was hard for me to find a general therapist again or even get my gp to add it to my mental health plann__label__4 i was diagnosed at back in i think so its been over years in and out of treatment on and off meds currently ive been consistently in therapy for years and on a buttload of meds have other mental illnesses working with a new psych atm in regards to still trying to find the right combo of meds for a bunch of shiti really do like my new psychiatrist and the psychologist ive been working with they both have a holistic approach which is great because i get to try a little bit of everything to see what workshowever i sit here currently having not slept because i ran out of antipsychotics crying my eyes out rapid mood swings lashed out at someone because i genuinely dont have an emotional support networki have friends and family but as you asked i do not feel understood outside of the professionals i seei dont feel seen or heard either and its giving me dark thoughts im currently trying to fightn__label__0 i was and had just come out as trans fem i attempted suicide and ended up in a psych hospital for two weeks they diagnosed me then and i was in denial about it for a couple years ive had four attempts since and every time i go to the hospital they reinforce that i definitely have bpdn__label__0 when i was i met a person who has bpd and it explained my entire life then i asked my psychiatrist to get tested and boom i fit all symptomsn__label__1 around a month ago my partner sent me a link explaining what a fp is and bpd and what it is i had a fp at the time and was very much still obsessed with her eventually i looked more into bpd and i asked my best friend about it whos a double major in sociology and psychology and he said he sees it in me also my partner told me i had a lot of symptoms of bpd and the most scary part was when i looked up the symptoms and saw a lot of em in myself eventually i asked my therapist about and he said he saw it in me and diagnosed me around weeks agoim still processing all this to this very second that i am writing this its a lot and ive been dealing with a lot of idk stuff thats rlly heavy its a lot when all of a sudden everything makes sense and all of your behavior in the past makes sense now and you realize that your life was not normal and it was just one big trauma eventn__label__2 nov crisis diagnosis at following an attempt and a i got lucky my diagnosing doc was the head of the mental health wing and a bpd specialisti didnt have the opportunity to be misunderstood when i got home i updated my therapist on what happened and we made changes accordingly my meds and dosageagain i got lucky imo hes also my older sisters therapist shes licensed so i trusted her judgment on himn__label__2 my first good therapist when i was diagnosed my mother with bpd that started a whole awakening for me and though i didnt have bpd at the time i realized i had had it as a teenager and had overcome it by myself through self reflection and implementing change it then returned when i was and i recognized what was happening bc of my moms diagnosis i started dbt at im now and things are improving again it has never gotten as bad as when i was a teen again but im lucky enough to recognize the signs and know when i have to consciously work through symptoms when they do pop upn__label__3 last year after starting my th round of trying to get on meds and stick with a therapist in the last years i finally had a psychiatrist ask me the bpd questions and he told me youre hitting a lot of the markers for bpd i would go ahead and do some research on it and bring it up at your next therapy appointmentnow my therapist and psychiatrist both agree that i have it but are reluctant to diagnose because of the stigmas and such they absolutely help to treat it though i am very lucky to have both of themn__label__0 i didnt even know it was a thing until i got diagnosed it was given a bunch of information to digest and boom everything clicked and i felt like there was finally an answer for why i was the way i amn__label__0 i didnt know about bpd so when i went to a psych ward they diagnosed me i thought i was autistic bc i have sensory issues but nope just bpd and it makes a lot of sensen__label__1 i was i was in a trauma center or facility for people with trauma i was telling the therapist my life story and just aired everything out to her even especially my mistakes she immediately knew after a couple sessions that i had borderline personality disorder i had never heard of it before when she brought out the dsm to show me i looked at the symptoms and everything clicked into place when she was describing back to me my behaviors and thought patterns and how closely they matched everything my whole life made sense finally i was shocked i always wondered what was wrong with me and why am i so different and she gave me that answer i finally had a direction to go in ill never forget what she did for me by literally just telling me the answer to my behaviors thoughts and feelings my mom finally understood too she didnt feel as lost in how to help me she was able to help me a lot more after that when the therapist told her i had bpd my mom looked into it a lot even she was like this made the most sense to her that therapist was very patient and kind with me even when i was kind of bitchy i already had been through a lot before i first got to the center i was having seizures opiate withdrawals it was awful i had no idea what direction i was gonna go in from there i got worse lol but when i talked to her i felt more hopefuln__label__1 i think i was i had been showing signs since ive had lots of therapy to find out whats wrong with me latest doctor who treated me dismissed bpd in our first sitting not greatn__label__2 i was one day i was driving my sister to the airport for a trip then all the sudden i was omw to a crisis center after a suicide attempt it was potentially the same day i dont remember that weekend well i went to an outpatient treatment center for a week or two and they diagnosed me there i thought i had bipolar for all of high school before thatn__label__0 this year at on january nd i talked to my psychiatrist that my wife and i noticed my mood over time with bipolar disorder has been better but the day to day in the moment moods were still volatile talked about it for a couple sessions and he determined im also borderlinen__label__2 the first time was during girl interrupted when they all found their files most of the symptoms fit save a few after that it was when my therapist told me i had trauma when i was a kid and i just thought all of my issues were from my ptsd we worked on a plan of sorts i never did hear back from the dbt group i was supposed to joinn__label__0 my mom told me i had bpd all my life and eventually i ended up in the hospital at and they figured out i actually had bpd confirmed by psychiatrists later toon__label__2 im my psychiatrist suspects bpd from one appointment he put me on lamictal to see if that works on me he said he didnt want to nail down a diagnosis yet most likely because this was our first appointment lmao but that hell most likely make a diagnosis in our next session my therapist js great he really understands me ive been seeing him for around years so he knows most of my tells i have a hard time communicating what im thinking and how im feeling i definitely recommend trying to find another therapist i was lucky and found a good one on my second try but it can take longer for some you could try to research and see if any therapists near you specialise in bpd or personality disorders in general its likely they would understand better than your average therapist i first suspected i might have bpd around when i was writing a paper in the disorder and read the dsm maybe read through that and see if you feel it fits you well i can link a pdf of dsm that i haven__label__3 i was diagnosed when i was im currently in the process of resuming one on one cbt i finished dbt around september of last year im involved in group therapy which does cycle through dbt skills which kinda helps to remind me theres other ways to be able to regulate myself and change the way i think its still hard though i was in and out of therapy since i was for depression and anxiety so the diagnosis of bpd was terrifying especially since it came after a depressive episode which winded me up with me in the hospital ive been using a workbook about bpd which kinda helps me to see what i feel and also put into words exactly what aspects of bpd affects me on a daily basis it sucks but i try to make sure my therapist is a person id be comfortable with such as being young young because ive had my fair share of old farts who belittled me and my situations sometimes gotta cycle through the therapists until you find someone or even a program that assists with people with bpd youre not alone op and i hope this gives a little insight for youn__label__0 diagnosed at the start of the lockdown in australia i was everything was great with the psych until i suggested i was autistic and then he dumped me i find nobody gets it unless theyve been through it its the worstn__label__0 im not diagnosed but i told my psychiatrist about my unstable relationships and how i attempted because i got blocked by someone i really liked and then he was like you have bpd after he said that he refuses to diagnose me and says that its because he doesnt want to think theres something wrong with me like you already told me whats the differencen__label__0 i was in a hospital diagnosed with emerging eupd then later just eupd i had no idea it was actually bpd at the time until i did a bit of research as soon as i looked into it i knew they were right loln__label__1 im still learning how to live with it but finding a therapist is hardn__label__1 its a bit of an odd story my fp diagnosed with bpd suspected i had it after knowing me maybe a month it was all but confirmed in his mind after my first attempt i didnt get a diagnosis put on any medical record i have easy access to until around months later but was never told i didnt find the diagnosis for over a year and a half when i went looking to see if some medical bills had been processed by insurance it was by complete chance that i noticed and the years of ineffective therapy with different providers and further attempts all made a little more sense i was pissed that it was hidden from me thoughand no i dont think my therapist understands me theyre fresh out of school so not as experienced as other people i have seen but theyre the only one that would take someone with my diagnosis while also accepting my out of state insurance they havent had time to be scared away from clients like me yet but the inexperience isnt making them any less understanding than anybody else ive seen ive come to believe people without personality disorders just have a very challenging time grasping the thought processes involved in onen__label__0 i was diagnosed st but i suspected it a bit before thatn__label__1 i thought found an article about it one day because i was researching it and realized i matched all the criteria forgot all about it fast forward to a year and a half later last spring at years old and i started therapy with a new therapist a few months in she starts talking about me having bpd and i was like wait what and she was telling me about it and i realized everything she was saying about it and about me made so much sense i started looking into it again and it felt like everything in my life made so much sense so i found out because my therapist casually proposed i had bpd and then diagnosed me with it lolto add i suggest finding a therapist who understand your symptoms and experiences in more depth part of having bpd is an intense need to be understoodn__label__0 my ex told me to get tested like two months after we broke up she had it too and said me and her had a lot in common with how felt thinked and just did things so i did and well yeah here we are now loln__label__1 i was diagnosed just before my th birthday and have had it confirmed twice since i have had bad therapist and good ones i currently dont have one and i am unmedicated i find it easier when im not medicated i do miss therapy and would love to get back into it i struggle more with not being understood by people around me i know they try but i also know they will never fully understand it and thats hard sometimes but i am currently living life as fully as possible i live with my loving partner and his mum and i have amazing friends around me some days are really hard butt some days are great i just turned like days ago haha sometimes we just need to trust that things will be okayn__label__1 my therapist thinks its because im in a bad relationship and its not bpd so idk yet until i leave him and end it smhn__label__1 i was about and going down a mental health rabbit hole i stumbled across a video about bpd and i had never seen anything that described how i feel so accurately so i went down a different rabbit hole about bpd and saw myself in it more and more after a week or of doing this i asked y therapist and she said that she had been thinking about it as well so overall a fairly positive experience with this disordern__label__2 after i got off my meds everything came back from high school and i realized something was deeply wrong with me my therapist later recognized it as well and suggested bpd after researching it and every other mental illness that i might relate to i came to the conclusion that shes probably right im now going to be evaluated for it this junen__label__1 i was diagnosed in the hospital at after a pretty bad suicide attempt had me in there for a few months i was in denial of the diagnosis for a while because im already diagnosed with quite a few things and thought the diagnosis was incorrect and my bpd symptoms could be explained away by my cptsd i eventually realised it was accurate though and have since accepted it i have a couple different therapists for different things and i feel relatively understood by all of themn__label__0 years ago on my way to the psych ward at the hospitaln__label__0 i tried to sign up for a research study that just listed the symptoms without actually saying what it was for when they told me it was for people with bpd i got really confused and then later was diagnosed when i started going to therapy for other reasons it was kinda ironic tbhn__label__1 my former therapist told me i had borderline qualities in like i got into a psych ward in got diagnosed with it when i got releasedn__label__0 got diagnosed last year after a hospital stint due to a crisisn__label__0 i was and my symptoms were getting really strong my life had also fallen apart a bit i had to go to my universitys psychiatrist because everything what so bad and that is when she diagnosed men__label__0 i read the dsm symptoms and mistook it for my life story then i tried to pretend it wasnt a thing until my clinical psychologist pointed it out still not officially diagnosed mental health professions seem reluctant to have it go on my recordsn__label__1 recently received a pre diagnosis by two psychiatrists in the previous she didnt gave me the ultimate it is what it is but like it should be borderline by what i said or bipolar disorder but she keep up the borderline diagnosis and said to me that i shouldve come over on a month family was surprised and not accept very well i still live with mom and ive had other session with another psychiatrist i didnt even told him what the other psychiatrist said he gave me the its borderline and you actually have traits and some like you know you act like that because a possible borderline personality disorder you know and if things got worse he would gave me lithium but i always have suspected my whole life i felt different from others im so i think he might study my case but its like that it is what it is its hard to accept and when you look back at your life you understand the way you act and feel likewhy i have this this isnt my fault its genetics plus traumas and sometimes i dont want to take my meds because i think im cured or something like i need to cry i need to feel myself but when im off for like or even some hours i confirm i need that just a lil ventits hard to accept that and my family is a little judgmental of it son__label__0 almost in germany was in therapy because of a suicide attempt and then i got diagnosedn__label__0 i was diagnosed in and honestly the reason i got diagnosed was because i impulsively od on benadryl one night and then went to class like nothing happened i waited till the next day to tell people bc i wanted attentionn__label__0 i got diagnosed at and it was honestly multifaceted ive become very self aware and its helped me immensely but for a long time i wasnt and it made me ruin so many good friendships and relationships the only thing i could think of after being diagnosed was how many people id hurt potentially unnecessarilyn__label__0 i was and it was during my nd time in the psych ward less than a week after my st time and following a really sudden very unexpected traumatic breakup i dont remember all the details but they asked a lot about my relationships with people and what happened when things went bad this time it was suicide attempts but before i was driving hours away to meet up with strangers i barely knew and even went to mexico by myself during an episode they seemed interested in those periods too even though it was years prior i was just honest about my mindset at the time even if it made me sound like a bad person but they said ultimately thats what helped them figure out if it was bipolar or bpdn__label__5 for clarification i am self diagnosed actively trying to get a diagnosis i have gone down every route and and it could not possibly be anything elseso when i was a kid my special interest was mental disorders like researching them over and over i got a professional ocd diagnosis when i was because i related a little too hard to all the stuff i was reading and i realised something was wrong anyways flash forward to my teen years im still reading up on mental disorders and cluster b feels a little too familiar to me i knew i was a dumb teenager and it was probably because of my raging hormones that my relationships and view on life were so unstable so i figured it would pass it did not passi became self aware that i was sabotaging all my relationships and friendships and dug myself into a deeper hole it was pretty clear now that there was something wrong besides the autism and ocd i learned that my mom was diagnosed with bpd and when we got talking she was concerned because i was acting very similar to her when she was undiagnosed and untreated since i was under all we could do was go through camhs who was no help and the moment i turned the pandemic happened so mental health services were fucked i did some cbt which was no help because it was over the phone when the pandemic died down i could finally go to adult services but unfortunately since then ive been in an infinite loop of referrals im sure its just your autism being referred back to the guys who referred me in the first place and now im and not any closer to a diagnosis the closest thing to treatment is antidepressants and antipsychotics that were prescribed to help me sleeptldr i was so autistic i caught onto my ocd as a child and unfortunately i was right about the borderline but no one wants to open that can of wormsn__label__1 it sort of made sense even though i believed i didnt have abandonment issues or a favorite person i sought out a therapist and they immediately diagnosed me with bpd fast forward a year later i entered into a relationship and after a few months of dating we broke up and i tried to kmsn__label__0 my case worker at noticed as she was the only one around me to notice loln__label__0 last year aged over my family left because of my moodswings and yelling by the end i was having rants that i couldnt remember a minute later pretty much thought id lost my mind started therapy after a mental health referral from my doctor and it turns out ive been a living textbook example of bpd since about the age of or so after the diagnosis i read a checklist of symptoms and ticked all of them off then a rush of realisation about all the times its caused huge issues in my life exes blackouts wilfully awful behaviour and the misery and breakups and flareups and moody awful parenting this made me sleep sweaty nightmares for a week trying to fix myself now and suffering from gutwrenching guilt about what a shitty father ive been at times with my moodswings and angry rantingif you have an inkling all might not be well between your ears id suggest getting it looked at sooner rather than later for everyones sake this stuff breaks families and ruins livesn__label__0 i still dont have a diagnosis i dont quite show all the classic symptoms but just learning more about triggers and how to cope has been helpingn__label__0 i was when i found out that i have bpdn__label__2 i was and had had a kind of breakdown too anxious to work body image and spiking alcohol issues i was admitted to a psych hospital for the first time and i got the diagnosis from the psychiatrist so thankful for that it shed so much light on myself and my struggles note i am in australia and its a lot easieraffordable to get adequate mental health treatment i lived in the us for years and totally get that its a very different story in other parts of the worldn__label__1 it was a about a year ago i was at the time i was really afraid and did not understand the diagnoses because all of the symptoms became a very normal and mundane part of my life in my earlier years as i was comparing to my friends who also had bpd both excisting and past relationships they were more out there verbally and i was not it was bad of me to compare but that was also the very stigmatized image of bpd that got burned into my brain you could consider it a more quiet bpd you have a lot of combinations and that made me understand it alot better i explained to my therapist when i got a second assesment that i wasnt sure how the symptoms fitted me but she explained me very nicely how those symptoms can come out about and that its different for everyonei fitted all the criteria she went over them with me and connected them back to my previous assesments with her and current aspects in my life ive had symptoms dating back to my th making it hard for my own self to see how it became a standard of livingsorry to hear your therapist doesnt understand maybe you can try and switch therapists within that same departementn__label__0 trigger warning for self harm suic and adult minor relationsmy finding out proceess was kinda weird i ended up in the hospital for self harm and an attempt on my life then after getting out of there i figured out the relationship i had with my father was not normal i reported it to the police then had a court mandated psych test the guy who did it told my mom off the record i have bpd but couldnt offically diagnose me due to my age i was so now im working on getting an offical diagnosis and hopefully getting some help for itn__label__0 yo i knew i was different i knew i felt different i got a bit of knowledge and i thought that i had split personalities since am no one and am everyone at the same time so i kept searching till i found out that i do have bpdn__label__0 diagnosed in thought it sounded dumb and told no one plus no research continue hurricane of a life until re diagnosed and in therapyn__label__1 had a plethora of diagnosis in the past had been doing therapy for like years and stopped taking my anxiety meds went a little crazy and ct my wrists ended up in the hospital welp the rest is historyn__label__0 the last three relationshipsdating ive had have only lasted max weeks either they abandoned me or i split on them and pushed them away spiralled out of control with the last two and od and attempted immediately got psychology review and after a couple sessions was diagnosed with bpdn__label__0 im officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder type but i split on people and apparently thats a bpd thing i also have black and white thinking get obsessed with someone then can drop them like its nothingn__label__0 actually i found out after becoming obsessed with psychology lol i found it fascinating i was constantly doing research on it looking for new subs to follow and read about and follow subs of disorders i didnt know about i remember i saw bpd sub and just clicked on it like i did with all the other subs and started scrolling and was like holy shit i knew then thats what i had got diagnosed a year later never mentioned it lol but i saw i had a new diagnosis after a hospital visit and knew right away what it wasn__label__1 i was and diagnosed by my current therapist i do feel understood by him more so than i think i have by any mental health professional ive ever met keep shopping around its supposed to work for you and youre supposed to feel understoodn__label__2 i was at the time closing in on now myself this year and i had split hard on my girlfriend i came back around quick and apologized because that was easily the most healthy relationship i ever had she was a psychology student and when i apologized she treated me with care but also asked me if i had heard of bpd which until then i didnt even know was a thing she talked with me about what she knew and what things i had done or said that suggested this may be something to consider so i took it and dug further seeking out therapy and if i fit the diagnosis which i ended up being diagnosed very soon after we restored our relationship but i split again and worse that time because i couldnt hide from it and was terrified and frozen and we never spoke again except for me apologizing a few months after once i had freed myself of the split the therapist that diagnosed me i did not feel understood me at all but i found one that did a few years later and was able to make really good progress until they moved to an inpatient practice and i had to suffer that loss and find a new therapist the nature of bpd is very hard to understand if you do not yourself have it but now as im older i almost feel as if im hitting a stage where i have to relearn everything in a way if that makes any sensen__label__0 found wiki article and was like holy shit this is me i think i was or got diagnosed last year at currently on waiting list for adhd and autism tests boy its been a riden__label__0 after a suicide attempt that happened out of nowhere in one of the most joyful periods of my lifen__label__2 i just turned i was told that i had a lot of symptoms traits i was constantly in out of hospitals had numerous attempts i was losing it but ive gotten a lot better with time honestly with therapy i feel like dbt therapist understand more they know how to help people who have bpd more than others who arent specialized in itn__label__0 so i was certain i had bipolar although i cycle at least twice a day and then my brother tells me his ex girlfriend had borderline so im curious about it and well at this time he had a son so i had a choice to make stay in the closet about my borderline or have a chance to be in my nephews life in hindsight that was a really stupid decision and i think my brother is a toxic personn__label__1 hi there i think their therapist does not understand them regardless of what the actual reason for seeing the therapist is i would look for another one you need to be comfortable with them and they need to be experienced with bpdall of your feelings are validn__label__0 i was misdiagnosed as bp for like years until i had a full dissociative episode when my current doctor said hey wait a secondn__label__1 i got diagnosed with adhd at but at around after all the therapy and workshops i was doing i felt like it wasnt a complete diagnosis i just felt too different so i researched about mental health disorders intensely i went to multiple psychiatrists and accepted with defeat when they decided to medicate me instead of listen and still nothing seemed to fit or work although its still undiagnosed i learned later on that it felt incomplete because i wasnt aware of or treating my autism but years of feeling misunderstood underappreciated and annoying by the world forces you into isolation and then covid happened and suddenly the isolation was everywhere tangible accessible but the loneliness and emotional instability was still there and growing and then i came across quiet borderline personality disorder i was in a whole different country wondering how emotions can be this fleeting and dangerous i fell in love found out that i had undiagnosed autism that heavily contributed to me developing bpd fell out of love and in and out and in and out and in and out and when i finally came across the rbpd page i finally found out i wasnt the only one living a life so painfully passionate i wasnt alonebut hey selfdiagnosis is fake they sayn__label__0 im only and i havent been diagnosed or anything but i have autism and i feel i may also meet the criteria for bpd but im pretty sure noone will take me seriously and they will just say oh you have depression or severe anxiety or something like thatits painful to deal with since no one understands how you really feeln__label__1 in the middle of an argument my partner diagnosed me in anger he was right but it wasnt ideal i immediately spoke with a therapist and received an official diagnosisn__label__2 i pretty much had known since i was from obsessively reading the dsm and psych books i found that i met the criteria of having of the symptoms as i got older i thought it best to stop self diagnosing and leave it to the professionals diagnosed with adhd at bipolar after my first manic episode at took medication saw therapists fast forward to while i was hospitalized i was diagnosed with bpd and told that a bpd episode was responsible for this hospitalizationn__label__0 i was diagnosed with depression so in my depress phase i took a month prescription and swallow it all down i then proceed to walk around the house looking loose pills around i was happy and was not like depress during this which make me learn about what manic was i also learn about favourite person and i read a book which describe how i am the diagnosed make me feel seen after years i understand how i amn__label__1 hii i started showing borderline symptoms at selfharming constantly dysregulated nervous system fear of loss attachment impulse buying abusing alcoholmy therapist understands me very well and is able to understand even the most illogical of my actions in that he doesnt stubbornly judge me but rather talks to me about the trigger and together we work out ways to avoid such situationsmy therapists exwife used to suffer from bpd so he understands the irrationality and fear of lossn__label__0 i got d loln__label__0 iiin__label__0 removedn__label__0 i was btwn__label__0 me too same age and everything looking up what i was doing led me to research bpd and realise i fitted like all of the symptomsn__label__0 i can relate when i was younger i would became so obsessed with someone and i was like crying every night or doing something to myself because i felt like i would being abandoned or cheated on and i was never enough i would drink alone and episodes and all that shitn__label__0 same here even w the age thing he was my first favorite person tbhn__label__0 me too th graden__label__0 same thats when it all really hit me i went absolutely fucking bonkers didnt know i had it in men__label__0 same i cried all night and had to get sent to the mental hospital cause i was threatening unaliving i wasn__label__1 your previous therapist may have not wanted to diagnose because theres such a stigma even within the mental health field some professionals outright refuse to work with pwbpd so sometimes diagnosers dont write down the official diagnosis to protect patients i personally think this is harmful in its own way and contributing to the stigma but thats neither here nor thereanyway just a guess who knows what she was really thinkingn__label__0 being diagnosed with bpd can disqualify you from working certain jobs joining the military can affect rates you get for life insurance etc it can sometimes be better to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety or an unspecified mood disordern__label__4 ugh thats what my therapist said to me i went to her because my psychiatrist was unsure if i had bpd or bipolar even though i have always felt i relate wayy more to bpd symptoms this has been a debate many different doctors have had about me i told my new therapist i wanted to figure that out and she said well labels arent really the important thing i think we often get stuck on labels etc etc and im like it matters a lot for me to be put in the correct treatment and on the correct medssince a lot of bipolar symptoms are essentially solved with meds and bpd symptoms arent its not because i want a labeln__label__0 what are they telling you to commit crimes to take you more seriously wtfn__label__0 same thing here im yet to be diagnosed but when i asked my psychiatrist if they suspect i might have bpd they said something like i dont want to put a tag on you and that was the sign that she is almost sure its bpd but she refuses to give me a diagnosisn__label__0 lol i literally just wrote something similar i pretty much knew o had it from all the online reading bht i was in the psych ward and didnt say anything about bpd got something saying i had a new diagnosis on my discharge papers and i was like lol i dont even need to look at this to know what it is it was bpdn__label__0 yep the medical system is the most fucked part i got diagnosed with bpd and instantly they think that its the only problem when it clearly is notn__label__0 omg lol what a way to get out of workn__label__0 how did you find a community of othersn__label__0 im in the exact same position i sabotaged the whole relationship even after we broke up he was still there for me for years i still continued to sabotage things one day i did something that made him finally done with me and i never heard from him again i still cry almost everyday i think about how amazing he was to me and all the ways i wronged him how badly i want to take it all back its excruciatingn__label__4 this is crazy to me my meds are the only thing that lift my depression enough to even attempt dbt seroquel is a very harsh drug to be on longterm though it causes insulin resistance which has a lot of serious health consequences that are more alarming than getting fat you have lots of options for meds though taking them off the table completely feels like setting you up to failn__label__1 can you please shed more like on seroquel what did it actually help you with angry outburst depression splitting impulsive what exactly i have bpd i am managing life great but the only thing i cant manage is my anger outburst i really need help with that because its ruining all my relationshipsn__label__0 i have a very similar story when i look back i realize that my depression didnt start at that was my first major split i went for years undiagnosed i wish id known soonern__label__1 oh i was im now and i understand being diagnosed for bpd under is not possible but the reasoning is still weird im very closed off with my therapists so its hard for me to get help my psychiatrist doesnt seem to understand though he just says theres more fish in the sean__label__0 plus things got worse on my moods specially with depressive episodes but he refused lithium even with suicidal ideation its not actively but i think about it everyday i wish he put me on lithium because sometimes its helln__label__1 depending on your country it is likely you would be diagnosed with emerging bpd its kind of the same thing but used to diagnose someone generally under as with a personality disorder it is hard to say for certain before adulthood if you are struggling with bpd symptoms please dont put off getting help i was treated for my bpd undern__label__0 hello here im feel the same way im going to get diagnosed very soon also i love dazai idk if youve actually watched bungou stray dogs or not totally get what you mean it is possible to get diagnosed under dont listen to misinformationn__label__0 same i was tho i looked it up and bpd came up thats when i knew i had itn__label__0 that is a good guess i just wish she would have told me that if thats what she thought the vagueness of her reasoning is what bothers me the mostn__label__0 i think i actually am diagnosed with a mood disorder tbh i at least take medicine for itn__label__0 which jobs if u r willing to share please i am on disability but id been in the workforce before that was prior to any mental health diagnoses despite having been in therapy since age it was explained to me that i was undiagnosed because my therapy was not in a clinical setting i hope thats not still happening to ppln__label__0 yeah she knows more than shes letting on i think its as people say theres a stigma from peoplen__label__0 lmao rightn__label__0 yes it is hurting me so much it is the one thing in life i really wanted and i completely self destructed itn__label__0 my psychiatrist told me its for mood swings i def notice an improvement with impulsivity like not spending my entire paycheque in days and just the overall mood swings throughout the day doesnt eliminate it but definitely makes it easier for me to manage this is just my experience thoughn__label__1 my psychiatrist didnt diagnose me for the that reason she said her notes would help any future medical professionals or therapists i want to work with while an official bpd diagnosis would create a set of assumptions that dont apply to me that i would have to disprove over time im also the quiet type imo the temporary validation you get from a piece of paper is not worth the stigma especially if you ever find yourself in a legal predicamentn__label__1 i also take seroquel minimum dose and it helps me with insomnia and mood swings impulsivityn__label__0 that sucks but also makes sense i also have the quiet type which is probably why ive gone so long without anyone questioning if i have it loln__label__0 after i finally received my bpd diagnoses at my mom admitted that bpd had been brought up since i was but no one wanted to put a full label on it bc they thought id be judged or dismissed too oftenn__label__1 i think we invoke empathy because we act in rather than act out on others ie we make life miserable for ourselves but not other people as much by leaving us unlabeled with a formal diagnosis its a pat on the head saying youre one of the good ones which is really gross actually diagnosed cluster bs are treated like dirt society deals with psychopathology largely according to socioeconomic class repeated transgressions leads to eventually being assigned the prison or the psych ward as your permanent homen__label__0 me too i consider myself a quiet type and i feel like if i was more extroverted i almost surely would have been diagnosed sooner oh welln__label__0 weed completely seriously it has helped me cope with stress a lotn__label__0 ltheamine supplements are good for anxiety definitely take them with food thoughn__label__0 rly kk tysm for ur comment i totally get that i heard its rly good for stressn__label__0 kk i bought them before for myself let me see how they work for my bro tysmn__label__0 this post has been marked venting please be aware that the op may not be seeking advice unotcrazyenough if you do not want advice please specify in the body of your post i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorbpd if you have any questions or concernsn__label__1 holy shit i can relate to some degree im not diagnosed either professionals say i have traits no one believes me when i tell them im suffering so i have to show them by getting worse at this point i dont want to get better i want people to acknowledge im mentally ill if i get better now ill never get the validation i crave i want to prove ive always been having a really hard time because i truly have and yet i showed no one so now no one knows lol for me also this is a competition of whos the most fucked up like give me some credits i need the attention i always repelled but thats about it i dont fake suicide attempts nor do i fake diagnoses to get prescribed meds i dont need that makes you more toxic to yourself than me in the competition of you and me you win you know the fact that you get to the point to fake attempts and diagnoses shows how unwell you actually are this fucked up mentality is a sign that you need help and i really hope you can get it not wanting to get better is a trap i wish we both get out of itn__label__1 hi probably an unsolicited advice but i recommend actually getting the proper help you need talk to your psychiatrist about this because from what you said at this point it might be hard for you to extricate lies from reality please stop if u havent yet taking meds that were prescribed for the illnessessymptoms you faked i get that you came from a harsh and unaccepting environment where a mental burden should be eminently deteriorating for it to be seen and heard i understand where youre coming from and im sorry if some people under this post cant read your vent at a deeper sense but u also cant blame them for being offended but doing so taking meds u dont need will do u more harm than good if youre having a hard time knowing what mental illness u actually have or whats been weighing down your mind tell that to your psychiatrist or psychologist and have yourself examined again from now you have to be selfaware of whats real and whats not lets say you get attention for being mentally ill then they listen to you and put you in an institution prescribe you meds but nothing will work because some symptoms are not even there in the first place and only made to seek validation for something else remind yourself why you have to tell lies its to be heard and be validated that theres something wrong with you and why do you want validation maybe because you want them to know whats going on inside your mind and maybe even help you get through it yes you want them to believe you but aside from that whats the point of faking other symptoms when you wanted your struggles to be seen im sorry but youre not helping yourself and im sorry if ever this reply came out rude but to exude a harsh tone isnt my intentionn__label__0 i used to lie a lot before being diagnosed too i think i just had so many needs that were unmet and i couldnt even identify them that i subconsciously hoped others could fulfill at some point my web of lies was uncovered and it was the biggest shit show ever i have emotionally hurt so many people and it took me a long time to learn to deal with the guilt better myself make amends and move on i understand how you feel about lying i have been there too it is great that you recognize that this is an unhealthy and very harmful behavior and i urge you to find a way out of it be assured it may feel like you can keep this up but people will find out that you are lying i wish i could take back all the harm i have caused and learn how to actually handle my emotions at an earlier point in life i know right now it feels like you need to be sicker and sicker to get attention from others but life is so much better on the other side it feels better to have people love and care for you because they want to instead of having them care for you because they pity youn__label__2 hey im now and i felt the same way as a teenager i hate to say it but for me these traitshave only gotten more pronounced as ive gotten older plus substance abuse which hasnt helped i dont have an official diagnosis but ive had therapists tell me that they suspect bpd in the past idk at the end of the day here is my adviceit doesnt really matter if u get the diagnosis or not if ur having these issues that are affecting ur day to day life then id just try to stay in therapy and practice using the tools u learn there focus on taking care of urself doing things u enjoy practicing self awareness and active listening try not to focus so much on trying to have it all figured out nobody does really and especially not when they are young you wear urself out going thru the cycle of thinking you know all the answers only to realize you dont know much at all and most importantly dont forget that at the end of the day you cant be perfect nobody can people make mistakes but its how you learn from those mistakes that matters the fact that you are being honest with urself about toxic behavior is definitely a good sign dont stop being honest with yourself its painful to admit that youve hurt others but you can recognize it and choose to be more cognizant of the way youre treating people in the future best of luck to youn__label__0 yo in the same situation i mean ive never faked a suicide attempt or faked schizophrenia but sometimes it feels like everything i do is just my brain being dramatic wanting someone to care sometimes this shit is genuinely not on purpose but its good that u recognize ur intentions ppl w this disorder are fr just hurting and ik it feels like shit to feel like a pos but u deserve help frn__label__0 id say find a psychiatrist who specializes in personality disorders because it could or could not be bpd and it could or could not be another cluster b personality disorder some traits doesnt mean you have it but you might at least be able to get the help from someone you need who is specialized since we shouldnt self diagnose or have other online people diagnose you also dont have to have specifically bpd to struggle with mental illness but therapy and telling the truth to your provider is the best betn__label__0 these people are so unsupportive ew im sorryn__label__0 given your post history it sounds like you need rehab more than a diagnosis or internet validation right now something is definitely wrong but its not for us to say if its bpd or not based just on what youd said it can be hard to get better or even want to get better while still usingn__label__0 im toxic welcome to life with bpdn__label__0 i did all this shit when i was underage hell i still struggle with the competition part ive been diagnosed with personality disorders and im almost sure i somehow had to fake it even if i didnt know three of them existedn__label__0 removedn__label__0 relate relate relate it may make you feel better to know that growing up and maturing makes it much easier to recover people say it all the time and it never really clicks but when youre a teenager you really are a mess of emotions especially with bpd i felt like my toxic behavioural patterns would solidify as i became an adult but i think thanks to being self aware from i was able to start getting better once i became an adult and had less hormones going round or whatevern__label__0 you sound like me when i was and still sound like me even now at use to fake suicide attempts then they started turning into real ones got better and made myself worse again had tons of psych wards trips as a teen and now as an adult its not linear at all i remember not crying for an entire year or so one year and now i cry every single day have gained and lost tons of friends over the years have had tons of failed relationships because im too toxic and i find people that are just as toxic or even worse i relate to the needing to feel the most mentally ill sadly that was the only way my family would even pretend to care about me at all i really dont know what to say i wish i could be one of those adults that could comment dont worry it gets better but it hasnt for me and thats just me being honest to you i will say however that if or when youre given the chance to have more help please take it seriously you really dont wanna end up in the current position im in right now i dont wanna elaborate on that too much because it would be me trauma dumping on your post but in short life gets harder as you get older and it ends up being all on you to fix your life if it starts falling apart even more its really good though that youre already this aware of your behaviors i wasnt back then at all and thats part of why everything is horrible right now you sound pretty smartn__label__0 i think a lot of us do similar things subconsciously instead of faking a suicide attempt i would say a lot of us have done it as more of a cry for help i dont ever really think specifically that i have to be the most mentally fucked up or suffer the most its more that i suffer so fucking badly to the point where i dont believe anyone else would be able to handle what i go through and its almost validating knowing your the most mentally ill and knowing you suffer the most im barely able to function and knowing someone suffers more than me and is still able to have a functional life would feel very invalidating and upsettingn__label__0 yes andn__label__0 removedn__label__0 removedn__label__0 no not at all i was going to make a post actually about how sometimes i enjoy being toxic but other people dont always understand like sometimes it feels good to be bad kind of thingn__label__1 i have never felt so not alone the first paragrapheverything youve saidi can relate so much to it id say were pretty similar in toxic level honestly thank you for making me feel valid i feel awful that i do this but i cant help it sometimes i got on meds recently so it has helped a lot i see you we see each othern__label__1 yea i get where youre coming from its been years since ive stop taking those meds and most of the stuff ive mentioned have been done in the far past but theres still some shit i mentioned that ive struggled with this is all a big headache i switched psychiatrist because of the reason that she wouldnt listen to my real issues but idk everything is so confusing to me when i said a lie about things it probably isnt what people are thinking ive gotten reevaluated and thats kinda what came up idk sorryn__label__0 i really dont understand why people look at anyones post history and correlate that to what op is asking this happens a lot in this sub its also very odd to try and tell someone they need rehab when you dont know them while it may be true and i dont know because im not going to go digging at this persons post history its not anyones place to say i think we should stay on the main topic they also werent asking if they have bpd they were describing things they do and asking if anyone can relaten__label__0 im not asking to say wether or not i have bpd i just kinda wanted to vent on here idk and honestly i have asked for some sort of rehab but theres no place around me for minors and especially none that take my insurancen__label__0 dude some of the comments on here im like do the mods not care about this subreddit op needs support like what you gave instead of ridicule

everything and just pin point on one thing that make me feel crazyn__label__0 lmao thank u sm thats exactly what i needed to hear rn i was fucking going through it in the moment man i just went on the first community that i felt i could let all this shit out on im not claiming to diagnosed but since so many people point me to this direction i just landed here this shit didnt hurt u in any way so why go out the way to comment this i didnt make up anymore shit because it all feels so exhausting did saying that make you feel better about yourself are u gonna sleep better at night if u didnt like it scroll thats itn__label__0 ohhh okayy its a relief that you switched to another psychiatrist when she was not properly taking notes of your issues i hope youre feeling better even just a little bit and i hope venting here helped you let some steam off of un__label__1 fair enough i was around when my drug and alcohol related issues started to get nasty i never went to rehab until i was i can understand the struggle of trying to deal with medical insurance and all that other shitn__label__0 im a mod there are people on this sub and if you do not report the comments we will not see it we

back off the sub for a bitn__label__0 removedn__label__0 removedn__label__0 removedn__label__0 going back and forth berating a teenager in a bpd sub isnt any form of calm i knowtheyre clearly aware enough to mention seeking helpyou needed to back off what seems to have happened is you were triggered and attacked a childn__label__3 you wanna talk to my psychiatrist you want him to write a little special note for you telling u all the details about me as a patient the reason i said all this shit was to try to move past it by letting it out because i no longer do that other unhealthy shit sure but not that the reason i came to this sub was because when every mental health professional tells u about how u gotta get your shit together before you become an adult cuz if not the diagnosis becomes yk official youre gonna relate to the community couldve phrased it better yea but also im not gonna think about all that when im having a fucking breakdown think about that also the point of me faking those symptoms at that time was not for drugs but for the attention lmao and it didnt hurt anyone i wasnt taking meds from anyone else because the supply was there why where u so mad they were freen__label__0 removedn__label__0 removedn__label__0 you called her a joke and berated her over multiple long replies thats attacking you went beyond accountability with the clear venom in your

practice your empathygood luckedit wordsn__label__0 deletedn__label__2 have u read my post more medicine equals more validation validation to me being attention the way u say drugs makes it sounds

broken is making others feel unwelcome and being kind then dont say anything at all youre literally berating a teenager i was like this when i was a teenager and guess what i got better thats right i got better because i was able to vent and get help you can have a conversation with someone without being rude imagine that you need some time to self reflect and learn what empathy isn__label__0 id

time that i need to improve my life do more with my days etc also not being funny but weed is not the answer it definitely did fuck all for my bpd if anything i feel like it made it worse temporarily everyone responds differently to substances not very solid advice tbhn__label__2 its a shame that theres so much antimedication type stigma out there and that there are people who act like psych meds are universally bad its that kinda baseless superstition that helps keep bpd so stigmatized and unaddressed at largen__label__0 its almost like moms response could be one of the factors in you developing bpdn__label__1 i will go against the grain a little bit when i was at my most mentally stable i was the healthiest ive ever been i was sleeping hours a night jogging lifting weights eating clean gluten intolerant meditating had hobbies was focusing on school was single its not a cure all but it does help but the amount of effort and focus it takesis very difficult its a lifestyle that i feel out of and havent been able to get back to im on medication now and not taking care of my body im not doing well at alln__label__0 it sounds like she isnt educated enough on bpdn__label__1 weed often times can be exacerbate mental health problems as for your moms opinion i find it astounding the amount of people out there with that same exact idiotic opinion if it were that simple psychiatrists and therapists wouldnt existn__label__1 meds saved my life lol i couldnt give less of a fuck what someone wants to say its my sanity compared to your opinion do what you gotta do baen__label__0 when i was still living w my father the main cause of my bpd he told me to start microdosing with himn__label__2 your mom sounds like she has some pretty serious mental health issues of her own im sorry that youre having to put up with it no one deserves that kind of treatment from someone who is ideally supposed to be a part of the support systemn__label__0 have you tried praying to jesus yet thats my mothers favorite remedy for everything i feel your pain opn__label__0 unless she can show you her medical degree id be hesitant to be polite enough to pretend to listen you know the sound a buzzer makes like a ehhhhnnnnnnhhh do that every time she starts talking out of her ass she will never change so have some funn__label__1 your husband is correct the medication keeps us from going off the rails it has saved my life toon__label__0 i think parents can be very dismissive of bpd when they at least subconsciously know they caused it its their shitty way of copingits insensitive and emotionally immature but in their mind its easier to make it seem like your fault and easily solved than accept that they have messed you up badn__label__1 sorry your mom is a jerk and has clue about mental health you did nothing wrong here your hubby is right you know your body and know exactly what would happen if you quit nothing good meds saved my life and i will always remember the people that got me going if what your mom said was true drs would do it they dont hold your head up and celebrate yourselfn__label__1 idk what meds ur on but try lybalvi or olanzapine it helped me a lot anyway combining meds with a good diet will help too so these all natural folks forget that both can be good at the same time my grandma tried to get me to take all these supplements and shit and i was like i already take a bunch of pills why do i need more i didnt take all those supplements but i do eat better and feel better but i would say the meds helped the most and this was after like years of trying to find a med that worked for me because finally i found a psychiatrist that knew about bpd she left the company and they gave me a new psychiatrist rip but i feel like this one isnt as good as my last i also smoke weed a few times a week but i wouldnt say that cured me its just fun to do and helps with when i feel depressedn__label__3 a i take pharmaceutical medication and weed you can do both b my doc just took me off of one of my meds coldturkey bcuz i started having some very concerning sideeffects and i feel like ass currently omw home from work early bcuz of a migraine ask your mom if she wants to reimburse you for your time off work while you adjust take care of you when you have side effects help you schedule and get to all of the doc appointments related to going off of your meds etcn__label__1 ranting with youits so discouraging to hear someone you love tell you to just like they have you all figured out like they know whats best for you and your mental healthhaving cptsd ptsd it takes years of practice and therapy to move past those painful events its not something you can just decide to stop thinking about im sure it was very frustrating and disheartening to hear those words from her and really invalidating for her to say that its that simple telling you to quit your meds and replace them with weed is so infuriating ru fucking joking life is difficult enough on meds im legitimately terrified of going off of my meds because of how destructive i would be to myself and to othersi wish people wouldnt butt in on shit they dont even try to understand it hurts even more when its people that you care about i feel for you im sending a hug your wayn__label__1 my mom was the exact same way my mom acted like a huge organic health nut since my preteens led to a dysfunctional relationship with food and my body image when i turned she doesnt believe in mental health so i had to postpone therapy until social services were involved was perscribed antidepressants she would hide them and compensate with vitamin d supplementsits because of all that junk food that youre depressed she would say as she wouldnt let me eat anything with more than gs of sodium its because you dont have god in your heart its that damn phonethis post makes me so angry for youn__label__0 just stop being depressedyet theyd never tear down someone struggling with a physical illnessdisability ignorance is everywhere huhn__label__1 last time i quit my meds i landed promptly back in my hospitals ae to be fair i was going through an extremely rough patch for months prior but that action tipped the balance ive gradually become aware exists living with an illness as volatile as bpd where youre somewhere between managing emotions and reactions to triggers with good success struggling but surviving or in need of urgent medical helpit is always extremely dangerous to cold turkey meds with no warning or feedback from a qualified professional and irresponsible in the extreme for it to be suggested as an optionn__label__0 if i had a penny for everytime someone told me to just eat healthy and exercise more after telling them about my mental health like i have a literal personality disorder but yes making sure i get more fiber in my diet is for sure gonna fix all of my interpersonal relationship issues suicidal ideations and extreme mood fluctuations for surrreeeand no doubt diet and exercise plays a role in mental and physical health but people really say that with the smartest tone as if theyre the first person on earth to think of telling me to eat healthy and exercise more i can always tell when someones never experienced true mental illness when their only recommendation to poor mental health is well eat better not only does it go to show they dont understand the complexities of mental illness or even just poor mental health in the first place but additionally they have clearly never gone through a period of extremely poor mental health because if they had theyd know that eating healthy can be easier said than done and exercise is the literal last thing im gonna be able to do when im so depressed i cant even get myself to get out of bed for a glass of water same vibes as someone saying have you ever thought about just being happyn__label__2 not adviceircomfort more thoughts triggered by this its also more of a half complete thought so read with more than a grain of saltive had similar wonders about that i was starting therapy and potentially meds for it but i flaked because the fear of the medical costs and the effects the ends would have terrified me i started making a lot of mental health improvements form there and did a lot of cbt on myself and had some therapeutic conversationshowever not everyone situation is the same and in some cases your brain reshapes itself with bpd and that becomes a more natural shape in some cases it can be like that from birth in cases like that and where your brain drastically changes shake to what i am going to refer to as bpd brain for now i feel like meds make a lotmoreimoact and are more helpful in less molded brains i can see where your moms logic is more applicablen__label__0 yep snap out of it heard that many timesn__label__2 the thing is i have tried alot of meds and it didnt help my bpd but that doesnt mean it could help others i know sometimes people can test your dna to see the effectiveness of certain meds by the side effects and stuff i think it just really depends what works for you and dont think someone else who doesnt know alot about bpd could determine that for you ideally the doctors should work with all natural and synthetic meds around the world and have broad knowledgen__label__0 just smile breathe and think happy thoughts lol i feel you on that quit living in the past bsn__label__1 i take mg of zoloft and mg saroten for my anxiety and depression she believes they are the thing thats makes me sick the biggest reason for my health is my thyroid lvls is not stabilizing its been years now of testing and adjustingn__label__3 medication is an evil we need unfortunately there are so many people who benefit from psychotropic medications people who cannot function without them so the benefit is definitely there but that doesnt change the negatives either the fact that a very very large portion of these medications have horrible side effects in the long term we essentially poison ourselves to function within society risking permanent health complicationsn__label__0 thats what happens when education is a seen as a means to control rather than a means to educate you get people confusing their half baked crack pot ideas with facts researched and challenged and verified over centuries by highly educated and specialized professionalsanyone anti med or anti vax should be able to sign something affirming their beliefs and thus excluding them from being able to receive actual medical care anti intellectualism should have consequences in the real worldn__label__4 i gotta have my meds theyre helpful seroquel lithium wellbutrin and klonopinn__label__1 that one hit home i have severe adhd thats affected me from a very young age my mom chose to not only keep me off adderal which i need but chalk it up to me having autism oppositional deficiencies disorder and when no one would diagnose me with either she resorted to giving me magnesiummelatonin to cure me when that didnt work she beat the shit out of me fuck all that more people need to see denying kids medication is absuen__label__1 my therapist suggested i brought my mom for some of my sessions minutes in the first visit she had to push the emergency button and she was escorted outn__label__0 lol my mom ran my formative years like a prison warden we dont speak anymore i think shes a covert npdn__label__0 my mom is more holistic electromagneticwaves healing stones and suchn__label__2 i wouldnt have these issues if she didnt made bad life choices when she decided to get kidsbtw i talked with my dr about quitting my meds he said ok if we start now you might be of them when your kid graduates years from now apparently zoloft is hard to quit when you have been on them for a long periodn__label__2 you hit the mail on the head it doesnt help that big pharma could sell things for substantially less money but greed has made it expensive as well its no surprised a lot of people are antimedication i will say that i am one but not ina judgmental way just in a personal way what people need to understand is that different things work for different people i can and do believe that with enough willpower and consistent work towards yourself most mental health problems can be fixed without medication obviously this is specifically what works for me as meds make me feel more worse but meds might do wonders for someone else so why would i not want thatn__label__2 it really is medical professionals called my mother parental bullying due to her not wanting me to have to take pharmacodynamic drugsn__label__2 yup that makes sense now why she doesnt know abt it she isnt even making an effort to learn it seems maybe tell the therapist to tell her in the first few mins how important meds are for u or if she still doesnt listen j try to block it out bc u cant take advice from someone who doesnt even know what theyre talking abtn__label__0 my mother is just a catholic zealot lol she reckons mental disorders need require exorcism like wtfn__label__4 big pharma are disgusting to me knowingly selling and churning out medications and treatments that they know will just keep us coming back years later for other problems because of said treatments if we funded research into learning about the brain and its functions way more than we funnel money into pharmaceuticals we could probably use surgery to treat people like us with next to zero risk and close to success with little risk of the problem returning but instead we use medicationn__label__0 oh wow im sorry that sucksn__label__1 gotta make that why fix is when they can treat us and make money for lifen__label__0 ikr still it is what is it i guess really sucks because the right kind of support makes a hell of a difference to people with a mental health conditionn__label__0 absolutely i finally have a job with excellent benefits only

omg boredom is the worst being bored personally makes me spiral as well feeling extremely empty hopeless and like i dont even know who i am recently i have been trying to escape boredom and really just bpd episodes in generala couple things that have helped me tremendously are hobbies for me nails art makeup fashion reading things that i resonate with and that make me feel understood journaling how i feel cleaning and doing anything i know i have to get done even if i want to procrastinate if i feel these are not enough to distract me from spiraling it helps me to just let myself feel my emotions even if it really is painful breathing and telling myself i will be okay because it is only temporary i hope you find something that really helps you you got thisn__label__0 god this is the worst feeling i work from home and the temptation to work to fill the void is so strongn__label__0 the only way really to learn to sit with boredom is just to sit with boredom but i find its easier to just use boredom to motivate you to do things you wouldnt normally want to do like if im bored ill wash the dishes or do hwn__label__0 excellent suggestions also just sitting and noticing physical sensations like tightness in jaw muscle contractions broken heart etc just for a minute or two before doing other things might help over time just sitting with physical sensations will be enough to pass time and it wont be so exhaustingn__label__0 ya i cant meditate for this reason my mind goes haywiren__label__0 i play guitar to calm the nerves its very relaxing soothes the

bariatric weight loss doctor until your bmi is overn__label__1 my primary care physician was willing to prescribe weight loss meds to me for obesity i think you can probably get those meds from a pcp or get a referral from your pcp to a doctor who can prescribe the medsin my unprofessional opinion when youre on the meds you should be careful and get blood tests for vitamin deficiencies i got a b and iron deficiency when i started eating less food once you identify that you can take supplementsn__label__4 if you have ppo insurance where you dont need a referral you should be able to schedule an appointment with a weight loss doctor without seeing your primary care physician np its very possible they will start you on metformin as its usually covered by insurance cheap and can be effective they might discuss glp injectables like ozempic wegovy mounjaro zepbound but they usually wont do that right at the beginning they might order labs and check if you have other things contributing to weight gain and may even do some genetic testing as well usually rather expensive and will probably also suggest seeing a dietician you might want to look at your insurance plan and see if weight loss treatment is covered so you know if you will be paying out of pocket for things like weight loss doctor appointments dietician medications etc ive been working with a weight loss doctor for over yearsn__label__0 just curious for a follow upn__label__0 thanks for the feedback ive never taken medicine for weight loss but i really want to the most ive tried is apple cider vinegar gummiesn__label__0 awesome thank youn__label__2 i couldnt get anyone to write me a script for weight loss medication however my primary doc prescribed an antidepressant i think it might help me be more active because i was spending a lot of time cryingn__label__0 np i hope it goes smoothly for youn__label__0 thank you i see my doc on wednesday morning so im going to ask her thenn__label__0 this post has been marked as a venting post please be aware that the op may not be seeking advice ujournalisticpandamon if you do not want advice please specify in the body of your post i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorbpd if you have any questions or concernsn__label__0 im sorry about whats going on in your life i think your friend is just not a good person to be around i know autistic people pretty positive no autism symptom includes being a shitty person id be angry too avoiding responsibility and especially slapping a but were friends onto your attempts to communicate is just so annoying if shes just tryna avoid being told she upset you by saying it makes her wanna harm herself its not right i can relate to wanting to do things to myself when told i hurt or annoyed someone but i take accountability for what i did instead of just throwing my bpd intrusive thoughts on them as if its their responsibility nown__label__0 you make a good point when it comes to my friend shes always like i was raised this way i cant unlearn that then when she ask how can she i dont have a good answer since i wasnt raised the same way she also likes to point out that her parents never taught her how to take responsibility and stuff like that she also gets to mom to come up to her apt almost hr drive or clean her apartment and do her laundry she works in social work so its a hard job but like every week she then goes you just jealous cause your parents werent good parents i usually answer with no shit im jealous cause my parents would never do that for men__label__0 trigger warning if you go to the contents page instead of to the abstract ive linked theres a stock photo of si i cut as an adolescent around the same time i was on mg of flouxetine the link obviously isnt stoneclad but i thought this article was interestingn__label__2 well you need to apologize first of all tell her that you were curious about her treatment but shouldnt have invaded her privacy instead of asking herbecause yeah you shouldve asked her about it instead of taking a picture you couldve just googled the name of the medicineand offer to delete the picture and explain how you had no malicious intent this would send me into a spiral of paranoia why wouldnt he just google it why would he take a picture does he want to show someone does he want some kind of proof against me you broke her trust so apologize and promise to do better she might not forgive you thoughn__label__0 this isnt about her having bpd its about you being a pos her disorder is irrelevant to your actions post this on aitah and see what people say about youn__label__1 what made you curious about them what was your intent with the information telling her the answers to these questions may help you could also spin it in a favorable direction like i care about you and its good for me to know what meds youre on in case something happens to you and im there to give paramedics the information the pictures are so i dont forget the names or that you wanted to know more about the meds to be able to better support her but dont tell her those things if they arent true i can see her side that it hurt her you taking the pictures and not telling her id be weirded out and upset too if a guy took pics of my med bottles and didnt ask me abouy them not to mention some of my meds have street value and could be sold however im obviously not too concerned about this because theyre in an open bag in my bathroom where anyone can see themn__label__1 ok ive never taken any meds for my bpd but i really dont get whats the problem with what you did op you just took a picture of something that was in the trash that you wereare curious about leave op alone peoplen__label__0 what you did is an insane violation of her privacy why post this on the bpd subreddit it has nothing to do with her disorder and everything to do with your own actions that disregarded her right to privacy for the sake of your curiosityn__label__1 this doesnt seem like itd be a huge deal to me idk but i dont take medication and i manage my symptoms maybe it is a bpd thing lots of people are disagreeing with you but this wouldnt bother me that much i usually take people at their word and give them the benefit of the doubt i have bpd and ive dated people with it who had worse symptoms than mine and my only advice would be that you cant control it at this point shell either spiral away or shell suddenly want to forgive you but i dont think theres much that you can do rn tbh she probably is splitting in reaction to this and has jumped to a lot of conclusions shes probably no longer going to believe anything you say because of this and youre just going to need to accept that and take it on the chinn__label__1 you know she has bpd so thats not news that she has medicine for it neither and that was in trash anyways i dont see much of a problem i tell mine which pills i take and if i am switching them were both curious about them and reading on side effects etcn__label__0 the goodbad thing about a person with bpd is that for however much they hate you today tomorrow can be a completely different story depending on where she is at in therapyher ability to maintain boundaries and use logicrationalityn__label__0 not saying your the devil but im personally so blackwhite that i probably couldnt move past that throw yourself at her mercy shower her in love and attention earn that trust back if she allows but her timetable her guidelines dont gaslight hern__label__1 i second this apologize even if she had something else going on be it if it was meds for bpd or meds for a cold just apologizen__label__0 he said he took the picture to look it up latern__label__1 her having bpd does affect this situation a little bit and how is op a pos he didnt violate her privacy all he did was take a picture to look up later and knowing bpd hes probably right to be curious about her medsn__label__0 i know its not about her having bpd i know what i did was a pos move i guess im seeking advice on how to approach the situation bettern__label__0 a pos seriously youre going pretty far not saying snooping cant be wrong but he literally accidentally came across them and was simply curious as to what they were could he have asked her about them instead sure but whos to say there arent valid reasons why he cant or wouldnt feel comfortable askingall im saying is calling him a pos for that is pretty extremen__label__0 i was curious for a couple reasons she would occasionally joke with me about herpes she hasnt done it in some time and the thought of what if always sits in the back of my head weve been dating almost years ive also just always looked up anyones perception bottle i dont snoop through cabinets or anything but if its in the open i google it ive always just been curious about medicine when i was younger i liked pills not anymore though i feel if i tell her my reasonings she going to get angry or gonna think im lying about me looking up prescriptions just because i know its weird i know i shouldve asked i do feel horrible and i understand her reasons to be upset i know i should give her a couple days and let her calm down im just afraid if she splits on me for good i guessn__label__0 how is this violating her privacy the bottle was in the trash he didnt snoop around in cupboards or drawers it was out in the open if anything why was she looking through his phone not trying to imply anythingn__label__1 honestly even if she was recovering if she was still upset tomorrow that is a completely normal rational and healthy response to finding someone with a picture of your medication in the trash thats insanely creepy with no context and any normal person wouldnt just forget about it the next day just because they dont have bpd i feel like people need to be careful about labelling people with bpds very reasonable negative reactions to people invading boundaries as a sign of them being unstable when recovery isnt going to suddenly mean we dont have feelings anymore or we cant feel hurt when people invade very generic boundaries around privacy and respectn__label__0 while this is true i dont think it applies here she isnt simply splitting on him her feelings of betrayal and mistrust are totally valid and even people without bpd would have a reactionn__label__0 youre telling him to love bomb her this is deeply manipulativehe cannot earn her trust back just like that and especially not by showering her with love and attention this is so sickn__label__0 read the other comments im not repeating myselfn__label__0 op i dont think youre a pos you already understand you fcked up the best thing i think you can do is to acknowledge what you did validate her feelings stop bringing up the issue or over explaining to give her time then give her space and tell her you will continue to be here if she wants to talk actions speak louder than words you get defensive and it might not go well for youa lot of us here with bpd already have trust issues betrayal trauma etc so you will have other people with bpd reacting to this post in ways i dont think will be helpful for your situationyou may not want it to be the end of the relationship but thats out of your control now the best thing you can do is try not to add fuel to the fire and accept itn__label__0 like i said this doesnt have anything to do w bpd go on the relationship advice sub you dont get to manipulate her disorder into a get out of jail free cardedit i may seem like im coming on a bit strong but i would be so livid if a partner invaded my privacy like this and then posted on the bpd sub about it as though i have no sense of right and wrong and have to be managed like a childn__label__0 then why are you in a sub about bpd its completely irrelevantn__label__0 calling him a pos for this seems like black or white thinking to men__label__0 bro if my guy took pics of my prescriptions to look up later it would be the end of the relationship idk if i just have different expectations but that is slimy as hell nope nope nope nope nopen__label__0 i know im commenting a lot but i just dont think this is a situation where splitting is an appropriate word to use plenty of people without bpd would have a permanent shift in feeling about this i wish you the best op but i just hope youre able to consider her reactions outside the context of bpdn__label__0 best thing to do is tell her why if someone tells me why it clears up a lot of doubt and questionsn__label__1 ive always just looked up anyones prescription bottle that is the problem why on earth would you think its appropriate to look up someones private medical information even outright asking them is approaching intrusive if they havent already volunteered why theyre on medication but to photograph someones private information andor look it up shows you have no respect for peoples right to privacy or their boundaries its incredibly childish and untrustworthyyoure not entitled to anyones medical status or info just because youre curious again this situation has nothing to do with your partners bpd you have a lot of selfreflection to do on why you think your actions are okn__label__0 even if she was looking through his phone two wrongs wont make a rightthey can both have crossed boundaries in different ways that doesnt negate what op did its an obvious privacy violation its one thing to see a something in the trash and ask questions about it its an entirely different thing to pick it up and photograph it regardless of what his intent may be just because it was in the trash doesnt mean its suddenly free game to do whatever withn__label__0 right maybe i didnt explain myself well enough from my first comment i totally agree that she has a right to be upset what i meant by my second comment is that we tend to be very angry for several days but then may feel totally different a week later or something sorryn__label__0 lol what putting trust into actionpractice the three as affection attention and appreciation daily show your partner how much you love and appreciate them in big and small ways every day rebuilding trust involves more than listening and talking we must also display trust through our actionsn__label__0 my thought process exactly this isnt a cute case of i told my wife i loved her extra fluff when she askedn__label__2 i have and my points still stand and even if he asked her that doesnt tell him whats in the meds side effects and what they don__label__0 thank you this is really good advicen__label__0 belongs in the aitah sub and the answer is yesn__label__1 theyve also been together for two years the fact he doesnt know what medication his girlfriend is on after two years is pretty concerningn__label__0 its not slimy as hell to show concern over what theyre taking hes not manipulating her disorder he was concerned and now he knows he messed up dont be so angry and take it so personally youre not the girlfriend that this happened ton__label__0 this comment its not fair to label her very valid emotions about op breaking her trust as splittingn__label__0 thank you op is playing armchair psychologist there trying to label this as splittingn__label__0 i seriously agree with your comments its super worrisome to think bpd factors into this situation substantiallyif shes being short with op or acting different thats totally within her right and isnt about her disorder if she had a physical illness and op had done the same thing thered be no discussion about whether shes acting irrationally or doing anything like splitting using her bpd as a way to diminish how strange and intrusive his actions were is so cruel and shows no substantial attempt at accountabilityn__label__1 technically yeah it does make it free game but how is it entirely different even if he asked her that still doesnt tell him whats in the med what it does and what the side effects are either way he googles it im not trying to say that asking wouldnt have been a little nicer because it wouldve but i think ops gf and pretty much everyone else here is overreacting a bit there are a couple reasons i can think of that taking a picture of it is usefuln__label__0 he did not display trust in his actions thoughlook up how love bombing someone is manipulative for example it happens in narcissitic abuseyou told him to not gaslight her and i agree with that thoughif he had broke her trust by flirting with someone else putting trust into action practice with those as will not repair their relationship how is this different you cannot fix everything by giving affection attention and appreciation especially after invading someones privacy like that and keeping proof of itn__label__0 how is taking photos of someone elses prescriptions in their trash not a violation of privacy i swear the world has gone insaneedit way to edit out the privacy and bpd content out of your commentn__label__0 are you serious thats personal medical information its really none of his business some couples choose to share that information if she doesnt thats perfectly acceptableedit if he really wanted to know and it was a dealbreaker to not he should have just asked then she could decide if it was something she was willing to sharen__label__0 thank you exactly my pointn__label__0 omg i get to be pissed on others behalf im a woman too and i agree its not slimy to want to know its slimy to invade their privacy instead of asking it seems like youre being willfully obtusen__label__0 thank you i was starting to feel like id lost my mindn__label__0 im like i have a hard enough time seeing my valid emotional reactions as okay i pray she is experienced enough to process her emotions outside of his therapizingn__label__0 thanks for responding im glad im not in the minority on this post i just dont think the justified angry replies would be any different if this were posted on the other relationshipsah subsn__label__0 context is everything we ended up hanging out and she was looking at my pictures makes it seem consensual as he was fully aware she was doing this its not like she did it on the side while he wasnt there kind of like how he dug through trash to find her med bottle lmaon__label__0 because its in the trash its not private anymore and since hes dating her he does have a right to know what shes onn__label__0 a which commentb i didnt edit anything about privacy or bpd out of any of my commentsn__label__0 chill with the name calling youre not the only woman with bpdn__label__0 no seriously splitting is when your partner is doing everything right yet youre still pushing them away and most of the time youre not even angry with them youre angry with yourselfn__label__0 delusionaln__label__0 oh yeah youre right my bn__label__0 i stand by calling out slimy behaviorand why are you mentioning bpd literally having a sense of privacy and ethics is part of my personality nothing to do w bpdn__label__0 i disagree that splitting is when your partner is doing everything rightn__label__0 right i was going to say that too pwbpd are usually acutely aware of our condition as evidenced by all the posts on here being like are my emotions valid in this situation almost always they areedit i keep editing all my comments lol to clarify we usually know when our emotions arent validn__label__1 what i think is delusional is that people are expecting op to not care about his girlfriends health by not looking up what the meds aren__label__0 npn__label__0 im mentioning bpd because you mentioned bpdn__label__0 yeah that is not what splitting isn__label__2 pov my therapist telling me im hard to treat because im so self awaren__label__0 he should have asked her do you not know how this works i know im being rude but the fact that you think this is acceptable makes me hope you get some more interpersonal skills before getting into a relationshipn__label__0 no i didnt other than to say bpd really isnt relevant to ops situationn__label__0 omg samen__label__4 im not saying he shouldnt have have you considered he might already know the names of the meds shes taking and hes just wanting to get more info about what chemicals and drugs that are in the meds its a possibility op never said he did or didnt already know that i do think its acceptable if i was a neurotypical person dating someone with bpd id want to know if they are taking meds what kind of meds what is in them what they do and how they make my partner feel and act so i could help her with her health safety peace of mind and in case some of the side effects start kicking in and hurting the relationship help find new meds if necessaryn__label__0 bro you are coping so hard everything youre saying is valid and can be solved by asking i said this to another commenter or you cant remember but seriously stop being obtuse your logic here is gaslighty sorry i dug thru your trash and took pics of your private medical info babe i just wanted to help you like do you realize how you soundn__label__1 but he doesnt need to ask it wouldve been more polite but not necessary because it was out in the trash and it was only a picture why get into a relationship if you cant even trust your partner with something as basic as meds especially if that partner has a mental disorder that affects the entire relationshipn__label__0 well i guess we just differ on what is acceptable behavior youre in the minority in this comment section which i would hope would cause you to reassess your thought process but anyway we just disagreen__label__2 tbh whats the difference between him asking her and looking it up with that logic it seems like this became a deal breaker instead of a mistake because of an insecurity around meds and you cant put that all on op he messed up but if youve got bpd then youve got to try to be responsible for your emotions when you split and try to understand why you dont want your partner to know about your medication it doesnt call for warn__label__0 agreed ha peer pressure doesnt work on me and its a minority that im proud to be in that we don__label__0 again you are assuming that she split not all anger is splitting whats funny to me is at least op knows he fucked up by snooping thru her trash his mistake was asking about her reaction to this breach of trust in the context of bpd yall commenters are the only ones trying to say he didnt make a mistaken__label__0 whats funny to you i said that he made a mistake and that he messed up a couple of times i think youre in denial of how bpd works and its clouding your judgementn__label__0 good baitingn__label__0 youre gaslighting people who try to reason with you on a bpd subreddit youve baited me and probably so many others with your lack of control good luck with thatn__label__0 ty i really wna cut cold turkey but i know thats bad and can cause me more harm but i want it too is that weirdn__label__1 you gotta get off it or at least take less working on the issues its masking is important you dont wanna put them off this is coming from someone who was unknowingly stuffing a lot of my issues down with adhd medication i wish i had known what i was doing and gotten off it sooner talk to your doctor i hope your able to find a solution that works for youn__label__0 you can try to substitute it with supplements magnesium is a good one particularly magnesium l theonate its very relaxingn__label__0 haha yeahi am def masking with it i used it for wrong reasons at first now im on so much i cant function im scared what ill feel like getting off of it but i need too thats for reminding me i am indeed maskingn__label__1 i am also in medicated for adhd the side effects were bad for men__label__0 ooo ill try thatn__label__1 you can do this and theres nothing to be ashamed of where ever your at when you get off the medication is where your at and thats okay you should be proud to take the step bc honestly if you feel the need to take that much of something in order to not feel theres something really difficult you might be suppressing and its understandable anyway im projecting but just dont be too hard on yourselfn__label__0 oh im a guy if that helps the questionn__label__2 although they were developed to treat psychosis antipsychotics are currently used to treat symptoms that are part of other disorders such as anxiety in this case antipsychotics can help regulate sleep and reduce agitation and the speed of thought for example hope this helpsn__label__1 antipsychotics made a huge difference in my mental health give it a shotn__label__0 avoid ability like the plague you think your brain is fucked up now just you waitn__label__0 i was given this do and was thinking the same thing that aint me trust the process and your dr its worked brilliantly for me fuck the label and just give it a shotn__label__2 i take abilify for both my mdd and bpd many people take it solely for mdd it can do more than just treat symptoms of psychosis which many people with bpd dont have on a regular basis but it can prevent them from occurringn__label__0 i love itn__label__0 why what do you mean it seems to work for me so im curious what to look out forn__label__0 uncontrollable muscle movements nerve damage decreased white blood cell count type diabetes high cholesterol numbers increased impulsive behaviorsn__label__4 thats because its a quinolone derivative if you have had any adverse affects to your nervous system eg the muscle spasms please do your best to try and avoid any fluoroquinolone antibiotics because those have a pretty high likelihood of causing you longtermpermanent damage even if you stop the drug as far as antipsychotics go though abilify doesnt affect beta cell function as badly as something like seroquel so considering the positive effect that antipsychotics have been anecdotally shown to have on bpd symptoms id consider abilify to be a pretty lowrisk drug in comparison and thus worth a try at the very leastn__label__0 youre having a really strong dissociative reaction it may not be super common but your mind has chosen to turn off your emotional side because you were in such an extreme situation it happens and its an appropriate reaction even for people without disorders that come hand in hand with dissociative tendencies it happened so that you could act fast and smart you did and it saved your sister you may start feeling much later its okay to give yourself time to return to normal this numbness doesnt mean you arent caring and empathetic its nothing but a stress response wishing all the best to you and your sistern__label__0 actually i think your reaction is typical with cluster b which is actually a brilliant thing you dealt with a chaotic situation with calm and saved your sisters life amazing i remember reading somewhere about this i just cant think of where right now if i find it ill link you sorry to hear about your sister and agree with other commenters youll need self care as emotions may bubble up soon big hugn__label__0 state of critical stress with controlled fight or flight response where the body disregards emotions for survival of self or others safetyits similar to what soldiers experiencen__label__0 why did she get discharged right after attempting she should be in the psych ward hopefully getting some helpn__label__0 nothing is wrong with you this is a survival mechanism and a very human reaction especially when youre the one who had to take action your brain took emotions off the table so you could do what you needed to be done the fact that youre worried that youre not emotional tells me you do really care about your sister and youre cognitively sad and worried about her even though your feelings dont reflect itn__label__0 action matter not emotion you did wellnow try to be conforting to her that is to be a good personfeelings are only drivers for our action if you are capable of the same or better action without them thats perfectn__label__0 you had a very normal reaction as others have said youre disassociating even a otherwise mentally healthy individual can react that way take care of yourself because it will hit you eventually lots of love and good vibes for you and your sistern__label__0 i think your reaction is completely normal my sister attempted suicide also and everything slowed down for me and i went about it very calmly with zero emotions it didnt mean that i didnt love her or care for her i think this is one of the rare good things about bpd our ability to dissociate in extreme stress it has saved our sisters livesn__label__0 this is pretty much what i was thinking though you articulated it better however you might feel better about it all or you might get slammed with all the negative emotions you thought you would feel just be careful ive been though something similar beforen__label__0 thank youn__label__0 yes thisn__label__0 thank youn__label__0 actually i think its not just typical for cluster bs i think its a common reaction ask your parents how they feel i guess they are worried but dont feel muchn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 not every place has a good hospital psych ward is a far cry will try to consult a psychiatrist online todayn__label__0 thank youn__label__0 i feel you if my colleagues pass any commentmay not even be intended towards me i have panic attacks cant breathe cant eat for days and when something real happens i am like a machine no feelings i know if the situation was reversed my sister would have known exactly what to say or how to support me emotionally but i just stare at her now either with no emotions or with angern__label__0 im straight ass sober too occasionally ill eat a little nibble of an edible to help me stay awake but thats like once a month im able to regulate better and more often if im not chemically altering my brain otherwise i do not want to depend on any sort of substance either but that is more due to a persistent what if the world ends paranoid ideation that ive had for like at least years nown__label__0 duloxetine has helped me a lotn__label__0 helps me a lot tames or rather numbs my reactionsn__label__0 i started this a few months back and out of all of the things that i have ever taken this has helped me the most i have even had days where i thought maybe i felt some happiness after years of years of not really feeling any true smile bringing happiness try and be consistent with it each day i missed it here and there and got inconsistent with the times of the day i would take it and i felt some of the old issues that i was going away from return until i got back on trackif i take it too late in the day it also messes up my sleep hopefully it works out well for youn__label__0 you can have any profession you like as long as youre medium to high functioning bpd low functioning has a harder time keeping employment but its still possiblen__label__4 i was planning to be a veterinarian from the ages of through or so i was too depressed and messed up in college to keep my grades up and i kind of gave up on the dream of ever getting into vet schoolso my advice if thats really what you want to do is to stay in therapy stay on whatever medication you find that works for you learn and practice some dbt dialectical behavior therapy skills and obviously study hard an official diagnosis shouldnt affect you either way as its not something you need to disclose if you dont want tomy one concern is that veterinarians actually have a high suicide rate here is a recent article just the first one i found on google but its something i think about a lot i point this out not to discourage you but to impress on you how important it is to remain in treatment and to be open and honest with your providersn__label__0 thank you for the response if im being honest i might become some type of vet specialist i think that would work best for me mentally wise i was thinking of like radiology or something like thatn__label__0 hey op unfortunately i cant help you with your question but maybe if you add your country it can be easier for people to offer insights since the healthlegal system works differently in each placen__label__0 great suggestion i added itn__label__0 this post has been marked as a venting post please be aware that the op may not be

they did so why would i do it to myselfn__label__0 i barely do sometimes its worth itn__label__0 whatever you want from others find a way to give it to yourself meditation is necessary to listen accurately to your own needs journaling is necessary to remember all of your neglected needs and address them imagine a kingdom of angry neglected people how crazy the kings complaining court would be person after person screaming the same things countless complaints they keep coming back because nothings done ever thats your minds state manage your needs listen and remember forget everyone else they dont hold any solution its why youre getting nowhereas you become fulfilled youll begin to display a magnetic confidence youll no longer need others theyll be drawn to you stop believing this is who you are because its not change starts in the mindn__label__0 barely i try to stay sober but it doesnt last long but sh always helps i currently have no one they always leave yet i keep putting myself through this cycle im so patheticn__label__0 this is how i am working on breaking my cycle sobriety holy fucking shit it works i am a man though so substance abuse is a big one for our gender im not perfect yet but every time i go longer without drinking the better my life gets also exercise does wonders for mood regulation you dont have to do the most but even a minute walk out in the sun

to know that youre valuable human being and word is a better place thanks to your existencei also have problem with making and mantaining friendships ive been lucky with my bf the reason for me and maybe for you too is that i dont feel like i am good enough so i feel like i dont deserve to be loved or have friends thus i push people away and when they leave it just strenghten these feelings i am not sure i have any advice other then trying to find value in yourself i am working on that one but its a long way and i am still at the begining wish you the bestn__label__0 i havent had a friend in like years so idk but youre not deplorable friendship is hardn__label__0 it actually sucks so bad but i just try to enjoy my life and the world instead of people when i do get close to someone though

away from family and i didnt get involved with anyone romantically i developed routines and did things i enjoyed alone i hiked a lot and spent time mostly with my dog then when i got back with my ex i maintained those routines hes really stable emotionally and in life in general and is understanding of my bpd so he knows my routines are important and he helps as best as he cann__label__0 introspection goes a long way i have accepted that i will constantly question myself whether i want to or not ill constantly question the people in my life whether i want to or not oh and i have worn the grippy socks i have had many conversations with people about my feelings i have acknowledged the intrusiveness of all my thoughts outloud and with other people i have found a solid base of friends who understand and accept me my girlfriend is a rock i never thought id find my best friend and i were diagnosed with bpd in the same yearall of this support and i still struggle resent myself resent those around me for not feeling what i have to feel fear failure and constantly step on my own toes introspection is the only way i was able to move on with this i needed to create a dialog with myself because i am my own biggest supporter and my biggest detractorn__label__0 i wish i could but life clings to me each time i do i survive however the physical injuries just get worse so i havent tried again my advice dont worry about people just look after yourself and keep a job and a roof over your head im homeless and its so bloody hard i made the mistake of telling support services that im bpd and the stigma from that was enough to be labelled high risk and banned i have no hope but i stay alive for my little girl i hold my life in contempt but my lil princess doesnt deserve to go through that trauman__label__0 no friendsn__label__0 numbing myself with weed and medicinen__label__0 trying to get into contact with people ive pushed away but havent pushed too hard or responding to people who contact me that ive pushed away is what i don__label__1 dbt honestly its out here saving lives i hope youre able to heal sometimen__label__0 i have no idean__label__2 drugsn__label__0

still feel terrible i walk daily and i try and i go to therapy but nothing worksn__label__0 i dont honestly know if i can say it helps but a lot of weed and a couple beers every night seems to help me get to the next dayn__label__0 its really going to depend on your history with addiction age and resources id say if you can control your usage cannabisn__label__0 i used to cry over the fact of being born and growing up because i thought i wouldnt live this long and always had the mindset that i would end my life that in itself annoys me because i dont know what will happen after i die if you ever believed in religion that means there is a chance there is something after death that used to annoy me too because i didnt want to exist not deal with whatever was next not even heavenafter losing people now i dont feel suicidal because i decided to live i deserve to live forget all the expectations i had for myself or my family had for me fuck it and fuck them i will be selfish and live my life as i want i try to enjoy every little thing if i had died they would have moved on so quickly anyway suicide is one thing you cant regretn__label__0 well first of all good on you for all of that you are ahead of the curve on recovery by doing that alone do not stop those habits ever or things will get worse i dont have specific advice at this point but good on you doing all that in spite of life being hardn__label__0 i have drank booze for the past or days out of i dont even remember at this pointn__label__0 yo im doing the exact same i got an rx for lyrica so a few of those and i forget where i amn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 felt this so hard i thought that way for the longest and ha a sort of crisis when i made it to i never thought id make it to but now i just live for what i want so everything doesnt feel too badn__label__0 a dee da real helpfuln__label__0 omg the downward spiral of bad choices that i have made in the past week alone lol i think i was drunk for five days straight im starting to get flashbacks of some of the stuff ive done omg its like i turned into a wear wolf for a week and am just now coming back into human formn__label__0 sober is a huge help i used to drink excessive amounts and crash every week after a huge scary meltdown i quit for one year i drunk nothing now i am strong enough to control it tightly no alcohol in the house and i only drink socially i have strict control only three pints of beer no strong stuff never spiritshavent been drunk in nearly three years and are now able to have some control im a far better person and i enjoy life far moreive also achieved far more in the last two years then i had in the previous tenn__label__0 hope youre doing alright lovelyn__label__4 what medications are you on pretty much every antidepressant that i have tried has caused bad night sweats among other side effectsn__label__1 yeah its the antidepressants ive read something about serotonin syndrome and it could be that as many antidepressants work on altering serotonin levels ive found over time it does get better but make sure you change your sheets regularly and be sure to wash your back when you shower ive been getting awful backne since starting ssrisn__label__5 yes finding a good therapist can be a pain so can finding the right combination of medications id find a new therapist if this one isnt helping but dont cold quit your medication some of them have horrible withdrawals and can be dangerous to your mental statei know it can feel frustrating and you might feel like throwing in the towel but i encourage you to stick in there if you can find a good dbt therapist who works closely with the psychiatrist on your meds it will help its worth it if it helps here are some links my therapist shared advocate for yourself youre worth itdbtcognitive distortionsn__label__1 i feel exactly what you mean i recently started going back to therapy since i stopped in like its definitely an interesting a cycle of neverending nothingness i want to feel normal but i dont even know what normal feels like anymore tbh i just sabotage everything for myself as soon as something is good im not even sure my therapist enjoys talking to me but its been an interesting journey forsuren__label__2 three years sounds like a long time to be going through therapy especially if you dont feel like youre seeing any positive results if you wouldnt mind sharing what sort of therapy are you undergoingid agree with nicemouse that seeking a new therapistform of therapy might be a good ideadbt worked for me but there are a lot of other options out there like schema therapy and mentalizationbased therapy which might work better for you if youve already tried dbtn__label__1 thank you so much here in my place all these therapists are money lootersn__label__1 thanks for the reply its just normal therapy i think my therapist talk to me and give some tools to regulate my mood swings sometimes they work sometimes they wont and im looking for some other good therapist in my area because its all me who worked on myself but i find it quite relaxing that because i dont share any of my problems with my family or friends but its nice to have someone to listen to you even if you pay thenn__label__3 i had all kinds of horrible side effects when i was on paroxetine fatigue brain fog etc followed by nightmarish withdrawals after i went off it its an awful drug and i cant believe doctors still prescribe itn__label__4 what medication did they put you on they could up your dosage or do a different one different people have different medications that work for them at the beginning of my journey i was diagnosed a medication that turned me into a zombie and stripped me of my entire personality but that same medication worked wonders for others please dont give up treatment because when i found out what worked for me it changed my entire life for the bettern__label__1 lamotriginen__label__0 they give me divalproex sodium and i dont feel anything nothing change i already told my psychiatrist its not working but she said we should focus on fixing my sleep problem firstn__label__0 no they give me divalproex sodiumn__label__0 im in school to be a psychiatric nurse and currently work as a psych tech i would recommend this career path if you have an interest in helping people out directly im diagnosed with both bipolar and bpd and have experienced what its like to be the one in a hospital bed its really powerful finally feeling like im able to give back and be like one of the nurses i had help me when i most needed it and surprisingly i find that working with patients benefits my own mental health too by allowing me to have time to put all my thoughts aside and completely focus on helping others it grants perspective gives me confidence and makes me feel useful love it love it love itn__label__0 i study animal biology and some environmental sciences ive done about a year so far currently struggling with depression so im not studying atm the thing that eventually led me to biology etc is my love for nature and animals so i guess i simply chose what my heart told me i think the biggest fear i have is what i will be able to accomplish for work in the future i also suffer from a chronic illness that affects the body so even if i would prefer to be working outside i think i also need the option to work from home at times too i think a career where i can be flexible is the best preferably work in a group of smaller people would love to be a part of a science team or something i like the idea of contributing to good causes and knowing that youre needed most times its the only thing that keeps me going despite all the strugglesi think you should go with what you feel most passionate about i also considered other options at first like veterinary sciences but i suck at math so that was no longer an option but i am very good at other things and i try to use those things to my advantagen__label__0 wow what an example thank you very much for the encouragementn__label__0 i feel like if youre not a fan of being around people but still want to be of service and help people indirectly and the environment anything dealing with animal welfare or environmental science would be great i actually want to be a vet tech because i enjoy being around animals and i also like to help and teach people about animal caren__label__1 theres ways to look at thatglass half empty your bpd goes unchecked your bpd seems to worsen over the years the panic about being alone will strengthen over time as you destroy more and more relationships it becomes a vicious cycle you feel you are running out of time but more aware you are being that selfdestructive yourself each time rebounding is harder and harder because you have drained your resources monetary people other physical and mental things to climb out of the last hole you can hit rock bottom and create new depths you didnt believe possible eventually one of those might lead you to glass half full if you do the the psychotherapy work and stay committed personality disorders can change now whether you make this commitment and more importantly can follow through before the beforementioned socioeconomic impacts is going to help it is a personality disorder personalities can change it is harder being older and more stubborn but glass half full version has to see that some people grow up shy and then learn to become public stars and great public speakers but it does take a commitment to yourself and if you have bpd its going to have to start where you believe in the second half of this not the first even if the first part already happened to you this second half can still happenn__label__0 sorta not something that improves rapidly its kinda like do people become more wise as they age generally the answer is yes but watching a tree grow can try just about anyones patience as someone else said if its not getting worse its getting bettern__label__5 im some aspects got better i got less impulsivity the more i get to know my disorder the more i accept myself now ive understood why i feel differently thanothers i worked on self esteem and self love thru therapy and theres a massive progress compared to when i was on the other hand as i get older some aspects got worse i feel more lonely some symptoms are not improving at all which can lead to helplessness sometimes i feel doomed and my episodes are stronger more intense rage and anger is less frequent but deeper theres definitely the weight of trying to get better without success the accumulation and frustration also i unlocked a new fear now never be able to achieve a good life dying alone and sad seing others living happily and me struggling with basic stuffthe fomo is real too as a female my biological clock started ticking but i cant see myself taking a decision about itwhen i think about the last decade i get bitter i feel like ive been robbed of my youthimportant information tho where i live dbt is not available medication protocole for bpd is ssri and lithium most of the therapist are practicing psychoanalysis as a form of treatment so i do not have access to the best type of treatment for bpd which can explain why i struggle so muchn__label__0 managing bpd requires skills and when we work on those skills they get better over time like any skilln__label__0 if it doesnt get worse your skills are working it might not get better right away but if it doesnt get worse then youre doing something and something is better than nothingn__label__0 i was diagnosed with bpd two years ago i was heavily medicated for half a year following that then switched to a significantly lower dose i have not shows bpdspecific symptoms for over a yearn__label__0 helloone of the things that i feel the most is that im very much affected by who and what sorrounds me so for me something that works very well is to follow my gut when i feel discomfort around certain people situations and just walk away i tend to feel like im the wrong one so having learnt to walk away till im around people that i thrive with for me has been a major takeaway i feel like i can be myself and i feel good since im sync with my soul and i dont feel like other people threaten me trying to make me something im noti feel like since we are majorly more sensitive its really really important for us to create the right dynamics around us cuz we are not good at not being influenced by other people and situationsto answer you question yes it gets much better with age if you learn to make the right choices for yourself and listen to yourself without forcing yourself to be someone you are not out of fear of being lonelyn__label__1 i am i have self reflected and learned a lot from my past experiences my impulsivity has gotten better i also have healthier boundaries and coping mechanisms i also recognise my triggers better got diagnosed officially last week and since then i am very committed to understanding why i am going through this and getting better while accepting myself my therapist told me people often do things they regret but that doesnt define them it is just a part of me and i have lots of wonderful qualities romantic relationships are my biggest weakness so i think i will take things slow instead of jumping into itn__label__1 i am struggling to improve my bpd i watched a documentary that really helped i am almost f and never had any counseling or anything until now i just accepted that i was crazy and learned to live with it the older i got the more issues i started to have especially after starting therapy maybe it was just talking about past tramas that made it career its ugly head in a very bad way i am currently engaged and its very close to our wedding and i started having a bpd episode that was really bad i was kind of pushing him away and it almost cost me my relationship luckily i have a wonderful man who is very patient and understands my mental disorder he showed me a documentary that really kind of changed a lot for me they were talking about something called dbt its a form of therapy that can help you control your bpd so when youre having a borderline moment it teaches you to handle that in a positive way and turn it around i am not in dbt therapy although ive been reading a lot about it and over the past few weeks just having the understanding and knowledge of my mental illness has allowed me to grow and to learn how to control a lot of those moments where i feel like im going out of control maybe look into dbt and it will helpn__label__5 untreated bpd will likely worsen over the years but as a personality disorder it is absolutely possible to improve with putting in worki cant speak for everyone and i am fortunate to have had a very good doctor and psych support but with dbt emdr medications and dedication im probably in the best state ive been in my life im not perfect and still have good days and bad days but compared to the state i was in years ago being diagnosed i am definitely better than i wasn__label__0 yes it does but i didnt feel a difference until my s so enjoy the ride for a decade more or son__label__0 if you learn to work on it and manage it it does get better i learned to identify when i was doingfeeling certain things and i could address it and stop it that took a long time to learn but made it way bettern__label__1 im and it took me losing someone i truly loved and cared about to take time to self reflect im also going to dbt therapy and single therapy which helps so much radical acceptance is a skill i just learned and so far thats been the hardest one to deal with i denied reality and minimized things my whole lifen__label__0 i disagree that is gets better with age i think we all know people who display the same symptoms we have in their s s s etc the only difference is the hurt they cause is less because the people who they hurt leave it gets better with time only if you are trying to prevent symptoms its not a sprint its a marathon because you have to do this for the rest of your life eventually this gets easier and you form new neuropathways but if you dont this will only get worse unless you entirely alone and thats not good eithern__label__0 i have always thought that those stats are because some lucky people end up having indeed a stable romantic relationship with someone who loves them so they stop having the horrible symptoms fear of abandonment impulsivity etc i was instinctly sure that that was the deal what do you thinkn__label__1 yes i dont even fit the criteria anymore but it took lots of therapy meds and timen__label__1 i personally think remission as a concept is total bs you just learn how to mask your symptoms better as you age lolmy psychiatrist and doctor even said dbt would never work for someone like men__label__1 i was able to quitpause therapy after years i am still on medication over years now and seeing a psychiatrist once or twice a year for said medication but it has gotten so much better for men__label__0 im and i feel i have improved failure still suck but it gets easier with age hell im going through a divorce currently and havent had too much of a problem with it some days the emotions are loud and i have a breakdown live for the good days and make the best out of everythingn__label__4 im in the same boat also and just cant seem to get my life together its in constant up and downs currently in the process of being evicted not because i cant actually afford my place but because im so reckless with my money drinking thankfully has gotten better but i am feeling super depressed and irritable since i have cut back i started taking lamotrigine this week recently got off prozac remeron seroquel and a few other meds nothing seems to really be helping and im just at my whits end i cant take much moren__label__0 im i feel less affected by peers life which felt like social pressure in s i felt like people were leaving me behind especially so when i saw they were seemingly having goals careers and having fun on free time while i withdrew all classes from a semester having to go have interview with deen and councelor to reregister then ended up not finishing my school semester away from being done i went back and finished it few years later no good career prospect etcaround those start not bother me since i started to surround people that who were still there when i withdrew for a year peoples life became more varied and that understanding helped me too my wicked life didnt seem so wicked anymorealso energy level is lower i dont seem to have active cinder cone volcano instead its like a shield volcano just oozing out lava on and offn__label__5 my therapist uses ptsd and depression questionnaires to monitor my bpd i have lost a total of points in a year that doesnt sound like much but im slowly improving the goal is to not meet the criteria its just slow work and its hard work if you apply yourself to learning about bpd and common treatments like dbt and cbt you can qualify as being in remission or recovery check out emotionsmatter website for resources and bpd brunch on youtube to see how other real people manage their bpdn__label__0 and has gotten better in someway and worse than others i think transitioning hasnt helped thobeing close to being sober fully again for the first time in like years tho which has made a lot easiern__label__0 im crazy nowbut i used to be craziern__label__0 its got far worse for me over the past years vut then again i have a shit support and shit people around me i can cannot get away fromn__label__0 i would say it mostly depends on how you are going to live your life bpd has a strong developmental component with either forming strong neural connections due to traumatic experiences or not forming the proper ones brain is very plastic when young so these connections are strong but over time you can form new ones that take precedence making your bpd better it requires effort and patience to learn the proper patterns of being but it is very possible something like learning to swim as a adult is harder than as a child but still possible you say that your feels the same way which is good because it didnt get worse but for it to get better you should try to go beyond just managing symptoms is still young you have a potentially great future ahead of youn__label__0 and i feel worse than ever beforen__label__0 im its getting worsen__label__0 thank you for your wonderful comment at least now i can think about it and look in my journal to see how i can work on it even moren__label__0 i understand how you feel i came to the point where i isolated myself from people i guess my philosophy is im not going to ruin their lives anymore this is going to be a sensitive question and you dont have to answer it for medo you also have the urge to selfharm as an adult ive been clean for a long time but sometimes when i cant identify my feelings or i feel at a loss i think that if i hurt myself i might at least feel something feelings might be released how stupid rightn__label__0 this you get better at managing itn__label__2 oh i see i have been treated with medicines for about years i feel like certain phases are worse i will discuss this with my therapist thank un__label__0 and what medicine do you taken__label__0 this is very good to read i only realized this this year at first i felt like a monster with these thoughts and i was thinking if i leave people will they hate me but we just cant force ourselves to do something that makes us worse right i am so thankful for this subreddit and all such great people now i dont feel like im alone in everythingn__label__0 thats great i hope to get to that point so far im still struggling with the episodes the last days are very tiring and i have isolated myself from people because their presence made me very nervous i like them and it annoys me that my mental health wont allow me to see them more but i cant sometimes i feel physically sick at the thought of being in the company of people i dont know if its similar for you but hyperfixations generally help me if i fixate on something it takes at least a month its quite calmingn__label__0 thats great i wish you only brighter daysn__label__0 sorry to hear that i had to gradually create strong barriers otherwise those toxic people would destroy men__label__0 try reading the comments on this post they are very positive for me fixating on something hobbies etc helps me the most you can try it too i hope you feel better soonn__label__0 you cant let it take your hope glad you doing your journal group or something similar such as here is important as well why its the last step in every recovery program and a central piece any newcomer to a recovery program will apologize tell everyone theyve probably heard the same stories over and over again the old timers in the recovery program will respond back thank you for sharing the reason they thank them and give back within their own program is because the group aspect is the most selfish step of them allyou see in others while they are at their worst where you once were and even if you are only a step above them in your own efforts you see where you dont want to be again and realize there is hope not to be at the bottom again where you dont believe in hope that keeps you goingn__label__0 ive been clean for a year and a half now but i still got the urge to do it every now and thenweirdly i didnt sh when i was younger it started around my mid syes i relate it happens when i feel overload with emotions i get a feeling that nothing matters and hurting myself seems like a logical solutionn__label__3 my initial dosage right after the diagnosis was mg quetiapine mg venlafaxine and mg of mirtazapine my dosage was adjusted when i was prescribed new medication so by now its mg if quetiapine mg of ritalin and mg of trazodonen__label__0 yes its lovely that we can connect so deeply even if we never metand yes i feel like there is no point in forcing human relationship its only a way to get further away from our true self and the people that are meant for us today i was reading a piece of journal i wrote two years ago and it said something that i really like im starting to get to know myself instead of deciding who i need to be it was truly the beginning of the healing phase i guess ahahahhan__label__1 yeah happens to me sometimes but i kind of shock my body out of it my therapist recommended accepts i was dating someone with an avoidant attachment and he showed abusive tendencies which made me split but i cut him off so recognising your triggers can help navigate life better its not going be fine and its alright if you feel nervous to meet people i have good friends who are aware of my condition try journaling as well i use voice memos because i can hear my intrusive thoughts and try to make sense whether they are rational or not get as much help as you can we are all in this togethern__label__0 thank you xn__label__1 do you also have adhd i just started concerta mg for adhd and my psych suggested eftil sodium valproate for managing emotions since desenda desvenlafaxine made me way too numbn__label__0 journaling is a really great way to get to know yourself when i read my pages in the diary i feel as if i am reading someone elses diary hahan__label__0 pro tip for latuda if your insurance doesnt cover it you can get code from their website that will cover the restn__label__2 i dont seem to get any side effects from buspirone have you tried that yetn__label__0 depends on the person i dont know if qualifications has a huge impact on their ability to be empathetic and understanding of our problems more up to who they are vs titlen__label__3 both my psychiatrist and psych np have been awesome my psych was the one who recognized that i had bpd after months of trying treatments that didnt work and always treated me with respect and care despite the numerous suicide attempts my psych np is just as caring and knowledgeable and i actually like seeing her more because of her experiences as a nurse im a nurse she always encourages me to talk about whatever i need to talk about and provides great psychotherapy but there are good and bad providers regardless of education level so you have to find one that works for youn__label__1 update i met with the nurse practitioner yesterday and they didnt seem judgmental at all of my bpd history and seemed to understand what it meant beyond just the stigma they also werent insistent on adding more medssince i told them my current med dosage is working well for me i think im going to continue seeing them thanks yall you helped soothe some of my anxieties before the meetingn__label__0 so i guess they can be a total hitormiss regardless of title yay loln__label__0 why do you have bothn__label__0 im so glad to hear that your two providers have been so supportive and caring thats awesomen__label__0 from what ive seen familiarity with bpd is all over the place even with mental health professionals some get it and some just dontn__label__0 what a shame i hope one day medical schools and other professional degree programs start teaching bpd with better caremore compassionmore accuracyn__label__0 i think people say they arent manipulative because bpd being inherently manipulative is part of the stigma they may be the ones that dont manipulate and thats great but i think their vocalness of it can backfire on the people who do theyre clearly trying to distance themselves from the ones who do almost makes it sound like those who do dont deserve help are actually the evil ones or not actually bpd i think very few people manipulate because theyre bad people we think of manipulation as this deeply calculated thing made from a person who is fully able to grasp the impact and other options they have in my experience its a lot more complicated than that bpd is also in the same cluster as npd and aspd it is not uncommon for their symptoms to overlap i get why people want to distance themselves from it but i think its important to remind those who do that stuff to not shy away from sharing their struggles its extremely difficult to still talk about it when you know a harsh reaction from someone who does not want to understand can be waiting around the cornern__label__1 youre definitely not alone i was in denial about it for a long time my biggest manipulation tactic is playing the victim because of my fear of abandonment i dont have an official diagnosis but ive been through talk therapy although i only got so much out of that since my therapist wasnt a great fit i was able to start recognizing when i was trying to be manipulative and sometimes put a stop to it not being in therapy right now though i can feel myself backsliding even with my coping strategiesn__label__1 i think every human being bpd or not has manipulative tendencies it depends on how much you try to check them you starting therapy means you want to be better and you acknowledge that manipulating people isnt a healthy coping mechanism i have been working on being less manipulative part of it is learning that it comes from me never feeling in control of my life especially in childhood my therapist has said before you want to be kind thats a self awareness that most adult people do not have bpd or not and shes rightn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 im very manipulative it destroyed my relationship i would purposely do things that would make him think he was losing me i would put him through hell i broke up with him multiple times knowing very well i didnt actually want to end things with him just so he would come crawling back begging for me in the end it became too much for him and he left me he wanted to go no contact after the break up and i would harass and manipulate him into talking to me it really makes me feel like a terrible personn__label__0 some people arent strong enough or ready enough to admit it and some arent aware of it its a common part of the condition however it doesnt make you a bad person its caused through the condition it can be worked on and the feelings of the fp etc need to be rememberedn__label__0 the manipulativeness is usually a holdover from when you might have had to regularly manipulate a situation to get your basic needs met old habits die hardn__label__1 i certainly was ive gotten bettermy therapist described manipulation as simply a method of trying to get a need met eg if i needed company i would guilt someone into spending time with mei think with bpd the manipulation is a byproduct of having more intense emotional needs than the average person so the trick is not to simply stop manipulating but to figure out what need is not being met and how you can meet it yourself where possible or how to get it met externally without crossing that linen__label__0 i think a lot of us literally dont even realize were doing it ive been at a real low point lately a sort of rock bottom of sorts ive only now started to notice myself doing it catching myself telling someone a piece of information or encouraging them in a certain way or changing my personality and my thoughtsmorals in a way to fit theirs all so that i can get something from them usually just attention usually its just im really lonely and i like the persons company and want to keep spending time with them i doubt any of them even know i do it i didnt even know but one day it clicked i was like wait a second this person really likes me and likes hanging out with me too but this isnt me im manufacturing and making up a person and saying and doing things to manipulate them into liking me or thinkingdoing what i want them to idk what to do about it i catch myself doing it a lot lately i really want to like not interact with anyone for awhile or just shut the fuck up so i can reassess how i interact with people but a public facing job makes being antisocial very challengingn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 yeah i dont like it sometimes i catch myself being manipulative and i can feel a part me saying come on man what are you doing but then its almost like i just dont care but i want to care but i cant care so i just kind of do it but feel like crap afterwards for manipulating someone i love i need help i get upset or my mind says i dont love someone if its not my way i hate that shit i want to unconditionally but its so hardn__label__0 i think manipulation can be a bpd symptom particularly when it comes to feeling abandoned however the issue is that many people including clinicians then assume that every single thing that someone with bpd says or does is a lie or attempt at manipulation when i feel like in the vast majority of cases someone with bpd and without another cluster b disorder will generally only manipulate to avoid abandonmentn__label__0 i can be tbf i dont even realize im doing it and most of the time its not in service to being maliciousn__label__0 i never realised i was manipulative until my diagnosis it opened my eyes up to why i was the way i was i used to manipulate my friend into making me theyre best friend so they could have other friends i know its bad and i feel bad but i am trying to take responsibilityn__label__0 i thinks its to outside people who dont have bpd what we do is seen as manipulative but to us were desperately trying to hold on to the thing we love the most by any means and sometimes and to other people those means are extreme and petty and manipulativeedit i know some of what i do is manipulative but im trying to hold on and the alternative is a worse option so i hurt everyone some to not absolutely traumatize them forevern__label__0 youre not alone sometimes i feel like im the walking embodiment of all the negative comments about bpd i dont have advice but youre not alonen__label__0 i think it boils down to intent do you manipulate people in order to hurt them i think thats what other people think about pwbpd but i dont think we do it to cause harm or even intend to do it in the first placen__label__0 i wouldnt say that im manipulative but in the times that i feel hurt or wronged i can definitely become toxic therapy helps though as stupid as it sounds mindfulness exercises help me calm myself down before i act on anything sometimesn__label__0 does anyone have examples they can share of the times when they catch themselves being manipulative i think i am at times but i dont really know i wonder if i might recognize my own actions thru somebody elses self awarenessn__label__0 half this sub is selfdiagnosed and im being generous dont let this subreddit define how you feel about your conditionn__label__0 youre definitely not alone babe i am so manipulative and i cant deny itn__label__0 yes im very manipulativen__label__0 yeah its starting to become apparent to me all the ways ive manipulated i can say i did it because i literally knew no other way of getting my needs met but it doesnt make it okay i wasnt conscious of what i was doing and it took an improved level of self esteem and healing just to begin to admit to myself that i hadnt always been genuine in my relationships and my dealings with people i felt a lot of shame at first but actually dont hold too much judgement towards myself about it because i just literally didnt know that people on the whole are kind caring and willing to meet your needs if you ask reasonably and share with them whats going on how would you ever know that if you grew up in an abusive environment so yeahn__label__0 yeah im very manipulative not by nature only when im in depressive statesn__label__0 i also thought i was alone with this particular symptom but looks like im not one positive that you can take from this is that you are able to recognise this and you want to better yourself because of it this to me shows you have a high level of emotional intelligence and empathy hang in there you got thisn__label__0 i used to manipulate people a lot more than now ive worked on myself counsellingtherapy self help self awareness cos i didnt want to be that person but sometimes it peeks out even just playing victim can be so easy problem is then i go too far the other way and my doctor scolds me when i didnt think something was worth bothering them case in point after weeks tonight went to doctor and diagnoses of bad bronchitis secondary infection and etc need big antibsi think there is a definite correlation between bpd manipulation and cptsd developed manipulation for survival its a traumasurvival traitn__label__0 i def can be i have gotten better at being self aware of when im doing it and consciously stopping it unless i really want somethingn__label__0 removedn__label__0 removedn__label__0 everybody isnmanipulative thats just human natureme specifically though im quite manipulative so i like to discuss boundaries around it within close relationships and it works out quite welln__label__0 used to be manipulative ruined many relationships didnt mean to be but sometimes intent doesnt matter what matters is how you made the others in your life feel realized i needed to change because no one deserves to be emotionally abused at the hands of my inability to regulate my emotionsn__label__0 removedn__label__0 removedn__label__0 i used to be with my ex he was narcissistic aspd but i knew exactly how to handle him until i miscalculated once and he attacked me he did want to stay though he cried when i broke up with himi liked our mind games it was exciting and we clicked so deeply ive never felt that way about anyone and never will again but i had to walk away though it wasnt the right choice for me personallyn__label__0 can i ask everyone what manipulation looks like i dont feel like even when triggered i ever actively think im going to do x so this person does y which is what i understand manipulation to mean however i do have extreme and frequent emotional reactions which for me is where i assumed the manipulative descriptor came from i thought that outside parties would assume that such extreme responses so frequently couldnt be real and must be fore show in order to achieve a goal this is why i thought there was a disconnect between the reputation and the experience a lot of people responding are identifying with manipulation but without examples i cant think of times i have consciously acted a certain way to get others to respond in a way i wanted them to i really want to be able to identify when i do and what it looks like and whether my behaviors are subconsciously manipulative in some way that i can identify and checkn__label__1 a lot of people do deny it but a lot also dont realize its manipulation before i got proper help and a diagnosis i didnt even realize half of the things i did was manipulative i thought it was normal cause to me it was normal my family also normalized manipulation and abuse it took me talking to a therapist and having them point it out for me to realize what i was doingn__label__0 yes the deep deep rooted fear of abandonment plays so much into my tendencies to manipulate i really try not to do it but i feel like my main tactic is just being super emotional which i am anyway but it hurts the people i care about when i say things that make them worried about me or express such strong emotions that they cant handlen__label__1 i been feeling like my fp will leave me soon and one of the urge i have to fight is not to do whats your saying my therapist is the same way with not being qualified to diagnose but she will point out how it would be manipulation if i told my fp my grandad is sick back in the hospital depending why i was telling her i told other people to fill them in or to get their support but specifically with my fp i can feel its like you can leave just feel bad for me if you do which is terriblewe should never normalize manipulation but sometimes i think how bad the stigma is its just hard to admit to it without instantly thinking you are a bad personn__label__0 yes to everything you said even today years after being diagnosed and years of therapy and rehab and aana i catch myself relapsing into manipulating my partner when i start losing control of the situation i guess at least i am seeing it earlier and earlier and apologizing sincerely instead of spitting out an im sorry because they wanted it but its definitely a big factor in realizing im not cured and i have to stick to my therapyn__label__1 it sounds like you have a good therapist its a shame there arent more of them aroundn__label__0 from your post i gather that theres a spectrum of manipulationwhen i think manipulation i think of me maybe not telling the whole truth orrrr asking a question in a certain way so that i can get what i want but i would never lie or keep up a lie sooo op maybe most people are just lower on the spectrum and therefore dont even notice itn__label__1 im gonna answer because the answers some people give on this sub are way off if you catch yourself saying something hoping to elicit a specific reaction out of the other person lets say youre sharing your feeling but not in an attempt to be open or honest but moreso in an attempt to get the other person to be sympathetic to you or even worse as a hail mary because the interaction isnt going the way you were hoping it shows a genuine lack of care and respect for the other person because your hiding your intentions behind normal human behaviour its disingenuous and hard to recognize if you dont know its being done which is why a lot of expartners of bdp people feel rightfully so gaslight disclaimer i used to and still do these things but im also diagnosed in therapy ongoing for years and on meds not a selfdiagnosed teenager talking out of their assn__label__0 hello your post has been removed

where i recognize where im the issue now but ive found that the people i deal with almost dont want me to calm down or disengage theyre so used to winning by me freaking out or causing a huge scene that now when i dont want to play the game they escalate thingsi feel like by doing skills it almost makes the people close to me madn__label__0 thanks for your reply i think i understand would this be an example of what youre saying say im arguing with my husband i get so frustrated and want to end the discussion so i blurt out i dont want to do this anymore i have a headache which i dont but the tension is starting in my head so thats a lie but i manipulated the end of the conversation because i wanted it to end by blaming what i frequently go thru headaches regardless of how he feels with where the discussionargument is at thats something i might do just off the top of my headn__label__1 no but we some people with bpd do have harsh ways to end conversations partners often learn to recognize those i have a look i do and my partner recognizes it she hates it but she respects it cause the alternative of pushing me isnt better and we both know it by nowbut weve talked about this its not easy for anyone but if theres at least communication than there can be peaceful coexistence i wil lreturn to the topic and let her finish the conversation when ive improve my state of mind i just know when im starting to lose control of a conversation and i know its better to end it there doesnt mean i shut them out or shut them upmany of the people on this sub who cry about never being good enough for normal relationships are just entitled and never take accountability for their action they hide behind this often selfdiagnosed without any actual proof condition as if it excused their shitty behaviour without doing the dbt a lot of bpd people simply never learn to apologize or be accountable which shocking makes them shitty partnersn__label__0 thanks for your reply we try to communicate but it gets difficult thanks again for your insightn__label__1 trust your gut there may be a chance of you not having it but definitely worth the diagnosis find a psychologist through a mental health institute if its urgent youre worried about your own safety then the ers psych ward can set you up with one most therapists arent licensed to diagnose so take their word with a grain of salt my therapist didnt think i had it either but i was diagnosed with quiet bdp by a psychologist part of what makes quiet bpd so hard to diagnose is because the symptoms are presented even hidden v differently than bpdn__label__2 ok ill try im in the middle of a breakdown my mom doesnt believe me and is giving me the silent treatment while i cry and shes forcing me to eat a snackn__label__1 i cant speak for everyone but in my personal experience therapy has helped me not feel everything so deeply as has just naturally getting older from when i was a child through probably years old everything was so painful im in my late twenties now and between therapy having a child and just generally aging i dont feel as miserable and sensitive as i used to part of that is also probably because i was drinking so heavily during those ages and making so many terrible decisions i was dating people who treated me terribly i was staying out late could barely keep a job so i was always in financial ruin honestly the way i was treating myself and my body is probably why i felt so emotional all of the time alcohol typically makes people more emotional vaping and other nicotine products probably make anxiety skyrocket impulsive decisions whether it be sex financial decisions etc can make us more emotional not taking care of our bodies can cause anxiety to increase even down to the food youre eating and whether youre exercising regularly therapy can help you make better decisions handle the extreme emotions you do have in a way that doesnt make your life even worse and put you in a position to treat your body better combine those things together and i think naturally the emotions you do have just come down a few pegs at least for me it didn__label__0 my emotions still go feral but learning the coping mechanisms therapy teaches gives me a chance to control it before the blow up happensn__label__1 hey i was in a really similar boat when i started exploring dbt it seemed way too focused on preventing your internal from affecting the external and couldnt actually touch on diminishing the reason that you were having episodes outbursts meltdowns ect in the first place aka reduce the emotional intensity in any meaningful wayand i also felt very similarly defeated like what the hell am i even doing any of this for if im still going to feel like reheated nightmare shit every day for foreverwell i cant speak for your lived experiences and your milage may vary but what ive found is that over time putting the work into skills made to make it easier for others inadvertently also makes it easier for you to process your own feelings the time spent analyzing what is and isnt appropriate for people outside of yourself also in a way makes it easier for you to rationalize events to yourself and get a better feel on what isnt appropriate or healthy even when its directed at only yourselfonce i became more secure in the idea of being committed to actually genuinely changing it became easier to forcibly lessen the grip that ruminating on those thoughts might have on you otherwise the distress tolerance skills you have to learn for preventing blow ups at people also work when youre just trying to calm your own ass down by yourself no lie it felt like faking for the longest time a lot of it is going to be challenging your own thoughts over and over and over it really is a game you have to play a long time overwriting unhealthy habits you might not even realize how deeply are engrained in you but it is worth the effort eventually it stops feeling like pretending im nowhere near done with the work myself and still have a lot of bad days but also holy shit not all of em and recognizing that you have made progress especially when you didnt think you would is a something that i hope you eventually experience for yourself best of luckn__label__2 good antidepressants keep changing and find ones that work for you personally i found ssris really bad and if needed a mood stabiliserthat dbt getting older and finding a balance in life that works for me good job supportive environment stable relationships etc all really helpi do still have very intense emotions but they arent anywhere near as bad as they used to beanger and impulsiveness are still an issue being aware and stopping myself go down the rabbit hole helps a lotif stuff in life happens a friend dying last year was one of them then i let myself go for a while had some grieving therapy and sat with those emotions that helpedwhat youre looking for is stability it gets better trust me xn__label__0 honestly an antipsychotic was what helped me the most along with therapy i feel like my range of emotions is closer to normal now i still feel big deep emotions and cry sometimes but its much much more infrequent it can get bettern__label__5 after decades undiagnosed going from everything from religion drugs alcohol being a workaholic and so on i have found my best coping mechanism to be step groups i did it first for trichotillomania and alcoholism but there is so much overlap between the steps and dbt therapy that i have been applying the steps more to bpd specifically therapists are expensive so i am so grateful to have found groups of people recovering together ive been doing this for about years and it got worse before it got better but the recovery has been good so farps i do still need to get back into therapy to try to help my lack of object constansy issues but i dont see it as an emergency as my sh is better i take a mild med pristiq as i couldnt do the more heavy anxiety meds that were really helping because i was starting to abuse them the combination of what works for each individual surely differs but there is hopen__label__0 honestly after i got sober most of the time for the first three months it was hard asf i was having breakdowns all the time and was miserable but then i just got used to my intense emotions i still break down and split every now and again but i take responsibility and make efforts to make amends now i can juggle being a mom college and a full time job yeah its still hard but i push through i just pick myself apart whenever i get triggered to figure it out so i can avoid that and communicate clearly about what i am feeling and why and i give it a rating on how im handling it is im about to flip my lidn__label__0 therapy medicinen__label__2 i have the worst adult tantrums that im embarrassed of my own self when its happening and its of the time by myself i refused meds thinking they were just for depression but i found the best combo and it changed so much yes you are right it totally sucks that the irritability and indescribable frustration went just disappear with meds or therapy but they helped me tremendously they got me to a level i can actually think rationally in those moments dbt is currently helping started individual and now just started a group bpd emotions suck in the worst fing way imaginable any relief is relief i hope you find something that works for you i really truly do im hearing youn__label__0 i dont think its possible to blunt emotions once they are present however once your perceptions become more accurate and your reasoning more mature you should be less emotionally triggered so they will become more manageable organically over timeour emotions are informed by our thinking when our thought patterns improve so do our emotions in the meantime you can channel your negative emotions into healthy forms of catharsis exercise art journaling bit fat crying sessionsn__label__2 cbt has been helping me to change my thought patterns so i dont have the unhealthy ones that lead to the intense emotions dbt can also help to teach you skills to cope with the emotions once you have them so you avoid extended spiraling episodes i still have episodes but they arent nearly as frequentn__label__0 not sure this is healthy but i use logic and rationalization to deal with my emotions like i ask myself does this make sense does what happened merit how i feel are my assumptions even correct and i also wait i give my feelings a couple of days to calm down before doing anythingn__label__0 i have been in therapy since i was i am now i feel so deeply its painful and exhausting and excruciating but my emotional regulation has gotten better i still access therapy to explore some of these emotions and to feel them in a safe space i have built better distress tolerance and included a lot more physical activities in my life that helps sorta put my feelings into physical pain wellness insteadn__label__3 finding internal and external resources that help for me finding out about nervous system regulation was absolutely life changing my anxiety was crippling and for no good reason but i found there were things i could consistently keep doing and it got a little better also not relying on others to meet my needs trying to meet my own like when i desperately need a cuddle i can run a bath or cuddle a soft toy and self soothe maybe call a friend and tell them what i need for me personally i found guided meditations ok but trying eft tapping through an app poor and lazy here was absolutely amaaaazing will take me off the ledge like no one else can its me showing up for myself um and i also tried microdosing a week or so ago since i found a trusted source lsd for me its like an ssri with a real hyperfocus on self growth but not in a victimised indulgent way in a wow i actually want to help myself for myself way ive been really focused on my self work since like i cant get enough learning or contemplation my feels are still intense but im starting to laugh at the absurdity of some and also use the intensity to see what i need to give myself im currently reading i need your love is it true by byron katie its super confronting but the audio book is read by her so its a bit more easy to swallow she really helped me confront the validity of my thoughts and ive been through a few therapists and self help regimes that were an ok bandaid at the time but this is like a salve of self compassion also i guess im here on my journey because i cant afford to be anywhere else suffering for this many years wore me out so much i just couldnt be with myself anymore i had to believe there was a reason the wounded victim can become the wounded healer in fact the only ones who can heal themselves or others are ones who have been through the pits of despair and wrangled the ego to make our lives make enough sense to find the meaning in it all and grow beyond it ive experienced happiness joy and wonder on levels i had doubted their existence by spending time with myself and doing lots of shadow work inner child work contemplating and practicing mindfulness i cant even say one thing was the fix its all of them with the somatics stuff of bringing the trauma out of the body trauma informed yoga acupuncture my fave i have chronic pain and cant take painkillers so this is my jam chiropractor if you find a good one eft tapping breathworkmeditation and one thing i learnt is just cos its meant to help you it might not in the moment if you dont feel like it i used to force myself to do meditations and i do not recommend that it isnt very self compassionate or kind i made a self care bingo so i had some options when i was freaking out or bored or wanted to improve my lifeperspective it all helpedn__label__0 i love to read so i found that reading and really studying every big emotion i was struggling with really calmed them down like for months i read a lot the philosophy and psychology of emotions was fascinating just study anger and infatuation and happiness as individual subjects i became more emotionally analytic and less emotionally impulsivei feel like it was the best way to really process the emotion as opposed to all the triggers of the emotions i learned to drop the story and on the flip side think of the story with a different emotion attached to it like an easy one was if i stubbed my toe i would force myself to laugh even though i still felt pissed and triggered into a rabbit hole it took practice but by starting with small triggers eventually i was able to not have such a thin skinn__label__0 i can relate was hoping someone here had tips i hadnt already tried but i understand i was in weekly therapy or outright inpatient for years it never helped me any like me in particular all it taught me was how to stiflemuzzle myself and bottle shit up and push it down internally so i was outwardly collected and normal it just made me more manageable and easier to swallow for others who can very much tell that im pretty off after any extended period of time it just taught me to make my symptoms manageable to benefit and not inconvenience others or make them uncomfortable at my own expense regardless of any of my diagnoses it didnt matter what i wanted help with the help was managing outward behaviors to make me easier for others to handle or gaslightingtelling me to gaslight myself that its not that bad or im being unreasonable or i just dont wanna not feel that way badly enough so i choose not to feel different and get better my wellness was always evaluated by my external performance but heaven forbid i tell anyone i still felt terrible internally no matter how well i was doing or it was my fault and i wanna be that way bc i just dont feel better it was honestly super damaging psychologically damaging to my self esteem from a young age and put me in a lot of shitty situations as a teenadult im in my s struggling to undo a lot of the harm from mental health professionals i just want results for me and no amount of genuine attempts to work a program or therapy skills ever made internal symptoms improve it just made it worse but hey at least now i dont bother others right i wish there was more i could don__label__0 i found in therapy i learned how to set boundaries and create safe spaces in my life this along with trying to live a healthier lifestyle more fruits and veg more movement less toxic screen time less substance use and adding vitamins and routines all help me regulate emotions by avoiding triggerstheres a lot of useful tools to behave less emotionally and this will help your relationships but focusing on finding your happiness will help you regulate the intensity of your emotions simply put avoid doing shit that makes you feel like shit definitely easier said than done and youll never get it perfectly but that for sure has been the biggest help for men__label__0 so true about were making you less of a danger than helping you suffer less some stuff ive been doing recently to help the suffering from having big emotions spiral prep when im gonna do something that i know makes me spiral i write before why im doing the thing i get the list in my head i review it before the event and after when im spiraling the spiral prep is in my head along with the spiraling lessening the spiraling i can go into detail if you want just ask not shaming myself for my emotions i am not overreacting i am reacting sure it is moremore intense than people without bpd but i am human too and this is just how i am not saying its easy to not feel shame for big emotions or spiraling or splitting over little things environment plays a big role ive recently moved back in with my parents who love to always tell me im overreacting and so those thoughts have increased in my head and theyre harder to fight back my point is if youre the type to beat yourself up like me everything is not your fault your environment and people around you play a big role not bottling up thoughts no matter how inane or ridiculous this goes along with the not shaming myself so i guess the first step is not shaming myself and the next is saying the thought or feeling however this i guess requires you have at least someone trustworthy you can talk to basically its not about saying anything no matter the consequences its about not minimizing yourself and feelingsso to answer your question in the title i think we are able to feel the emotions and not suffer not saying the big emotions stop being distressing ever but we can at least not hurt ourselves for having them and the emotions themselves can become less distressing i thinkwe just need support and community and healthy environments and to work on our self esteem and fight internalized beliefs about were overreacting this is all easier said than done saying that in a gentle understanding way not in a condescending wayn__label__0 noemotions are there to be felt and the more open you are to feeling them the more quickly they pass feel it and let it pass if you keep pushing it away and pushing it away it just gets bigger and bigger like a tidal waveas opposed to the wave thatd wash around your knees if you just let it happenn__label__0 it gets better intensity of emotions decrease with therapy over time in my experience as you learn to tolerate them instead of trying to avoid them this might sound counterintuitive but emotions are temporary they just come and go as you learn to tolerate and process them so you just gotta get in the mindset of facing them head on it helped me a lot making a challenge out of it as im generally up for challengesat this point i can verbalize my emotions in such a healthy manner that i end up calming people down instead of antagonizing them further while still enjoying the benefits of having intense emotionsn__label__0 i would say personally that the emotions are still intense not as insanely intense as they used to be but you basically learn different techniquestools manage them better which is usually but not always learned by doing enough therapyfor example journaling is an insanely power technique put all of that shit down on paper that usually speeds up the recovery time and then you can just throw that paper away if need be other techniques is just learning how to exit a situation and process the emotions yourselflater etc etcat one point you get good enough with these tools that you can pick when you want to feel intense moments and when you want to manage them in a more constructive way the endgame isnt to emotionally neuterstunt yourselfn__label__0 yes i started it in and ever since i feel less emotional and just so stable i dont even remember the last time i was upset or i lashed out or even cried i used to get so angry and frustrated so fast but not i dont really caren__label__0 replying to add i do still have breakdowns i still have moments where everything is at and my therapy skills all go out the window those instances are fewer and farther between and im much better at keeping myself from getting to that point in the first placen__label__0 i fell like i am the opposite i am in my early s and i have never felt more fucked up felt so much and hurt so much as i am in these years it is terriblen__label__0 this the intensity doesnt magically disappear for me at least but i have skills within my belt that i can use to prevent a catastrophic blow up the intensity is familiar its my regular so that doesnt upset me once i feel heightened emotions i use the tools ive learnt in therapy to regulate them and express themn__label__0 thank youn__label__1 just deleted my paragraphs to say thank you it is so good to hear someone else has found a step program to be beneficial to their bpd as well my bpd peaked at puberty and my drug addiction began shortly after ive been in a step program for years now and only got diagnosed wbpd years ago going to meetings is my daily repreive and working the steps has given me a design for living ive recently come to realize they cant help me in every aspect of my bpd and i am seeking outside help someone who specializes in bpd but those meetings make a hell of a differencen__label__1 i did some cbt years ago but we focused on social anxiety as i wouldnt be able to go outside for it but thats all it helped me for we tried to change the black and white thinking too but i feel like it worked just on the surfacen__label__0 thank you it gives me some kind of hopen__label__0 same with me you will always have these intense moments where your brain goes into an emotional fire but its happening far less frequently which also means you can live a more normalconstructive lifen__label__0 im so sorry to hear that thats not something i would wish on anyone do you have any resources that might help therapy a cheap gym membership anything that can help at alln__label__0 wow that is so cool and encouraging sounds like we have about the same story the step groups were essential for me getting diagnosed because there were some things that wouldnt budge even with the steps grateful for our daily reprieven__label__1 yes the black and white thinking is very hard to contend with what ive come to realize is that its a driving force for basically everything in my life even small things that dont matter i have a lot of work to do still but at least cbt has helped me to become more self aware so i am at least able to recognize when i am thinking in black and white i can handle it in some situations weve been unpacking but it is just so ingrained that there are a lot of situations and triggers and it seems like im finding new ones all the time at least i feel like there is some hope nown__label__0 of course i actually had this same conversation once in therapy and it made me feel horrible i went home and cried feeling like i was cursed the more stability i allowed into my life the better i felt the real key is i had to stop involving myself with people and things that were chaotic sometimes thats easier said than done thoughn__label__1 thanks i am going to therapy it is not working taking meds it is not working nothing sparks joy anymoren__label__0 yes exactly it was only after id been sober a while and worked a couple sets of steps when one day i lost control and realized i only acted like that on under the influence yet here i was years sober thats when i sought help and got diagnosed but working the steps and going to meetings being in the rooms has helped me so so much it helped me enough to seek help and it continues to help me with resentments and controlling my anger and just basic daily living i love that it helps you too so cooln__label__0 i know that feeling i just went through a bout of that about months ago i swear i just sat on the couch for a month finding a new video game to play actually weirdly helped me get out of it any fun games youve seen recentlyi also forced myself to get a gym membership to keep me actually doing something i found one with a pool so that is my current motivation now to see if i will actually use itn__label__0 thank you i know you mean well but honestly i just want to be dead nothing makes sense everything is boring and exhausting i do have a gym membership but whats the point you known__label__1 yeah i know what you mean thats a rough space to be in is medication an option im sorry youre going through this just know that there are people here for you even if its just internet strangers like men__label__1 i am taking meds but they arent working obviously i am going to see new psyhiatrist this friday so maybe hell evaluate me and prescribe me something betterand once again thanksn__label__0 this post has been marked as a venting post please be aware that the op may not be seeking advice upeachxberry if you do

questions or concernsn__label__0 you do deserve things life is tough but dont trick yourself into thinking you dont deserve things you deserve love and compassion trust and communicationim sorry youre having the world coming down on youn__label__1 youre not a burden i know some stranger on the internet saying that doesnt help but it is the truth and im so sorry that your brain is telling you those things you dont deserve to talk to yourself that way or to feel guilty for that either you are going through something hard and you deserve lots of grace for that when i feel at my lowest pinterest helps i search exactly what i need ex how to stop feeling guilty how to stop feeling like a burden how to be kinder to yourself it does help you need to heal from this and i know with all the other stressors going on that seems impossible but do as much research as you can when youre up to it you are valuable even when youre sick even when youre angry even when you have to rely on others now all you gotta do is learn how to believe that it takes time but thats all you need time and mindfulness you are a human being youre not all good its impossible to be but youre not all bad id even argue that the fact that you care so deeply about burdening your friends and family makes you a pretty great person the thing that holds you back is caring so much about what others think at the expense of yourself theres a balance that you need to find and it is possible i swear to you it is i used to think i was the most unloveable person to ever exist and i surrounded my entire life around being better and making others happy but the only way you can truly make the people in your life happy and yourself is to learn how to not be so hard on yourself not to be even harder its not that you are a burden its that you believe youre one that is the problem alone its not your fault its probably due to past experiences and the way others have made you feel about yourself and that part of you needs to be healed is all i know on my healing journey i had to face a lot of horrible truths about who i am about how i let others treat me and how i responded to their behaviour when i shouldve just walked away but then once you get through all that you get to the point where you realize you didnt know any better you wanted to you tried to understand but you werent given the information you needed and thats okay as long as we try now even when we have setbacks and feel like its useless even when the world turns its back on us we can still get back up and start off where we left off when were ready again and then every time it gets easier and easier until its okay i hope this helps you and im so sorry youre going through this youre aloud to feel the pain that comes along with it but do whatever you can not to let it consume you our feelings are tools we can learn how to use them to help us get through things and figure stuff out but you need to learn hown__label__0 you will get used to this new way of living you are loved for who you are by your fiance and others this will get bettern__label__0 ive had inflammatory bowel disease since i was years old thats a big reason why i have bpd and it is so hard to keep your brain from going crazy just remember that if your fianc wanted to leave he would have done so a long time ago he sees an amazing woman and wants to stay in your lifen__label__0 you are not a burden they should understand its not your fault at all maybe suggest restaurants that you can go ton__label__0 big virtual hugn__label__0 youre not a burden it makes me sad to know youre feeling how i used to feel remember who you are love do not succumb to the pressure to the weakness of the mind at your lowest you have a partner who loves you and accommodates life for you your fianc wants to marry you love not everyone has a partner like that i have the same man for years never got a question like that why am i around oh hell who knows love the babies its hard but at least you have so much loven__label__0 this does not make you a burden at all chronic illness especially autoimmune is such a tough thing to handle mentally remember your body is attacking itself thats a lot for you to handle and its not your faulti have a couple of them as well as a paralyzed stomach people make going out to eat so much of a hassle than it need be i suggest joining some support groups for your condition things arent as limited as they may feel and things wont feel this awful forever you deserve love and compassion from others and from yourself baby

foods i cant eat and the oils theyre cooked in idk who you were calling fat but sitting at a restaurant drinking water while everyone else gets to enjoy a meal is sad and awkward if it was as simple

or concernsn__label__0 i definitely dont think its hopeless to get a job but for me it feels that way i have pretty lowfunctioning bpd and i had a pretty good job with a manager that understood about my mental health at a grocery store but then i stole k during an episode and got fired this job lasted a year i never got a job after that im struggling with going to school at all so i havent even graduated hs im considering dropping out but youre not the only one eventually things might look up and youll find a good job regardless i keep telling myself that and i might get a job next month after i had talked to the manager at the pharmacy that i go to that i was close to i didnt tell him i stole k of course if he finds out he can do what he wants with thatn__label__0 ive had my current job for years and am not planning on quitting anytime sooni havent tried to run my own business because thats a huge investment and risk and the income may not be consistent or reliablei dont create contenti work from home as a data scientist and most of my day is spent either working closely with my team people or individually with a couple meetings per day off camera because i work at my own apartment i can usually step away for a few minutes craft during meetings or watch tv during my downtime or prepare a meal if things are slow when things arent slow im pretty intellectually stimulated by my work and thus not bored because i have a puzzle to solve i make less than i probably would somewhere else but i have a lot more freedom and comfort so its nbdn__label__0 bank teller was the best for me i found i failed miserable at jobs that required a little of everything like working as a barista i would have thrived if i was just making coffee but i was also doing prep work making food cleaning the whole restaurant i worked midday shift and had to be acting manager and deal with peoples snot attitudes but a bank teller id clock in keep a drawer be kind to customers count my drawer and then go home i was just a bank teller and i got to dress up every day it was a joy and i miss itn__label__1 yes only when working in a toxic workplace where everyone seemed to have some form of personality disorder stayed for years because the commission was good now i work from home and i hate this company they tried to write me up because i reported a senior agent for harassment the woman harassed me on occasions the final one was where she sent me a sentence paragraph desrcribing how awful of an agent i was they said what did did was innapropriate but that she was trying to help me i said that wasnt help she belittled and mistreated me she put me down and insulted me and would not stop after i told her to they labeled me as aggressive because i said to her you are not my manager i am terminating the call and i am contacting my supervisor about this i told hr they were gaslighting me and showing favoritism and that this was very much indeed harassment and that i was documenting everything i told them that telling a black woman that she is agressive when shes being assertive ia a microagression it can be viewed as discriminatory after that they decided not to write me up i had several panic attacks engaging with this co worker and hr management and i let them know i took time off and provided a drs note thankfully he didnt charge me im looking into speaking with a lawyer to discuss my rights one thing about me is that i will always advocate for myself they will probably find a reason to let me go eventuallyn__label__0 non__label__0 yes its absolutely possible you just have to keep trying find something youre truly passionate about not just something that sounds fun or youre doing it because someone else you know does it find your niche and youll be much more successful in your effortsn__label__0 its fucking hardworking from home has been the best thing to happen to me i cant talk myself out of not pulling out of my driveway i just have to roll out of bed on low effort mornings its still a struggle to get out of bed each morning i work but its made things just a little easier to show up each day i squeeze every second of free time of when im not working to do what i actually enjoy every day i work i have to talk myself out of quitting several times a day if i quit im already at home and i get to stress over how to pay my rent my point is to find something that works for you its a lot of work to workn__label__0 i like the helping professions specifically medical so my longest job was a cna and im back in the medical field now i think it depends on your interest areas but ppl with bpd are known to be highly empathetic at least some of the time so the helping professions work for me i couldnt do content creation because its not personal enough for me i need to see people every day and know that they are helped by me in some way no matter how small but there are others ways to use high empathy besides medical so look up some jobs online if you think that will help youn__label__0 im only m and had jobs my first job lasted months and ended because my boss retired second job was months and ended because i was majorly depressed and burnt out being in it by the end of it i was having panic attacks and negative thoughts so i had to just quit on the spot third job only lasted a month because i got dumped by someone i thought was the loml so i was a wreck and couldnt handle myself much less a job at that point trying to get a job again and hope i dont follow the past patternn__label__0 i dont have my own business and i dont really have a desire to run my own business i dont do content creation mainly because i think my moods are too unstable i used to write for a tumblr blog when i was transitioning out of high school and i got a high when i saw comments or likes on my pieces but since then i dont really dabble however ive always consistently earned money whether that be through school loans my first job at dg that lasted years then my most previous job in a warehouse that last years and this new adventure im about to take into veterinary medicine i quit my first job due to toxic environment and the heavy favoritism favoritism was shown to me and i didnt like that my coworkers were getting the shit end of the stick oh and the pay was shit i quit my second job yesterday its because i want to try something new and my body is sore from all the warehouse work im exhausted all the time and dont find night shift as enjoyable as i once did so im moving to this job in veterinary medicine hoping that it bring some purpose that ive lost between the last few yearsn__label__0 yes im the high functioning quiet bpd i am a manager in automotive quality i make good money but this is my th job in years i kept rage quitting my jobs before but fortunately i am otherwise quite intelligent and a true chameleon so whatever job i have im very good at it i like current job because its extremely stressful and time consuming so it leaves me very little time for selfpityn__label__0 so like as far as an income making job no im currently holding the most important role ive ever had in household management but its a non income based role however im currently starting a business so thats funn__label__0 yeah social anxiety disorder means i would rather suck it up and swallow my rage and anger than find a new jobfactory work was by far the easiest give me a job i dont have to think at and leave me alonen__label__0 do you have a bachelors i want to do this so bad but i cant bring myself to go back to schooln__label__0 i have a masters degreen__label__0 i am super happy for you and have found some plant medicine helpful myself but i wanted to let you know that my brain interpreted your title as literally trees and i was like yes me too i fucking love trees being around trees is currently my best calming down methodn__label__3 honestly agree my meds just made everything worse and made me feel so numb i use it as medicine too and its the only time i feel somewhat happy and content which sounds awful probably but im sick of running in circles trying all these medications that dont do shit and make it worsen__label__1 and they say there are no meds for bpd lol i am also super thankful to be able to use it as medicine it made me paranoid before i got my card but now it really helps a lotn__label__0 what strainn__label__0 nothing like doubling upa hike under the trees while i enjoy some treesn__label__0 hybrids like golden pineapplen__label__0 i was gonna say i love to be outside with the trees while enjoying some treesn__label__0 tyn__label__0 giggling in the grass w some gigglegrassn__label__1 wrong therapist indeed this person is going to do more harm then good my god to suggest that you are fking possessed is so behind unprofessional and kind of blowing my mind to be honest she must not be licensed if she is she needs to be reported i would do whatever i could to avoid this person and make sure no one unsuspecting goes to her and is damaged permanently by their nonsense i dont even believe in spirits or the supernatural but something like that would rattle me deeplyn__label__0 rleavesn__label__0 maybe try and reduce intake ive been in the same spot as you and noticed when i reduced intakestopped all together it was a lot easier to feel okay and not have the dreaded overanxious feeling if that makes sense lolyou can also try tracking your intake by jotting down in a notebook the days you smoked how much and how it made you feel that way you have something you can look back on and go okay this amount of weed made me feel like this that day and no weed made me feel like this etc its a tough one to stop especially with it being so well accepted in society but its not for everyone and thats okay if its not for you dont know if any of this helps but hopefully it cann__label__1 bpd causes me to abuse alcohol when i have withdrawals i lie awake in bed or have nightmares fever causes me to wake up two or three times a night to change my shirt because its drenched in sweati shake and shiver and lose balance during the day this disorder sucks alcohol works on the brain the same way as my medication does and its hard to resist even my psych accepts the need and psychological effects stopping suddenly can lead to seizures and in serious cases death its brutal and i hate it i dont drink to party or to have fun im just getting by im almost always aloneyour struggle and your feelings are valid and youre using a substance to help control the intensity of mood you are seenaddiction comes in many forms and sometimes im able to beat it i hope you can find a type of relief and support that works for you just know that youre not alonen__label__2 im in the same boat im going to rehab in a few days for other drugs but im honestly most scared of going without weed its so essential for my mood regulationn__label__2 youre doing a great job of developing introspection and self reflection i had a similar realization a few years ago but it still took me about two years to quit completely and then my doctor told me to quit drinking because of signs of damage to my liver all of this led me to be in the perfect position to start trying medications to manage my symptoms of anxiety and depression im not perfect by any means but where i am now is a huge improvement from years agobe patient with yourself you know what is best for you and it will take time before you will be able to completely quit start by trying to go longer in between uses then go longer in between buying more gradual decrease will help you get used to the idea of quitting without punishing yourself for going back to it youve got thisn__label__0 my best advice for quitting and would be taking cbd it blocks the same receptors the thc does which will help you with the withdrawal and it helps with anxiety without the psychoactive effects even if you continue using weed incorporating in cbd before and after you smoke will help with your mood and brain fogn__label__0 i did it and i dont want to go back havent smoked in days after years of daily heavy use mostly carts the first couple weeks suck really bad but i think its so worth it genuinely cant try to get better if you arent dealing with your shit straight up you know i dont think weed is all bad but im not able to have a healthy relationship with it very all or nothing itd be nice to be able to smoke a couple times a week but that simply isnt realistic for me and from this post i kinda get the impression that your relationship with weed is similar to minelmk if you have any questions bc i was in this exact positioni have some quotes saved that helped me big timen__label__0 i used to smoke daily and think i wouldve had a hard time quitting from that point but recently quit from smoking to times per week and it was really manageable its been weeks since my last smoke and im feeling good i would try to rely less on it slowly over time and then quitting altogether wont be such a huge jolt to your routinesystemn__label__2 been a daily smoker for years trying to quit since december but im failing ive quit hard drugs but weeds just horrifically habitforming and i have zero chill and cant do any drugs recreationallyn__label__1 hey friend i so relate to this post i recently quit smoking weed almost months ago now after over years of daily use i smoked daily for similar reasons to you and also wanted to quit for similar reasons my biggest thing is that i just dont want to need something like that to be okay anymore i wanted to quit for about a year before being able to but i knew that i would when i was ready and i did i think its extremely important to give yourself a lot of grace as you move through this if you do decide to quit try changing up your routine as much as possible and probably getting rid of all of your stash unless you have tremendous self control for me im a stubborn fuck that can come in handy in situations like this once i make my mind up about something im doing it all or nothing am i right lolthe first month wasnt as hard as i thought id be mostly physical symptoms as i worked through lack of appetite and differences in sleep i recommend trying magnesium and melatonin for nightly relaxation and helping you fall asleep melatonin is a life saver when it comes to this at months after quitting i dont need the melatonin unless im pretty overstimulated and honestly my sleep is so so so much better now i really enjoy having dreams again and i just overall feel like sleeping is more productive my appetite is back to full force too like super full force im actually hungrier after quitting but during the time youre going through withdrawal id try having some milk protein shakes easy snacks on hand after the first month i had some shit show up for me that reminded me why i using in the first place i had about a week long episode of being really really not okay i was able to reach out to my therapist at that time which helped a lot at making me not feel crazy but i had to remind myself over and over and over again why i am doing this because if i choose to just go back to smoking when these hard emotions show up im never going to progress or really learn how to manage myself and heal i found what was really hidden underneath my daily baked buzz and it was unsettling but i know its something i have to work through and i promise you its gotten easier and easier and easier im so grateful i stayed strong over that week it actually helped me learn that my hard moments and feelings actually do pass which felt like a huge revelation after stuffing them down with weed all these years i feel like i am slowly coming to a normal baseline and i truly am not missing feeling so spaced all of the time and having the want to smoke hanging over me all the time i feel like i can actually be a bit more present with myself and others i hope this helps you can do anything you set your mind to it also takes giving yourself some love and patiencen__label__0 finding another coping mechanism is so important keeping busy and changing some things up to keep things interesting keeping yourself away from triggers i just managed to successfully quit all substances a few months ago for the first time with the exception of an occasional edible right before bed for inflammation sex and giving myself some little tattoos have been helping but most bpd coping mechanisms are not very good im also audhd taper off weed while you taper onto another coping mechanism maybei hope this all makes sense and is at least a little helpfuln__label__0 tysmn__label__0 yep for me the sweet spot is smoking days a week not the wholeday either or only before bed more than that and its terrible for my mental health and from what ive seen this is pretty common just adding this in case anyone wishes they didnt have to stop altogether ofc it depends on the person but quitting entirely doesnt have to be the only optionn__label__0 that might actually help thank you for the suggestionsn__label__0 thank you for that validation and for sharing your struggle with addiction i hope youre able to find peace and healing as well as myself yeah quitting alcohol cold turkey is definitely dangerous please take care of yourselfn__label__0 im wishing you the best of luck itll be worth itn__label__0 thank you im so glad you got better your comment is really inspiringn__label__0 thats really good insight thank you for this comment im willing to try and only smoke a couple times a week but im prepared for the possibility of needing to quit altogether because im not so sure i can have the self control for that im not even sure what questions to ask other than how did you cope with the first couple weeks id love it if you could share those quotes with me or any other information that helped youn__label__0 how did you do it did you go from smoking daily then times a week and then none or was it gradual just out of curiosityn__label__2 well first off congratulations on quitting hard drugs that deserves acknowledgment because thats huge even if it was long ago i hope youll find some of the comments on this thread helpful one thing that has stood out is some people saying how it took them a long time to successfully quit youre not alone in this ive been having a feeling of wanting to quit for a while now but have been too scared to truly admit it and come to terms with that until recently years is a long time so be patient and give yourself grace its been going on years for me we can do thisn__label__1 i do wish i didnt have to stop altogether ill try slowly weaning off but if i like how i feel when im only smoking it a couple times a week ill try to keep it at that its hard to resist the urge to do it everyday but its just something ill have to get used to and find other things to fill that time maybe if i smoke less often itll help lower the negative side effectsn__label__0 i slowly worked my way from daily down to times a week it was gradual though i honestly didnt try to my use just fluctuates naturally but i know i wouldve struggled quitting completely when i was smoking daily i relied on it so heavily quitting cold turkey from only smoking times per week was honestly a breeze wishing you the best of luckn__label__2 ive also found cbd flower to be helpful not only it helps with my bpd iirc its being researched as a treatment for it but it also counteracts the negative effects of thc its the same habit too so you dont even have to change your routine and you can just focus on the addiction part for now at leastanyways good luck i hope you find whatever works best for you and stick to itn__label__1 i feel this college has become a place of constant dissociation for me and my school doesnt give accommodations for attendance and also doesnt recognize bpd as something that warrants any accommodations i have found that having a set place to study has made it easier for me if i dont feel ready in even the slightest for an exam or presentation i almost certainly will bail and my dissociation makes it so hard to ever feel ready it has been a lot of tries and fails with medication and it really ended up going to having some sort of comfort media podcasts for me that i let myself listen to while studying i also play this little game of everyone can tell i am not there and is judging me for skipping class that makes me more anxious to miss class i hope that this helps and i hope you can find a good balance because college is hard but college with bpd is near impossible i am proud of you for working hard and looking for ways to get back to where you want to ben__label__3 im so sorry sweety law student here it has been hard to me as well but i go to the therapist even taking medications when i need them ask for help study what you can are there any tutors to help you explain the problem formally if you want to talk im heren__label__2 my therapist says that the best solution is to study everyday just a bit and it will get easier everyday try to spend an hour studying each day and try to increase it when you can do one hour a day consistentlyxbim just like you actually im on meds which help a bit but im still daydreaming i still have addiction issues and impulsive behavior but i catastrophize less im kinda in the mindset that even if i dont succeed ill try again but you gotta believe that you can succeed even a little bit you can even by chance by accident or by studying at least an hour a day consistenly its better than nothing you can do it good luck youre not alonen__label__0 i was literally in this same situation and dropped out studying defectology now not to discourage you since everyone is different but if you put too much pressure on yourself eventually youll snap medicine feels like an only this or ill die sort of option but just knowing it doesnt have to be that way makes things a whole lot easiern__label__0 thank you so much exactly its nearly impossible the harsh truth is that no one sees what you are going through bpd makes life hell i wish i could know earlier about my bpd sometimes i think to myself its too late to even try to heal myself idkn__label__0 it is it is impossible on september i will retake my year college on because i do not have enough credits to pass on fourth year thanks to bpd i have on i try not to blame my self for what i have at least im always waking up and try to survive i hope you all will find spiral of happiness i have to thank you all because this community is making me feel less alonen__label__0 thank you so much i didnt know about bpd ive been diagnosed lately but my life was shit already at least after diagnosis i felt relievedn__label__0 thank you so much for your kind words its really hard i try everyday its like suffering i know studying for couple of hours is hard for everyone but bpd make you feel much more pain than normal peoplen__label__0 im not looking for an easier option im looking to make myself strongern__label__0 i can fully understand it amazes me how many people are there in this community k i hope it makes you feel less alone i send u all my love and supportn__label__0 i feel ya it makes me in pain too to study but im also so proud that i did study and that i did not totally give up im doing the best i can with what ive got and its important to be proud of that you did not give up youre still trying kudos to you for that dont forget to reward yourselfn__label__0 wonderful absolutely wonderful i love this what a positive thing to do power to youn__label__0 i mention this song whenever i can if you havent heard colds bleed you should give it a listen its acoustic so its not like their other stuff i cry every time i get to the i will marry melody linen__label__0 i was thinking of getting a tattoo across my scars as well but ive been told that depending on how bad the scar tissue is the ink may not take well and may appear faded im still going to try it i too hope it will keep me from cuttingn__label__0 thank youn__label__0 well they asked me how old my scars were they must be years or older and i think it depends on how they look my whole arm was covered in scars so it is possible you should do it its better than cuttingn__label__0 i think mine are that old they have all turned white i know when they are still pinkreddish its too soon i have some pretty thick bumpy lines thoughn__label__0 i had some thick scars as well but you really should go to a tatt shop and ask for their advice i really hope you can get a tattoo because it will give you much strengthn__label__3 theres no meds that actually treat bpd there are meds that are used for other disorders that can help lessen symptoms in some peoplei have not been on a single drug that has helped me at all none of them work for me theres zero differenceother people have had really good success with meds so just like everything else its different for each personn__label__1 ive found lamictal to be really good for paranoid thoughts it helped me a lot with the psychotic symptoms gave me time to challenge my thoughts before i believed them as factn__label__5 this is kind of confusing befsuse some people refer to bipolar disorder as bpd and obviously for borderline personality disorder that is bpd so i will just use bipolar and borderline so no confusion if lamictal was that radical in treating your symtoms id say that is alot of evidence that points to having bipolar as someone else said there is not one single drug approved for use for borderline most are a short term bandaid for treating some symtoms the treatment for borderline is dbt and has shown works long term lamictal and other moodstabilizers can radically trreat bipolar symtoms and are life savers they do not work that way for borderline now it is also common to have both borderline and bipolar and misdiagnosis is so common i suggest you go thru the criteria yourself and see if you meet at least out of ideally using someone you know well to helpn__label__3 lamictal is the gold standard mood stabilizer for bpd it like cuts off the extreme ends of the emotional spectrum but the stability is more than worth itits also known as lamotrigine and it pairs well with many classes of psychiatric medication good for you that it helps so much get better dont slip back into the hellholen__label__0 ive got bpd and bipolar the lamotragine works great for my bipolar and makes bpd easier to handlen__label__1 its a personality disorder so no medication can help dealing with emotions but attachment issues identity disturbance and other things are way differentn__label__1 you cant just cure bpd with a medication but it helps with sustaining your emotions to where it is manageablen__label__2 i take lamictal and it helps alot however with bpd you need therapy so both would be preferred i also take a bunch load of other meds to help as welln__label__1 it helped me a lot but unfortunately i was one of the few that ended up having an allergic reaction weeks in hopefully itll work for you its the one with the least side effects i felt really chill on itn__label__1 agreed im on lamotrigine and i have bpd it has definitely helped me drastically besides going to therapyn__label__0 how long did the reaction lastn__label__0 when you get the reaction you gotta stop but i was covered in a itchy rash for a weekn__label__1 im worried about starting the medication and getting a rash during my trip out of the country ill be on the trip for three weeks and currently have a little over a week before i leave should i start now or wait until after the trip like is the rash enough to ruin a vacation i know its a slim possibility ill get it but im so worriedn__label__0 wait till after because if you break out it could be seriously damaging youd need to go to the er if you break outn__label__0 okay thank youn__label__0 np hope it all works out for youn__label__0 for real currently in the same situation its kind of depressing and feeling like ur the most toxic guy makes u feel like u wont feel the painlemme tell u that it doesnt work like that ur still gonna feel the same shit again and just add on to all those issues the guilt of doing those stuff againjust hold on things get better maybe its gonna take some time but we have to have the hope that its gonna get better and everything is momentary its gonna help a lotn__label__0 embrace the loneliness youre free no one can tell you a damn thing the only person your choices can disappoint right now is yourselfbe self destructive if you want fuck up and learn from itaccepting my loneliness has been the most beneficial thing for me recently knowing i can only rely on myself makes things so much easier do i make stupid choices and regret them yes do i worry that someone i care for deeply will hate me or leave me because of them no i do not and its very liberating im not saying just go on and throw your life away but you can live a little without worrying so much about what anyone thinks about youn__label__0 i thought i was the only one the emptiness sucks so much just wanna feel somethingn__label__0 i feel you being self destructive is such a good way of releasing everything inside you but then you feel like shit after because you cant put the toothpaste back in the tube last year i impulsively chopped all my hair off up to my neck and i regret it so bad i was growing it out for a year and wanted to be a long hair girlie again now i have a grownout shitty haircut and im doing everything i can to make it grow quickly and i even go to a dermatologist for it hair cutting is mild ik but im still kicking myself for that being the method of taking control of goddamn thing in my life that i let win i have red hair too so its always been a main part of my identity so i think the people around me even noticed that i wasnt doing well after giving myself a short shitty haircutn__label__0 being diagnosed can be such a mind fuck it can feel like finally but it can also feel so scary and overwhelming dont get hooked too much on thr diagnosis a d try to get hooked more on getting therapy and moving towards healingn__label__0 lol im f and got diagnosed last year went through something similar its very common to feel imposter syndrome as one of the traits of bpd is having no sense of selfn__label__0 thank you yes im going to therapy two times a week and upping my medicine i appreciate itn__label__0 yes i was wondering if that was a part of the imposter syndrome hahaha its so easy to think that youre faking thingsn__label__0 its always talks about an fp till you become an fp a lot of people justify it im lucky as to where my fps were also people who bullied me but i still like them i think theyre cool people just not cool with me im a lot more avoidant now sometimes i come across this subreddit and the justifications of an fp overwhelms me so much im glad when i see a post about not having an fp been an fp to someone hurt a lot and in the end im sure ill be a bad person to her for some good reasons some i think are problems of her own i find it incredibly inconsiderate with people talking about boundaries here and there then do the same thing they would hate to be givenits a learning curve maybe its a lesson learnt but its not something you deserve be sure to set boundaries earlier than later and please prioritise yourself the whole i love more than they love me is very unfair please for the love of god you dont owe it to her you really dont plus shes older than you she has to learn to find help to be equipped otherwise its like a person sinking dragging the people around them with them you do not owe her and please i get not wanting to abandon them especially when you know how it feels but that isnt on you i wish you the best honestlyn__label__0 im sure deep down you know it but if youre her fp there is no way you can back away without her getting upset about ityou have to decide and set boundaries for yourself you dont worry about how people react to your boundaries if your boundary is this is too much for me i cannot handle a friendship like this that is okay you can back away block them if you have to if they start being angry it isnt your faultn__label__0 being that person to someone else was so eye opening for me real wakeup call to change my behaviorsn__label__0 i find it incredibly inconsiderate with people talking about boundaries here and there then do the same thing they would hate to be givenyeah this is a big onen__label__0 thank youn__label__0 i told her i couldnt hang out tonight and she just showed up at my apartment i think i accidentally got involved with something im not equipped to deal with i didnt answer her calls last night and she texted saying she was going to kill herself i barely know this chickn__label__0 yeah it sounds mean to say but im being given a real life example of what will happen if i dont work harder on dealing with bpd and letting it control men__label__0 it was me projecting a little bit i dated someone else with bpd and it has been tough i dont think i can do that again but reading what you said youre aware and i think just because you learnt something doesnt mean you should feel indebted you not wanting to cause abandonment will do that itll make u burnout your empathy good luckn__label__0 youre seeing how bpd works from a new perspective now and why some people do end up abandoning when they realize they arent equipped for iti would say the way to make this into a silver lining scenario is to learn from it recognize what about her you can see in yourself and work on bettering yourself with the motive of i dont want to be like heras for your initial worry about how to handle what youre already into there isnt going to be a peaceful ending where she accepts it her showing up to your apartment like this shows that muchyoull have to accept that in her eyes when you step away for your own sake you are going to be the bad guy just remember you arent actually a bad person it is okay to look out for yourself you are not at fault for her issuesn__label__0 genuinely like im not even this persons fp anymore and i still get so anxious every time i hear from her like omg is this how i made people feel i really get it nown__label__0 thank you this sub really is amazing i knew id get great advice here about this i think its my first time getting to know someone else with severe bpd and its definitely been eye opening and honestly a little shocking i usually dont start showing symptoms right away for months even but weve only hung out times and i cant get her to leave me alone and her behavior is truly shockingn__label__0 i feel so seenn__label__0 it was definitely a much needed eye opener i have bad bpd but this chick is another level she has a big heart but she is the most unstable person ive ever met she is currently throwing rocks at her exboyfriends apartment window which is directly under my apartment and yelling in the streetsn__label__1 yeah i feel you ive been in that spot more than once its never easy and it never really gets easier tbh bc i hate cutting people off in the first placeyou have to put in the effort to remind yourself that it is not fair nor is it your responsibility to fix people someone who will not respect you and give you space when it is asked for is not treating you wellher showing up in person after you already expressed you didnt want to hang out there is no justifying that it is not okay behaviorn__label__3 tbh i wouldnt talk to the psychiatrist so much about it unless you think it was a side effect of your medication id save this talk for the therapist now while i understand the feeling of feeling like the things said and done during the episode were a different person in reality and to the perception of the person to got the short end of the stick it was you what you should do is message them something along the lines of im sorry about how i actedwhat i said i know its inexcusable and no one deserves to be treated like that sometimes i fly off the handle because of issues in face in my past and i can make me react poorly to whatever triggered you i act impulsively and say things i dont mean but i know will hurt and thats not right my mental health is my responsibility and i need to get it better under control im currently in therapy trying to do the work to not respond this way but i still have a ways to go i just really want you to know im remorseful and i dont mean what i said i understand if you dont want to talk right now but i just wanted to say my piece and i want to hear yours if you want to shareobviously you should make it more sincere and more applicable to your situation also if its to someone youre not that close to make it more short and concise as theyre less likely to want a hearttoheart but if its a close friend partner or family say as much or little as you want whats done is done and you cant change what happened but you can always take accountabilityn__label__1 please yestalk to both l suppose that him is the person you behaved in that way that feels so out of placefor the therapist yes talk to him communicate let him help you communicateand to him lm a partner to a gfwbpdthe moment behavior especially bad behavior is explained to me motivations triggers feelings etcl start to understand her feel with her insteat of being irritated or frustrated by her behaviorif you can communicate in a calm healthy way please do itif that is difficult to you ask your therapist to help you communicatebecause one thing is clear you dont feel good about itn__label__2 i just am unsure if the impulsive behavior is apart of meds side effectsn__label__0 yeah i dont feel good about it at alln__label__1 id say for most of us its a fact of life i just had the same thing happen been happening my whole life no matter what meds im on everyone is different though so might still be worth askingn__label__0 if you think its a side effect then for sure mention it but for a lot of people its just a bpd symptom that you have to work really hard to reign inn__label__0 l see you you might be scared that stuff could get worse by communicatingbut if he is a good one he most likely understands and even feels better about you and safer by kinda understanding whats going on that could even prevent future problems by having that secure line of communication to address when shit blows up in your faces againand if lucky you even have something positive to remember and find courage in when you on this same bridge the next time maybe connect something good with communicating yk rewire the brain and stuffand if it goes the wrong way you can at least look back and say you triedbiggest regrets later on are on all the stuff you did not trywhatever you decide to dolm sure you a good one ogood luckn__label__0 ok ill consider asking him fridayn__label__0 this post has been

i was on medication for anxiety and depression since i wasn__label__0 here and stay single myselfn__label__0 im was told by a clinician that she believed i had it back in but no formal diagnosis was actually given in i was formally diagnosed but the diagnosis was withheld i found out later they believed i was such a high suicide risk that they should not tell me for fear that id go out and try again i just found out about a month ago it explains a lot but i have lots of troublen__label__0 yr old woman herewas diagnosed a couple of years agoits ruined my lifeironically after my diagnosis i vowed to change my lifethen got diagnosed with hsv as wellfeel like any chance i had at a decent life has been cruelly stolen from mebut not prepared to lay down and die just yetn__label__0 im and was diagnosed years agon__label__0 female here i was diagnosed at and even went through deep brain stimulation surgery for my trd i too am solitary its less exhausting and less stressful even though i know its maladaptive forcing myself to socialize now because i only have my mom and brother in poor health leftn__label__0 year old man here i get where youre coming fromn__label__0 heren__label__0 ha good to seeyeah its sad to see all the relationship turmoil brings up bad memories and all i could suggest at this late stage is to get used to your own company but i also remember i really couldnt take any advice back then i just had to live through it compulsions ruled me common sense was a seconday considerationn__label__0 can totally relateif you dont mind me asking do you get anxiety over change uncertain future necessary social interactionsn__label__0 i feel there is definately a positive element to knowing and then making adjustements to deal with it very shitty it was withheld from you imowithout truth we move in circles or on someone elses leashi hope you can begin to find peace nown__label__0 understandable feels like your time is up and you can only make the best of it nowthere is solace in solitude though especially if your history has been so turbulent kinda feel like im just existing but im still making improvements with my self at my own speed something i could never do before i started prioritizing myself being selfish was necessary for me as for ailements they just keep coming lol last year i discoverd i had photosensitive eczema out of the bluen__label__0 i feel this so muchn__label__0 how are you doing now with your solitary existencen__label__0 yes there are even email addresses and phone numbers that cause me crazy anxiety when i see them pop upn__label__0 in hindsight though and with some insight into myself they were right i wouldve likely denied it and it may well have completed the act later i still struggle with the thoughtsn__label__0 mostly ok with it i get anxiety over social interaction when its necessary or forced my life went off the rails before i was diagnosed so i have this constant fear of change or repeating mistakes and losing control of my life again ive gone to great lengths to simply my life now and the peace is prefereable to the chaos anger and self sabotage can also continue unmedicated there is underlying depression ofc that makes me feel unworthy of relationships but its also self preserving considering how turbulent they have been for me slight disinterest in conventional life goals but no longer determined to end itn__label__0 come to think of it every time my phone rings usually telemarketing it makes me uncomfortable intense fear of losing control of my life again one interaction at a time seems things can spiral out of control fast no news is good news i think it can be improved over time but you have to do it at your own speed at the same time the longer you avoid it the harder it can be but i think concentrating on improving yourself in ways that you can handle it makes change slightly easiern__label__0 thank you of sharing i hope things keep getting better for youn__label__0 your brain is completely being silly and goofy your goal needs to be to learn how to catch it doing that so those silly and goofy thinking doesnt lead to consequences that affect your life in negative waysn__label__6 your experience is to a t what i felt at first almost word for word lol it took me a few months of spiraling postdiagnosis to actually come to terms with it once i was like oh damn this is for real i enrolled myself in therapy and got on the right medication like you did youre doing great definitely on the right track if youre interested in how i got diagnosed and what helps and doesnt ill add it below i was diagnosed with bipolar type for years never felt like i fit that criteria just right though then i looked into bpd i think the media is evil in portraying bpd because of the stereotype i never cared to look into what it actually entails but when i did woooof it hit close to home more like a tornado blew through my house if you will lol anyway talked to my therapist about it id been seeing her for a couple years so i trusted her to give it to me straight she absolutely did she said she wasnt ready to tell me that i fit the criteria because she was scared i would fixate and spiral on it which i absolutely did once she told me lol went to my psych he insisted it was bp type still but did suggest to go to php to be monitored did php and they confirmed the bpd diagnosis they did keep the bp diagnosis but changed it to type which made more sense to me i mean i took it seriously but i was in absolute limbo for a year about it i only took it seriously about years ago and decided to be proactive about it damn glad i did i dont know whered id be if i didnt go through treatment and get on the right medsn__label__0 tbh it just fit everything in my life thus far up to that point and still fit everything after it lmao i couldnt stop thinking about old relationships and how shitty they ended up how many people id just obliterated out of my life for no reason how many people id come to believe were evil until reflection years later and realizing they honestly didnt do more than that one thing that made me hate them completely how many crazy things i did impulsively that just didnt make any sense in hindsight at all theres one moment years prediagnosis that still haunts me i remember this guy i was seeing broke things off and he was very nice about it i tried to be calm but my efforts didnt last long i went scorched earth fury on him cant remember what i said but it was bad i just know it was bad and i remember one text he sent out of several that said youre fucking crazy and it made me see ten thousand more shades of red it made me feel like i had no choice but to opt out im lucky my brother was with me he talked me down and stayed with me until i was calmer but anyway yeah stuff like that just kept popping up in my memory like hey so why didnt you realize that wasnt normal i had other diagnoses already so i guess i just figured it was something arising out of those i wasnt educated enough to realize it had to be something else back thenn__label__0 feel like my comment was long enough but i do have things that help and dont help toon__label__0 this post has been marked as a venting post please be aware that the op may not be seeking advice ulateniteredditor if you do not

or concernsn__label__0 hard relate it takes me a very very long time to stop feeling heartache over people i once loved but had to move on fromdistraction helps keeping busy and meeting new people helps but then i might hear a song or have a moment of silence when that chest pain of missing someone in particular comes back to haunt men__label__0 im dealing with the exact same thing right now and its very onoff either i have brain fog to a point where i can barely thinkstudy or im experiencing some of the worst pain of my life literally anything i do is a trigger and its such a pain in the ass if i study i get stressed and think about her if i so much as see her name i think about her im planning on asking my doctor for a mood stabilizer soon or something because holy shitn__label__0 yeah i remember freaking out about the prospect of moving away and losing my friends and everyone around me being like whats the issue youre gonna find new friends and i was like no you dont get it thats not how it works for men__label__0 i feel like i could have written this hugsn__label__0 op do you feel more lonely when youre around people you care aboutn__label__0 i feel this i tend to push people away and burn bridges and feel absolutely shuttered with guilt and shame that i lost themn__label__0 it is a very hard thing to deal with for me it helps understanding it logically to better work on what i consider a puzzle some emotionspuzzles are easier to solve seeing what goes where almost instantly and then others it feels like are million piece puzzles and give me no indication of where to start go or whether to stay in my current position i know you said that you see professionals as do i have you brought what you said up about the weed to them and how it doesnt fix the feeling and what that is it took me many sessions of back and forth questioning to start to understand that there was more to it than i was aware and the only way we turned onto that road was discussing situations where i just didnt have the answer and some of the questions they would ask i would say i dont know or it makes me feel shitty but then through more prodding on their end we were able to find a opening to get through where more made sense so i could ask better questionsn__label__0 i fully relate to everything you said in this post im and currently going through this exactly the feeling in your chest you talk about like it wants to implode can become absolutely unbearable as horrible as it can feel sometimes personally i try to remember it so i can use it use it to remind myself that i dont want to feel this anymore remind myself that i dont want people and relationships falling out of my life motivation to put more into my friendships and relationships and to put more into myself so i can be better for those relationshipsn__label__0 i totally relate to this i feel like nothing will ever be like it was before like ive missed a onetime opportunity in my lifen__label__0 my bpd isnt confirmed but my doctor told me its a possibility everything you wrote feels so relatable its so hard to deal with missing people when they arent even in my life anymore its been years and i still think about old friends and it hurts a lot no one would understand it others could move on easiern__label__0 gifgiphyqyvswlqviemcoamn__label__0 i legit am trying to disconnect from caring about people at this point if thats even possiblen__label__0 i totally understand i have copying mechanisms i actively use but nothing makes it feel better than weed makes me feel like i can actually process everything better than just being so weighed down by my intense emotions i try not to think of him and im almost good at it but when i do think of him it just drags me down this hole my whole body feels like its tense and restless and aching i feel like im physically holding myself back from just being sucked into despair it feels like hes still holding my heart in his hand even though i can admit i dont want to go back to him i feel like i cant stop myself from needing to just to feel better in those moments weed is a crutch life is really hard and sometimes i like the edges dulled a littlen__label__1 people come and go in everyones lives so what makes you feel that way with the ones who left it is the way they treated you or you to themmy ex gf a person wbpd sent me an apology letter long after our breakup in that letter she expressed the pain of not having me in her life thats why your post resonates with mebut her pain as honest as it could be is a consequence of her own actions in this case cheating on me emotional abuse constantly lyingso its important to think where the pain comes from and the accountability on our partn__label__0 im currently trying to figure the same thing out how to get over people ive loved and its hard for me alson__label__0 been a year since my best friend broke up with me and the pain hasnt gone i miss her every single day and theres nothing i wouldnt do to have her back in my lifen__label__0 hugs to you i know youre getting help but is it specific to bpd ive seen some other sites here where folks talk about different breathing exercises cold water etc i dont have bpd but the person i love and always will i miss everyday even over years ive healed in counseling and its taken along time ultimately if you care or love someone you really want them to be happy think of things youre grateful for and to replace someone not in your life everyone bpd or not all want love and care the best way is to care for yourself right now if you dont love yourself you cant be there to love someone else and they cant love you enough to fill that voidn__label__0 you need to find someone new to obsess about and put on a pedestal its the only thing thats worked for me in the past and i am now actively seeking that person now lolhonestly though i feel your pain between my interpersonal relps or anger or introvertness the pain of missing someone is the worst like i just need to wrap myself in a blanket and reassure myself that everything will be okayn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 i truly havent got a clue working on that appreciate your commentn__label__0 thats definitely believable i once had a friendship breakup that was so distressing to me that it felt like i couldnt breathe though it was just a temporary feelingwith that being said you should never stay in a relationship that doesnt work for you only because the other person will be hurt by the breakupif you cant be happy with her and if shes not working on understandinghealing her personality disorders then you have a responsibility towards yourself to walk awayn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 i wish you all the bestn__label__0 hey op it may be helpful to look into emotional permanence unfortunately it is a common experience for us to really struggle with knowing that our partners still deeply care about us when they arent there by our side giving us that reassurance my partner could give me reassurance that he loves me minutes prior but some sort of minor trigger pulls me out of it like wait does he really love men__label__0 thank youn__label__1 do you mind me asking what they prescribed you just trying to see what others are being given in comparison to myself which would be an snri an antihypertensive for some of the physical symptoms an anticonvulsant at a low dose for a mood stabilizer and adderall for my adhdn__label__0 lithosun and franxit i got these twon__label__4 this is pretty normal for most mood stabilizers antipsychotics and antidepressants its your body adjusting to the medication you should speak to your doctor about feeling suicidal though you might need to try a different medication or be put on a smaller dosen__label__1 im like really aggressive when i go on anti depressants so now i get really aggressive when a psychiatrist suggests for me to implement an anti depressant in my meds if this change in mood happened after you started taking it immediately contact your psychiatrist and let them know whats going on i would say to stop taking it also because it sounds like its doing more harm than goodn__label__0 laminator didnt do anything for me it was like i hadnt taken anythingn__label__2 definitely speak to your doctor about adjustingchanging your medication different antidepressants work on different people you ideally will just feel at a baseline for a few weeks before seeing any changesn__label__0 remember its constantly two steps forward one step back to successn__label__0 this congratulations on taking good care of yourselfn__label__1 hi there im diagnosed with bpd too and some other disorders i just want to ask you will you be taking therapy will you be on medication or bothn__label__2 hello im in therapy and see a nurse practitioner for meds im taking lexapro mg rn because my anxiety is so bad but im still kinda experimenting to see what works for men__label__2 oh i think ive been on lexapro in the past but ive changed my doctor like times since they werent working for me but the meds which i am rn are goodn__label__1 what are you on now its my first go of lexapro i felt icky last night after bumping my dose up to mgn__label__0 im on like medicines rnolanzapine zolfresh mg flunil mg zapiz there was a time when i used to be on like medicines a day but ive been seeing my new doctor since december last year and ive been feeling bettern__label__0 deletedn__label__0 ill screenshot this and add to my notes thank you please hang on i need more answers it was a wrong turn yesterday and my thoughts are all over the place im not aware that i should have passed through it but the problem is the minute i woke up my thoughts is never going away it will just go if i explode it on my boyfriend i tried meditation but its not consistent i need a punching bag or some sensation like biting my tongue or scratching my ears to keep my thoughts away and focus on my day sometimes my boyfriend is my trigger because he isnt bothered in life he is chill and focused his life is organized i want to mirror him but i need to know how to help myself firstn__label__1 ive been worried about it before but man they work so well im willing to take any risk that comes with them which honestly there doesnt seem to be any major riskbut if you do want to try easing off meds some day or cutting certain ones out im sure your doctorpsychiatrist would help you figure it out bat least any decent one wouldn__label__1 im a million times worse unmedicated so not really worried about the medsn__label__2 i wonder what meds i should be on i was put on antidepressants and antianxiety meds but a lot of people of this forum seem to be on mood stabilisers my meds make me feel super flat i hate itn__label__1 i can relate i take different kinds of meds for my bpd every night and two different anxiety meds as needed id really prefer not to take so many but everytime i feel like things are going well and maybe i dont need them i remember that i feel this way bc of the meds lol if youre concerned about it tell your psych dr and you can work together to find the right combo or decrease some of them you can always go back to the dosage you were on or try something new entirely if it doesnt work out or fuck it raw dog life without meds at all im going to ask my doc to taper me off lithium bc of the long term damage it can don__label__0 yeah sometimes but then i remember how wildly unstable and unhealthy i was before i started taking them and feel a fresh wave of gratitude lmaoback in winter of i used to spend upwards of hours per day just bawling until i threw up and then bawling some more now i have my life back thats worth the pricen__label__2 yep at one point i was taking one of them had death listed as side effects one was so toxic that i had to get a checkup every month to be sure they hadnt damaged my organs yet neither of them were particularly helpful that one lsd trip i had once helped me quit all of those meds except the sleeping pills my life has been monumentally better in the year since i chucked them in the trash where they belongn__label__1 the same i went from raw dawging it completely to being on anti depressants anxiety meds and a mood stabilizer i almost have imposter syndrome about the whole thing and convince myself ill be fine getting off the meds but like you said if i miss a day im way out of wackn__label__3 i just recently went through medication induced psychosis my md had me on medications since then ive gotten a new psychiatrist and ive been taken off a lot of those meds im still recovering from that episode thoughn__label__6 i fear i should be on medication for these things namely anxiety and depression but the last time i took an antidepressant it messed me up so bad i tried to unalive myself so i selfmedicated instead with marijuana which also messed me up after a while in different ways so like i guess no meds for me but rawdogging life sucks too so there isnt really a win herebut as someone in holistic healthcare i try to advocate for as little medication as needed depending on the diagnosis since intrinsic work should be done first im not a fan of just giving people medication right off the bat due to possible addiction needing to rely on it for possibly their entire life and the longterm effects of someits tough because the pharmaceutical industry hospital funding and society pressures doctors into prescribing medication in a survey on the national institutes of health government page it was reported that of doctors prescribed medication to avoid negative impact on the joint commission and to avoid decreased patient satisfaction scores basically to be reimbursed for their services its better to prescribe more so im a bit apprehensive to go on medications a good rule of thumb is to never trust a therapist that willingly prescribes medication after the first sessionand yes medication can cause some serious withdrawals just like any other drug but that doesnt mean you cant power through it i have no advice really and i probably didnt give what you may have been looking for but these are some facts that push me away from medication in generaln__label__3 theres no med that will target every or most symptoms of bpd mood stabilizers havent helped but an antipsychotic helps my dissociation adhd meds help that but besides those nothing has helped its always worth a try as long as you have the supervision of a good doctor and you watch out for side effects especially if you have comorbid disorders like mdd or gadn__label__1 sometimes i feel like meds are keeping me dependent on them for the rest of my life but they do help im mainly taking mood stabilisers i would love to be normal and unmedicated but these are just some of things we have to do to take care of ourselvesn__label__1 i have really bad adhd so i told my doc i need just one kind of pill so i take of my med every day there was a time i was taking different kinds and i told my doc i was worried about taking multiple meds and he understood and found something else for men__label__3 i dunno im off anti depressants and anxiety meds but ive been on a lot before and yeah i definitely worried until i was diagnosed from age ive been on every antidepressant ever made i should get a medal or something anyway yeah med resistant depression ftw then i developed epilepsy at and was put on an ever increasing dose of a mood stabilizer that also prevents seizures ive been seizure free for a few years now thanks to that med but holy shit if that medication is helping stabilize my mood i dont even want to know what im like without it ive still been hospitalized from selfharm attempts psychosis ive been in one toxic relationship after another insane mood swings pretty much every symptoms is still very much alive and well within me that being said im in some intense therapy and i think thats what will help me the most its possible i really need the therapy and the mood stabilizer to really feel a differenceedit just to add that its mdd and gad just to be more specificn__label__4 i was put on effexor venlafaxine for my antidepressant meds and i just started them back up again feel like im tripping balls and trying not to throw up the whole time i have to make sure i eat or i will throw up i go to talk to my doctor about it soon but god damn why does this happpennnn__label__1 i am on no meds at all coz the fear of becoming reliant is huge for me and how damaging they are on organs and my brain fucks with me i do everything in my power to do things as natural as possible my persona is a a spiritual hippy galn__label__0 this is how i feel the fear is unfounded theres pharmacies everywhere and it wouldnt really be medicine if the downsides were worse than the benefits that being said medicine is not effective for everyone and i only have the perspective of it being really effectiven__label__2 im also on mood stabilizers and i think they help a good bit but yeah i do wonder a lot how id feelbe if i wasnt on all these meds i just cant make that step thon__label__1 im on different anti depressants and a mood stabilizer one of the anti depressants is taken with propranolol for migraine prevention im on a shot for migraines too i hate taking the meds but i have to for my familyn__label__1 ive wanted to try lithium forever now but i have hep c and its too hard on the liver depekote works for me but i cant take that either for the same reason ive been on lamictal forever now but have had multiple episodes on it but they say its bc of the ssris so i stopped my welbutrin today reluctantly bc ive been having paranoia i do not suggest raw dogging life bc then it will raw dog youn__label__0 i envy you ive took phychedelics hundreds of times and it never cured my bipolarn__label__0 i feel thisn__label__0 oh dang that sounds scary im glad youre off a lot of themn__label__2 same congentin was the one that did it for me phychosis is terrifying i just did days in a mental treatment center bc of it i had one more while i was in there butidfk i refuse to believe its natural has to be from some kinda medn__label__1 no no this actually helps thank you i got a new psychiatrist a year ago after rehab ive noticed she is super willing to prescribe me meds based on anything i say which i kinda dont like but finding a new psychiatrist isnt fun either i just wish i knew the secret med formula for whats actually best for men__label__2 i have some quetiapine from my psych ward trip which they put me on due to psychosis but i should probably have a doctor check over my meds before i switch things up i do wonder about long term effects on the brainn__label__3 yeah thats the serious downfall with lithium i have to get blood tests to make sure my levels are okay ive also had plenty of episodes and ive been on my meds for years now unfortunately the meds only have the ability to soothe the demons not take them away thats a bummer i really like wellbutrin although its not an ssri its a ndri so maybe an ssri would help either way i hope you can find a combo that works for youn__label__0 i did lsd many times before and it hasnt cured anything but it sure provided me with some much needed perspective about the world and my role on itn__label__2 i totally understand its very tough to navigate because while the doctorstherapists may care about you the industry doesnt and of course we want to fully trust all medical professionals but its good to get a second opinion as well though more expensive unfortunately definitely a huge barrier when i was prescribed antidepressants way back when all i had to do was go to a regular family doctor not even a therapist fill out forms about my levels of anxietydepression and boom i was prescribed that day its very interesting to look back on and know why tf they can do that and of course i was so desperate for a solution that i didnt look anywhere else it was the easy way to me but nothing is ever as easy as it seemsdont give up i would definitely recommend trying out a new psychiatrist it sucks and they are hard to find especially now with the long waitlists after the pandemic and the us mental health epidemic were currently facing but i would strongly recommend trying good luckn__label__0 wow i just typed like paragraphs and none of them postededit anyways i was just saying that i meant to say were stopping the welbutrin bc it inhibits the reputable of dopamine and that could be causing the paranoia i said many other things too butn__label__0 i love your usernamen__label__2 cured wasnt the right word i think i used it bc i envy you but phychs helped play a role in me accepting myself as the addict i was i felt like i was just meant to do drugsn__label__0 thank you haha its how i feel a lot of the time smiling through the pain ahhh okay i gotcha sorry hope i didnt come off a knowitall or something loln__label__0 idk i think no one is meant for anything or anyone in particular to quote the great david firth but really youre just

download the tapping solution app for now and use the free meditations it will take more than one it seems silly but it literally regulates your nervous system this will passn__label__0 very common actually i opened this post looking for more answers because i still think im faking it i literally stopped taking my medicine a month ago because it was stopping most of my bpd symptoms and i wanted to see if they would come back or i was fakingive seen glimpses of them but im more stable than i have been for a bit just waiting for something badn__label__1 honestly yes all the time i will contemplate this question i dont know why for me cause i dont tale medication but then ill come to terms with it because of a diagnostic and it truly makes sense bpd is very strange and a mystery to me i wouldnt be surprised if this is relatable to more peoplen__label__0 hi now i see im not the only one but are you sure about leaving the medicine wouldnt like anything bad happen to youn__label__0 it is indeed thanks for answeringn__label__0 seems fine for now if symptoms start getting worse again ill start using them once moren__label__5 i would advise getting into outpatient treatment if it feels like your substance abuse is severe enough if not i would recommend at least talking to a professional therapist doctor whatever you feel comfortable with so maybe you can trade out the benzos for something more appropriate or you can just say fuck the meds altogether and gain the skillstools you need to manage your bpd i say this as someone who is currently in recovery from opioids im only a few weeks clean and am using suboxone to get off opioids im also intensive outpatient treatment hours a week of group treatment and its a lot of struggle pain and effort i have to endure all because i chose to self medicate so i didnt have to feel the feels associated with bpd i wouldnt wish this process on my worst enemy so i hope you find a better way to cope before you get to the stage i am at its truly not worth itgood luck youre not alonen__label__0 tysm for letting me know a little bit about your own experience it really does make me feel like im not alone good luck for you too remember

live without therapy like humans have been doing for thousands of years just because therapy and mental health recognition is a newer movementthing does not mean that it is not helpful for you that is a very silly point to make humans also died prematurely for thousands of years before doctors from colds and the flu we found ways to treat it properly but since the dawn of time didnt come with that treatment it shouldnt be used people have been fighting off illnesses for thousands of years without it see how silly that sounds mental health is the same way it is a part of your overall health and it should be treated and therapy is a way of treating it just like medicine treats a cold another note therapy has become more normalized as depression and anxiety become more common we havent had this extent of therapy forever because we havent always been in the position with mental health that we are in now just from to depression diagnosis increased over link and covid pandemic alone increased anxiety cases by link mental health issues are becoming more and more of a common issue and it just wasnt recognized before seeking therapy is not weak it is responsible you are treating your health it is a very common issue that needs to be treatedif he still thinks its a scam practice that is on him but many people need these services and therapists have to do lots of school to understand humans and to help treat us they are professionals that is not to say they are all perfect but generally it is something people will benefit from sorry if this seemed like a very long ramble it probably didnt make much sense but i just kind of wanted to share my thoughts therapy has saved lives and i have a very positive experience with itn__label__1 therapy and meds are the reason

questions or concernsn__label__4 listen im in the exact same situation omg its horribleive been in a treatment center since january and also fp free since then making good progress and doing my therapy a couple weeks ago i decide to try dating around nothing serious its going good just casual dates and then i meet someone last week and it leads to us talking non stop all day everyday we go on a date it goes great and bam im obsessed but after the date she started to become distant and i immediately think its my fault and i stop eating for days and cant function because im mirroring her mood ive been making so much progress in dbt skills and it feels like i threw it all away in days now i have all these thoughts that i did something or she doesnt like me or just its all fucked up and now i cant function and i know my therapist would say it was just one date it happens but i cant let it go im spiraling so i really do get and what youre going through if you ever need to talk im heren__label__0 after i read the notification from this post i got a notification from a really motivating app saying stop letting people who do so little for you control so much of your mind and feelings i know its hard but youll get there sending loven__label__0 haha shit man live really hates us really thought i was alone in this helln__label__0 this scares me too i feel like being in relationships as someone with bpd is just hellprogress is so slow and hard and when your emotions are thrown into the mix its like you lose controli have no advice just that i understandn__label__0 yuuuup ive been fp free for over a couple months and i hope to stay like that and this post is whyn__label__0 whats an fpn__label__0 thats like me you described theren__label__0 god damn favourite person syndrome is the absolute worst isnt itn__label__0 im very energy sensitive and struggle with this nonetheless im always worried that im a burden im not meeting his needs that im causing him to lose time doing something he wants needs to be doing if i do something that can be a team effort take cleaning out the garage for exthe way weve coped with this was by having some hardcore truth talks now naturalllyyyyy i have a real hard time believing his reassurances havent figured out how to get past that one or the energy sensitivity i have with himif it isnt clear i mean like i can easily too easily pick up on his mood and physical feelings such as feeling unmotivated or sleepy i then feel guilty for feeling the opposing and slip right there with him i know this has something to do with having a pos father and just making life easier by not being in a good or productive mood just for it to be brought down abruptly and painfullyits rough homie its seriously rough out here weve gotta learn ourselves and grow its all we can don__label__0 i cried all day and got really depressed because my fp didnt send me a kiss after a sentence so i thought he hated and would abandon me soon its okay to overthink and most of the time its never the case it turned out he was just busyn__label__0 i had to give up on relationships altogether because it was the only way i was able to regulate my emotions its sad but its still an improvement over having zero control over my emotional life and just having to live with the consequences we all do what we have to to stay afloat i guessn__label__0 i do such much better when i am fpfreen__label__0 im so scared of caring about someone because of this it happened with my ex such a nightmare and exhausting like you said is there a way to really love someone or really care without them turning into fpn__label__1 ive found myself in similar situations but as ive learned to cope ive developed a more cynical attitude perhaps it may be an extreme but being a balanced cynic may help when you meet someone immediately have expectations no matter how great they are until theyve proven youre worth their time view them as just like the rest no matter how much you want them to be that does not mean treat them like shit or you dont want them around lol just give them a piece of you then let them give you a piece of them if they dont then yk where they stand message for plans and if theyre busy see if they offer to reschedule if they dont every time you know where you stand message them first a few times then stop and see if they message you first if they dont you know where they standits really hard but the key is not to fixate one one person having hobbies and working making money can only go so far when youre alone you can also try making connections on reddit there are some friendship reddits where you can meet friends you can try using people to occupy your time yet keep your distance while still having fun i know that sounds manipulative but when people dont show they care its easy to just have fun then bounce most importantly pay close attention to the people that do message you randomly thats huge for people like us but its only huge when we dont fixate on trying to find or keep a specific person because we want to challenge and prove to ourselves we can earn their validation earning validation should be a challenge that leaves us exhausted it should be smooth sailing and easy and fun and exciting if someone doesnt make you feel that way maybe its time to let them goive been through this plenty of times and after detoxing from my fps who are toxic i can focus on people that really care so i hope this helps and good luck to both of youn__label__0 we are here with youn__label__0 yeah having a fp is terrifying its been over a year of me without a fp and even though its been a lot more peaceful it gets so lonelyn__label__0 favorite person you can read about it heren__label__0 favourite person this is my fave article describing itn__label__0 i was wondering the same thingbecause i am so lostn__label__0 omg i hate it so muchn__label__0 great article thank youn__label__0 awesome so helpfuln__label__0 its the only medicine that has worked for me but if i miss a pill its definitely feltn__label__2 have you ever been tested for what medication works well with your body there is a blood test that they can do to determine which medications to go towards and which do more harmn__label__0 it works pretty well on me at leastn__label__0 almost weeks on it still waiting for the good stuff ive read that it has helped so many people so hoping it helps us toon__label__0 i was having a hard time by afternoon so i switched to two a day morning and afternoon and it was really good for me probably the most stable ive ever felt with my moodsn__label__0 yeah she says it lasts hours so take it every morningn__label__1 i wish i had the money for that i can barely afford seeing a therapist and psyche regularly tho i really do trust her but i agree that would be a lot easiern__label__0 no ive for real felt less depressed and more motivated lately im finding its helping a bit but i could use an up on dosage im only on mg these pills are tiny but when i see mt doctor next we will move up for now im pleasantly surprisedn__label__1 i would also be offended if my therapist blocked me but just remember that even therapist have their own lives and hardships maybe your therapist is really stressed out maybe they are dealing with a death or an addiction or their own mental illness maybe they are escaping a crazy ex or an obsessed client who knows but its unfair to yourself to jump to conclusions and believe that it is because of youn__label__1 yes just remember therapists are people too some of them are not equipped to deal with us no matter how polite and friendly we are it doesnt reflect on you or themn__label__1 honestly this happened to me once granted i slept through an appt but when i reached out apologizing and offering to pay for the session she never responded i was also very shocked because it was by no means a regular occurrence i still to this day have no idea but honestly i would just chalk it up to it being their issue we cant know what happened as others have said therapists have their own iives and problems etc so i guess we just have to remember if we genuinely didnt do anything crazy its probably not us i do thing they should be more professional though lol its pretty devastating for someone like us especially because of our fear of abandonment and rejection jayzusn__label__1 im sorry this happened and im wondering if this could be something on the therapists end and not yours at all you mentioned you hadnt been seeing them so maybe something in their life changed that they are not currently seeing clients maybe it is truly something wrong with their phone maybe they got a new phone or are traveling to a different country in which case they wouldnt be able to use imessage perhaps instead you could email them to ask whether or not they can see you again emails can generate automated responses if they are indeed taking time off or vacation or something even if it doesnt it allows them to read it and respond hopefully in a professional when they have a chanceblocking a past client with no conversation or notice or previous talk of boundaries is highly unprofessional and plain hurtful i hope there is another explanation to this which there very well could be but i understand how disheartening and upsetting it feels in the momentn__label__2 imessage doesnt turn green when youre blocked it just doesnt go through so you wont see a send receipt they could have changed their numbers recently try emailing them without accusation or reactionary anticipation and ask them if you can book a sessionalso bear in mind that borderlines are one of the causes of therapist burnout as were very difficult to treat without absolute commitment if they dont respond to you which sucks i agree they may just be burnt theyre humans toon__label__1 a lot of therapists have a god complex if a case is challenging it invalidates their complex and they can get defensiven__label__0 if i saw you on the street i would ask you outn__label__0 i missed my appointment because i got admitted in a psych ward last year lmaon__label__1 yeah i cant count how many have told me i was lucky to see them because most wont even take someone with bpd as a patient its mind boggling how these professionals think hard to treat means not worth trying like thanks dr just one more thing to cause anxiety good work see you next weekn__label__0 as someone who has met a lot of them and has also been a psy student in uni i can tell you one thing a lot of them are as damaged as we are it is rare to find a truly good onen__label__0 this post has been marked as a venting post please be aware that the op may not be seeking advice ubidjadq if you do

questions or concernsn__label__0 not easy we move from unhealthy crutches to different unhealthy crutches finding healthy ones is tough and something we all have to work on wishing you the bestn__label__2 the treatment was not to drink medicine and go to the doctor but rather to give up what was harming usthank you for your wordsn__label__0 anecdotal opinion of people have no idea what it is or have never heard of it people know what bipolar or schizophrenia is even if only from movies but dont know what bpd is it isnt worth telling anyone i would even strongly hesitate to tell a significant other if they dont already know because it places stigma or bias even if they claim it doesnt ive unfortunately formed this opinion over years of having moderately severe bpd because anyone ive ever told has ceased being in my life shortly after being told and please never tell coworkers or your boss ever ive only told a handful of people and regretted it each time the first broke up with me that night the next in a few weeks and the last one just started to act weird and call me mentally ill on regular basis that relationship never progressed into anything but it gave them ammunition to chalk everything up to you are mentally ill therefore im always right and you are wrong one of the worst things about bpd is that we tend to want to overshare but id refrain at all costsn__label__0 most people either dont know what it is or invalidate the disorder telling me i dont seem to have a personality disorder nobody ever believes me im very high functioning and self aware which leads to people often telling me i could never have this disorder it actually sucks i would prefer them not knowing about it then to invalidate my experiencesn__label__0 in my experience most people dont even know what it isso far as health care professionals even they even comment its to remark how calm i amto be honest the only people that try to use my bpd against me are other people with bpdn__label__0 a withdrawal of any form of emotional support and connection from within the mental health service i work in just in case im manipulating themive been told to try and be happy move on and get over it everyone has a bit of bpd in them and others have it worsemy personal favourite invalidation my initial enthusiasm for any understanding from the significant people in my life died a fiery death muggles cannot comprehend a lack of emotional permanence and i never wasted my time trying to explain itthere isnt any incentive to share my diagnosis and the complexities of it are an unfair burden upon those we want to understand it i keep my diagnosis to myself these days funny thatn__label__0 hi there in my experience there are generally three ways people react when i say them i have bpd other than the fact that many dont even know what bpd is where i live the first reaction is the most common one people dont really care because in general they dont care much about you so nothingthe second reaction is that people are greatly supportive and stay closer to you in order to reassure you and wanting to really help you through your problemsthe third reaction is when someone looks at you in totally the opposite way than the second they see you as a threat as an enemy as someone manipulative and that wants only to care about himself that is we know it absolutely untrue so yes thats what i saw in general if you have more precise question just ask im going to answer surelyn__label__0 deletedn__label__2 they usually have preconceived notions that it just means youre crazy they have no idea what the symptoms are what the causes are treatment etc they usually let me explain what it is and are pretty nice about it though telling a romantic prospect though i have not gotten good results from a lot of ghostingn__label__0 my reactions from significant others has been mixed the good ones try to be as supportive as possible and do their research and communicate better the bad ones use it against you during fights or as a way to invalidate or discredit you friends acquaintances and family all pretty much brush it under the rug ive never had a big circle so telling people hasnt affected much for me ive seen a lot of people discourage people from sharing but i dont see the point in any relationship where i cant be open about it especially considering how hard they are to maintain to begin withn__label__0 the reaction that still makes me laugh so hard i cry whenever i think about itohso like a psychopath you cant experience emotionbahahaha as ifn__label__0 if they prejudice about the mental illness they prejudice about everything else in my opinionn__label__2 most of my friends dont know what it is so it didnt really matter in all honesty i wish that someone in my life would just google it so they can understand but theyre completely just ignorant they dont understand that its a real disorder and explains a lot of my behaviors they think thats just me and that it cant be helped my grandmother however did google it not in attempt to understand but more to judge for herself and told me that i cant possibly have that coming from the woman who i see like three times a year from medical professionals ive had most of them say they cant treat me and told me to go to inpatient because im too high risk for anyone to treat thats bs though because im no where near as high risk as other ppl w bpd that ive met not saying that theyre worse than me and dont deserve treatment because of it or anything im just saying im not really as actively suicidal and they knew that so i dont really understand the big refusal it wasnt until i sought out someone who specializes in bpd that i was treated normally i told them from the beginning im borderline and they said dont worry about that i have many borderline patients and things have been fine with them sincen__label__0 honestly if i ever say bpd people immediately go oh yeah bipolar and then i correct and go actually its called borderline personality disorder and honestly most people dont know what it isthat said my opinion here is going to be a little different from the majority ive actually had really positive experiences with telling people one of my good friends admitted recently that he did research on it to learn more about it and honestly that was really touching because i never expect anyone to really care that much i willll say its better to tell people when youre feeling super level and normal and not acting crazy explaining from a place of calm is something people can relate to on some level explaining that perceived abandonment triggers a morehurtfulthannormal response is honestly something people have probably felt themselves at least once in their lives for me its a convenient way to bundle depression eating disorder intense fear of abandonment rejection sensitivity impulsebased issues substance abuse reckless sexual behavior excessive partying living the fuck it mentality adrenaline junkie shit and anger into a tidy little package sometimes i mention that it falls into similar behavior patterns to adhd and thats a helpful and lessdemonizing frame of reference because everyone is a little adhd according to themtldr read the room before you say anything tell people you want to tellnot that you feel compelled to do it in a way thats safe and with people you trust and always explain coming from a place of calm not triggeredness itll help you a lot in the long runn__label__0 to never disclosing that you have bpd at work when you are struggling you have anxiety and depression the stigma is real and whether its in your own head and some what of a self fulfilling prophecy or on their part by and large it will not end well you are putting a giant target on your back that will be blamed and used whenever you fall short as well as by manipulative associates who can use this to throw you under the bus and advance at a faster raten__label__0 most people dont know what it is and the people who do know what it is think im faking it because of tiktok or other social medias influence they think im faking it to have an excuse to be crazy and manipulative or to be quirky i guess i wish i was just faking it lmaon__label__0 for me they usually call me something like a yandere or call me crazy or say im faking it since young ive known ive had it for a while because my father also has bpd and we have a lot of similar behaviours because of our abandonment issuesn__label__0 im so sorryn__label__0 you seem so normal if they even know what it isn__label__2 ive gotten one of two responses they have no idea what it even is and they call me a narcissist and title me a bad person neither bother me as i know who i am and i know what i do and dont have control of medical wise idk how many of my medical records show it but i have my diagnosis paperwork so idk how it works but i know when my family had this incidentsomeone broke into one of my grandmas property to cook meth and the house exploded and i had to sit out at this fire inhaling fumes for hours and due to the chemicals i had started hallucinating and was in allot of physical pain but was dismissed due to my past hallucinations from my mental illnessesthey never even did a drug test on me and my hallucinations are maybe once every months to a year now and are very under control and the hallucinations felt more like a acid trip im sorry if this isnt comforting but we get treated poorly sometimes by medical professionals and thats just life i guess sometimes during freak accidents we are ignored and looked over due to our issuesn__label__0 some were great some were uncomfortable some used it against me latern__label__0 most people in my life are unaware of my diagnosis but often question my hospitalisations when i mention or describe my symptoms people say oh so like depression oh yeah anxiety ive got that or my favourite oh mate i must have that im stressed all the time my managers have had to be made aware due to missing work often they have been supportive for the most part but i think its person dependantn__label__0 thank you for your reply it looks like youve earned your complaining no longer entitledn__label__0 holy shit all points noted thanks for your input to my questionsn__label__0 you my fellow warrior have hit the nail on the head and then some i too am high functioning if i am honest its more about how good i have become at necessary deception i present as well read and i have done my due diligence with regards to my own mental health its not the symptoms of this disorder i cannot identify its the inevitable pull of the crash that you can see coming from miles away and that crash you have warned and explained to every person you meet in absolute horrifying detail leaving nothing out being an open book still those you have trusted along the path with this precious information even handing over bits of that wreck to those special to you anyway you deem trustworthy and understanding you merrily go along your way only to turn back and see that those very people are gawking at that wreckage laughing or confused or angry the worst are the ones you can see the disappointment radiating off of now you are left alone to ponder what the heck changed you explained what your navigation skills where like you told them there were chunks of your past scattered and bits of who you are disembodied and strewn like road kill in places you had no idea you even stopped your explaination and their understanding held out until reality bit and all you have leftis the taste of the dust left from the speedy getaway you knew was coming yet that abandonment and self loathing you feel will never change no matter how many people you told and no matter how many i love you i will never leave yous have been uttered over the course of your ill fated sojourn on the fed up highway you navigate in total darknessn__label__0 this being self aware seems to make even medical professionals doubt your feelings i cant possibly be mentally ill because i can clearly describe my patterns and feelingsn__label__0 before getting diagnosed a couple people close to me thought i had bipolar and honestly i had a suspicion too but wasnt sure because my highs and lows werent sustained for the duration that bipolar sufferers experiencenow i like to think of the mood issue side of things as bipolar on speed but yeah bpd does not equal bipolarn__label__0 thank you for sharing your experience you made some good pointsn__label__0 yikes thank you for sharingn__label__0 im genuinely curious what would be an appropriate response to hearing that someone has bpd im very new here trying to figure out how to navigate responses diagnosiss doctors etc thank youn__label__0 thank you for sharingn__label__0 honestly asking how you can help and assuring us that we didnt fuck up by telling youn__label__1 im sorry if it was allot and that none of it was positive but i was diagnosed at rare but cause of severity it happens and ive had to deal with allot and have even been bullied by impatient facility workers for being a narcissist which im not in my opinion and i feels its just best to honest you have no control of what mental illnesses u have but dont stress ur self anything is treatable if u try always take time to recognize our toxic traits and trying to fix them if you ever need anyone to talk to feel free to reach outn__label__0 its all good i appreciate hearing everyones different experiencesn__label__0 im also from like a hick area very bigoted area so my expierence may not even be near urs and i hope its not i wish you the bestn__label__1 i started taking lamotrigine a couple months ago the first four weeks were really rough i felt like i was going crazy but once i worked up till like mg it was a godsend i would go from probably to intense mood swings daily from feeling positive to wanting to die and i would be lucky if i had a couple days where i felt okay in decent now that im on i maybe have like for a week but it doesnt even get to the suicidal part not even close i still feel that over attachment and abandonment issues but overall for me on the mood regulation side its like an reduction in symptoms its the most stable ive been in years while with bpd you definitely need to go to therapy which i plan on doing at some point as well but for now i feel like i can function and feel relatively positive which is pretty hopeful its almost hard to get used to in a way cuz im not used to feeling this way at alln__label__0 i cant offer any advice but maybe it gives some reassurance that youre not alone i feel the same and i am also looking for answersn__label__0 in those moments i try to find something that i find comfort ineven if its not that healthy for mebecause its still better than having the thoughts of the world is better of with me dead i try to distract myself with that i find comfort in and then i try to remember that it is not as bad as i think it is that i am loved and that i am valued even though my head says no i sometimes call a friend and just catch up with them to distract myself and it helpsn__label__0 for me knowing that one or maybe even two people care about me helps its the best medicine for me to counteract my own bullshitn__label__0 i focus on the little things that make me happy for a moment a good movie a song a conversation with a loved one hell even a good interaction on reddit is nicen__label__2 there is no official medication for treating bpdn__label__3 been on zoloft for years seroquel for while there is no drug out there to completely cure bpd the symptoms are easier to manage on seroquel toon__label__4 ive been on sertraline it gave me headaches and made me feel sick ive also been on citalopram and escitalopram neither did anything i feel like escitalopram made me worse but im not sure i took these pills well over years ago the pills i take are paroxetine for my depression and propranolol for my anxiety again idk if they work or not my boyfriend and sister have suggested i should go on anti psychotics cos of my mood swings and stuff but im dubious about it as i dont want to be worn out his dad has bipolar he takes them i think and most of the time he sleepsgoes months no contact with my boyfriend so idk if its the right idea id probably need to speak to a doctorn__label__1 ive found risperidone good for men__label__0 we must search within ourselves for the love and reassurance we seek from others we must find peace itll get bettern__label__0 i really am trying to learn through therapy i can say compared to how i was only two years ago ive made some progress thank you sometimes its hard to keep on pushing through moments like last nightn__label__0 youre not alone we can do this i believe in youproud of your progress take pride in your own progress even if its just tiny step forward just keep moving forwardn__label__0 even if you fall back down again or take however many steps back you gotta keep getting back upn__label__0 i will everyday i remind myself what im working towards and who im doing it for i dont want to feel this way my whole life and i dont want my loved ones to watch my suffer as well its nice knowing that if i cant bring myself to a better place on my own i have people around me including this community that can bring me back down so i can get back on track again thank you it really means the worldn__label__0 yes we are never truly alone despite how much we feel like we might be youre welcome take caren__label__0 you as welln__label__0 thats so fucked up please encourage him to report that clinic because transphobia in medicine is asininen__label__1 none of that bullshit is rooted in dbt in fact it goes against a lot of the principles of dbt like showing a person in pain basic respect and validation of their pain im so glad your partner left because he does not deserve that abuse and honestly i dont think those providers are capable of providing actual dbt training i mean for fucks sake dbt doesnt even use enforcing language it doesnt say x behavior is healthy and y behavior is toxic instead it invites you to consider alternative mindsets im so mad on your partners behalf please dont let this abuser shape your view of dbtn__label__3 i was hospitalized as a teenager for severe depression and anorexia in germany too there was so much going wrong at that clinic i could write a whole essay about things i experienced there that further harmed me i know someone who works there and he told me about a similar situation with a transgender patient whom the treatment team refused to gender correctly it was very upsetting for her as well and obvious that she wouldnt be able to benefit from therapy if this basic part of her identity wasnt respected but that didnt even seem to be the priority of her therapist the person who works there has also told me other horrifying stories about patients not being taken seriously intimidated and punishedthat doctor disrespected and manipulated your partner and is absolutely not fit to help mentally ill people shes the one being oppressive and controlling not your partner im so sorry this happened and angry that so much harm is being done in places meant for healing and recovery many people working in psychiatric clinics seem to be more interested in exerting control and enforcing harmful pointless rules and boundaries than in actually helping their patients by listening to them and learning about them with openness and respecti also wonder if people like that doctor ever try to put themselves in the patients shoes and empathize with them opening up to a stranger seeking help and especially accepting inpatient treatment takes a lot courage and can feel really scary it certainly felt terrifying for me those working with mentally ill patients should be extra sensitive and compassionate not extra harsh and hurtful i hope your partner finds another clinic or therapist that will treat him the way he deserves to be treated and actually offer supportn__label__2 as an american trans man fuck that place in all my therapy experiences ive never encountered such blatant disrespect they might not have really understood my experience but they at least had the basic decency to respect my name and pronouns im quite proud of your partner for standing his ground thats not easy to do im sorry hes dealt with that i cant say that dealing with medical professionals is easy as a trans person because so many are woefully uneducated about even the basics of treating a trans person but any therapist worth seeing will respect their patients rights to express their identity freely and be supportive of that i cant guarantee he wont face further ignorance because theres plenty of it out in the world but i wouldnt consider it the norm and he absolutely shouldnt settle for it i sure as hell haventn__label__0 gross find someone elsen__label__0 i will from what i have heard he will report her to the diversity management of that clinic group they have several clinics in germany so hopefully this will do somethingn__label__1 thank you for your perspective on the whole situation i was hoping that this place is not a good example for dbt the details you provided really helped sorry for the late reply btw i think i will have a look into what dbt is actually supposed to be i might have bpd as well and i was a bit scared about the whole situation to be honest i am really glad to hear another perspective thank you againn__label__1 thank you for your compassion i am really angry about it as well i was hospitalized myself as well but i was really lucky that everyone was very helpful and compassionate sadly that apparently it is luck here in germany i feel the same to me it looks like she is really toxic and selfcentered not at all fit for that position what i was insecure about is that i have no idea about dbt i heard it is quite strict and there are lots of rules after reconsideration its a nogo no matter what type of therapy it is i honestly hope he will find the courage to do so he is quite devastated right now and wants some space from the idea of going to another clinic which i completely get i dont want to push him the whole thing just sucksn__label__0 i am a trans guy myself never did i need to argue about being called by the right pronouns in therapeutic context early in my transition there were a few f ups but you could easily tell it was by mistake and not bad intent i am proud of him as well i dont know if i could have done the same in his shoes he is really brave and kept his calm but was firm in asking for respectthank you for your input and compassionn__label__1 it is i really wasnt sure if parts of this arent due to the nature of dbt i have zero experience with that doesnt sound like that thank youn__label__2 the last time i considered going to a clinic the doctor doing the admission interview made it seem like people with eating disorders generally lie deceive and cant be trusted in any area after i disclosed i was in recovery from anorexia there was a tone of derision even contempt in his voice he also accused me of not wanting to get better even though i was very much willing and motivated to work on myself i was horrified and never went back ive not been inpatient since apart from a short crisis intervention even though i think id benefit from inpatient treatment under better circumstances ive sadly been judged belittled forced and not listened to too many timesn__label__1 i am so sorry for your experience that really sounds horrible i hate the statement of not wanting help like you wouldnt go there if you didnt want to maybe you dont know how yet but showing up and working on it is the first step i feel the system is really messed up in germany getting help for these things is incredibly difficult and finding a good therapist or clinic seems like an impossible taski wish you a lot of strength and hope you will find the resources you need it is incredibly difficultn__label__0 this post has been marked as a venting post please be aware that the op may not be seeking advice usecretarycritical if you do not want advice please specify in the body of your post i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorbpd if you have any questions or concernsn__label__0 i often have issues with connecting with people on some deeper level i mean i can connect with everyone on a basic level that we are all people with lives problems dreams ect but beyond that i think i still havent met a single person that is like me its depressing when you think about it almost billion people on earth and youre just like everyone else in the basic sense but in your mind youre always the outsider the alien watching other people from my perspective i often feel like theres no one like me out here and its breaks my heart but i want to believe that one day i will meet someone at least similar to me in some way dont give up on yourself dont give up on other people were all fighting to finally be ourselves around someone and dont feel like you have to act to be perceived normal or like them ive accepted that im not like them and it kinda helps knowing and accepting yourself the way you are is really something that everyone should strive for hope that my perspective will help you in some wayn__label__1 i find it very very hard to connect with people i get very annoyed with people that i feel no connection to but there is a chance that i will develop one but then again thats only when i live with someone when im with someone all the time its the best times of my life when they leave i really couldnt care what happens to them like oh yeah im supposed to like them idk i hate that i do it i have medicine but i have anxiety with taking medication so its a constant cycle that i feel like ill never get out ofn__label__0 its okay even if it doesnt feel like it something that i dont think doctors tell their patients enough is that when you start a new medicine the chance of feeling a little off is very high the feeling is most likely temporary your body is getting used to the change i know the feeling absolutely sucks but itll all be okayn__label__2 yes this seems to be very common with psychiatrists ego is involved and they start thinking they know whats best for patients without even asking them lol i just saw a new psychiatrist after the old one told me to meditate when i brought up concerns about adhd i do a lot of dbt so im all about mindfulness and meditation but come on lady so now im on day of adhd medication and am functioning better without even taking the nd dose i know its because i feel more hopeful too cause someone actually listened to me and wasnt patronizing but anyway im proud of you reading this because i also get a lot of anxiety seeing new mental health professionals and youre rocking it with your dbt facing fear and coping ahead skills you got thisn__label__2 that was so validating i really appreciate that im really glad you have someone taking you seriously with your adhd and have meds that are helpful i have adhd and mindfulness and meditation can only take you so far some people really need medication for it and doctors should listen to their patients and take things with a case by case basis everyone is so unique even within just adhd alone before taking into account body chemistry and stuff it just doesnt make since to generalize and dismiss what your patient is telling you is happening youre the expert on your body youre the expert on your mental health why would they not consult the expert on thatn__label__2 i take lamotrigine and im so grateful for it no side effects that ive noticed over years but everyones differentn__label__1 try them i dont think meds work well for bpd on its own because it isnt a chemical imbalance but how brains are wired so it wont cure it however ive found some meds really helped with my impulsivity and anger issues they didnt make me feel better they just stopped me doing things i would have regrettedn__label__5 just talked to a new psychiatric np about this today the best treatment for bpd is therapy but meds including antipsychotics or mood stabilizers can help to bring our baseline to a more manageable level as someone else said control our impulsivity anger etc basically the goal we set for me is to get to the point that i am relatively functional so i can be more receptive to therapy i have bpd and ocd related disorders so im starting with trileptal this week and assuming i tolerate it will be adding luvox ssri after thatn__label__1 seroquel xr saved my life i will note that i also have bipolar ii but it helped so much with my daily affective instabilityn__label__1 yes trileptal works well little to no side effects for men__label__0 im currently on fluoextine and im so far so good i do feel numb sometimes though thats the only thingn__label__2 i recently started latuda after an emergency crisis i definitely feel like medication isnt a full solution to our obstacles we face with bpd but i also feel like it can help lessen some problematic aspects in my experience ive been having less delusional and black and white thinking and the mood stabilization aspect of medication really helps with my episodes albeit with some side effects splits may ease with medication emotion wise but still may be there in your head if it makes sensei definitely think both therapy and medication can be a great combination for better quality of life take your time and figure out what works best for youn__label__1 it has helped me immensly its definately not a cure but if you feel its unmanageble you should discuss it with a professional im on lamotrigine its not like i dont have any bpd symptoms because of it but its like going down to a level vs a level during an episode and damn that makes a difference long term through therapy seems like the best routen__label__4 im on seroquel and amitriptyline and as of right now my psychiatrist and i are trying to find the right seroquel dosage for me i should add that i also have bipolar i was on latuda but had some side affects akathisia which is basically restlessness and i got severe panic attacks from it obviously everyone reacts differently to meds its always worth a shot to try them out but try to be patient dbt is highly recommended for bpd but if you are wanting to take medication definitely talk to your doctorn__label__0 deletedn__label__1 its a great idea to give them a go im currently on quetiapinen__label__0 try them and see how you go personally theyve helped me but its taken a lot of amendments for this to happen dont be afraid to talk to your doctor if they dont suit you and make sure they gradually increase the dose good luckn__label__2 im on quetiapine as well as an antidepressant they have their ups and their downs quetiapine is mainly useful to help me sleep it also helps stabilise how i express my moods but i still feel them as intensely my anger still burns and i still can get incredibly sad but i dont lose control as often i guess it makes me more palatable which sometimes frustrates me as im doing it for other people not myself my antidepressants can lead to me being kinda numb and losing my passion the only thing i like about myself but they do lead to my depressive episodes being less severe theres a trade off i have to make there sometimes its one i am okay with and sometimes its one im not okay with i would recommend trying it and seeing how you go cause it does make some aspects of this diagnosis easier but its not a solutionn__label__1 i also have bp im on lithium and seroquel and this has helped me a lotn__label__2 i take vraylar mg and lamictal mg for my bipolar but also helps with some bpd symptoms but nothing fully helps bpd ive been in therapy and on meds years and imn__label__1 yes i take lamotragine and my symptoms have not gone away but they have improved tremendously i also started gabapentin for my anxiety recently and it had made a big difference too i was basically non functioning and almost had to go on disability over the summer recommend trying medication i was hesitant at first but i dont regret itn__label__3 hey i was diagnosed with bpd at almost now and i say go for it try whatever you think you need to get through the day no psychiatric medication has ever helped me with my bpd but i also have quiet bpd and havent had a bad episode since starting hrt but nonetheless the best medications for those with bpd ive heard of are trileptal lamictal and latudan__label__2 newer science has proven that meds wont treat personality disorders only consistent therapyn__label__3 i was on risperdal for a while and while it isnt a cure all it helped make a lot of my symptoms manageable i had more energy and my outbursts werent as frequent but i was still struggling with issues that i needed to address and overcome through talk therapy i hope you can find treatment that works for youn__label__1 im also under and i take mg of seroquel theyve been a life saver and also helped me get my sleep schedule back on track only downside is missing one dose gives me serious withdrawals so i cant imagine going off this med anytime soon good luck i hope you find a med that helpsn__label__0 mgn__label__0 omg yes its the best medicine i couldve asked forn__label__0 im on this too its extremely helpfuln__label__1 they wanted to put me on it but i had the gene testing done and i apparently have a gene phenotype that puts me at higher risk of the bad rash from lamotriginen__label__0 what improvements have you seenn__label__0 okokn__label__1 im on a waiting list for dbt but itll probably take about a yearn__label__0 same thing is happening to men__label__1 do you find it makes you tired i used to take it before i switched to lamotrigine but it made me a bit of a zombien__label__2 i have the exact same thing with my antidepressants i lose a bit of my spark but my episodes are able to be overcome im in weekly therapy and signed up for dbtn__label__1 im worried it might have bad side effects since im not yetn__label__0 mg is fine for men__label__2 at first for the first few weeks they definitely made me tired but after a while that subsided but i felt kinda high but it was a pleasant feeling for me at least because the bad thoughts stopped and the highs and lows werent so bad however it seems to be less effective than initially and i think i need to try a new medication because going a higher dose gave me side effects that i dont think i can get the hang of and staying at this dose although its much better unmedicated made me stop sh impulsivity etc i still feel like i want to explore more options since its my first and only antipsychoticmood stabiliser ive triedn__label__1 if youre already on antidepressants then i would definitely recommend trying something like a mood stabiliser i think it helped my antidepressants to work in conjunction with them especially if you think you do have bpd just use them as a a tool for therapy to start being more productive rather than as a tool unto themselvesn__label__3 i was worried too and there is no way to tell but part of the reason i was put on lamictal first was because i was so concerned with side effects and my psychiatrist said the side effects with this drug are usually pretty mild its the least likely to cause weight gain and he said it wasnt as likely to deaden me as the ssri i used to be on definitely talk to your psychiatrist a lot about your concerns and if you feel like you dont like them switch before you go on anything some of them are bad and dont listen so find someone you trust first and foremostn__label__0 huh its interesting how were all different i had to shift off them because i drove a lot for work and i didnt want to be so drowsy behind the wheel plus if i had alcohol i could pretty much fall asleep standing up loln__label__0 i was worried about the weight gain and im already on setralinen__label__0 for me its all about my tolerance when i was new to weed id often be more anxious when i smoked and it would sometimes turn into panic attacks but once i started smoking daily this stopped without the tolerance after a break its still too intense and just makes me more anxious but for the most part i can smoke as much as i want and it just relaxes men__label__0 hi there f with bpd here i smoked weed daily from the time i was and told myself i was going to stop all the time because it gave me wicked bad anxiety and paranoia and made me dissociate regularly it wasnt until a microdose on shrooms that i was finally able to shake the habit that said everyone is different and what didnt work for me could help you i think the only way to be sure is try it out also i have found that smoking cbd does have beneficial effects for me ive just come to the conclusion that i need to stay away from thcn__label__0 i used to smoke alot daily and it did help with sleep and to give me an appetite but then i quit for awhile to get a job and now whenever i smoke like once a week i get massive anxiety from it it sucks because i do miss it but now like half of a hit is all i can do to help chill myself out a bit and not freak out loln__label__0 deletedn__label__0 it helps slow my thoughts down ive been thinking of acquiring some cbd to help with my anxiety separately but when i really start to spiral and cant get out of my head and im headed down the rabbit hole thc helps s l o w it all down for me and thats a huge help bc then i dont feel like im a ball in a pinball machine just shooting every which way while feeling everythingn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 thank you i cant smoke daily i gotta be alert because ive got my kiddo most of the week but i hoped maybe there was something that could help me just sort of relax more i guess idk much about pot or anything related loln__label__0 thank you i get everyone is different but i guess i just wanted some live experiences i guess i have had cbd oil and it seemed to help but it wasnt highly concentrated eithern__label__0 im not asking to get high i know very very little about pot or cbd but after having asked here it sounds like what i want isnt in fact marijuana its cbd in some form after other comments and research it sounds like the cbd is what i need at least to help relax and maybe sleep while avoiding the high that would make it hard for me to function and parentn__label__0 do you have to be high for the slow to work or just a bit of a buzz i would much prefer to stay sober like of the time at least but i really need something to take that edge off when it gets super bad too though i suppose it would also be different for the both of us loln__label__0 it doesnt workn__label__0 lol no for me just a hit or two would take it down then i started liking itso at this point im probably overnedicating the problemn__label__1 but remember everyone reacts differently to meds so my experience may not be the same as yoursn__label__0 yep yep i wanted some first hand accounts while also recognizing i may still have different reactions than anyone else posting but having a general idea is what i wanted before speaking with my doctor toon__label__0 im so sorry i swear i replied and it disappeared for me i didnt have to be high just a hit or two worked with what i had then i discovered i liked being highloln__label__0 no problem and lmao i dont know that i would actually like being high but i never actually have been either i know i dont like being drunk but i have no idea if thats even remotely the same as being high or not since i have experience there lmaon__label__0 keep staying away from alcohol great work there and if youre going to try to get high smoke with someone you know who is a regular smokern__label__1 thanks for the advice and tbh i havent touched alcohol in years i never really liked it much and now i just use my meds as an excuse to never touch it againn__label__0 lol brilliant alcohol amplifies my emotions and thats not a good thing for melolsighn__label__0 yup same i noticed its made everything way too hard to deal with and i never understood why so i just quit drinking then i got my bpd diagnosis and was like ohhhn__label__0 omg me too i quit drinking and did meetings etc etc and certain behaviors of mine did not change at all behaviors i thought that were caused by my drinking thats when i got diagnosed for the second time lol this time i believed themn__label__0 theres a huge difference between no contact when its healthy out of selfrespect and selfpreservation and the other party is just not worthy your attention anymore or when its childish ghosting punishment no contact bs like bpd causes you to do to avoid emotional pain and or to get the attention backn__label__0 im having a hard time understanding i wanna listen i cant really get it though are you able to expand further its ok if not ur not obligated toedit my caption about no contact is bs wasnt to dismiss my behaviors it was just a title about my experience trying to utilize it and whether i utilized it right or wrong i dont really see what is being explained like i know why i do the push and pull because i want to manipulate him further and i also am avoiding getting into emotional turmoil all over againn__label__1 so you dont wanna talk to me because you wanna punish me for something that triggered you okay i will simply return the favor and not talk to you because i have selfrespect enough not to engage in a bpd abuse mind game which only aims at getting my attentioni did that with one ex until i got a message from a common friend that she hadnt eaten in days and cried her eyes out my last ex dumped me in a very rude immature via whatsapp and told me she wants never to see me again including some personal threats ok i granted her wish days later a childish apology message and later a how are you what i call trial balloon message nope no contact it was and still is shes now dead to mei dont get treated like that and reward that with attention and who has punished now whom bpd the wonderful delusion where youre constantly stabbing your own self believing youve harmed the other onen__label__1 thank you for sharing this did help me identify things im freshly diagnosed so its been a huge learning curve and quite exhausting ive been catching myself to not engage in the mind game quicker than usual whether it be the mind game used to last weeks or so now its like week and then most recently i snapped out of it in days so i can see progress since therapy and medication but yes hearing what ive done or said to ppl and how it affected them was a huge eye opener you said it right literally stabbing myself does this get any friggin easier as time goes on and life continues to beat me down or is this me still in a victim phase ugh if everyone else can power through i guess i can toon__label__0 also if your boy is just as much bpd or npd then it will be a neverending spiraling dynamic of that between you both mutual abuse that will appear as a loving harmonic relationship what you need and at the same time hatefear is emotional stability and boundariesand dont take me as patronizing i am the combo of bothn__label__0 this post has been marked as a venting post please be aware that the op may not be seeking advice unephildark if you do not want advice please specify in the body of your post i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorbpd if you have any questions or concernsn__label__0 hi so i think i went through a similar phase i coped with weed instead of booze tho suppressed the feelings of insecurity until i developed ticks i would literally gasp at the thought of my partner leaving or if i thought my partner was trying to placate me to set up a situation to leave i wish i had at least been sober when it ended i dont know if it would have changed things i just know i hurt us both so muchnow i gasp and apologize out loud to memories of a person that hasnt talked to me for months like i keep touching a hot stove in my mind no amount of exercise meditation cold showers and sobriety seems to help all i can do is avoid interacting with people so i dont embarrass myself im not the best person to get advice from but id recommend sobriety and general personal health to anyone best of luckn__label__1 i dont know if theres a good alternative but i had the same problems on seroquel so you def arent alonen__label__5 i take both and i didnt know this could be a problem until this post i saw a comment that youre not alone i hope you could tell your psych about this medication is always experimental ugh ive tried so much meds but lamotrigineseroquelxanax prn are the best combination for meand i always thought drowsiness will only affect you at most a week and youll get used to it its been months i dont think you should delay seeking other meds anymore my meds trial and error took years to find a good combination i hope youll feel better soon thoughn__label__1 i went into psychosis using low dose seroquel for sleep i was taking mg nightly probably after months i started having psychotic symptoms and it only got worse with each dose i went off of it and havent experienced psychosis since its been probably two years i now take mg of trazodone for sleep and it has been working well for me just gives me wild dreams sometimesn__label__0 thank youn__label__1 i havent tried both together before thats interesting ive taken xanax before and its helped but my psych basically said im not allowed xanax because its known for being addictive will definitely reach out to a new psych for help thanksn__label__0 im sorry to hear that glad youre doing better i might go back on trazodone but i remember it wasnt too effective because i would stay up too late and my brain would get dizzy but not actually fall asleepn__label__0 thank youyoure welcomen__label__1 yes xanax can be addictive but so far im not addicted to it my psych give me pills per month and i dont take it daily although recently i do take it more because i have too much on my plate and i cant afford leaving my anxiety on all the time unless you have a history of substance abuse id say it is safe and not addictive at alli was like you too scared to try xanax for the first week to month and i ask about it here in case you want to see what others think about itn__label__0 yeah you definitely gotta take it when your mind and body are ready to sleep or its miserable waiting for it to wear offn__label__1 oh thats smart i wish my psych would give me xanax but she just wouldnt bend ive been prescribed it before but it was with a psych before he retired everyone else ive been to afterwards wouldnt prescribe it to men__label__0 she may be triggered by only having you to depend on and need more support you arent harming her by being her friend she needs more people not lessn__label__3 hey there ace she needs some serious treatment intervention there like residential or php level and when she gets amped up keep yourself safe go for a walk if you need to if she threatens suicide call a crisis line or the authorities to handle it setting boundaries will be much easier if shes had some intensive treatment beforehandn__label__0 my fp is a pwbpd and they have been verbally abusive towards me heavily for over a year of our year relationshipzax has your fp been diagnosed as having fullblown bpd i ask because if so her bpd traits would not only be strong but also persistent they would have started showing strongly as soon as the infatuation period fades typically about to months into the relationship the traits would not be mild or moderate for the first years of your relationship this at least is my experience zaxn__label__0 she sadly lost all her other friends she only has her family and me her sister is wanting to be supportive but she keeps pushing both of us away when she is upset she even blocked us both today and ran away and wouldnt let either of us know where she was until late tonight after keeping us worrying we dont know what to don__label__1 sadly she is really difficult with therapists and with medicine her doctor has given her especially when shes upset at everyone i have been told if shes being difficult theres nothing i can do but i dont want to just abandon her and want to find a way to really motivate her to continue getting helpn__label__0 wouldnt let either of us know where she wasi know this is hard but you have to accept that as a disabled person she has the right to die and that she may make that decision for reasons you completely disagree with you need to stay out of a suicide watch mode because it will just damage her self esteem furtheroff hand get her to take a workshop or volunteer in animal rescuen__label__0 but what youve been told is right and calling mental health crisis services if she threatens self harm or suicide is not abandoning her its helping her in ways that youre not personally able ton__label__0 are you suggesting i let her take her own life this isnt about her self esteem at that point i dont want her hurting herself or worsen__label__1 around here we try to accept bad things to help ourselves emotionally not because we want the bad thing to have happened her mental health is likely going to be worsened by being treated like she is mentally incompetent and you are in the process of dumping her for her mental health then following her around and insisting that her feelings are toxic i am worried that you need to be able to accept the reality of your situation instead of continuing to go rounds with her over her mental health that said showing positive emotions would be great right nown__label__3 im in my s very typical quiet bpdit does get better its just different for everyone medication did help me a little i think therapy was useless to me until i found a therapist who does dbt and also is comfortable working with transgender people and not all weird about that aspect of meit really does get better with time i think i started to be able to identify the obvious feedback loops in my life mostly relating to jealousy and while i still have bad days most of the time i can kinda interrupt the stupid circle before i get lost in it and spend days quiet and stewing and feeling progressively worsen__label__1 it can get better and im pretty much on top of itin remission been years since a major episode other than that life is pretty calmwent through a very stressful period last month first anniversary of moms death got screwed professionally lost a friendship of years butno meltdown got through it and back to normal in weeks as opposed to yearstherapy meds and lots of practice plus just getting older has really seemed to make the bpd back offn__label__0 f its gotten better over time im not quiet bpd psychiatric medicine didnt help me felt worse on it tried different ones for nearly decades i hate psychiatric medicine depression was severe and i decided to try literally everything for it therapy worked better for me when i had moods better managed i use herbal medicine for my moods now so much better this way mediterranean diet recommended for depression pain and endocrine disorders walking

day anymore though i do have my horrible moments i cope bettern__label__1 didnt get help for my bpd bipolar or fibro until its harder once your older those coping skills have been around longer but they can still be changedive been on meds single therapy and group therapy for a year now and its helped a lotjust gotta keep trying the bpd will be there and youll still have feelings and have to navigate sometimes the trick is to learn to deal with those things so theyre just a blip in your day instead of ruining the whole thingn__label__0 deletedn__label__2 i know you asked for older adults and im only but i thought id give a little input medication and therapy vary by person as we all work differently and have been through different things it takes time to find the right things that work for you it can be a frustrating process but please dont give up as it is very possible to find your peacesomething to keep in mind is that even with all the right medications and coping skills and having let everything off your chest you can back track sometimes dont let those moments weigh you down though it doesnt mean you havent made progress or that youre destined to fail youre essentially trying to change habits formed over many years also dont just focus on the disorder and how to manage it look at life beyond the disorder what and who makes you happy where do you want to be in life make goals find enjoyment where you can youre more than bpd and you deserve to be happyn__label__2 im only now but ive come a long way since i was first diagnosedi think the biggest thing for me is my medsi take an anti depressant anti psychotic and mood stabiliser and im like a different personi have other meds i can take when im struggling as wellbut my meds have helped me so so much and made me alot more mentally stable finding a good therapist that you click with is really important as wellsomeone who you really trust and can open to upit never goes away though and ive just learnt to deal with that nowsometimes i have my down times and lose all control of my emotions but i no longer have any incidentsi severely self harmed for years and although i still have urges at timesim able to keep it under controland ive just had my whole forearm tattooed to cover up some of my scarringgot a long way to go though before all the scars are covered but honestly it does get betterthere is hope for everyone xxxn__label__0 i was diagnosed about years ago nothing helps nor medicines nor therapyn__label__1 im nothing ever gets better its just ups and downs and over again year after year meds help but dont make anything bettern__label__5 eta while i am older i am a more recent diagnosis and treatment though i have had the symptoms most of my life i was very quiet bpd with heavy masking by overdoing other stuff until i was hit with covid as a nurse moving after living in the same place for years and starting grad school which i did not stay ini absolutely broke down over many months until i was really really scared i did get the diagnosis a couple of months in i have seen the same psych provider for years so she noticed the subtle pattern learning helped a little but the dysregulation got worse and worse and ended up in the hospital during the worst of the worst with sh and si after a quick stabilization i was discharged to php weeks and iop weeksi was and i was tired of wasting time id been battling mental illness that was marginally responsive to treatment for at least years in my own research i kept finding that the best treatment outcomes and even remission to the point that i wouldnt have enough symptoms to fit the diagnostic criteria was most likely with the fullmodel dbt weekly skills group weekly individual dbt diary card coaching calls at least one year preferably i have not been working or going to school i do volunteer semifrequently though after the dbt group i moved to an emotional resiliency group weekly focused on just that continuing to manage strong emotions still do weekly individual therapy there are no coaching calls in stage dbti am a couple months from my year mark and i realized just the other day i slowed down in an upsetting interpersonal situation and all the same judgmental self judgement bpd type thoughts and emotions were there but for the first time in years they were not louder than my wise mindlogic mind i would have never ever imagined being at this point my relationship continues to be a challenge as my partner is completely emotionally selfunaware he does not recognize nor can he process them a big part of improvement was not taking so much responsibility for his emotions and emotional intelligence i was the fix it or faultfail type pwbpd and had to learn somet hings i cannot fix and i should not fix them i can respond in a situation for my own benefit only if needed and thats okay like i said i am a nurse i have not worked through this or gone to school school is indefinitely set aside i went down that road for the wrong reasons to begin with i have a year old son and a crap ton of pets i interact with a small number of super trusted friends maybe but am comfortable in situations with strangers or acquaintances most of the time i do want to go back to work but i have zero desire to ever return to acute care in hospital i have enjoyed public healthcommunity health and am an excellent candidate for those jobs but i dont see enough positives to work outside the home yet i volunteer extensively with boy scouts with and without my family leadership teaching and summer camp nurse mostly these things are very fulfilling to meim so sorry for the novel but thats what life looks like at when i am having an bad episode day i definitely feel like im barely how on earth will i survive another years with this i cant i just try to redirect to the presentn__label__1 im a bit older than you and i can say that things have gotten better with changes in my life some things that helped me like getting my diagnosis and starting bpdappropriate therapy are ones i can see youve already gone through on your journey but there have been other things eg distance between me and my fp finding a therapist who actually listens getting a less stressful job etc that have meant that while the unhelpful thought patterns dysregulated emotions etc are still there i am able to manage them better and they dont have as much control over men__label__0 as a queernb person with bpd its great to know there are providers who do support the lgbtqia communityn__label__2 good to hear things get easier my bpd has started to back off after months of being without a provider and medications sometimes the dark gets too bign__label__0 ive just had the darkest meltdown in my life so far it lasted for weeks im now my loss of a grip on my bpd could have potentially ruined a good thing i had going on its still up in the air this was weeks ago i went into a rage and did some things im not proud of i had to then explain why id been hiding my bpd from her i have separation anxiety and fear of abandonment and i just cant stop obsessing over what my girlfriend is doingyou cant hide it you can only learn to control it and i have been controlling it really well your comment gives me hope that as i age more i can get to a place where my episodes slow their frequency and i can just live with a little bit of peace for oncen__label__0 im just but id say the lowest or worst episodes have given some perspective and then age there are just a lot differentless things i truly care to give my emotional and mental energy tootheres a lot more oh well while my partner remains pretty anxious about small things sometimes loln__label__0 but youre here friend im proud of you for thatn__label__0 im sorry friend how do you cope i cant imagine how painful that must ben__label__3 i just flat out ask now if im getting a new doctor or mental health doctor i will ask to talk to them on the phone or via email before the first visit and ask if they are accepting of lgbtq people and if they have worked with anyone like that in the pastkinda helps weed out the ones who are a little weird about giving me treatmentits weird too i live in rural nowhere beyond my husband my best friends in this town are either corn or cows lol and somehow in a town of like i found a therapist who used to practice in the nw and has extensive experiencen__label__0 it does the dark never leaves it just moves back if that makes sense far enough back its not a huge factorbest advice i can give is progress isnt linear it will speed up slow down pause maybe backslide none of that invalidates the work you do try to break things down into smaller issues to deal with rather than a huge single issueand medwise i found an antipsychotic made a huge difference for me super tiny dose rexulti took away the edgy aspectmade me feel stable let me handle things calmlyquick effects within days of starting no issues just quitting iteither and oddly i feel like that distance it gave me has become permanentn__label__0 weeks isnt too bad so far as meltdowns can go dude seriouslylike my last episode like years ago took months to shake off and that was an all time record fast recoveryso getting past one that i never actually went completely off teh rails with was a huge sign of progress weeks is pretty damn good radical acceptance is a huge help with that sort of trust issue helps keep you from overthinking when shes out of sight keeps you from losing controlyouve got thisn__label__0 learning perspective truly helpsand so does the moment when you realize no bad period is forever it makes it easier to deal with when you know it can end and you can be happy at some pointn__label__0 i dont i just imagine that the future will be better my imagination is all what i haven__label__0 also this is a great description in my head i think of emotion mindbpd as very loud obnoxious relentless big overwhelming dark and the other side was just normal intensity bright so doomed against its adversary falls back is a great example mine is noise bpd gets quieter and moved back i can hear calmly the other sidei learned to strength the rationalbright side some but it was mostly about quieting and controlling the darkn__label__0 i had a very rude awakening after an upward trajectory i had two smaller episodes that lasted a few days at the start of this year and then it exploded out of me last month i guess you could say it lasted months my head is a lot clearer now im trying to concentrate on myself by changing my habits and writing a journal when i have dark thoughts it works well reading back on things with a rational mind is kind of uplifting you realise how stupid you were being in those rational momentsits still hard its more of an anxiety wave than a perpetual feeling and it helps if im with someone as welln__label__0 i also find it fascinating when i now notice something that seems to matter quite a bit to someone like traffic maybe and i have absolutely no emotional response its freeing to be able to set so much stuff down because we just dont need itn__label__0 thats actually incredible though seeing nothing in the future but blackness has been a limiting factor for me in the past sometimes im still not sure whether itll be good or bad but can acknowledge it existsn__label__0 i see it as a sort of taking turns thing reduce the dark and static and then you can access the light get better at holding to the calm and light and its easier to push back the darkit just takes time but once you start moving forward it gets easieri find just being able to realize hey this is a nice walk today look at the lilacs is a powerful step forwardn__label__0 thats exactly why i keep a journaln__label__1 one day i told my therapist that i decided i was going to leave the room and go upstairs because i wanted to she said that was the first time shes ever heard me i did something just because i wanted towhen i am able to take up space no matter how little and feel safe i know its bigwe live with an acre or so of old growth forest behind us i wander back there and look at all the plants and rocks and occasionally critters i like that its wild and purely nature occasionally my partner will be the idea that something needs removed or changed and i chase him offn__label__0 i love my walks my city has nice trails along the river a nice walk there does a lot for my moodsn__label__0 im more emotional so i am really empathetic but dude if its taking a toll on you you have to remove them from your life its not your responsibility therapy or medicine or both should help themn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 its not healthy for you to be his emotional prisoner either i understand you want to be there for him but this is how you help him this isnt healthy for either of you and you reaffirm a bad habit that people with our disorder can and will use against you its a self defense that theyll utilize to get their way and they will use it again and again against youn__label__3 im taking lamictal also its been about weeks now the week mark is about the time my psychiatrist said that it should make a considerable difference you should be able to see a small improvement once you got to mg although i didnt see any its personal disclaimer this may not be accurate this is just based off memory as far as the symptoms id definitely mention it to the doctor just to be safe and its always good to be vocal about any side effects you may be experiencing on a medicationn__label__1 i know the majority of people are against self diagnosis when it comes to bpd and theyre probably right however years ago i stumbled upon some posts about bpd and they really resonated with me like i was feeling exactly what these people were describing i did some research and took an online test which told me my chances of having bpd were very high months later i ended up in the looney bin and got a professional diagnosis of bpd you have to look a bit more into it and have a discussion about it with your therapist to figure out if its really bpdn__label__0 non__label__0 not self diagnosablen__label__0 everyone has their own ways of dealing with the symptoms it gets easier for me when i listen to music for example or read a nice story onlinen__label__1 cognitive behavioral therapy helped me with my anxietyn__label__0 it sounds like they dont believe in psychiatry like my family i just dont tell them anything about itwhen i did tell them about it they would make snarky comments or just be rude to me for not dealing with things on my own or praying about itthey basically wanted me to think something was wrong with me for wanting to take care of myselfi decided it was more important to take care of myself than my relationship with them i have very limited contact with them and contact is always scheduled its the boundaries i had to create to protect myself from themim not fully aware of your situation but you dont have to be in contact with abusive individuals even if they are familyn__label__5 hey there im audhd as well and have been taking lamictal for a few years it is quite literally the only medication ive tried that has helped me so far with my bpd if the medicine works for you please dont give up on it or feel ashamed that you take it just because your stepmom is being some type of way there is definitely a possibility they are acting this way because of how people view certain medications and treatments ive had plenty of people raise an eyebrow at some of the stuff ive taken lamictal included but theres also a chance that the lamictal is working as intended and youre now starting to be more aware of whats happening in your head and around you that particular medicine gave me the ability to pick apart and identify issues better as well as figure out what im feeling and why before i started taking it i was so trapped in my head and only aware of what was going on in my brain i had complete tunnel vision and didnt see other people or their reactions to my behavior only my own emotions it could very well be that the medicine is snapping you out of that funk and now you are seeing whats around you more clearly either way its terrible to hear that they arent giving you the support you need please please please dont let their attitude ruin the fact that you found something helpful that medicine saved my life and i hope it continues to help you no matter what they say something that might be useful to you is taking note of when you see changes in their behavior like writing down what you said and their reactions to it this might help you find a pattern to their hostility and figure out if theyre always like that or if theyre just belittling mental health treatment i know myself i cant always remember things that happen so i have to take note if you ever need to talk about it or anything else my dms are always open and i hope this was helpful in some wayn__label__1 they really dont they even refuse to believe that my eldest sibling has autism despite being diagnosed by one of the leading professionals in the state however they treat my eldest stepsister like an angel even though shes also autistic and my other sister the same way and shes diagnosed with adhd so its very much a mixed bag with them a double standard kind of my stepsisters are allowed to have actual diagnosis and get treated with kindness understanding and respect while me and my eldest bloodsib are basically treated like trash my other older sister basically gets treated like my step siblings because she managed to get good grades and mask her issues extremely well and with my momi dont live with her she is also autistic and has adhd as well as a lot of other things so i dont get why my parent and stepmom dont want to accept the fact that more than two of their kids are actually disabled its all so irritating really and if i could i would move out of my parents house but unfortunately my only source of income at the moment is doordash which doesnt really get me much i absolutely plan on going nocontact with them if possible because theres no way that theyre going to change their attitude with me in all years of my life so far ive been treated the same way im even the last one of my siblings that is still living with them and i hate it thank god theyre not here this weekendthey just left the house about minutes ago so i have some time to relax and not worry about themjust like you mentioned with your parents mine get super snarky with me whenever i tell them about my issues like damn im sorry that im trying to communicate my issues and then they go and tell others that im the one not communicating with them smh whats worse is that my stepmom is literally a nurse and my older sister literally just graduated college with a degree in psychology and is getting her masters right now and what sucks is that theyre not bad people because i see how they treat my older sistersminus my eldest sib but even they get treated better than me atp and how they treat everyone else but theyre just awful towards me in particular i truly cant wait til i actually have a job so i can save up my money and move out get my cat from my momsmy stepmom wont let me have her at their place even though my bedroom is big enough for cat its a pretty large room and cut them off as much as i can before completely going

very treatable and it improves as people get older and more stable you might still struggle with your emotions but thats what makes us special unfortunately we have to deal with a lot of negative emotions but on the other hand we have a wonderful ability to experience very deep love compassion and passion that a lot of people cant experience to the same degree we do i know it feels hopeless sometimes but it does get better i promisen__label__2 this makes me so sad i can def relate at the root of bpd is emotional dysregulation and its not something we r born with but rather a product of

to mitigate itand in general the older you get the less it affects youn__label__0 makes us special no its definitely a cursen__label__0 it definitely can feel like the only way you can view the

post i wish i had advice obviously you gotta go one minute one hour one day at a time and do the best you can for you in that moment i lost everything once and although its a painful memory im a better person for what happened i hope you get some light at the end of this tunneln__label__0 im happy your venting and sharing bc this is a real affliction and its important to talk about it im sorry to hear youre in such a bad place you said you lost everything in the months as you specified since your diagnosis that makes me wonder if youve become too attached to the diagnosis itself subconsciously i think that can be a serious issue with bpd and find myself falling into that mindset fairly regularly and i have to keep things in perspective nearly every symptom of bpd is one that every person experiences at some point in their lives but on a spectrum youre not inherently screwed in life bc you have bpd behaviors consequences thoughtsemotions in and of themselves do not hang in there and stay connected to these forumsn__label__0 well how did ya lose itn__label__0 if it was meant to be it would be some things dont work out for the better and some things can continue again ive had friendships come and go and i still love those people deeply sometimes its hard but focusing on yourself is probably the bestn__label__0 can i ask what exactly you do wrong that pushes people away and what have you done to change it my ex bf most likely had bpd so im just wonderingn__label__0 i was also recently diagnosed with bpd and have lost the majority of my friendships and significant other in the process its absolute suffering im sorry to hear you are also going through something similar i dont know how to get past this either so youre not alone im in therapy and literally just taking it one day at a time other than that im still figuring it all out its tough hang in theren__label__0 i can honestly relate all i ever do is self sabotage i hate this illnessn__label__0 hello friend i am just wondering how your diagnosis has impacted your relationship with your pets i am in the process of trying to figure out my own diagnosisn__label__0 so when i was diagnosed with bpd i was given notice that it was an undesirable condition and i was given days to fix myself so now im in the process of medical separation because theres no fix for a while i did think i was going to make it out on top and be able to stay in i got better at work i was already the highest performer financially stable and i was gaining back friends even though nothing about me really changed only to be told three months later that even though i had completely changed i was still getting kicked out as for my girlfriend ill admit i walked out on her because i felt like eventually i was just going to be an anchor to her career personally i refused to believe i had bpd and still find it hard to admit to myselfn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 i lost my housing and had to rehome them i lived with my ex who agreed to let me keep one of my dogs when we broke up i was able to have a friend keep him my dog is extremely attached to me and is highly reactive so giving him up would mean him having to be put down since no one not even a professional trainer is able to touch himn__label__0 my ex definitely pushed me away he was extremely clingy and jealous even though he hurt me i believe he did love me deep down its really sad because he was the best and worst bf i ever had its like a self fulfilling prophecy because you cause people to leave you due to you thinking they are going to abandon youn__label__0 so you still have your dog thats good dont give up it will work out i have been researching personality disorders and i think from what i have read that the enemy to everyone with a personality disorder is thier own mind they are often very smart krishnamurti said it best its no measure of health to be well adjusted to a truly sick society how old is your dogn__label__0 he just turned a year old in januaryn__label__2 so i always felt pathetic for letting my mental disorders get the best of me because my family raised me with the shut up suck it up mentality my doctor always made me feel better by explaining to me you wouldnt stigmatize or berate someone for being on insulin or high blood pressure medication right she words it a lot better but basically some organs just dont work as well as others are any of your family members on medications for anything tell them to just get over it and see their reaction our brain is an organ that sometimes needs medicines its a much more complex organ than others and i would definitely argue that science doesnt fully understand it yet we are learning so much every day just because there isnt a brain scan to definitively say you have bpd and need medicine doesnt mean there isnt a problem and you cant benefit from taking a mood stabilizer or whatever you are on and if simply taking something and getting things off your chest is a step in the right direction all the more power to you you shouldnt have to struggle and they should be supporting youn__label__0 this post has been marked venting please be aware that the

was just so cringe and basic i couldnt carry onn__label__0 i dont know if this helps im also venting but reading this really struck a chord with me i can relate when people are really kind or caring i know theyre just trying to help but they dont understand that it actually makes me hate myself more and then i resent them for it it makes me spiral into guilt and shame and suicidal ideation because i feel like i dont deserve it because i am a horrible person and they only love the version of me i allow them to see and i feel like a burden and that they could be spending their time on way more important things and i must be ruining their life and like you said because of all this i selfisolate which makes them even more concerned and the cycle just continues it feels like theres no winning because i always want people to like mecare about me but then when they actually do it makes me uncomfortable and so guilty and yeah i just want them to go awayn__label__1 have you tried setting up boundaries what did your therapist suggest i guarantee it wasnt keep reciprocating what triggers you so you can continue to be irrationally mad at your friendsn__label__1 which dbt bookn__label__0 i relate and thats whats so fucking confusing about me yourself and others who relate no one from the outside knows whats going on in our heads if i explained this thought process to the people who cared for me they would get even more confused but in my mind it makes perfect sense im also mad at myself for having this same thought process because it makes no sense and yet it does make sense at the same time frustrating afn__label__0 im glad you found some answersn__label__1 congrats on your diagnosis now you can get the help you need i take meds for my bipolar but they also help with my bpd

or concernsn__label__0 i have horrible memory problems they started when i was in high school when i endured sexual abuse and grooming by a teacher in addition to being emotionally abused by my dad ive always just thought there was something wrong with long termshort term memory retrieval but after learning more about my disorder and working through past traumas its probably a coping mechanism if i dont store anything in my memory it cant come back to hurt me i can just remain numbn__label__0 yes yes yes whenever im especially stressed i tend to blank out forget what people at work or my boyfriend had been saying to me i forget what i just had said a few seconds ago and its stressing me out even more just this acknowledging that you have issues with memory helps talking about it to someone and this might seem stupid but you know those brain exercises like sudoku and whatnot i feel like whenever i do these exercises my general brain functioning improves and also sometimes i trace back my train of thoughts this is not only helpful with figuring out emotions but memory as well and be kind to yourselfn__label__0 this may be more of a general tipbut keeping a journal changed my life i was able to vent reflect track my moodbehavioursthoughts with my depression most days blur together so having a journal helps me remember what i do daily or a weekly basis once it became a habit i loved journalingn__label__0 honestly cant remember my life before middle school i see pictures and videos of me and i just cant make the connection that that was me anything after that i can remember relatively well i can remember things about other people pretty well toon__label__0 i have so many issues with memories there are entire years of my life gone and i dont tend to remember suicide attempts or self harm or extreme emotion after they happen i like to write significant things down in a diary when i remember them in case i forget them again i also dont want to dive too deep into my past because i dont really want to know a lot of itn__label__0 yes and i think youre doing what you need to be doing when my brain is all triggered and or in a depressed state my brain doesnt remember shit keep working on your bpdside note try meditation im not sure it helps with memory but i know it helps with bpdn__label__0 i havent been through what would usually be considered trauma in fact i feel bad usually bc what ive gone through is nothing yet for some reason i cant remember anything i forget things as im saying them quite literally i forget things while im looking at them i cant remember what my life was like and how i felt other than bad before this week even everything is foggy idk if this is disassociation i dont have any tips for you but you arent alone pm me if you need ton__label__0 oh my goodddddd i dont have any advice but i relate so so so hard sometimes i find myself in the middle of an argument and i cant seem to put the pieces together or understand what im even talking about anymore days are like a blur and i cant remember the most basic things sorry i cant help but its comforting to see that other people have similar struggles and youre not alonen__label__0 i think theres a demon inside us that if you fight will hurt you worse than any other person possibly could the flip side is that this demon can work for you if you befriend it it can stop other people from hurting you like being bulletproofof course you must be careful when using it to protect yourself got to be willing to be open as welln__label__0 i completely agree w this i feel like journalling makes your brain relive process remember everyday life by writing it down like going over a really fine line in pencil with a line in pen so its more engraved in your memory dream journals to do lists etcn__label__1 im really hoping to try medication next so im actually excited af for you please update this thread with how its goingn__label__2 which meds are you on im so tired of feeling my feelings so to speak idk if anyone else has had this experience of going to therapy and having a therapist tell you to just sit with what youre feeling validating it etc whilst ignoring how like debilitatingly and crazy intense the feelings really are and how impossible it is to function like a normal person when feeling them like no i dont have time to fucking feel my totally irrational and blownoutofproportion feelings and it doesnt serve me or any of my relationships for me to try and feel therefore driving myself into rumination and negatively coping with the intensity of emotion im experiencing its exhaustingn__label__0 im really proud of you dude good luckn__label__0 that is awesome i know it isnt the only step you have to take but its an important one you have taken feel good about yourself for doing so keep it upn__label__0 mine saved my life im proud of youn__label__2 exactly what i was thinking two nights agoit is ridiculous for someone with bpd to be expected to do this and for it to be successful it does cause rumination and an intensification of the emotions which can lead to more negative thought patterns and behaviors even selfharm and other destructive things impulsive decisions and actions etc better strategies exist therapists trained in dbt are much better at guiding those with bpd and ptsdn__label__1 not op but im on wellbutrin and it helped me tone down my depression so mindfulness exercises what are you feeling exercises actually worked it hasnt cured all of my depression but it reduced the noise in my head that has made my depression manageable and that makes my bpd is manageable as a resultn__label__0 i am so damn happy for you congratulations sending much love to youn__label__0 congratulations well done for holding on and getting theren__label__0 congratulations reading this gives me hope thank youn__label__2 i am overjoyed for you not only have you worked hard to get better but you kept fighting through having

might need another diagnosis hahahn__label__0 already have bipolar depression bpd anxiety and insomnia got no room for anything elsen__label__0 do you take medicinen__label__1 trazadone and lamotriginen__label__0 what i do is add an alarm that i dont turn off until i actually take my medicine and then turn it off once im donen__label__0 thats a good idea but too late now im in a predicamentn__label__1 are there any negative side effects if you accidentally take two pills my doctor says if i forget then to just take it when i remember and then take it again at my next usual dose timen__label__1 i dont know if there is thats why i specified the medication and dose on here in case anyone has experience the problem is im supposed to take it around now but i cant remember if i already did it or not i remember thinking about it but dont know if i actually took itn__label__0 skip until your next dose if you are taking regularly it wont mess it up as long as its just this time taking a double dose could make you feel unwell its not worth the riskn__label__1 google says to just skip it until your next dose i dont have any personal experience with the medication thoughn__label__0 are you able to move away from your parents i went through a lot of the things your going through and my symptoms drastically improved as soon as a got away from my abusern__label__0 i wouldnt really consider my parents abusive as these incidents arent especially not since i got diagnosed and got older like past but damage was done by then tbh however they were just uneducated and misinformed they werent trying to hurt me or abuse me however it obviously did affect me so i dont really know if they are abusive but yes the result of it affected me as suchn__label__2 my diagnosis came from a psychiatrist after a weeks stay on a psych ward for suicidal ideation i still have that original discharge paper that listed bpd and have shown it to numerous health care providers over the years it seams like once the first one does a diagnosis then everyone has an easier time with it im not sure the reluctance on the part of providers maybe its an issue of getting sued if you think you have bpd try to find a therapist with dbt experience they would have the least issue taking you through the dsm and other toolsn__label__3 do therapy first do you have trauma in your history if so find a trauma therapist they will know what to do if not find one and call them and in the minute phone consult most give tell them you think you may have it and if they are willing to work with you therapists do give diagnoses they have to int order to put something on insurance it takes awhile to diagnose bpd because the pattern has to exist over time and being thorough is a good thingalso go for the meds go for it if you cant take the side effects of one try another meds are great unless you are high functioning and really feel like you can hang in there until therapy start to work it is not instantn__label__0 i dont have anything to say other than im here too wondering the same myself hope youre okn__label__0 this post has been marked venting please be aware that the op may not be

i discovered my own bpd diagnosis while getting my degree in behavioral biology and psychology low key the reason why i even chose that degree in the first place is because i wanted to be able to fix myself without having to go to a professional i have a myriad of comorbidities including depression and anxiety if i get the same education then i must be capable of doing all the same things a professional does right not exactly i found that it really only made me extremely selfaware which can be a good thing but also extremely detrimental especially for someone like me with selfesteem and anxiety issues the exercises i tried to do that i learned about didnt really help mebottom line although i think its possible to improve on your own it just would be much faster and a lot easier if you went through a professional and got therapy specifically tailored to your particular bpd without the years i spent in therapy i would not be as stable as i am today the problem is when youre in a bpd episode its extremely difficult to maintain an objective nonemotional perspective on whats happening to you you need to either train yourself to pull yourself out of it or talk to someone that can there is most definitely hope i just think itll be more work and i want to keep it realistic as someone who has tried to fix everything on their own before turning to a professional as an adult definitely check out dbt and cbt books try to keep yourself aware of when youre in emotional brain vs when youre in logic brain isolate when your thoughts are a reasonable reaction to things or splitting once youre aware of this work to accept them and work through them instead of pushing them away and splitting completely in the opposite direction acknowledge that your feelings are just thoughts and at the end of the day you control your own thoughts remind yourself that although your reactions may be severe your feelings are valid meditate this is continuous work but it is possiblen__label__0 someone suggested worthy as you are by durgadas allon duriel and one called tarot for troubled times by shaheen miro and theresa reed i have been journaling a lot lately and trying to be really honest with how i answer the jounaling prompts that the books give i am by no means doing wellbut i think im starting the process of untangling the knot that is my emotions and feelings etc i feel like if i can get to the root of my problems it will make it easier to weather the emotional storms i get because i will hopefully have a better understanding of why some of them are caused one of the things i have appreciated about worthy as you are is durgadas talks about having compassion for ourselves and to talk to ourselves as if we were a dear friend who was going through the same thing i have made some really surprising discoveries about myself by journaling that way i think its slow progress but it is progress i wish you so much luck op sending you love and lightn__label__1 so i wouldnt say im healed but i am the most stable ive ever been and most of that is due to my own hard work i had an amazing therapist for a few months that helped me open my eyes to what i was actually struggling with i had a hard time admitting that i was very emotional and had intense ups and downs for example she ended up retiring and after that i got an awful therapist that literally said i would never get better never get a job never move out and that it was all in my head i quit therapy after that kind of impulsively got a job and moved out the house as soon as possible and its the best thing i couldve done moving out of my old toxic household and being able to put up massive boundaries gave me space to work on myself i still have massive mood swings and sometimes i still turn to self harming behavior and the fear of abandonment is still very much there but i can deal with a lot of it and a big thing that has helped me is acknowledging my feelings and allowing myself to feel them and recover from them i also want to mention that i have an amazing partner that is incredibly understanding weve learned to communicate extremely well which has helped tonsn__label__1 not selftreated or healed but hoping to grow out of it in time blessings and love friendn__label__0 i have made significant improvement over the course of years i did intense acting exercises and was screamed by my teachers so that taught me emotional vulnerability however there is still very persistent symptomsn__label__2 i cant afford therapy at the moment and i need to be careful with looking for the right therapist as well i used to be in a homosexual relationship with my fp which was also a poly relationship my country is very christian and antilgbt so im basically walking on a minefield looking for the right therapist gives me heavy anxiety because of that so until i get enough strength to do it im trying to heal myself on my ownim trying to watch out for my splitting and my episodes but ngl its difficult as hell my fp is a very understanding person but she recently cut me off to focus on her own mental health which i involuntarily took a big part in destroyingnot gonna lie this situation is really hard to get through i split constantly and even experience panic attacks because i dont even know how shes doing or when or if shes going to come backthe only thing i can do at the moment is keep on working on myself and healing myself im going through the dbt book currently and im doing everything i can to avoid my triggers i get my low moments often but i find that reassuring posts on this subreddit often help feeling better even if just slightly it helps more than hearing that stuff from people whos never had to deal with bpd i know that we can all relate here so i think its good that we can all give each other some reassurance and supportthere is certainly hope as long as youre willing to work on yourself its going to be a long and hard work you will often feel like you cant do it anymore or that its not working im going through that as well but ive noticed that some things have changed for good and that keeps pushing me not to give upwishing you all the best in your battle and please stay strongn__label__1 i tried without doctor intervention but i found for me at least that its not something i can do on my own i lack the insight and full awareness that a doctortherapist provides even though i was well aware of the symptoms and condition i never knew how to actually stop the train im sure its possible though but personally i wouldnt bank on it unless youre confident in yourselfn__label__0 tbh not my case i was totally out of control without professional help going to therapy getting diagnosed properly medicated and getting an healthy support group was the only way i could start to feel normali still have my ups and downs healing is not just healing its a long time work especially for people like us but im proud of my workthats not to say that people cant heal by themselves but i truly believe it takes a lot more time and strength to do it bc in my case youre almost forced to healim proud of everyone who makes effort to heal in any wayn__label__3 if money is an issue you can see if a local university has a dbt program thats how i was able to get treatment they let you pick how much you pay a sessionn__label__0 didnt heal but managed for several years with the help of yoga and meditation yogic philosophy buddhism and the beautiful communities that exist around those thingsrelapsed when i thought i was healed and stopped doing the important spiritual workn__label__0 yea by using natures medicinen__label__0 my abusive fp died and i healedn__label__0 thanks for your reply is that the green book on amazonn__label__0 yes this one also i collected these infographics that can be helpful during an episode maybe it will help you toon__label__0 thanks so muchn__label__0 i wish i could find a pdf copy of this book looks goodn__label__0 hehen__label__0 i love un__label__0 bless youn__label__0 it sounds like this professional has a very narrow perspective about disorders autism is a spectrum and people experience bpd in a variety of different ways sure some people with bpd have a lot of partners but thats not everyone they definitely should have asked far more open questions about symptoms and behaviors something like what does impulsive behavior look like to you or have you self harmed or explain to me how you view yourself and your place in the world im sorry for your experience if you can find someone new somehow i really think you should maybe you can even see a different doctor within the same building or company i might even recommend reaching out to their supervisor if you want to bring up your concerns good luck friendn__label__0 with bpd there are main types and its also a spectrum just like autism and also with the main types theres so many literally thousands of combinations to officially diagnose you just need to meet the criteria but dont hvw to experience every symptomn__label__0 also your english is great cn__label__0 i was afraid that i was being too pick but apparently he really was being inflexible about the spectrum of these disorders i will try look for another doctor thank youn__label__0 i was thinking that too during the appointment i will try look for other doctors that really understand about bpd and dont judge the people with disorder as promiscuous and deviousn__label__0 thank youn__label__0 every since i microdosed on acid i thought hard n i stopped wanting to kill myself outside of depression episodes so take from that what you willn__label__1 the journey can be very hard and comes with a significant risk of suicide and traumaalso many of the south american retreats have been shown repeatedly to be more of a money grab than actual healing centres this can create an environment adverse to mental health during such a vulnerable time as the healingvisit or post in rayahuasca for a more indepth conversation with the communityn__label__0 ive done kambo several times but not ayahuasca heard a lot about ayahuasca and want to try it as well a lot of people do kambo right before ayahuasca as well you dont trip in any sort of way with kambo but it is like a reset for some people i didnt notice a big enough difference to justify puking or shitting my guts out for an hour you do get more clearheaded i guessn__label__1 i want to do it again i did it one time and it healed how i saw my mother from what i read one time isnt enough one has to do several days and be in therapy with a nurturing counselor dbt is helping too but i feel my brain is going back to hating myself im thinking about going to rhytmia in costa rica this study made me want to do it againn__label__1 ive done acid a few times recreationally while i see the potential to help with such problems on other individuals it never did that for me its always been more like a have a good time drug ayahuasca on the other hand is not fun not ever you mostly spend the night puking and journeying into the depths of your subconscious which is always scary and will always constitute what some might call a bad trip its why people travel thousands of miles into the amazon for it instead of just going to amsterdam lol i just so happen to be in the region so i thought why notn__label__0 thanks ive been researching it nonstop this last week blogs youtube videos netflix documentaries points of view from users scientists everything from what i see the main danger like what actually killed tourists in the amazon are those tobacco preparations which i will respectfully refuse when and if offered im vetting the place im going to looking for reviews and stories to see if theres anything off with it unfortunately its hard to find a noncommercial place to do it a commercial institution still is better than doing it by yourself tho the most you can hope for is an entrepreneur shaman with morals and who actually knows what hes doingn__label__0 honestly if it were me id do it just to be able to say i didn__label__0 yes the main danger of the ceremony itself is the tobacco purge however the suicide risk in the days and months following is also highn__label__1 i turn next month and already almost feel like i hit that point too i get u im exhausted i finally got over this guy who just hurt me and id let him id keep going back i said no more find someone else and just leave me alone i used to obsess over him such a weight off my chest not interested at all either treat me properly how i treat you or leave me the fuck alone im over it i fuckin feel you girln__label__0 there are illnesses and there are personality traits one may be diagnosed with an illness bpd is an illness according to the nimh but having traits recognized is not called being diagnosed emotional dysregulation is a range of emotional responses that do not lie within a desirable scope of emotive response considering the stimuli and is present in bpd but one may present emotional dysregulation outside of an illness some might call it a trait many people seek official diagnoses for various purposes perhaps for your purposes a diagnostic is not essential perhaps you can just have conversations about how you feel your emotional responses are way too strong and have that as a conversation starting pointn__label__4 i didnt state all that i have experienced because this post was not asking for help self diagnosing or for asking what kind of treatment i need if i have a diagnosis maybe i can get help i dont know but the meds ive tried arnt working and i have talked to four therapists i guess i was hoping for some words of wisdom or encouragement sorry that was unclearn__label__0 i thought you were asking how to talk with your fp what exactly are you askingn__label__0 yes but its hard as heck it just takes practice im good for weeks but then i have relapses during stressful moments i just try to cope without bringing anyone down and just sit alone in a quiet room and try to calm down breathing to calm down exercise and sleep are super important eating well and overall good health bc when we feel good we can cope bettern__label__0 adaptogens stack themn__label__4 is there any way to feel better like a specific type of meditation or something like that i mean theres dbt skills those take a lot of practice but are considered to be the most effective treatment for bpd including in comparison to medicationn__label__0 wowi love this this was so insightful and gave me some hope this was beautiful op thank youn__label__0 this is really interesting and helpful can you explain mhow relationships are a vehicle for a full expression of your self i think i know what you mean but i want to be sure thanksn__label__0 underrated and interesting insight i am on this path too i think there can be small glimmers of light and we have to take what we can but also just experience life as a wholen__label__0 there was a post yesterday about falling for other broken people people who struggle with mental health etc i think it connects to the end here about sharing pain good postn__label__0 damn the mom as an emotional vacuum hits right where it hurts thats great insight opn__label__0 thanks op i genuinely felt my problems regarding a recent incident in which a girl blocked me i thought it was her which was making me complete or accompany me as a friend but after time i realised that its not her its me actually whos empty from inside and after your thoughts i am fully aware of what was the problemonce again thanksn__label__0 n__label__0 whoa i like that seems like that perspective has the power to relieve so much struggle from relationships thanksn__label__0 bpd can very easily prompt abusive behavior just like a lot of things however what you described in this specific instance seems like the beginning of recovery and management of his emotions i get that it can hurt to hear what was said because of what that would mean normally but take a look at it because it really seems like he isnt saying i hate you but im feeling an emotion like hate that doesnt make sense given who you are and wants to get some space to responsibly process it thats like what nonabusive bpd hinges on his recovery and your sanity rely on you setting boundaries for your own safety and happiness seems like your relationship with your sister does toon__label__0 it really depends because you dont go into a lot of detail your sister is right that if he is abusive then you should leave him borderline or not if hes not actually abusive then yeah your sister should stay out of itn__label__0 hi therefirst off i want you to know how proud we are that you are reaching out it takes a strong person to ask for help let me give you a little bit of insight splitting is a very hard thing to get over for most of us for example i was on the phone with my girlfriend and i saw she was on her phone while we were facetiming and i got paranoid and i thought she was talking to other guys i started to split i started to give her the cold shoulder now one thing that you must know is splitting stems from a fear of rejection or abandonment i split because i felt like whoever she was talking to she wasnt could take her away from me and i felt defensive but she explained to me she was texting her aunt i felt horrible i started to apologize frantically and i was scared she would leave me its a very common thing now i know it puts alot of pressure onto you as his so so i have a suggestionreassure him most people split because they would much rather be the one who distances themselves rather than someone else leaving maybe keep a journal that you both write in and use your thoughts to help build communicationi hope this helps if you need any advice dm men__label__1 bpd can easily cause abusive behaviors most mental disorders especially clusterb are known to do this when theyre not managed properlyit sounds like youre aware your boyfriend behavior is harmful and not ok but you are confident that a youve got a handle on it and arent being exposed to anything you cant handle or which might cause you longterm psychological harm b that your boyfriend is also taking accountability for his behavior and committed to a path where this behavior should be improvingit might be helpful to move away from the term abuse or abuser which is an emotionally loaded term with strong moral undertones we conceptualize abusers as bad people who willfully cause harm not sick people who unintentionally cause harm your sister might be hung up by the fact that you refusing to identify him as an abuser means you are in denial about what love is supposed to look likethe harm hes causing and you seem to be aware of both those things but are extremely hesitant to use a word like abuse becuase you dont feel like its fair to demonize someone who from your perspective is on the right path and dong the right thingit might help to establish some if this happens then i will step back from the situation boundaries your sister might just need to hear you arent some battered woman in denial who will stay up until the point shes beaten to death no offense but someone willing to get into a relationship with unmanaged and undiagnosed bpd probably has their own concerning history of past romantic or life choice that also might be making your sister feel like you have bad taste in men or make bad choices when im sick i dont usually find myself surrounded by well rounded morally good healthy people ya know it tends to be fellow sick people predators and chronic enablers so your sister might just need to see what differentiates you from an enabler by seeing that you do have a grasp of what isisnt going on and what you expect to see from your boyfriend to be comfortable that hes taking meaningful strides to recovery because a lot of people especially women have a tendency to become martyrs in order to take of mentally ill partners and likeyoure not a doctor that is not your job so if your sister has a reason to suspect thats what youre doing then shes right to be concernedtelling her its not her business and youre an adult is exactly what battered women say so i suspect youre getting defensive and shutting the convo down which is just even more triggering her my sister is in denial and going to get herself hurt bat signal maybe talk about what boundaries and means of protection youre instituting and what youre doing to maintain your own healthlike for instance even just being the partner to someone who is on a recovery journal is itself a huge thing so you should probably either be in therapy or some kind of guided support group becuase stuff like this can turn sideways very quickly not cause your boyfriend is bad but because recovery is not linear and when people can backslide it can be swift and brutal and your sister will probably be very reassured to see that you arent just blindly trusting your own gut but instead relying on a more formalized and professional degree of oversight and again dealing with the residual side effects of being around the mentally ill absolutely is serious enough on its own that you probably would benefit a lot from your own therapy through this process cause even if your boyfriend is an absolute allstar at recoveryits still a pretty slow and arduous journeyn__label__0 having bpd doesnt excuse abuse i have bpd and say things i dont mean but i feel guilt apologize and try to change my behaviorn__label__0 if one gets damaged by somebody elses behavior it doesnt really matter why they behaved that way what matters is that one got damaged by that person and one needs to do something constructive to prevent that from happening againn__label__0 i think this is going to take a lot of communication on both parts he has to put in the work to control his intrusive thoughts and avoid lashing out at you from impulse and like in any relationship you have to be careful about venting to family members when you need to talk about your issues talk with him about it i know thats not easy because bpd makes him sensitive but he needs to work on allowing you to feel safe to work through these things the hardest part is that it does take time so youll have to be the judge of whether or not hes making improvements or using his diagnosis as a crutch to be abusiven__label__1 how does he treat you while splittingn__label__0 a relationship is a benefit not a right if your boyfriend has work to do before being a good boyfriend then break up until he does the workn__label__0 well if things have been like this for a while and you somehow involve your sister when it happens asking advice or venting then she will create her own opinion if the same pattern just repeats maybe she is simply tired of hearing about it and is in a heavy handed way trying to solve her own issueits your relationship but she is allowed her own opinion you just dont have to put weight on it thoughn__label__0 splitting is abusive he hurt you you cant expect your family to like him and support your relationship if he hurts youn__label__1 dont tell your sister abt your relationship anymore if you need someone to talk to talk to a therapist familiar with bpd or a support group or here on this sub even honestly my partner talking with her family and friends abt me made everything times worsen__label__0 your sister needs to grow upn__label__0 i split a lot but i refuse to tell my partner for this reason alone it hurts them i try my hardest to keep my toxic thoughts away from my partner thats his first lesson not to be open with splitting its hurtful and can hurt the partner big time and usually the feeling goes away splitting is hard and havingbpd is incredibly hard your sister doesnt understand mental illness and instead of judging she should do her researchn__label__3 obviously i only know what is being said here but as a person who has found myself in two abusive relationships people on the outside tend to have a better perspective my first relationship was physically and verbally abusive the second was emotionally abusive and a lot harder to see the scary thing is even the first one i was in denial about because he was always drunk and i made excuses for him i have bpd and i am in dbt it is no excuse for the silent treatment gaslighting etc if he is communicating and working on himself then second chances are always nice if it is not psychologically damaging youn__label__0 this is a very good point he is doing well trying to manage himself and identify where it is the illness talking and when it is his true feelings it is important to try and avoid taking it personally because it isnt personal he seems pretty well rounded to be able to word it in a softer way as wellthat said if you ever feel too overwhelmed you should tell him if you need a break from it toon__label__0 emotionally abusive would be a better term for it he is supportive of my goals pushes me to be better never calls me names or anything an otherwise emotionally abusive person would do but the splitting is what my sister sees as abusen__label__0 just like ops boyfriend thenn__label__0 very distant avoids physical contact completely he is also cold when texting and way more sensitive than normally he will get offended very easily and pick a fight he will also be unable to fall asleep next to men__label__0 splitting abusive inherently splitting is the emotions we feel its possible to deal with or express those emotions in ways that arent abusive mean maybe sure but that isnt all abuse iswhen i split i get super bitchy moody and pretty hostile thats not good by any means but its not necessarily abusive and in my case because ive had some therapy i can usually manage to pry myself out of being ready to maim whoever im splitting on and communicate as best i can i am feeling unreasonably angry towards you right now and this is what triggered itop said her bf said i feel like i hate you right now and said he needed space he was splitting on her and he told her he was splitting and made sure to remove himself instead of getting involved and being upset at her how is that abusive thats the like ideal way to resolve splitting in a romantic relationship being mean or cold or bitchy abusive it absolutely can escalate there but plenty of people are mean to each other all the time and its not abuse thats a really heavy word that means specific things op has said in other comments hes not controlling at all hes very supportive and overall a good partner and he apologizes for his splitting and takes responsibility for it nothing about this reads as abusiveyour comment here is doing nothing but furthering the already incredibly hard to shake stigma of bpd being inherently abusive splitting is something most pwbpd experience are you saying everyone with bpd is abusiven__label__0 this is dangerous advice when a woman stops telling her family about the abusive things her boyfriend does to protect him she has one foot in the grave if you are worried about the way youll be perceived by your sos family there is probably something wrong with your behavior and bpd is not an excusen__label__1 splitting isnt abuse its unfortunately something a lot of people with bpd have if hes not abusive in any way then this is just his bpd talking one thing is if he doesnt stay on meds or doesnt want them he will never get bettern__label__0 yes exactly i think that if he truly feels guilt and is actively working on the behavior and not using bpd as an excuse then i wouldnt call or abusen__label__0 thats abusive read why does he do that by lundy bancroft leave himi have bpd i split on my boyfriend when i split on him i tell him that im not feeling well and will be quiet for a while sometimes i cry and he has to say its ok sometimes he has to bring me a tea sometimes after ive recovered we have to talk about what happened which always makes both of us feel betterbeing cold picking a fight refusing to sleep next to someone none of that is a symptom of bpd or acceptable in a relationship its an early stage of emotional abuse it will get worse if you stayagain splitting is a symptom of bpd but what you do when you split is an expression of your character he is showing you that he is a mean personn__label__0 you know family can be abusive as well and controlling relationships is often a component of abusen__label__1 i disagree its unhealthy in any relationship to tell your family and friends about private things i didnt tell op to stop talking just stop talking to people who have no issue stealing away their autonomy a therapist who knows a bpd or group support is better because people with bpd are continually discriminated against op clearly wants to figure out how to be with their partner i dont see how talking to people who dont understand bpd are gonna help at alln__label__0 i think you should reconsider if you have bpd you know rejection is a trigger and family and friends of partners that continually reject you is detrimental to a person with bpd do you not feel that wayn__label__1 there isnt a med for bpd no med will make someone stop splitting only therapy can help with that meds can help alleviate the depression and anxiety that often is associated with bpd but thats just a bandaid for those particular symptoms not a longterm solutionn__label__1 hold on are you saying that the only help for someone with bpd is medsn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 til im emotionally abusiven__label__1 not all people with bpd that split act like this and that doesnt mean its abusive he clearly knows he needs help and that its wrong just doing all that without bpd and no remorse is abusive i sometimes pick fights im splitting right now next to him and i have so much anger and just want to be alone i usually do the cold shoulder and just want space rather than speak to himknowing ill get over it in an hour or soso no its not abusive considering ops bf sounds like he treats her overall really welln__label__0 then youre a very lucky person with bpdn__label__1 sounds like youre splitting your manipulative tendencies to order your indectured servan i mean boyfriend to cater to all of your needs you kind of sound like a sociopath thats attempting to blend in with the bpd community hows that helping you tea sippern__label__1 i didnt tell op to stop talking just stop talking to people who have no issue stealing away their autonomywell that just sounds like paranoia which you know is a symptom of bpd if you are in a relationship with a mentally ill person you have to keep the lines of communication open with your family about that they have to know how youre doing how your partner is doing and how theyre treating you thats not a betrayal of the partner thats just a healthy thing to doive been the mentally ill person who doesnt want anyone talking about them it sucks to feel condescended to and managed but its not really avoidable and the alternative to have no one keeping tabs is dangerous for you and your partnern__label__1 well i never said that there was a medicine for splitting hence why i told them therapy and meds helpn__label__1 it definitely helps most people without bpd need meds same goes for bipolar im sure theres people who dont have it as bad but for a lot bpd has no cure and yes if your diagnosed you should be on meds especially ops bfif someone doesnt want to be on meds and is showing many signs of bpd thats just plain toxic and you want to stay clear from people like that i mean think if someone with very clear issues refuses any help then theyll continue to suffer and hurt othersn__label__0 thats cooln__label__0 i disagree i dont believe that participating in my recovery and not abusing people makes me lucky i think it makes me pretty average actually lets be clear abusive bpd sufferers are not the norm bpd isnt an excuse for any kind of bad behaviorn__label__0 im proving advice to op as someone with bpd and as someone who struggles with family and friends of my partner rejecting me i dont matter to these people only my so matters i dont think its healthy for her family and friends hear things out of context about me and them telling her she deserves better because i am emotional at times and struggle to relate to her and i struggle with wanting to exist at times she knows its because i am struggling and i love her and she knows i dont abuse her her family doesnt care if im actually abusing her her family is abusive and controlling im notn__label__0 deletedn__label__1 most people with bpd need medsthe only thing that my pill provider will let me take is something for the anxiety she has told me over and over that i dont show a need for anything else id love to be on a mood stabilizer i really would this shit is exhausting and tbh id be ok with being a zombie for a while just to get a few weeks of freedom from the heaviness of existingn__label__6 meds are not the end all be all and plenty of people simply do not feel better on psychiatric medication i would say if somebody is unwilling to try medication that may be a red flag but i refuse to take medication personally because i was medicated for many years on many different meds and none of them helped they all didnt do anything or made me worsetherapy is by far the best treatment for bpd because its a personality disorder medication isnt a frontline treatment for it you might take meds to cope with comorbid issues depression and anxiety are common in us afterall or if its very extreme you may want to be on mood stabilizers but thats still a pretty strong medication with many possible side effects that will not be for everyone hell not even for most peoplepsychiatric medication is not a cureall and especially not for things like bpd that are the result of longlasting and ongoing trauma and neglect if they work for you thats great but saying that if somebody is diagnosed w bpd they need to be medicated is really ignorant and harmful to say people with bpd need whatever treatment works for themn__label__1 what kind of medication do you think works best for a personality disorder like borderlinen__label__0 no it isnt but you cant deny other peoples experiences of behaving abusively just because you dontn__label__1 its in the thread so yes i did say thatidc if people are mad at me oh well i said what i said its my opinion oh welli said it hours ago as someone who does suffer therapy and meds help but they go hand in handif it doesnt work for you okay not my problemn__label__3 honestly taking a mood stabilizer has helped me a lot anti depressants always made me worse then i started taking lamotrigine i actually dont experience the zombie effect i still have extreme highs and lows and even have wondered if the meds made a difference at all but my bf says they have i am also in therapy and recently diagnosed adhd and working on getting medication for that as welln__label__1 i think a lot of people with severe bpd need meds thats an opinion dont really have to like itmeds keep people stable regardless if its bpd meds people with mental illness need meds and therapy its not a bad thing it helps with improvement so downvote me all you want lmao but meds keeps people stable to work on themselves as they shouldn__label__1 again never said it was a cure all i legit said meds and therapy please read it before repeating exactly what ive saidas someone whose been on meds it keeps people stable to be able to improve yourself with therapy of course not everyone needs meds sure but a damn lot do and i think ops bf does as too and therapy if someone is unwilling the get help or take meds when its needed then yes thats intensively toxic and they will not get better hence why i said most not all if you dont need meds then my comment has nothing to do with youalso stop looking at meds as some awful negative thing if i say most people with severe bpd need meds then yes they need meds especially if they are unstable meds keep people stable for the most part hence why i said most and not all but again your allowed to have your opinion and i have mine as welln__label__1 you need a psychiatrist for that no one on reddit can help you with that considering that meds affect everyone differentlyn__label__1 seroquel puts you to sleep for hours a day less risk to yourself and others sleep life awayn__label__1 why do you think ops bf does he seems pretty stable right now why do you think he has severe bpd why do you think hes unstablemost people i know who have been on psychiatric medication has hated it and felt better once they were no longer forced to take them youre out of your mind if you think psychiatry medicates severely mentally ill people out of compassion and not out of a want to control people and their lives im very envious of you having never experiencing psychiatric abuse for you to feel so strongly that you can trust a psychiatristn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 i have borderline and i am not medicated does that mean im doomedn__label__1 well maybe i guess im lucky that i have a great psychiatrist and therapist guess not all have that but i do and everything ive stated is my view again downvote me its my opinion we can all disagree on thingsyou writing paragraphs on the other hand wont change my mind its my view thats all it isn__label__0 okay it doesnt work for you cool hence why ive already said it doesnt work for all but it does for somemost if it doesnt work for you then good for youn__label__1 your asking me too much this is all for a psychiatrist they are there to help and guide you therapy and meds helpsn__label__1 i was just asking because you said that if this person whom you dont know that has bpd is not on meds or doesnt stay on them hell never get better which seemed very absolute to me i reasonably i think took that to mean that you were under the impression that people with borderline need to be medicated in order to get better just wanted some clarificationn__label__1 its called an opinion and thats my view on it if someone has severe bpd and is awful and emotionally abusive then yes they need therapy and meds i feel doomed and im unmedicated hence why i said its my opinion i still stand by my point honestlyn__label__1 are you in therapy according to my psychiatrist its possible to live with bpd and not take meds but this is different from person to person my advice would be to find a good psychiatrist who can evaluate this for you its not something strangers from the internet can give you a good answer to neither can mothers in law etcn__label__3 if going off meds isnt beneficial try a different med youve been on the same one for years how do you know its even working i switched my meds about a year ago and its been life changing for my depressive thoughts i dont feel sad anymore and i didnt know that was possiblealsofuck your family for saying your addicted to antidepressants taking medication for a medical condition shouldnt result in being shamed ive been on meds since i was and im almost with no plans to ever stop i need pills to liven__label__1 ive seen a psychologist twice now who recommend dbt group therapy but i cant currently afford the week program for it ill look into a psychiatrist for the medicinal aspect however in the meantime thank youn__label__1 prior to this i didnt have intentions to stop i feel im also one of those people who will be dependant on them lifelong but i suppose ill find out shortly lol thank you for the support as to their opinionsi tell myself similar daily but its so hard for me to shake off and ignore which is annoying afwere you scared to switch meds when you didn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 i understand what you mean its important to not base your self worth on others gesturesmoods you are an important kind person who deserves everything good to you i know its hard and i relate sm to what youre saying but never undervalue yourselfn__label__0 i totally get thatn__label__0 thank youn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 yeah dennis definitely has npd that annoyed me so muchbut mac definitely has bpd he is impulsive has very intense mood swings and yelling fits is also very emotional all the time has pretty fluctuating identity being confused abt himself esp w being gay he has bad body image issues is an alcoholic and big abandonment issues having dennis check in w him feeling like his close friends dont value him he also had a shitty childhood which isnt a bpd thing but is common to us w bpd unfortunately him being diagnosed w anything doesnt fit as well into the story as it did w dennis pn__label__1 dennis seems waaaay more narcissistic if you ask me also a bit of a sociopath the whole gangs fucked up thoughn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 it took me by surprise too not a chance hes bpd npd or aspd perhaps definitely not bpdn__label__0 its always sunny is probably my favourite comedy dennis is definitely not borderline and it really upset me that they were so lazy i adore the show but sometimes the humour is justthey should do bettern__label__0 dennis being diagnosed with bpd annoyed me so much seeing as i dont think it he fits the criteria at all npd yes most certainly but not bpd i know its just a comedy and a ridiculous one at that so its silly to be annoyed by it but i guess you cant help how you feeln__label__0 dennis is a narcissist he probably would be comorbid with bpd i feel like im dennis with elements of charlie and frank the disgusting partsi love that show so fucking muchn__label__1 he seems like an npdsociopath to me reminds me of someone i dated who idolized this charactern__label__0 best sub reddit for this shown__label__0 well i have bpd and npd and tbh i see a lot of myself in dennis that said i cant see him ever self harmingn__label__0 thats more like what i was thinking too ive seen every episode multiple times and i was trying to think back on all of the dennis moments and i was thinking the same thing about npdn__label__0 makes total sensen__label__0 omg yes mac has bpdn__label__0 yeah thats what i was thinking toon__label__0 do you know anything specific that mac has done that seems like bpdn__label__0 youre right it is just a comedy but it doesnt make it feel any less weird hahn__label__0 ive always felt that i had a bit of charlie in my personality too or at least in my mind hahan__label__0 i actually havent even looked for one i dont know why i haventn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 deletedn__label__0 late as fuck but riasipn__label__0 ive just started season because its on netflix and im already seeing dennis kind of blossom in to his character role hes definitely a lot more vocal about his issues already and even in his makeuphair you can see how much he is aged and looks a little like suffering from something i noticed it in the very first episode more like the second because the first one they are all really drunk anyway hes looking gray and he has bags under his eyesn__label__0 that makes sensen__label__0 deletedn__label__0 im definitely thinking the same thing i feel like there has to be some sort of break down for him in the endn__label__0 this post has been marked as a venting post please be aware that the op may not be seeking

quality of life is part of a doctors jobn__label__0 im on it hasnt affected my appetite at alln__label__0 thank youn__label__0 thanks for your reply i honestly understand that its just really triggering for men__label__0 thanksn__label__0 you wont know like a month and a half in and everyones different son__label__2 im on a low dose of lexipro and it definitely helps with the overall depression and having more spoons to deal with the breakdowns but it doesnt stop the breakdowns themselvesso to answer your questions directlymy thoughts are the same i get just as paranoid about people judging me or my spouse hating me or whateverthey dont change who you are if the dose is too high then yeah it can mute you but thats not the goal and you can adjust your meds if you dont like themi think they help like i said i still get the emotional spirals and emptiness but because my overall mood is buffered a little i have more spoons to deal with the negatives of this disorder there are side effects that arent horrible but you have to kinda see what you get out of the grab bag and decide if the benefits are worth the side effectsn__label__3 im not currently diagnosed with bpd i was diagnosed as bipolar depressive which i believe is incorrect but i have a friend that is diagnosed and shes on similar medsmy main medication right now is lamictal it stabilizes my mood to the point where i can function in my daily life without constantly busting out into tears or seething with anger it doesnt always work well and when it does it may work too well an example of this is that i was barely able to shed a tear on my wedding day they do not do anything for the rest of my symptoms as far a debilitating behaviors like impulsivity and thoughts like paranoia but at least im functioning im sure they will have you on a few different cocktails until youve leveled out just keep going and try not to let this illness define youn__label__0 they are necessary for my mental well being and emotional balancen__label__3 depends on which one you take i took lexapro and didnt tell my friends and they were always questioning me because i was super empty and tired i couldnt stop sleeping i couldnt cry i wasnt high or low i was just there i think it was good for that point of my life but i got off of them as soon as i felt like i turned around i was not dx bpd yet and still had a few episodes after thisi started wellbutrin over summer and its like night and day i feel a ton better no depression but i do still get sad and i cry but not like so sad i cant get out of bed i feel happy and sometimes i feel a little too happy downfall was the period where i was getting used to it and my anxiety went through the roof also my sleep patterns are awful now wake up every night around am wide awake but im not sure if its antidepressants not really leaving the house much because of covid or bothboth did wonders with my impulse control though i drank on lexapro and dont do that i dont drink now and i think its better that wayn__label__2 im on mg of ciraplex with ativan on hand for emergencies which i havent used or refilled on a long time now i made the mistake of not taking my meds recently and ive been off the rails for me my meds help me a lot it feels like the load off my shoulders is lightened i feel happier well adjusted and the thoughts arent so daunting and dark im not like this toxic positive person either i just feel like i finally have balance i strongly recommend it and urge people to try different kinds and youll find the right one that works for you especially with the right dosagen__label__1 side effects such as are you experiencing anythank youn__label__2 im also on lamictal but i just started a few days ago i agree that the paranoia is still there but ive seen some improvement in being able to control my behaviors im a very angry person i still get angry but im able to stop myself from acting out nowi chose to start medication because my symptoms were starting to significantly impact my ability to function in life i would weigh your pros and cons for me i had nothing to lose so its only been positiven__label__0 what do you mean by thoughts like paranoian__label__0 i cant nut and its awfulbut other than that its p goodn__label__0 well im not sure that everyone experiences this but i will walk into a store and think that everyone hates me or thinks im weird and wants me to leave im hyper aware of what people are doing around me and my brain always interprets it as hostile at work when people whisper i feel like they are talking about me everytime it feels like im an alien walking around on earthn__label__3 snris did this to me horribly they gave me wellbutrin and it did seem to help it felt a little different to nut on it but its way better than not even being able to keep it upn__label__1 i reduced my dosage so were gonna see what happens people told me it is easier on wellbutrin so im gonna try that if its not working stilln__label__3 effexor did it to me thats when they gave me it the first time i got on a different snri a few months later and this time i couldnt nut after only taking it a couple days the effexor took some time for those side effects to comei know how incredibly frustrating it is though like im not really a sexual person outwardly anyways but damnit i need to take care of myself haha i feel for you mann__label__0 im a times a say kinda girl so it suuuuucksn__label__1 oh im sorry i thought you were a male since you said you couldnt nutim not sure how the wellbutrin would work for you then the issues that kept me from doing it dont really apply to you haha id at least let your psych know or whoever it is that you see just to get the ball rollingn__label__2 can relate been on different medications and years of therapy i wont give up but this is starting to feel like a scamn__label__0 welcome sounds like youre already heading in the right direction i wish you the best of
