       " '__label__0 i wish i had a better answer for this but ill speak from the heart not sure if itll make sense it is easy to be filled with loneliness when we are trapped inside four walls the loneliness is like an object a feeling that fills us up if you really look at it the loneliness isnt absence but a ball of emptiness it is easier to be filled with yourself when youre engaged in some difficult task usually in isolation like hiking or rock climbing or wood working or painting spend more time fully engaged with the self in some task that requires the totality of your concentration and then youll feel full of yourself',\n",
       " '__label__0 hmm the two main features i would try to describe are emotional lability people with bpd literally experience more intense emotions than the normal person so it is like an amplifier of emotions both negative and positive you feel deeply in love and youre devastated by rejection my take on bpd is that it is a core lack of sense of self if we think about who we are when i was years old i was still me even though my body is different i was me before i was a father and after i was a father im still me xbso most human beings have a sense of transcendent identity we look different we talk different we become rich or poor we become married or divorced but were still mein bpd that meness is missing so who we feel like we are is defined by our circumstances',\n",

       " '__label__0 i love this questioni think that the more we go into deeper spiritual practices the more benefit people with bpd will see the key thing about some spiritual practices is that they help us discover the true self this is precisely what people with bpd are missing interestingly enough i sometimes wonder if people with bpd are the most karmically spiritual what i mean by that is that most people have a karma where they arent forced to learn meditation they can go through their lives bumbling along being secure in themselves and are just sort of chillin but people with bpd are forced into learning these skills their karma demands it and thus they end up on a profound spiritual path which is what ive seen in my practice putting the bpd in remission is just the tutorial',\n",

       " '__label__0 i dont know if this was answered but ill try to answer it as i had the same question a year ago the answer is no at least not without years of therapy the reason being is that the fp to a borderline is a toxic codependent relationship no relationship can be healthy when one person expects the other to be the center of their world and pins their happiness and wellbeing on them as a person with bpd you have to learn to care and love for yourself before you can have a chance at a healthy attachment and relationship make yourself your favorite person and not someone else hope that helps',\n",

       " '__label__5 lotta great questions lets go through a few of themhow does stimulant medication help stabilize emotions stimulant medication stimulates our frontal lobes which can inhibit our emotional circuitry when we get our emotions under control our frontal lobes control circuitsare slamming the breaks on our limbic system emotional circuits stimulants strengthen the brains ability to regulate emotions and impulses as for the question of bpd and childhood diagnosis this gets a bit tricky to my knowledge there is no age requirement for the diagnosis of bpd in the dsm that being said i would be reluctant to diagnose a personality disorder outside of conduct disorder in adolescence simply because personality changes drastically during adolescence we think about bpd as an established personality but personality is so fluid throughout our teenage years that the dust hasnt settled which makes a diagnosis potentially problematic that being said there is very good evidence that early intervention in adolescence is really important at helping kids so even if there isnt a diagnosis of bpd i think it is reasonable to help a kid with a traumatic upbringing the treatment may be very similar to treatment for bpd whether there is a diagnosis or not such as dbt mindfulness psychotherapy etc last question is what is the difference between bipolar disorder and bpd bipolar disorder is a mood disorder where moods persist for some amount of time weeks to months and in the case of rapid cycling still weeks iirc the definition of rapid cycling is at least episodes in year in bpd we see a lot of emotional lability over the course of minutes to days the other big difference is that the emotional lability in bpd is often heavily influenced by external circumstances whereas with bipolar disorder it can even be completely independent of those circumstances',\n",
       " '__label__6 ahmm what an interesting clinical presentation if i was teaching a class and we were reviewing a case heres how i would teach itso a few general things mood stabilizers can absolutely cause fatigue to be worse so what can we do as clinicians patients use mood stabilizers especially things like lamotrigine to help manage emotional dysregulation so if mood stabilizer is causing fatigue one thing we could do is build up nonpharmacologic skills meditation dbt to manage emotional dysregulation or psychotherapy to manage the roots of the emotional dysregulation once we have those on board you can pull the mood stabilizer down or off this should help with the fatigue i would then ask the class what other considerations are there in a patient like this what would you want to rule out optimizethe student who says people with bpd and adhd are both prone to substance use and substance use can lead to fatigue over time so id want to check for their level of substance use and ideally help them remove stimulants and sedatives from regular usealso want to make sure pcos treatment is optimally managed and lastly what has direct benefits for fatigue we want to make sure we do a good differential cbc for anemia checking tsh etc and optimize those things most students should get to there on their own then id ask my last questionafter we do all that are there any evidence based interventions we could use to improve adhd bpd and fatigueand the answer is mindbody practices like yoga or tai chi',\n",
