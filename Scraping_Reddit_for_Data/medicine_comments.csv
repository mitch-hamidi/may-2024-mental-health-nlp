0,"Medication isn't used for BPD. There is no approved medication for BPD. You must be being medication for symptoms or conditions CAUSED by the BPD. I feel for you, it's a lot all at once and then they just hand you prescriptions and say take this. You don't ask and they don't explain. You are not the only. This subreddit is filled with people who think they are taking medication for their BPD. They are not. You need to speak to your doctor about what the medication is and what specifically is he prescribing it to you. But your BPD will never be fixed with medicine, BPD is addressed through therapy.",MainAction9667,1b92zml
1,"Bupropion/Wellbutrin has been really good for me with trazodone for sleep, and hydroxyzine if I end up having an anxiety attack.

I am pretty sensitive to meds, and I've retained my libido, feel more energetic and focused, depression and anxiety are helped enough so that I can do my own work to better the symptoms, and my emotions have been WAY more manageable. I of course was distraught, but I didn't breakdown or shutdown when in the span of a month and a half my ex/good friend died in a traumatic way, my snake died, I had 3 periods, my car got a flat, I got into a fender-bender, and it was all over the first holidays I spent being NC with my abusive mom. Usually, just one of those things would send me into a SI spiral and complete dorsal vagal shutdown.

Also since starting I've been able to quit smoking cigarettes, I now drink only maybe 1 day a week with 3 drinks being the max, and the constant feeling of weight and pain in my chest is gone. I am currently on the max dose, and I don't have any nausea, sleeping issues beyond the normal insomnia I've had all my life, and I can still cry, feel, and process the world. It hasn't made me numb at all, which is a godsend. Lexapro, effexor, strattera, and buspiron all fucked me up pretty bad.

ETA: This is a medication where you risk serotonin syndrome, though, so if you use any kind of drugs you need to be really careful.",,1b92zml
2,"I've tried most medicines, mostly SSRIs, mood stabilisers and benzos.
I found that tricyclic antidepressants work the best for me but the dose is really high.
I still have emotions, it just softens the edges and makes my responses to stimuli more 'normal'",erbstar,1b92zml
3,"Unfortunately, there are no meds specifically for BPD and all the psychiatrist prescribe meds in order to ""try out and find out"". Some people with BPD see that they feel better by taking SSRIs, others by SNRIs, others by mood stabilizers, and others by mixing any of the above, with or without antipsychotics. From what I've noticed, most psychiatrists prescribe meds according to the symptoms that trigger BPD or according to the disorders that co-morbid with BPD, ex. I'm prescribed Lamictal for the mood swings and Concerta for my ADHD, and this combo works wayyyy better, so far, than  my previous meds combo which was Concerta+ Fluoxetine. 

Also, many meds make your symptoms worse until they start to work. Lamictal is one of them, it needs 2 months to work and it increases the severity of every symptom, which is why many people who just started Lamictal have SI since week 1 of taking them, but, in most cases, SI stops once these 2 months pass.

Idk if just therapy helps with BPD, but therapy+ meds is the one that worked for me. DBT is the best option for therapy for people with BPD or any disorders that cause emotional disregulation.",soundofdarkness1987,1b92zml

5,"I also have bipolar 2 disorder, so they put me on Vraylar. It has not only helped my bipolar immensely but my BPD symptoms are way more tolerable now. It is an antipsychotic, but it’s the only thing that has worked for me & hasn’t made me feel like my body is weighed down. I can still party & drink on it, but I also don’t get hangovers, never have. I don’t know if my sex drive is affected as I’m asexual, so I can’t give you insight on that part.

I purposely didn’t take anything(only cbd gummies for emergencies) so that I could get to understand myself, my body and my feelings better.

20,Lamotrigine has only dulled me in what I'd consider a positive way in that it helps calm down my mood cycling and brings my anger to a manageable level. Duloxetine helps a lot with my suicidal thoughts but it doesn't interact with alcohol the greatest. I still drink on it but I black out easier. Both have actually given me a normal sex drive when it used to be non-existent.,spicyhotfrog,1b92zml
21,"I was diagnosed with BPD about 5 years ago and I take a few medications to treat the symptoms I experience as a result of my BPD. I also have severe depression and anxiety, so my medications address those as well. I take Auvelity and Lamotragine to help my mood swings and the anger and violence that comes with it. Both of those medications have helped my BPD symptoms well. Medications just help with the chemical changes and pathways in your brain. There is no cure for BPD.

2,"Just wanted to say I've been there (and will likely 'go there' again) and I know how scary and disorienting depersonalization can be. Hope at some point, if not now, you can recognize how brave it is to show up every day and live in the face of symptoms like these!! But ofc 'brave' is cold comfort when we feel disconnected from reality itself.

I don't know if it will help but I wanted to share some of the things I've tried to/my experiences with similar typs of symptoms.

 i've been waiting to see a psychiatrist for ages and only got diagnosed with bpd recently.  I was prescribed a low dose of antipsychostics (on top of a new SSRI)  to help with my severe depersonalization/dissociation/derealization. I haven't even started them yet, it's so recent-- up until now I've been relying on a patchwork of coping mechanisms. 

\-I used to roll my eyes at ""mindfulness"" but eventually I got desperate enough to put aside my ego and and actually try because it was basically life or death. Focusing on your senses, to the best of your ability  -- and I know even your senses can seem like someone else's, far away, dulled, unreal, etc --  but still, trying to anchor myself however I could into the present moment, mainly DBT mindfulness skills. if possible, try to find little things that anchor you, even a little -- a hot shower, a familiar favourite show, the smell of coffee, the feeling of a pet's fur, the feeling of breath, whatever. 

\- I marked down or took random photos during good moments so I remember they really happened, even if I forgot, or feel like it happened to someone else. 

\-I tried to limit my stress in any way I could because my symptoms are exacerbated by stress (find out your triggers!). 

\-when experiencing depersonalization, I tried accepting my current experience, no matter how scary, while remembering that it will pass and I will feel eventually different, that I have survived difficult moments before, that I am safe,

\- weird but i've found it helpful  saying to myself that ""I notice I'm am experiencing a symptom of mental illness right now,"" or ""I notice that my body feels like a mannequin, I'm very depersonalized right now."" it gives you a framework to understand and tolerate your raw experience through kinda?? 

\- Accepting that sometimes it will be very difficult to function, and not beating yourself up for this. being kind to yourself and caring for your needs as as you would your most beloved longest friend, even if you can't access love for yourself then.

\-Don't isolate yourself!!! i know how tempting it is, how it can feel like the only option. but please, even if it's awkward, or anxiety inducting, or you're totally dissociated the whole time, I really recommend seeing people you feel safe with. anything makes a difference, even a short visit once a week. participating in 'real life' is such an important component of mental health, even if you feel separate from it and that is really distressing for understandable reasons. It is okay to 'just go through the motions'--- at least you're moving! and it is okay to want more than that , and be upset by that at the same time. 

\-Remember recovery is possible. 

\-Remember there are hotlines to call if you feel you might resort to harming yourself or others. (Honestly it isn't usually the talking that helps, but the keeping myself occupied until the urge subsides that is useful.)

\-Of course try to access psychiatric and pharmaceutical care as well as counselling. There is medicine for this. I know it's really hard to access these service for many if not most though and I wish it was different.

2,I strongly suggest starting off with hybrids and if you like a certain type of feeling try another hybrid that leans more to that side. Say strain x is 50/50 hybrid and you like more of the indica side effects then the next time try a 60/40 indica dominant hybrid!,AvailableAttitude650,1aw0jbm

On top of BPD I also have ptsd, depression, anxiety, and adhd so existing is pretty hard sometimes lol but I've discussed my use with doctors and my therapist and they say as long as I'm not abusing the chemicals and taking safe amounts that there is scientific evidence that these chemicals can help people.

Hopefully it becomes legal.  Hopefully I start regularly working out or being active and that will increase my resilience.  So far, getting high and calm is the only thing that gets me out of bed consistently.",Dutchass91,js95dc
3,"I also used to rely on marijuana pretty heavily- it was the only thing that was able to change my mood and the only time I felt truly “happy” or care free was when I was high. I totally relate though when u said sometimes it can produce opposite results like anxiety and even more paranoia- I started experimenting with different strains and after being a hybrid ride or die for years, I tried out sativa strains and loved it. I’m definitely glad you found something that works for you, and don’t let your parents make you feel bad about smoking weed, seriously. It’s saved my life multiple times and 100% should be thought of as treatment/medication for those who really benefit from it. It’s not just for recreational use, although I support that use as well. 

One thing I will say though, is that I did end up getting addicted. It doesn’t happen to everyone, and actually Im probably in the minority, but it did happen to me where I couldn’t go one day without it. I didn’t want to even eat meals without it because food just didn’t taste as good when sober. And when I ran out of bud, things got pretty desperate. So to answer your question of what worked best for me was for one, finding the right strain, and then personally I smoke only when things get really bad for me, or when I feel like I truly deserve it or need it. I had to make sure that I wasn’t so reliant on it for regulating my emotions because I was smoking instead of acknowledging what was going on in my head. This is completely individual though, so it’s up to u to really experiment with it, and find what’s best!",seyserKoze7,js95dc
4,"I’ve never been on antidepressants, but when I started struggling to feel emotions, I started smoking and all the emotions came back to me. My parents are the same way about stigma around weed. They managed to make me feel like an awful person for smoking, but it’s the only way I can feel normal. Now if I don’t smoke it’s basically guaranteed I’ll either have a panic attack, an angry outrage, a depressive episode, or some do crazy impulsive thing. Acid helps me so much I usually take it once a month. I’ve never thought of it as an emotional reset but that’s the perfect way to describe it. Like for me the come up feels like I’m feeling such intense highs of those emotions to the point I’m almost overwhelmed, but after the peak i feel this really great balance and I can recognize the beauty in it all. It really sucks that there’s so much stigma about all of this but think about it.

6,"Great post OP. I'm 26 in Sydney, Aus, and although it's pretty frowned upon here I use microdosing of homemade edibles, (and sometimes pipes) every few days or sometimes once a week on good weeks. My tolerance is light so small amounts work wonders and even if I don't, 'get high', I still get emotionally reset which can be a positive. 

I'm in the process of getting it medicinally through Cannabis Doctors Australia, but they don't prescribe it to people with 'psychotic disorders' and I'm worried I'll have to just remain a criminal. For me, it helps me relax and lessens chances of emotional outbursts, but I still have episodes. Finding balance is important so healthy food, exercise and good sleep makes all the difference.

9,In my opinion being dependent on Lexapro or Zoloft or whatever the fuck they prescribed us is the same as being dependent on weed. Only difference is weed is natural.

3,"Me. I’m in in my 40’a and have had this issue all my life. The early years were tough when there was no tv to distract me from my thoughts until I fell asleep. I remember as a kid running into my mum’s room crying after getting myself worked up from hours of being left alone with my thoughts. 

Relationships are impossible with people who need a silent/dark room to sleep. I’ve been asked so many times to have the tv on really quietly so as not to disturb them...ummm no I need to listen to the dialogue. 

Listening to other people snore or just generally breathing in their sleep really sets me off when I can’t relax myself. I’ve got out of my ex partners bed and driven home in the middle or the night many times. Or left my own bed to go chill on the sofa with the tv if I’m at home.

My GP knows, and says they’re safe for me to take. The “10 day” limit is only imposed for people who may have another underlying cause for their sleeping problems (in which case they need to see a doctor). He’s the one who writes up the new scripts for me every few months.

I also have C-PTSD. This compounded with BPD means I suffer from hyper vigilance; my brain cannot switch off, it’s always on high alert, even though I don’t usually feel anxious when I’m trying to sleep.

I’ve seen one of the best sleep specialists in the country for over two years now, and even he agrees that the best course of action here is to take the sleeping medications.

0,"I did when I first tried to go off of meds years ago. But then my psychiatrist confirmed that I had discontinuation syndrome. Most people develop discontinuation symptoms or develop discontinuation syndrome when they go off their meds. That can happen even if you're being tapered slowly. But it's virtually guaranteed to happen if you stop taking your meds because you don't have them. 

Basically, the way you feel when you are discontinuing medications doesn't mean anything about how you would feel when you were totally off medication. 

To me discontinuation felt like BPD but to the MAX! No inhibition. Acute Pain. I got brain zaps and my skin crawled. I felt like a heroin addict in that I would have done anything to make it stop.  

There is NO reason to stop taking your medication suddenly. If something has happened between you and your doctor: If you can't reach them, or they won't write you a renewal go straight to the hospital. They know: Stopping a psychiatric medication cold turkey because you suddenly lost access to it is very very bad. Don't worry if it was your fault... you threw it away, or forgot to pick up the prescription. They would rather you come in than not. 

In the future you need to have enough medication so that you won't be left in the lurch if something happens. Even something like COVID-19, that could interrupt supply! My psychiatrists have always recommended at least one month extra supply. 

I know we're not supposed to give medication advice, so I hope this doesn't violate the sub's rules. But I think I should be ok because all I'm saying is it's dangerous to stop taking your medication if you suddenly don't have access to it.",LBinaamba,oignz2

0,"I did weed every day for a few months and I found it helped me a ton, but I started to feel dependent and stopped drugs altogether for a couple months, and then I started going back to it now. Feels more helpful than ever.  

It sometimes feels hard to tell if I'm addicted or if it's more like medication--thought the former once, now I'm back to the latter.  I've always had substance problems, but at the same time I have problems medications and drugs like weed are known to help which makes the line feel blurry.  

For me, it greatly improves and stabilises my mood, and rather than making me lazy actually makes me far more productive and active. Less empty. Sativa dominant hybrid strains help me most, indica strains tend to just make me feel bored and like doing nothing.  

It also helps me get a good night's sleep regularly, rather than my mind staying active, getting nightmares and night terrors, etc and barely ever getting any rest. (I have PTSD as well.)

I also don't like smoking personally. It doesn't last long and it's expensive to do regularly. I buy concentrate and make edibles, since it lasts entire days with only slight redosing needed, and $100 of it can last me months at less than $1 a dose.",happy-when-it-rains,7xwv18

4,"I think cannabis use can be quite complex for people with BPD, especially because BPD and substance abuse seem to go hand in hand unfortunately.
For example, I have a female friend who has been smoking cannabis since her early teens (I guess she started at about 14-15 years old). At that time it was more of a recreational kind of thing and she wasnt diagnosed with BPD yet.
Now she's in her late 20's and is smoking daily (most of the time in the evening, but then at least 1 or 2 grams a day) to cope with real life/her BPD issues.
She mentions it is the only thing that is keeping her somewhat sane and relaxes her (which I believe), but she refuses to see all the negative side-effects that stem from her abuse (which I do see better then her I think).

- She has problems with her weight (she's really skinny) because she finds it hard to eat when she isnt high, so mostly skips eating all day until somewhere in the evening. Prefers sugar & candy above most other things so really little healthy foods unless someone else cooks for her. Even then she eats about 1/3rd of what should be healthy for any human being to survive.
- Sleeps in really late and isnt able to keep a steady sleeping pattern. She used to have grouptherapy but due to her not showing up (and still sleeping, not caring) she got kicked out. This worsened her mental state even more.
- If she can't smoke she'll get really anxious/mad and it triggers her bad side.
- Has low motivation to finish anything she promised to do. Only thing she does really well is keeping her appartment clean.
- Forgets a lot of appointments and has poor memory overall.

I wouldnt say that all of these problems come from her abuse of cannabis, but im pretty sure she would be better off without, or at least greatly reducing her use. 

My problem is that i've tried to talk about it with her many times but she doesnt want to hear it/reflect on her own life and get mad at me for even trying to talk about this.
So while I know cannabis can help her cope with all the rollercoaster thoughts and heavy emotions. She tries to drown them all in cannabis, forget about everything and rinse repeat the next day with the same (negative) outcomes. 
I truely think cannabis is holding her mental development back for years now and keeps her stagnant.

5,"Man, I have a love-hated relationship with weed. 
I almost always go through a ""smoke everyday, as much as I can in one day"" each years for months at a time. Its pretty harmless if I do it only every few days but, then that very quickly changes. 
Sometimes I can smoke and be fine, othertimes I become a rude unreasonable asshoooole around the people I care about most- especially if I have no weed that day. I also find that if I quit, I hate the feeling (this isn't bpd, more anxiety related) and get extremely anxious, sometimes burst into tears and can't communicate for the whole day and end up going back home and either stopping or just hermitting and smoking everyday until I can do it and be social at the same time. 
Still love weed though, just know I shouldn't smoke it as much as I do or that whole smoking everyday thing will probably happen pretty soon into the year. ",waddupmang,7xwv18
6,"I’ve been smoking regularly since I was 15 and I am 20 now. One positive effect I found about dope, when I get really mad about something or going through a hard time, as soon as I get a puff into me I think “you know what, it isn’t even a big deal” and then I rethink my behaviour If I over react. 

It basically makes me a civilized person. I’ve had behavioural issues and acted on impulse since I was a little kid and weed actually changed my life. I was really socially awkward too, Instead of being impulsive all the time, I chilled out and became a normal guy. Started rethinking my priorities and other things and got motivated to do good in life. I failed grade 8 and had to do a summer term before I started smoking, then grade 9 when I started I got 80s and over, I also started going to the gym, got really motivated with it and went pretty far. Made a TON of friends and completely turned my life around.

I still smoke every day at 20 and I’m on my second year in college in marine engineering with an 80 average. I owe a lot to weed, it’s basically therapy in a plant.

Some of the negatives though would be bad anxiety in social situations, harshly criticizing thoughts sometimes, feeling tired afterwards (i only smoke at night), and of course the legal issue. I’ve found out a lot of people who smoke that are criminals really give it a bad name too.. I know a lot of very successful people who smoke.",DeKinny,7xwv18
7,"I smoke every day and have done so for about 4 years. Honestly its what keeps me sane and focused most days. 

I like to pick up sativa dominant strains that channel my creativity and energy levels. The type of weed definitely determines my mood though. I detest the couch locking strains. Sober I feel enough like a lazy potato and usually just adds to the guilt when I smoke something that further hinders me. 

I use my smoking sessions as a part of my daily routine. Its like a nice cup of coffee or a nap to keep me going and feeling like a normal human. I put myself on a strict morning and nightly ritual and it helps create consistency. Maybe I'm addicted, but I've found meditating while sober gives similar invigorating effects in place of weed in my day. 

I live in a legal state so its much easier to find what I'm after in my medicinal weed. I feel strongly that weed strains are important because weed really is a medicine and its different for everyone. 

I struggle with a lot of black and white thinking, depersonalization and anger and the weed helps me channel those bizarre feelings into productive energy. My boyfriend calls its neurotic, but I feel happy, giggly even, and I cope healthily with unsettling emotions with weed's amazing effects. 

TLDR: Weed is an amazing mood stabilizer, energy producer or relaxation treat, but it the strains really matter! Information is power.

8,"I’ve started smoking the last few months somewhat more regularly then before, once or twice a week seems to help with my weekly troubles and stresses. I’m trying to find a balance, because when I smoke i smoke too much in the session and get too high to somewhat function normally. I’ve started cutting down the amount I smoke in the amount of time, I roll up take two/3 hits leave it for half hour and do something in the mean time. Come back to it have a few big hits then see how I feel. Seems to work better for me to be able to function in the day.

I think it's helpful, and a nice little release throughout the day. ",Eivetsthecat,7xwv18
11,"I use it recreationally, but it has useful medicinal side effects. Weed has got me through a whole bunch of crises and dangerous situations. My last care coordinator actually said ""if there's a thing you do responsibly that stops you getting into a life or death situation, and that happens to be smoking a joint, then obviously that's the better option"". I've found it to be a great mood stabilizer, and it doesn't half help clear your mind having a walk through the countryside with a joint.

The downsides for me are the next morning when it's a fair bit harder to get out of bed and moving. Once every now and then I'll have a bad trip where any anxiety I've been sitting on comes to the surface, however that happens maybe 1 in 100 times or less. I don't get paranoid or anxious thankfully, its nice to go off into the country with a picnic and have a little holiday for a few hours. It's also nice to have a joint and then get really involved in making music or doing electronics projects, plus me and my partner talk for hours about all sorts of things which is a good soul cleanser too. Every so often though you need to take a break to get used to soberness again, it's easy to use it habitually and forget how to function or entertain yourself without it.

It doesn't work that way for everyone though. From what I've been told, if it agrees with you, then it agrees with you. If it doesn't, and you're one of the very few people where it causes anxiety or psychosis, then it doesn't work for you and you shouldn't use it. Whenever I've changed mediation or a crisis/relapse is occurring however, it's consistently been a lifesaver since I started smoking 5 years ago.

23,"> Wait so you do opiates but consider cannabis consumers scumbags?

Yep, correct!  I think the vast majority of cannabis consumers are extraordinarily disingenuous, and there's little that's scummier in my view than being disingenuous about matters such as one's drug use.   I have a rather 'old-school' view on this I suppose in some ways: nicotine is okay, pharmaceutical uppers and downers and opioids are great, marijuana is not.  Snake oil at best, harmful snake oil at worst, with very dubious cultural associations and popularity indicative of cultural degradation and decay.

Though I've never self-medicated mood stuff directly with opioids; it's just a nice side effect of having to take them for acute pain associated with electrolysis facial hair removal treatment.

> You're worse than a scumbag imho... such a nasty person.

I'm sorry you feel that way.  I don't think that's terribly fair just based on my having unpopular drug opinions, but okay.  Whatever.

See, the thing is I don't think marijuana should've been approved for ""medical"" as much as it has been.  I think that's based on *very* dubious research, and was really just a loophole to get around prohibition.  Hence what I said about disingenuousness, and that's just one part of it.

Some drugs are better than others, and some drug cultures are better than others, so yes, I can say that.  I'd rather spend time with a fellow pillhead than a pothead any day of the week, because I find heavy cannabis users obnoxious most of the time.

Well, cigarettes are obviously so toxic that their benefits are far outweighed, but nicotine itself is demonstratively beneficial for cognition, anxiety and fatigue with minimal detriment on its own.

Things that my pothead friends have no need for because it doesn't create a bodily withdrawal. I know all types of cannabis smokers. Neither groups of drug users can be put under one stereotype.

Yes, they have major benefits, but just like you’re argument about pot being used for anything under the sun medicinally, pills are abused in the same way. Just with more extreme consequences I feel (any pill used long term, especially opiates and stimulants, are horrible on your body. Plus the added risk of overdosing on them).

I was however, exhibiting symptoms of our favorite personality disorder! I was prescribed abilify, 15 mg. I was insatiable, and had a very long commute to work. I would hit a drive thru each way, sometimes twice just to feel okay because I was so starving constantly. The meds also made me tired, so I stopped exercising.

She eventually left, but not because I was heavier, but because of my angry outbursts and insanity coming off the med. I beg everyone reading, please do not make this mistake. Tell the doctor. Do it the right way. She loved me for me, didn’t care I was out of shape. Never even mentioned it.

How do you think cultural heritage affects BPD presentation? Also, do you see any East Asian specific symptoms or presentations?

Is it possible to reduce the hypersensitivity that people with BPD often experience, or is it just something we have to live with and tolerate/cope for the rest of our lives? I feel a lot of discomfort with everyday life because so many things can make me very anxious, very sad etc. 

I try to deal with them through methods I learn from DBT - by trying to stop and pay attention to my feelings/body, or taking a break and do something relaxing, or some meditation, or some distraction. However, taking the time off to soothe these feelings is honestly time-consuming and exhausting. They come so often since many things (or sometimes nothing) set off large amounts of negative feelings, and these strategies don't last long because they creep back in when I get back to everyday life, namely work.

Sometimes I just tolerate the bad feelings and try to get work done despite them. One would think I should have gotten used to bad feelings or become less sensitive but somehow I don't.",Zorkxa,12xrl1n

Based on his views, and the diagnostic criteria similarities, is it possible that BPD is, in at least some cases, misdiagnosed ADHD? And if so, would that mean that a person with ADHD's ability to reduce their symptoms is just healing of their trauma?

2) Alternatively, how do you determine which sources are reputable and helpful when it comes to a mental health condition as complex as BPD, given the popularity of those like Dr. Peterson saying that people with BPD ""didn't get properly socialized between the critical period of development, ages 2-4""?",BipolarBabeCanada,12xrl1n

Since I was widowed I was just shut down, but now that I am in therapy all the old emptiness and fear of abandonment, feeling inherently unworthy of love has flooded back in from those days before I was married. I can be literally snuggling one of my kids and at the same time yearning for validation and love. I am trying very hard not to pass down the maladjusted behaviors. (Thus the therapy) Self love seems so distant and impossible and unreal. I would be very interested in what you have to say.

I hear that there is a lot of success treating people with BPD- 


Are there any ways that friends or loved ones of people with BPD can aid them with their symptoms?


My ex partner would have episodes of spewing hate and blame on me for everything I did wrong in their mind. Their eyes would seemingly glaze over and sometimes the episodes would last around two hours.  Attempting to end the conversation would make things worse, like threats. Couple hours later it was like nothing ever happened. 

As the week went on, there would be love bombing, and because of the love bombing I never took things seriously. I thought it was uncontrollable anger and saying sorry afterward until I learned it was BPD. They broke up with me because I couldn’t meet their emotional needs, even though it constantly felt like I was putting them before myself (I’m referring to “them” as I wish not to disclose mine or their gender).

I wish I could have known ways to help.

A lot of the stuff I hear about BPD paints them as mean and crazy. They can do a lot of hurt to others (emotional abuse), but they themselves are going through a lot of hurt and they need help and comfort.

I would've cried through your entire video on Relationships and BPD if it weren't for you voice mimicking, in which I cried and laughed simultaneously instead. That video was incredible for me, and I realized what I need in a relationship, despite the fact I *actively seek* a sort of ""intensity"". Thank you so much for that video, it was eye opening and I gained a lot of insight and self knowledge as to ""what I need"" to heal. I didn't know what I wanted even though it was at hand. Now I know (better). I'm also grateful for the HG subreddit (mental health with understanding of gaming — the subreddit I did not know I needed)

People with BPD (myself included) or other traumas (or even just the average person) often have a difficult time describing/knowing — what is love? I do I love the idea of love? Do I love being loved? Do I love my projected fantasy? Etc. What does a healthy relationship feel like if I don't know what I feel or how I should feel? How can a person with BPD know what love is? Are people with BPD capable of giving this so called love?

I personally find myself only comfortable around those who are a bit mentally unwell themselves, but they are stoic yet empathetic, and can withstand my emotional volatility, which are I feel are qualities I need. I've been trying to heal, albeit slowly but surely, but I find what I need to offer from my end is sensitivity, gentleness and understanding (another Q: what does the person with BPD need to do?)

78,"Hi Dr. K! I didn't see this until now. I'm in the Healthygamergg Discord and I felt so seen after you posted your video explaining what BPD is. I'm found your YouTube channel whilst looking into the psychology of tilt. (I previously played League of Legends as an ADC main.) 

> I really enjoy working with clients with BPD. I've found that they are some of the most exceptional human beings on the planet, and it has been rewarding to help them integrate into society in a healthy way. I've worked with a ton of folks in high-powered fields such as finance and medicine who have BPD.

It's good to know that people like me in health care with BPD exist. (I'm a nurse.) Because of the stigma (with BPD and mental illness in general), most people with BPD like me tend to hide our diagnosis from people at work. It has led to me feeling alone, suffering in silence. 

>I also believe that Eastern psychology and medicine has *far more* to offer to help people with BPD. Marsha Linehan and the development of Dialectical Behavioral Theory was just the first step!

I agree wholeheartedly. DBT wouldn't have been developed without Marsha finding out the Mindfulness component which originated from Zen Buddhism was what was missing from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. With mindfulness, the therapist could focus on acceptance *and* change, balancing out focus during sessions with the client like a see-saw.

>Also, some cool stats - most people think of BPD as a permanent diagnosis, but research shows that people with BPD can get significantly better and in fact most do. 35% remission at 1 year, 91% remission at 10 years, and 96% remission at 16 years.

Thank you for mentioning this as well. I always highlight this whenever people tell me that our diagnosis is a terminal, lifelong condition. That it is pointless to do therapy or seek alternative forms of treatment like Ketamine Infusion Therapy when talk therapy isn't effective.

There is hope!

I hope you can do a collaborative video with Dr. Daniel J. Fox sometime. I'm subscribed to his YouTube channel as well as Healthygamergg regularly for increasing my mental health awareness. He has highly similar focus in his messages about BPD.

My question: I am 32F diagnosed with BPD and anxiety since 2021. I married another gamer and we now have a child just over a month old. I'm currently in the middle of doing Intensive DBT and on a break from group skills classes because of birth. (Still seeing my individual therapist weekly.) I'm scheduled to resume where I left off this August.

I am worried that the demographic of people signed up for group counselling are younger than I am and won't be able to relate to the challenges I'm facing. For example, the challenges of being a new parent, coming to terms with the upbringing I experienced from my own parents, and the goal of fostering a secure attachment style with my child. 

With this in mind, do you believe Healthygamergg counselling would suit me better in a group or individual setting? 

Moreover, should I aim to seek counselling now along with therapy or would it be more prudent to finish a year of Intensive DBT first before attempting counselling? Or perhaps even wait until I get into remission? 

I would be grateful for any input, Dr. K.",ladyhaly,12xrl1n

1) how does a bpd individual not overly depend on their significant other, despite the bpd (me) being aware that i am trying my best not to drag every insignificant emotion towards my SO and miserably fail every single time. Its a repeat cycle of ‘ something upsetting happens that has nothing to do w my SO > finds a way to blame my SO for my feelings of despair, upset, anger > am aware that i am doing it , try my best to not feel that way > fails > gets passive aggressive and unable to explain to my so whats going on other than ‘ its not ur fault ‘ 

2) how does a bpd individual stop feeling the extreme emotions of each situation and jump straight to the worst thoughts . Example
- SO and I had a mini argument, my first instinct is to run away, cry by myself and imagine all sorts of scenario where he doesnt love me anymore and im not right for him and we should end the relationship

It is also incredibly hard to say ‘ im sorry for being like this and its my fault, instead i am always looking at myself being the victim, and not the perpetrator. This results in my SO being the first to apologize, and wanting to close the argument by saying i love you ‘ im not sure whether it is a power complex on my end where i refuse to step down subconsciously and must win every argument. But my logical and mature side which is trying is telling me that this is wrong. This has resulted in me grooming my SO that i will explode if he doesnt, for example, text me every hour if not i will be upset and we will get in a fight and rinse repeat the above situation . 

This whole personality of mine is very upsetting and I have yet to understand why I am like this, and am not sure what I can even do to help myself to improve and my relationship.

In my experience, the best way to ""deal with"" someone with BPD is to just sit with them in their intensity. What is so hard for clinicians is that we fall into the trap of ""if someone is hurting more, do more."" 

But the best thing to do is not *less* per se, but just stay as tranquil and supportive as you can. Over time, I've noticed that my tranquility is what most of my patients need. 

But it can feel like you're letting your patients down if you're not doing more. And if it is too intense for you as a clinician, you end up rejecting the patient.

I've also worked with people who have been able to rise out of a highly active period of BPD and be incredibly successful.

88,"Let's think through it this way. If your BPD comes from childhood neglect, your mind has lots of data that *attachment* leads to *lots of pain*. What we want to do is give your mind *new data* from *healthier relationships*. The more data we give it, the more it will start to understand that relationships don't need to be feared. 

It's ok to get overly attached - even when it is painful. Each time you get overly attached, if the person isn't abusive, you'll calibrate towards normal. And paradoxically, if you *expect and accept* that you'll get overly attached, that'll help you get less attached. 

The last thing to remember about relationships is that when we have BPD, our *identity of ourselves* becomes *defined by a relationship*. This is why breakups are so traumatizing. We don't lose another person, we lose ourselves. 

When I work with people with BPD, I try to help them develop an identity of themselves - usually through meditative practices. The more your healthy identity develops, the less traumated / attached you'll get.",KAtusm,12xrl1n

If we look at the evidence based mindfulness techniques for BPD, they are usually grounding techniques - things like ice diving (when you dunk your head in a bucket of ice water). Self injurious behavior or cutting also accomplishes something similar (but the meditation is far healthier!). 

Utilizing these mindfulness techniques in the moment can be really helpful. The challenge is that using them when you are out of control is difficult. So how do you fix that? Learn how to do these techniques when you are *not* out of control. Then start to use them when you are slightly upset. Then moderately upset. Level up until you can handle things when you're out of control.

91,i feel this too! great question,,12xrl1n
92,"&#x200B;

The first thing to remember is that *no human being is static*. So is it impossible to have a healthy relationship with a pwBPD? It may not be possible *in this moment*. Is the person with BPD *ready to engage in a healthy relationship?* They may not be *at this moment*. Also, it is very possible that the reason that the relationship didn't work out is also because of the person *without BPD* having certain problems, or not being able to meet their partner's needs. It takes two to make a relationship work, and it usually takes two to make a relationship fail.

And what happens on the internet is that people will take individual cases, and extrapolate them out.

So I'd say that you can absolutely have healthy relationships with BPD - in fact, I want to say that the majority of people with BPD end up in healthy relationships. The challenge is that it takes some time to get there.",KAtusm,12xrl1n
93,"The challenge is that in BPD, the person with BPD often uses relationships to fulfill other needs. Using sex as a substitute for connection.

94,"Hmm.. this is a bit tricky.. I see a few threads.

>leaves me thinking I only deserve the people who are willing to tolerate me.

The first, weird thing, is that this is true. We don't deserve any particular person's company. Whether you have BPD or not, the only people that hang out with you are the ones that will tolerate you. This is true of my romantic relationship, and my friendships.

The tricky thing with people with BPD is that they often *select* the people who treat them poorly, or will *pre-reject* people who are healthy.

When someone is abusive towards you, they usually try to keep you around. Abusive people are lonely, and will hang on to anyone that tolerates their abuse. This is why they chase people down who try to leave, even though they will tell them to GTFO. So in BPD, there is a strange security with an abusive person: if I can handle the abuse, they'll stay. So look for this in your own interactions.

There's also this element of ""I think I'm shit."" ""They think I'm shit."" So we all agree, and there's no surprises.

Now let's look at a healthy relationship. ""I think I'm shit."" ""They are treating me OK."" It is only a matter of time before they find out I'm shit. And then that'll really hurt, because abandonment really hurts. So the best thing I can do to protect myself from that hurt is to not get attached int he first place. So I'm going to steer clear of them, because they'll end up rejecting me anyway, because they are ""good"" people, and I'm ""not good.""

We sort of call this ""self esteem"" - but in my experience, understanding that it is an issue of security can be helpful. The crazy thing is that abusive relationships are certain, and healthy relationships are foreign and uncertain. So we gravitate towards what feels safe, which ironically is abusive.

So pay attention to how you select who you hang out with. Notice that there are some decent people, who you may avoid. This is the key thing that needs to shift. In a weird way, you are taking the decision away from them by pre-rejecting yourself. They get to choose - not you. So give them the choice! Offer your friendship. Think about relationships as an offering, given freely. And they get to choose. 

Sorry for the wall of text... hopefully it makes sense.",KAtusm,12xrl1n
95,"For question 1: Look for psychiatrists or psychologists who are open to working with BPD, or even specialize in it. There's a fair amount of us. I think BPD is made out to be way scarier than it is. Often times in clinical training, we see the *most severe cases* of BPD - inpatient - and thus we assume that outpatient will be similar.

If they don't want to work with you, that's OK. Some people want to become surgeons, some people want to become psychiatrists. Some psychiatrists like working with BPD, or addictions, or depression, or OCD. Everyone has a talent and a preference. Just look for someone who wants to work with you, is comfortable with BPD.

As for the second, apply anyway. I'm not sure what kind of disclosures you have to make for fire or police, but I've worked with both populations and there is a *lot* of mental illness. You can't control whether they turn you away or not, but if you want to do something, go for it. Also it helps to have your BPD in a stable place, and hopefully a good support system in place to help you handle the rejection (like a therapist).",KAtusm,12xrl1n
96,"We made a video recently about how to have a [relationship in BPD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT5PN7IhyPc)... some of our more meme-friendly content. 

The most important thing to recognize as a person with BPD is that time is on your side. The more you *withstand* the relationship, the better off you'll be. 

The second big tip that I'd have is that positive emotions screw things up just as much as negative emotions. We always think about negative emotions as the problem in relationships, and thus we try to ""control"" them. Meanwhile, their positive emotions will set the relationship up to fail. 

\- Deeply in love and your lease is running out? Don't move in together 2 months into a relationship. 

\- Met your soulmate? That doesn't excuse their behavior. 

\- Love this person so much? Let them leave if they want to. Trying to trap them will only drive them away.",KAtusm,12xrl1n

98,"Hmm.. I'd say that meditation training, and even support from spiritual sources can be helpful. I've seen a lot of mental illness in ashrams, and I've seen mixed results. In some cases, people get taken advantage of, but in others people can become drastically better. Let's remember that DBT exists today because Dr. Linehan sought some degree of spiritual training and support. So if you can find a place that is safe and focuses on meditation training, often times these people don't charge for anything. I'd go with a friend, though, just so that someone else can be on the lookout for potential of abuse.

100,"I wish I had a better answer for this... but I'll speak from the heart. Not sure if it'll make sense. 

It is easy to be *filled with loneliness* when we are trapped inside four walls. The loneliness is like an object, a feeling, that fills us up. If you really look at it, the loneliness isn't absence, but a ball of emptiness. 

It is easier to be *filled with yourself*, when you're engaged in some difficult task, usually in isolation. Like hiking. Or rock climbing. Or wood working. Or painting. 

Spend more time fully engaged with the self - in some task that requires the totality of your concentration. And then you'll feel full, of yourself.",KAtusm,12xrl1n
101,"Hmm... the two main features I would try to describe are:

1. Emotional Lability - People with BPD literally experience more intense emotions than the normal person. So it is like an amplifier of emotions - both negative and positive. You feel deeply in love, and you're devastated by rejection.
2. My take on BPD is that it is a core lack of sense of self. If we think about ""who we are"" - when I was 5 years old, I was still me, even though my body is different. I was ""me"" before I was a father, and after I was a father, I'm still ""me.""
3. &#x200B;

So most human beings have a sense of *transcendent identity* \- we look different, we talk different, we become rich or poor, we become married or divorced, but we're still ""me.""

In BPD, that ""me-ness"" is missing. So who we *feel like we are* is defined by our circumstances.",KAtusm,12xrl1n

Man I'm smiling so much - I love working with people who struggle with anger. I'm excited for you which may be weird, but this is clinical work that has been very rewarding for my patients so I hope it will help you learn and grow as well. 

Fury and rage when you split is necessary if fury and rage don't have a home with you when you're ""well."" My guess is that you think ""fury"" = ""unwell"" and should be avoided. Fury and rage are to be coveted parts of ourselves, treated with respect. They're what help us fight for life. So let them in to the ""healthy"" part of you. It's OK to feel angry, even be angry with others. And voice that to them, with compassion. 

Let your anger be information - if you are being mistreated, you will feel it. But if you set it aside for the ""unhealthy"" part of you... you will become a doormat, the mistreatment will continue, the anger will build up, and you lose control and ""split"" with fury and rage. 

Then we begin to fear it, and thus it becomes hard to integrate.

I think that the more we go into deeper spiritual practices, the more benefit people with BPD will see. The key thing about some spiritual practices is that they help us discover the true Self. This is precisely what people with BPD are missing. 

Interestingly enough, I sometimes wonder if people with BPD are the most karmically spiritual. What I mean by that is that most people have a karma where they aren't forced to learn meditation. They can go through their lives bumbling along, being secure in themselves, and are just sort of chillin. But people with BPD are *forced* into learning these skills - their karma demands it. And thus, they end up on a profound spiritual path - which is what I've seen in my practice.

relationship. No relationship can be healthy when one person expects the other to be the center of their world, and pins their happiness and well-being on them.

113,"What a fascinating question. I'm gonna take a stab at this, but this is somewhat spitballing and I don't have a ton of clinical experience with Koreans with BPD, but I did grow up South Asian and certainly have family members with PD. 

So let's think through this: What are the core features of BPD, on an internal psychological level?

1. Lack of stable internal identity. 
2. Fear of abandonment. 
3. Emotional dysregulation.

So when it comes to a cultural manifestation - what are the features of Korean (East Asian / South Asian culture) that are different from the West? 

1. East Asian and South Asian cultures are more community oriented. 
2. ""Face"" and public displays are very important. 
3. Are more hierarchical / less independent. 

How does someone with BPD meet their emotional needs?

1. They lack stable identity, so they live vicariously through their children. If my child succeeds, I'm a success. If my child fails, I'm a failure. So putting a lot of pressure on their kids. Demanding a lot from them. 
2. If I'm afraid you'll leave me because I'm abusive, I'm going to become incredibly controlling. No friends. No dating. Or if you date, I'm going to hate on anyone who fosters your independence. You stay with me always. And if you go off to college, in order to keep you close, I'll express whatever it takes - to keep you close. I'll cry. I'll throw fits. I'll find excuses to bring you home. I'll find excuses to come out there. 
3. Given the importance of face, I can accomplish a lot of my goals through histrionics. If I make a public display, people will give in. Everyone will want to keep me happy so I don't embarrass them. I'll also martyr myself - if I feel abandoned, its all your fault. Look at everything I've done for you. 
4. Psychosomatic Illness - If my behavior drives people crazy, as a last resort I can get sick. That'll make people love me, care about me. And remember if people are *displaying symbols of love and affection,* that won't make me feel abandoned. If I'm feeling abandoned, I'll call you because I'm having a heart attack, and then I'll know how much you love me. The more inconvenient it is for you to come, the more I'll know you love me. So I'll call at the most inconvenient times. Your SO is proposing? Not today they're not, I'm having a MI, so fly back from Canada or wherever the hell you are because I need you because I'm dying. 

Now the scary thing is this sounds like an *awful lot* of people I know. So maybe BPD just masks as the most extreme things of culturally acceptable behavior (controlling, vicarious living, etc).",KAtusm,12xrl1n
114,"Lotta great questions. Let's go through a few of them:

How does Stimulant medication help stabilize emotions? 

Stimulant medication stimulates our frontal lobes, which can *inhibit our emotional circuitry*. When we get our emotions ""under control"" our frontal lobes (control circuits)are slamming the breaks on our limbic system (emotional circuits). Stimulants strengthen the brain's ability to regulate emotions and impulses. 

As for the question of BPD and childhood diagnosis - this gets a bit tricky. To my knowledge, there is no *age requirement* for the diagnosis of BPD in the DSM. That being said, I would be reluctant to diagnose a personality disorder (outside of conduct disorder) in adolescence simply because personality changes drastically during adolescence. We think about BPD as an established personality - but personality is so fluid throughout our teenage years that the dust hasn't settled, which makes a diagnosis potentially problematic. That being said, there is very good evidence that *early intervention* in adolescence is really important at helping kids. So even if there isn't a diagnosis of BPD, I think it is reasonable to help a kid with a traumatic upbringing. The treatment may be very similar to treatment for BPD whether there is a diagnosis or not - such as DBT, mindfulness, psychotherapy, etc. '

Last question is what is the difference between bipolar disorder and BPD. Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder where moods persist for some amount of time - weeks to months, and in the case of rapid cycling, still weeks. IIRC, the definition of rapid cycling is at least 4 episodes in 1 year. In BPD, we see a lot of emotional lability, over the course of minutes to days. The other big difference is that the emotional lability in BPD is often heavily influenced by external circumstances, whereas with bipolar disorder, it can even be completely independent of those circumstances.",KAtusm,12xrl1n
115,"AHmm... what an interesting clinical presentation :) If I was teaching a class and we were reviewing a case, here's how I would teach it:

So a few general things: mood stabilizers can absolutely cause fatigue to be worse. So what can we do as clinicians? 

Patients use mood stabilizers, especially things like lamotrigine, to help manage emotional dysregulation. 

So if mood stabilizer is causing fatigue, one thing we could do is build up non-pharmacologic skills (meditation, DBT) to manage emotional dysregulation, or psychotherapy to manage the roots of the emotional dysregulation. 

Once we have those on board, you can pull the mood stabilizer down or off. 

This should help with the fatigue. 

I would then ask the class ""What other considerations are there in a patient like this? What would you want to rule out / optimize?""

The student who says ""people with BPD and ADHD are both prone to substance use, and substance use can lead to fatigue over time. So I'd want to check for their level of substance use, and ideally help them remove stimulants and sedatives from regular use.""

Also want to make sure PCOS treatment is optimally managed. 

And lastly, what has direct benefits for fatigue? We want to make sure we do a good differential (CBC for anemia, checking TSH, etc) and optimize those things. 

Most students should get to there on their own. Then I'd ask my last question:

""After we do all that, are there any evidence based interventions we could use to improve ADHD, BPD, and fatigue?""

And the answer is mind-body practices like yoga or Tai Chi.",KAtusm,12xrl1n
116,"The media portrayal of BPD is often quite negative. The ""crazy ex-girlfriend"" is usually a caricature of BPD. 

People with BPD can be abusive, just like anyone else. We also know that people who *were abused* are more likely to *be abusive*. 

So I wouldn't think of it as people with BPD are abusive, but:

People who were abused are more likely to be abusive. 

People with BPD are more likely to be abused. 

I haven't looked at studies examining whether people with BPD are more likely to be abusive specifically.",KAtusm,12xrl1n
117,"I would see any mental health professional in your area. A diagnosis of BPD after 15 mins sounds highly unusual.

119,"Healthy relationships can sometimes be *very confusing* for people with BPD. A healthy relationship can trigger fears of abandonment, which can be difficult to tolerate and make the experience worse. 

Can't be afraid of abandonment if there's no one to abandon you. 

The really harsh irony of BPD is that relationships are often times really hard, but are also really helpful. Frequently, a clinical relationship is a good first stepping stone to establish some degree of connection and work on abandonment, with solid boundaries so that the patient feels safe. If you can learn to trust your clinician, you get a roadmap to trusting other people.",KAtusm,12xrl1n

121,"I know this can be hard, but therapists will frequently see patients at reduced or even no cost. Most of us are in it to help people, and many therapists have the luxury of taking reduced fee or free clients.

Lastly, there's some evidence that a stable relationship can help stabilize BPD. But sometimes that's out of your hands.

122,"Ask as many questions as you want! I'll get to them as soon as I can. 

1. I'm not too familiar with Jordan Peterson's views on BPD, or what context he explains them in. In general, I think Peterson is quite ""clippable"" - especially on the internet. I've gone through his whole course on Personality and I think it is excellent. We have pretty good data that BPD correlates with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and early life trauma. It is possible that inadequate socialization is one example of this. 
   1. As for misdiagnosed ADHD, I think there is some overlap in terms of emotional dysregulation, and it is possible that the two are misdiagnosed on occasion. I've had some patients who can achieve remission from ADHD symptoms with stimulant medication, and that doesn't make sense if the source is traumatic because... well, stimulants don't cure trauma. 
   2. I do think that most people with ADHD end up with [trauma of some sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkXpcs_an80). The YT video explains this, and there's more detail in Dr. K's guide. 
2. Determining which sources are credible for mental health info is a huge problem. I'd start by looking for some degree of clinical experience. The second thing is stuff that resonates with you. There is a lot of varied clinical experience, and clinicians will come to different conclusions. We also know that finding the right therapist is really important, even if all of them have the same degree. The last thing is that a reputable source will likely be wrong on somethings, and almost always *incomplete*. That's the nature of the internet. The more in-depth you go, the less likely it is to be viewed. So all of us struggle with reductionism - deep dives never get watched, so we have to try to simplify stuff. When you simplify, you get closer to being wrong. 
   1. The last thing to consider is that even if it is a reputable source, is what they say evidence based? I try to do my best to be clear that I sometimes make recommendations that are based more on my spiritual training than medical training - and that this isn't evidence based. So sometimes you'll get prominent medical influencers who'll take a stance on something, but they may not take a stance based on science or even their clinical experience.

I've been on and off different meds now, I've been on and off therapy, and out of everything weed is the only thing that hits a wellness spot in my brain, almost like a switch.

When I'm high it's like a cloud lifts out of me. I'm not calculating nor planning everything, I'm not frustrated by things outside of my control (money, other people, the weather etc), I don't need to convince myself to do chores or things that would benefit me like exercising or cooking a nice meal... I just flow. I focus on what I am doing at the moment and I flow from one thing to another without resistance. 

It tunes down all the intense feelings that come with bpd, especially frustration, anger and sadness. 

It also helps me with something which I don't know if it's a bpd thing or a me thing, which is always outlining the things I need to do and stressing out about not having time, or dreading doing any single thing. Like I said above, I just flow. Dishes need doing? I go there and do it. 

I'm so much more productive and also I feel so much like my essence, the me I really am, if that makes sense???

I am vulnerable and authentic and happy, I enjoy my own company a thousand times more.

I can't handle the head high, and sometimes just a couple pulls off a bong or joint gives me that shaky, ice-water-running-through-my-veins sensation.

I financially cannot do that anymore and I’ve been cutting down to smoking flower about 2 times a week and my dab pen also 2 times a week, so I get high maybe 4 times a week. My anxiety has greatly improved butttt my eating disorder from 2 years ago has emerged. Weed was the only way I was able to get myself to eat without thinking so hard about all the consequences and calories. Now, I’m back with my eating disorder brain and it’s a daily battle trying to eat without feeling guilt and shamed. 

For my BPD, weed has also helped but not heavily. If I’m in an episode, the last thing I want to do is go smoke weed and help myself calm down. I like to wallow in my sadness or anger until my eyes are too tired to continue crying and I’m so dehydrated my head hurts. I just end up putting myself to sleep. But sometimes I am able to walk over to my rolling table and roll a joint. It almost always calms me down and makes me laugh off my episode like the crazy bitch I am. Then, I think damn my brain is really whack and I should probably not depend on weed to mellow it out. 

So idk I think my 3-5 times a week smoking is good for me. I can’t afford to smoke a lot anymore anyway, so I am doing alright with that. And like I said my anxiety has greatly improved especially the anxiety I would get when driving.",Rare-Gain,16w7ykf

It’s gotten to a point I realised the last few years I have only worked to afford my rent and weed/medicine, I am used to struggling to afford groceries because australia has really high rental prices & my tolerance is so massive I’m spending minimum $300AUD a week on weed alone.

I go smoke free like 90-95% of the time now with the small % reserved for absolutely awful days where I just need a respite from spiralling/overly heavy emotional moments and also social situations with other friends that smoke.

I originally started with edibles to take the edge off and so I could sleep. It graduated to flower as a post work relaxer. After work I want my mind to go blank and to sink into whatever furniture I'm sitting or laying on. Ironically it's also helped me not overeat, which had been a problem for the last decade or so.

Listening to music while high has been nice as well.

145,"Smoking weed never felt good until I did a bit of research and got a vaporizer! I didn't wanna encourage anything haha but I have much more control over how it affects me now. The different parts of cannabis react to different temperatures and a common cigarette or joint burns at around 800 degrees C (sry don't know Fahrenheit, should be double I guess?). But THC for example is released at 157 Celsius and it's the most psychoactive so I avoid it. CBD is released at 180 and that's the temperature I usually smoke weed at and it calms me but I use it for clubbing or having sex as well, since I don't drink (I don't like the feeling at all). When I want to sleep I smoke at 190 C and I can go to sleep pretty much immediately. Doing the research definitely changed the game for me because initially I was thinking about trying out medication amd found weed to be a good or better option for me since it feels more natural. I had some bad trips when I smoked joints, especially with tobacco and it never happened again after switching to the vaporizer. Maybe that's something to consider :)",PeanutPepButler,16w7ykf

My weight has never been consistent throughout most of my life.

BUT I'm having ketamine infusions on a weekly basis to pull me out of an acute depressive episode and my Dr is putting me on ketamine maintenance infusions every 2 weeks.
It's really working well! My mood is steadily improving, anxiety is decreasing and my sleep is improving.

I refused to take meds again after developing one of the side affects from abilify, but when my friend died and then my brother was killed a week later I fell into an extremely dark place. My friend recommended CBD and I've been using it since.

90,"I’m a child and youth worker and currently I work in a group home for teenage boys age 12-18. I really enjoy what I do rn but I also am very passionate about this field in general! I wanted to be a part of this field so I can support youth; when I was a kid I wasn’t supported well by the adults in my life. So going into this field I wanted to be able to support youth who have felt the same, and who need an adult to really care about them in their lives. 

Where I work now can be intense at times, I work directly with youth who come from trauma and who have mental health and learning disabilities. I feel like my BPD can be both a blessing and a curse in my current setting. It’s a blessing because I know first hand what it’s like to have trauma so I feel it makes me more able to empathize with our boys. Many times the kids will say we have no idea what it’s like but there have been so many kids I’ve met in this group home where I’ve connected on similar situations I’ve been in. I used to be a very angry child too and so I feel like this makes me able to understand the kids on a deeper level. 

The BPD can also be a curse sometimes, the jealousy of not knowing if I’m a good enough worker, issues between coworkers can sometimes trigger me and tbh even working with the kids can be intense at times which has triggered my BPD. They just know what to say that punches ya in the gut! There are times I have full blown cried because of how a client has treated me. 

But all in all I really like what I do, even the harder moments; I’ve met so many different youth there and have really enjoyed being able to support and hangout with them and be a part of their lives. And tbh I do feel like my BPD does affect my job sometimes and that’s okay. Where I work mental health in the workplace is supported really well and everyone there is a great support system. 

I also genuinely feel that no matter where I would work in this field my BPD would affect it. These days I’ve gotten really good at regulating my emotions, identifying my triggers and allowing myself to feel what I need to feel which makes work easier. There are days where I’m sure it might be a little more obvious to the boys that I’m not on my “a” game or that I’m a little off but I feel my BPD has been extremely manageable where I work. 

I’ve had jobs in this field in the past as well where I felt my BPD was more noticeable at work. Before this job I worked at an after school program for elementary kids and I loved it, I worked there for 5 years before I ultimately got fired bc of new management and the new management not supporting me in a time I really needed support. And my BPD was the absolute worst at my last job. There have been things that frustrates me like overstimulation but tbh I do think that my BPD affecting me at work is more manageable when the management there is understanding of staff mental health. I’m allowed to feel upset and process it rather than just shove everything down. Before I got fired at my last job I felt supported before new management took over. But when they did it was like I wasn’t allowed to have feelings emotions, I had to get over it and work is more important, etc. 

Overall I really do enjoy working with youth and feel this has been a job and career has been beneficial along with able to help my BPD. I love what I do!",Commercial_Cattle76,182ugt9

Instead of punishing me by starving myself or hurting myself or just simply trashing the person i am in my head, I try to be more understanding and think about the cases we see in the hospital and how I need to continue to do what I always wanted to do, help people, save lifes, continously educate myself.

102,"Currently, I am studying Aerospace Engineering with space technology for my bachelors. I'd say that my BPD has certainly affected my studies as I had to take an extra year in order to focus on my health and self betterment, however I feel I am doing significantly better this year than in previous years! It's my final year, and I have high hopes to apply to a masters programme elsewhere for a related field (though not the exact same). I think that it's definitely possible to achieve your dreams even if you struggle with BPD, so long as you again help and support that you need, and allow the institutions you study/work at to be aware of any accommodations you may need in place. This is under the assumption that this is possible where you are working and where you live, of course. 

Accommodations I've had put in place include a study needs agreement that allows me a guaranteed extension on my coursework hand in dates, as well as access to study materials in advance.

So side story: I have been diagnosed with BPD before, never gotten help. It took an FP to ask me if I was borderline to make me realize I needed help. It took another customer that has been in the mental health field to give me the help to find therapy and help me to admit to myself that I am a toxic person at times, BUT I can get better. It was a hard pill to swallow. I wasn’t receptive to treatment and I was resentful at first. I am so glad that these people came into my life, and approached me because I wouldn’t have gotten help. I would still be ignorant of what BPD really is, nor would I have even thought of it. I have been shamed and dismissed so often it’s hard to ask for help. I am also now admitting to myself that I can be very toxic, my drug addiction was a big way to stuff a lot of my BPD symptoms - like the FP, the paranoid hallucinations, the splitting.

0,"Alright, I'm going to start with my experiences, move into what your doctor is probably thinking, and if you say fuckall to those two topics I have four questions that will help us figure out what it is you need from treatment, and then we can talk about some ways you can get those things. 


I can share with you as someone who was suicidal on a daily basis and who self-mutilated extensively for a good... six or seven years? That none of the many medications I was placed on prevented me from experiencing those emotions, and some of them actually had some strangely powerful influence on how much pain I could take (my carvings got more elaborate or deeper), how much flat affect I experienced, or even how frequently or intensely I dissociated from myself.  

I think your doctor might be hesitant for several reasons: 

1. **Medication is not a solution to borderline.** Whereas someone with a strictly biological issue, like bipolar disorder legitimately needs a chemical to regulate their neurochemistry, our issues stem from maladaptive thought patterns and a lack of effective coping mechanisms. What that basically means is no one taught us how to deal with really hard emotions, and it's amplified by the way our minds work. 

 I know that shit gets overwhelming man. When you're in the moment it feels so fucking awful that you can't take it and you don't know what to do, you want it to stop, please stop, it hurts so much, please, ANYTHING to make it stop, ANYTHING, and you end up reaching for that knife.  Unfortunately, medication is not going to take that away from you. 
  But cognitive therapy will, so that's a big upside =D 

2. **If you're suicidal, starting on something like an SSRI will increase your chances of killing yourself.** Like I said, taking that pill will not take away the hurt you're experiencing. With that amount of suffering comes a certain degree lethargy; I know when I was suicidal I spent a lot of time laying on and staring at the floor. Let's say you're three weeks in to an SSRI regimen, and you start feeling increases in your overall energy. Then something bad happens. Now you have the same overwhelming feelings, and drives, but they're coupled with this new found physical energy. You might go for it with gusto, and really hurt yourself. Maybe even check out. That's *terrifying.* We don't want to lose you! and that's definitely something your therapist is considering. 

3. **Psychiatric medications have A LOT of side effects.** Weight gain, weight loss, sleepiness, insomnia, constipation, jitters, more anxiety, dizziness, getting sick to your stomach,  loss of libido, anorgasma... It's not too fun, and the effects last a while.  I'd say a safe estimate of the number of medications I have been placed on is at least fifteen, which is an exorbitant number, and none helped with my symptoms. I can get more into that if you like, but it seems like you're trying to find something that will help take this pain away from you. 


You're not on an easy path, this stuff is nearly impossible to deal with, and your therapist not being of much help is bad news bears. 

So let's start with a few questions so that we can figure out what you need from therapy, and what you can do to make sure its given to you! 

1. If you woke up tomorrow and all your problems were gone, how would your life be different? 
2. If your doctor did provide medication, what effect would it have and how quickly would it have that effect? 
3. Besides prescribing medication, what are the things you'd like your therapist to do that he doesn't? 
4. Is there anything else bothering you that you'd like to talk about? 

Anyways, I hope you're safe, doing okay, and hopefully haven't felt like you need to cut today. We're here for you! I want nothing more than for you to be lessened of some of this burden and hurting. 

I look forward to hearing back from you =)

We bpd do not have the requirement to be on meds, theres no meds out there that specifically stops you from cutting, or having those intense emotions.

Seizure med for my bipolar, heart med for my anxiety and therapy for my depression, they dont have to give me psychiatric meds, since other meds could help with my symptoms.

but BPD isn't directly caused by a chemical imbalance. that's one difference between personality disorders and other disorders, like bipolar.

For what it's worth if the flupentixol doesnt work the next medication I am being offered to try is quetiapine however I have met other people who have been prescribed that, unlike flupentixol. 

Some doctors decide that there simply isnt enough concrete evidence to prescribe and so offering prescriptions aren't all that common. Others are more comfortable prescribing medication in order to treat specific symptoms. Myself I am prescribed my flupentixol because I have BPD and PTSD and since they make eachother worse my psychiatrist is keen on offering me as much reprieve as is possible which I am greatly thankful for.

Delusions are often much harder to recognize than the example I provided. For years I was convinced that people talked badly about me behind my back, all the time. Literally believing that my bullies were obsessed with saying horrible things about me even when I wasn’t anywhere near them. 

That’s a delusion. Zero basis in fact, lots of basis in that stress -based paranoia. Took me a long time to realize I was, in fact, delusional. And while it can be a symptom of psychosis, you don’t need to be psychotic or near a psychotic state to have delusional thinking.",DarkfireQueen,172cqod

They might be out of nowhere and right at the front of my mind. But the thoughts don’t invoke a behavior anymore. I just simply acknowledge them and move on.

118,"Hmmm, how about this? 

Would you agree that a normal, healthy person can walk up 3 flights of stairs without getting tired? Like someone who regularly works out and is generally active in their day to day life. I would think so. But I personally am underweight, desk bound, and don’t regularly exercise (at all really). If I were to climb 3 flights of stairs, it would be exhausting. But just because I felt exhausted going up the stairs, doesn’t mean that the 3 flights of stairs was actually difficult to climb. It is only perceived as exhausting and difficult because I am not an active, healthy person. 

In the same sense, just because I perceive the transition from an overactive state to a healthy, regulated state as numbness doesn't mean that regulated emotions in healthy individuals are genuinely numb. It's about individual experiences and perspectives, much like how climbing stairs might feel exhausting to someone less active, even if it's not inherently difficult.

I am also not going to comment on what healthy, regulated people feel or don’t feel, since I’m BPD and have not felt what a normal person has felt. Whether they feel everything or not is not known to me, and the topic of feelings itself is subjective by nature. I can only talk about my own experiences, which is what I’m doing.

0,Has she done any form of therapy? I have successfully been off my meds for a year at this point and a lot of that is due to having the tools from therapy to cope with everything instead of medications. You are right that telling her to go back on meds would likely not be met with a good response as her reasons for going off them are very valid. I know you said she ‘thinks’ this stuff is happening but she knows her body and if meds are making her lose her intimacy she knows that and doesn’t want that. Same with hormones and medical stigma. So I would suggest continuing to support her in her decision and when appropriate mention therapy (dbt is usually recommended for people with BPD) to help her be more stable and herself but without the needs of meds.,zanny2019,1bwiezw
1,It takes a long time to stabilize after coming off medication. And being a woman can take even longer. Certainty less than a month is not enough time for the brain chemistry to go back to how it should be.

2,Going off of meds is stressful as hell especially the older you get. Not only that but it's also tough reaching your mid 40s because of hormone fluctuations that come with pre menopause. She definitely needs patience from you and to remain in therapy. SSRIs do help a lot with the mood swings and anxiety and I hope she considers them. She might have to hear that from someone who's in a similar position as her.,napkinrings,1bwiezw
3,Bpd-> dbt. Meds help symptoms wont get to the nitty gritty of it all. She also needs to want it (meds or therapy) to work.

4,"I also struggle with the medication stigma. It might really ease her mind to try Genesight testing. Your psychiatrist/doctor orders it, you swab your cheek and mail the swab back. You receive a detailed report of which mental health medications, of every class, you are able to metabolize properly (meaning, those meds that will give you minimal side effects and only the very common/predicted side effects). I am a woman who lost sexual function while taking propranolol, and when I got my report back, propranolol was listed as one of the medications that I cannot metabolize well. That’s why it gave me such negative side effects.

Being weary of meds myself, my psychiatrist prescribed me a “beginner” med. I currently take Buspar for anxiety symptoms of BPD. It’s not an SSRI - it has a much much weaker and more localized effect on serotonin. It only increases desire for intimacy - it’s often prescribed to counter the sexual side effects of other medications! Not all meds are the same!!

It was probably a little more than 6 months before things calmed down.  Everyone is different so who knows an exact time frame or how her body will cope.  She will also have to do some work on herself as well if she can do that things should be fine after a bit.  Just know it is a volatile time right now.",Horror_Medicine3327,1bwiezw

She's been in therapy for 8ish months (IC & MC). That has helped a LOT and she has a great therapist, things have just worsened since she stopped meds. She has trouble communicating, things are blown out of proportion & misinterpreted, turned negative, then she gets stuck on it. When ask her to say back things I'm saying she stays stuck on what I'm not even saying.

When I say she ""thinks"" the meds make her gain weight, her weight is no different than before this medication. It's fluctuated throughout the years - but she looks good. She said she's gained some weight since going off the meds that's most likely from recent changes in diet & exercise.

0,I get this so well!! Like I love the feeling of impulsive rush and I feel like if I go on meds I will be so monotone.

1,A natural way to do it is with 5htp. It helps stabilize more naturally and it makes up the elements necessary for the body to produce more serotonin.  When given meds for serotonin balancing it forces more serotonin to stay in the receptor sites but does not get the body to produce more.

What are your experiences with propranalol and gabapentin?",gaysynthetase,3oel11
3,"I think that some doctors just don't prescribe certain medications because they sort of have a 'go to' choice for medications.  Which for a lot of doctors is antidepressants or benzo's.  I also think that those other meds don't always work as well.. they have less of a chance of success according to studies and doctors tend to go with what they know works.  For example, my family doctor was older..and I got prescribed propranolol initially for panic, because at that time, there wasn't a lot of antidepressants that worked well for panic, and he wasn't inclined to give me benzo's  (I had to fight to get them..and it took like.. 5 years of fighting with him)  So doctors tend to not really go far off 'what they know' and are comfortable with.  You really have to look to find a doctor that will work with you to find medications that work for you (especially if you have drug interactions / allergies / conflicts etc)  My suggestion to you is to tell your doctor (if you are comfortable with them and they're not an asshole) why you are trying to find a work around medication for your anxiety.  If they are a good doctor..they will explore other medications you can take, and hopefully you find a combination that works well for you.  

(You could also inquire about any kind of anxiety group therapy opportunities.  Those can be helpful as well.  I found the book [10 Simple Solutions to Panic](http://www.amazon.com/10-Simple-Solutions-Panic-Harbinger/dp/1572243252) really helpful.  It had a lot of exercises in it to sort of help you get used to the physical symptoms.)

I take hyroxyzine as well for allergies.  I quite like it actually... it has minimal side effects for me.  It doesn't make me overly tired.  Just resolves my allergy issues (I have contact allergies to something that makes my skin blister) I also spoke to the doctor about it for anxiety (because clonazepam is addictive...and another doctor had implied to me that hyroxyzine was also addictive) My family doctor said it had no to minimal potential to be addictive and felt it would be fine as a regular anxiolytic. I just never really pursued getting a dosage for that as my anxiety was pretty much under control as of that point.  

Gabapentin is fine for me.. it makes me a bit sleepy for my evening dosage but otherwise it's fine. I've had very little side effects from it besides sleepiness.  Pro's include that it reduced my migraines / regular headaches to  0 with the propranolol.  Which was a huge win.  And it also seems to be stabilizing my mood decently.  Can't go wrong with that either.

Propranolol was the first panic medication I was prescribed.  I've been on for like 20 years... so.. I can't really recall my initial experience with it, other than dizziness and sleepiness initially which eventually went away.  I never found it helped me overly with my panic I just kept taking it because it helped me with my migraines. Initially when I started taking it and I would have a  panic attack... it would feel this sort of odd sensation around my heart (now I know it's because it blocks adrenaline to your heart) But eventually that sort of faded and I needed clonazepam to manage my panic at that time.  :) 

I took 2mg of clonazepam for a long time actually (.5mg four times a day and sometimes more on really bad days) Probably close to 10 years to function.  It never made me tired.. or doped up.  All it ever did was stop the panic attacks.  Eventually I started lowering the dose over time.  I came off it really slowly.. probably over 4 months to nothing.  Now I take it as needed.. which isn't very often.  I suspect it's due to the Gabapentin / propranolol combo... but.. I couldn't be 100% sure.. I'm sure that learning coping skills also helped.  :)

But you have to go through many to find someone that works with you in the way that is beneficial for you.

I’m also more of the quiet bpd type and you are very valid in your thoughts and feelings. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

He said the only thing it would do was make me fat. He then told me the only thing that would help is dbt (which works but I also did dbt in the past as well) and said that therapy would not help and only the dbt program which would cost around 200$ a week and was a private program which would not be covered and I would have to pay out of pocket, but apparently my city did not provide that type of program. Later I learned they did provide that program. Told him I can’t afford that and he told me, well you could look up mindfulness videos on youtube.

56,"For clarification, I am self diagnosed. Actively trying to get a diagnosis. I have gone down every route and and it could not possibly be anything else.
So when I was a kid my special interest was mental disorders. Like researching them over and over. I got a professional OCD diagnosis when I was 11 because I related a little too hard to all the stuff I was reading and I realised something was wrong. Anyways flash forward to my teen years, I'm still reading up on mental disorders and cluster B feels a little too familiar to me. I knew I was a dumb teenager and it was probably because of my raging hormones that my relationships and view on life were so unstable, so I figured it would pass. It did not pass.
I became self aware that I was sabotaging all my relationships and friendships and dug myself into a deeper hole. It was pretty clear now that there was something wrong besides the autism and OCD. I learned that my mom was diagnosed with BPD and when we got talking she was concerned because I was acting very similar to her when she was undiagnosed and untreated. Since I was under 18 all we could do was go through CAMHS, who was no help, and the moment I turned 18 the pandemic happened. So mental health services were fucked. I did some CBT, which was no help because it was over the phone. When the pandemic died down I could finally go to adult services but unfortunately since then I've been in an infinite loop of referrals, ""I'm sure it's just your autism"", being referred back to the guys who referred me in the first place, and now I'm 22 and not any closer to a diagnosis. The closest thing to treatment is antidepressants and antipsychotics that were prescribed to help me sleep.

TLDR I was so autistic I caught onto my OCD as a child and unfortunately I was right about the borderline but no one wants to open that can of worms.",LORDCANTl,1b0qxii

59,"Last year aged over 50. My family left because of my moodswings and yelling. By the end I was having rants that I couldn’t remember a minute later. Pretty much thought I’d lost my mind. Started therapy after a mental health referral from my doctor and it turns out Ive been a living textbook example of BPD since about the age of 9 or so. After the diagnosis I read a checklist of symptoms and ticked all of them off. Then a rush of realisation about all the times it’s caused huge issues in my life - exes, blackouts, wilfully awful behaviour and the misery and breakups and flareups and moody awful parenting.  This made me sleep sweaty nightmares for a week. Trying to fix myself now and suffering from gut-wrenching guilt about what a shitty father I’ve been at times with my moodswings and angry ranting.

63,"It was a about a year ago, i was 23 at the time. I was really afraid and did not understand the diagnoses because all of the symptoms became a very normal and mundane part of my life, in my earlier years. As i was comparing to my friends who also had bpd, both excisting and past relationships. They were more ‘out there’ verbally and i was not. It was bad of me to compare but that was also the very stigmatized image of bpd that got burned into my brain. You could consider it a more ‘quiet’ bpd. You have a lot of combinations and that made me understand it alot better. I explained to my therapist when i got a second assesment that i wasn’t sure how the symptoms fitted me, but she explained me very nicely how those symptoms can come out about, and that it‘s different for everyone.

I fitted all the 9 criteria, she went over them with me and connected them back to my previous assesments with her and current aspects in my life. I’ve had symptoms dating back to my 13/14th making it hard for my own self to see how it became a standard of living.

So I took it and dug further seeking out therapy and if I fit the diagnosis. Which I ended up being diagnosed very soon after.

So I researched about mental health disorders, intensely. I went to multiple psychiatrists and accepted with defeat when they decided to medicate me instead of listen. And still nothing seemed to fit or work. (Although its still undiagnosed, I learned later on that it felt incomplete because I wasn't aware of or treating my autism.) But 18 years of feeling misunderstood, underappreciated and annoying by the world forces you into isolation. And then covid happened and suddenly the isolation was everywhere, tangible, accessible. But the loneliness and emotional instability was still there and growing. And then I came across Quiet Borderline Personality Disorder. I was 19 in a whole different country wondering how emotions can be this fleeting and dangerous. I fell in love (found out that I had undiagnosed autism that heavily contributed to me developing bpd), fell out of love and in and out and in and out and in and out.

In the competition of you and me, you win. You know, the fact that you get to the point to fake attempts and diagnoses shows how unwell you actually are.

2,"Hi. Probably an unsolicited advice but I recommend actually getting the proper help you need. Talk to your psychiatrist about this because from what you said, at this point, it might be hard for you to extricate lies from reality. Please stop (if u haven't yet) taking meds that were prescribed for the illnesses/symptoms you faked. I get that you came from a harsh and unaccepting environment where a mental burden should be eminently deteriorating for it to be seen and heard. I understand where you're coming from and I'm sorry if some people under this post can't read your vent at a deeper sense (but u also can't blame them for being offended), but doing so (taking meds u dont need) will do u more harm than good. If you're having a hard time knowing what mental illness u actually have or what's been weighing down your mind, tell that to your psychiatrist or psychologist and have yourself examined again. From now, you have to be self-aware of what's real and what's not. Let's say you get attention for being mentally ill. Then they listen to you and put you in an institution & prescribe you meds; but nothing will work because some symptoms are not even there in the first place and only made to seek validation for something else. Remind yourself why you have to tell lies. It's to be heard and be validated that there's something wrong with you. And why do you want validation? MAYBE because you want them to know what's going on inside your mind and maybe even help you get through it. Yes you want them to believe you but aside from that, what's the point of faking other symptoms when you wanted YOUR struggles to be seen? I'm sorry but you're not helping yourself.

I have emotionally hurt so many people and it took me a long time to learn to deal with the guilt, better myself, make amends and move on. 

I understand how you feel about lying, I have been there too. It is great that you recognize that this is an unhealthy and very harmful behavior and I urge you to find a way out of it. Be assured, it may feel like you can keep this up, but people will find out that you are lying. 

I wish I could take back all the harm I have caused and learn how to actually handle my emotions at an earlier point in life. I know right now it feels like you need to be sicker and sicker to get attention from others, but life is so much better on the other side.

4,"hey, im 23 now and i felt the same way as a teenager. i hate to say it but for me these “traits”have only gotten more pronounced as ive gotten older (plus substance abuse which hasnt helped). i dont have an official diagnosis but ive had therapists tell me that they suspect bpd in the past. idk. at the end of the day here is my advice

it doesnt really matter if u get the diagnosis or not. if ur having these issues that are affecting ur day to day life then id just try to stay in therapy and practice using the tools u learn there. focus on taking care of urself, doing things u enjoy, practicing self awareness and active listening. 

try not to focus so much on trying to have it all figured out. nobody does really, and especially not when they are young. you wear urself out going thru the cycle of thinking you know all the answers, only to realize you don’t know much at all. 

and most importantly dont forget that at the end of the day you can’t be perfect. nobody can. people make mistakes but it’s how you learn from those mistakes that matters- the fact that you are being honest with urself about toxic behavior is definitely a good sign. dont stop being honest with yourself. it’s painful to admit that you’ve hurt others but you CAN recognize it and choose to be more cognizant of the way you’re treating people in the future.

13,"You sound like me when I was 15 and still sound like me even now at 23. Use to fake suicide attempts then they started turning into real ones. Got better and made myself worse again. Had tons of psych wards trips as a teen and now as an adult. It’s not linear at all. I remember not crying for an entire year or so one year and now I cry every single day. Have gained and lost tons of friends over the years. Have had tons of failed relationships because I’m too toxic and I find people that are just as toxic or even worse. I relate to the needing to feel the most mentally ill. Sadly that was the only way my family would even pretend to care about me at all. 

I really don’t know what to say I wish I could be one of those adults that could comment “ don’t worry it gets better!” But it hasn’t for me and that’s just me being honest to you.

I don’t wanna elaborate on that too much because it would be me trauma dumping on your post but in short: life gets harder as you get older and it ends up being all on you to fix your life if it starts falling apart even more.

And no doubt diet and exercise plays a role in mental and physical health, but people really say that with the smartest tone as if they’re the first person on earth to think of telling me to eat healthy and exercise more. I can always tell when someone’s never experienced true mental illness when their only recommendation to poor mental health is “well eat better”. Not only does it go to show they don’t understand the complexities of mental illness or even just poor mental health in the first place, but additionally they have clearly never gone through a period of extremely poor mental health because if they had they’d know that eating healthy can be easier said than done and exercise is the literal last thing I’m gonna be able to do when I’m so depressed I can’t even get myself to get out of bed for a glass of water.

It’s very possible they will start you on Metformin as it’s usually covered by insurance, cheap, and can be effective. They might discuss GLP1 injectables like Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, Zepbound, but they usually won’t do that right at the beginning. They might order labs and check if you have other things contributing to weight gain and may even do some genetic testing as well (usually rather expensive), and will probably also suggest seeing a dietician. You might want to look at your insurance plan and see if weight loss treatment is covered so you know if you will be paying out of pocket for things like weight loss doctor appointments, dietician, medications, etc.

As far as antipsychotics go though, Abilify doesn't affect Beta cell function as badly as something like Seroquel, so considering the positive effect that antipsychotics have been anecdotally shown to have on BPD symptoms, I'd consider Abilify to be a pretty low-risk drug in comparison and thus worth a try at the very least.",seaofneedles,18m7fck

So! My advice, if that's really what you want to do, is to stay in therapy, stay on whatever medication you find that works for you, learn and practice some DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) skills, and (obviously) study hard. An official diagnosis shouldn't affect you either way, as it's not something you need to disclose if you don't want to.

My one concern is that veterinarians actually have a high suicide rate.

0,"There's 2 ways to look at that.

Glass half empty. Your BPD goes unchecked, your BPD seems to worsen over the years. The panic about being alone will strengthen over time as you destroy more and more relationships. It becomes a vicious cycle, you feel you are running out of time, but more aware you are being that self-destructive yourself. Each time rebounding is harder and harder, because you have drained your resources (monetary, people, other physical and mental things) to climb out of the last hole. You can hit rock bottom and create new depths you didn't believe possible. Eventually one of those might lead you to:

  
Glass half full. If you do the the psychotherapy work and stay committed, personality disorders can change. Now whether you make this commitment and more importantly can follow through before the beforementioned socioeconomic impacts is going to help. It is a personality disorder. Personalities can change. It is harder being older and more stubborn, but glass half full version has to see that some people grow up shy and then learn to become public stars and great public speakers. But it does take a commitment to yourself and if you have BPD it's going to have to start where you believe in the second half of this, not the first. Even if the first part already happened to you, this second half can still happen. :)",MainAction9667,1befrjf

2,"I'm 31.
Some aspects got better, I got less impulsivity, the more I get to know my disorder, the more I accept myself. Now I've understood why I feel differently thanothers. I worked on self esteem and self love thru therapy, and there's a massive progress compared to when I was 16.

On the other hand, as I get older some aspects got worse. I feel more lonely, some symptoms are not improving at all which can lead to helplessness. Sometimes I feel doomed, and my episodes are stronger, more intense. 
Rage and anger is less frequent but deeper. There's definitely the weight of trying to get better without success, the accumulation and frustration. 
Also I unlocked a new fear now: never be able to achieve a ""good life"", dying alone and sad, seing others living happily and me struggling with basic stuff.
The FOMO is real too, as a female my biological clock started ticking but I can't see myself taking a decision about it.
When I think about the last decade, I get bitter. I feel like I've been robbed of my youth.

Important information tho, where I live DBT is not available. Medication protocole for BPD is ssri and lithium. Most of the therapist are practicing psychoanalysis as a form of treatment. So I do not have access to the best type of treatment for BPD, which can explain why I struggle so much.",1air2d,1befrjf

6,"Hello!
One of the things that I feel the most is that I’m very much affected by who and what sorrounds me. So for me, something that works very well is to follow my gut when I feel discomfort around certain people/ situations and just walk away. I tend to feel like I’m the wrong one, so having learnt to walk away till I’m around people that I thrive with for me has been a major takeaway. I feel like I can be myself and I feel good, since I’m sync with my soul and I don’t feel like other people ‘threaten me’ trying to make me something I’m not.
I feel like since we are majorly more sensitive, it’s really really important for us to create the right dynamics around us, cuz we are not good at not being influenced by other people and situations.

Maybe it was just talking about past tramas that made it career it's ugly head in a very bad way. I am currently engaged and it's very close to our wedding and I started having a BPD episode that was really bad. I was kind of pushing him away and it almost cost me my relationship. Luckily I have a wonderful man who is very patient and understands my mental disorder. He showed me a documentary that really kind of changed a lot for me. They were talking about something called DBT. It's a form of therapy that can help you control your BPD so when you're having a borderline moment it teaches you to handle that in a positive way and turn it around. I am not in DBT therapy although I've been reading a lot about it. And over the past few weeks just having the understanding and knowledge of my mental illness has allowed me to grow and to learn how to control a lot of those moments where I feel like I'm going out of control. Maybe look into DBT and it will help.,Galllatea6,1befrjf

I think we all know people who display the same symptoms we have in their 50s, 60s, 70s, etc. The only difference is the hurt they cause is less because the people who they hurt leave. 

It gets better with time only if you are trying to prevent symptoms. Its not a sprint. Its a marathon, because you have to do this for the rest of your life. Eventually, this gets easier and you form new neuropathways.

25,"I would say it mostly depends on how you are going to live your life. BPD has a strong developmental component, with either forming strong neural connections due to traumatic experiences, or not forming the proper ones. Brain is very plastic when young so these connections are strong, but over time you can form new ones that take precedence making your BPD better. It requires effort and patience to learn the proper patterns of being, but it is very possible! Something like learning to swim as a adult is harder than as a child, but still possible. You say that your feels the same way, which is good because it didn't get worse. But for it to get better you should try to go beyond just managing symptoms. 30 is still young, you have a potentially great future ahead of you.",Royal_Composer830,1befrjf

The old timers in the recovery program will respond back thank you for sharing. The reason they thank them and give back within their own program is because the group aspect is the most selfish step of them all.

You see in others while they are at their worst, where you once were.

0,"I think people say they aren’t manipulative because BPD being inherently manipulative is part of the stigma. They may be the ones that don’t manipulate and that’s great, but I think their vocalness of it can backfire on the people who do. They’re clearly trying to distance themselves from the ones who do. Almost makes it sound like those who do don’t deserve help, are “actually the evil ones,” or “not actually BPD.” I think very few people manipulate because they’re “bad” people. We think of manipulation as this deeply calculated thing made from a person who is fully able to grasp the impact and other options they have. In my experience it’s a lot more complicated than that. 

BPD is also in the same cluster as NPD and ASPD, it is not uncommon for their symptoms to overlap. I get why people want to distance themselves from it, but I think it’s important to remind those who do that stuff to not shy away from sharing their struggles. It’s extremely difficult to still talk about it when you know a harsh reaction from someone who *does not want to understand* can be waiting around the corner.",,tsp6n5

I thought that outside parties would assume that such extreme responses, so frequently, couldn't be ""real"", and must be fore show, in order to achieve a goal. This is why I thought there was a disconnect between the reputation and the experience. A lot of people responding are identifying with ""manipulation"", but without examples, I can't think of times I have consciously acted a certain way to get others to respond in a way I wanted them to. I really want to be able to identify when I do and what it looks like, and whether my behaviors are subconsciously manipulative in some way that I can identify and check.",timemelt,tsp6n5
35,A lot of people do deny it but a lot also don't realize it's manipulation. Before I got proper help and a diagnosis I didn't even realize half of the things I did was manipulative.

It took me talking to a therapist and having them point it out for me to realize what I was doing.,TinyCheeserole,tsp6n5
36,"yes!!! the deep deep rooted fear of abandonment plays so much into my tendencies to manipulate. i really try not to do it, but i feel like my main tactic is just being super emotional which i am anyway but it hurts the people i care about when i say things that make them worried about me, or express such strong emotions that they can’t handle…",lachrymoselamb,tsp6n5
37,"I been feeling like my FP will leave me soon and one of the urge I have to fight is not to do what’s your saying! My therapist is the same way with not being qualified to diagnose but she will point out how it would be Manipulation if I told my FP my grandad is sick back in the hospital depending why I was telling her; I told other people to fill them in or to get their support but specifically with my FP I can feel it’s like “you can leave just feel bad for me if you do” which is terrible

When I think manipulation, I think of me maybe not telling the whole truth orrrr asking a question in a certain way so that I can get what I want, but I would never lie or keep up a lie.

41,"I'm gonna answer because the answers some people give on this sub are way off.   


If you catch yourself saying something hoping to elicit a specific reaction out of the other person. Let's say you're sharing your feeling, but not in an attempt to be open or honest, but moreso in an attempt to get the other person to be sympathetic to you, or even worse, as a hail mary because the interaction isn't going the way you were hoping.   


It shows a genuine lack of care and respect for the other person, because your hiding your intentions behind normal human behaviour. It's disingenuous and hard to recognize if you don't know it's being done. Which is why a lot of ex-partners of BDP people feel (rightfully so) gaslight.

But we've talked about this. It's not easy for anyone, but if there's at least communication than there can be peaceful coexistence.

Many of the people on this sub who cry about never being good enough for normal relationships are just entitled and never take accountability for their action.

0,"I can’t speak for everyone, but in my personal experience therapy has helped me not feel everything so deeply. As has just naturally getting older. From when I was a child through probably 24 years old everything was so painful. I’m in my late twenties now and between therapy, having a child, and just generally aging I don’t feel as miserable and sensitive as I used to. 

Part of that is also probably because I was drinking so heavily during those ages and making so many terrible decisions. I was dating people who treated me terribly. I was staying out late, could barely keep a job so I was always in financial ruin. Honestly, the way I was treating myself and my body is probably why I felt so emotional all of the time. Alcohol typically makes people more emotional. Vaping and other nicotine products probably make anxiety skyrocket. Impulsive decisions (whether it be sex, financial decisions, etc) can make us more emotional. Not taking care of our bodies can cause anxiety to increase. Even down to the food you’re eating and whether you’re exercising regularly. 

Therapy can help you make better decisions, handle the extreme emotions you DO have in a way that doesn’t make your life even worse, and put you in a position to treat your body better. Combine those things together and I think naturally the emotions you do have just come down a few pegs. At least, for me it did.",triviolett,1acmhn7

2,"HEY i was in a really similar boat when i started exploring dbt, it seemed WAY too focused on preventing your internal from affecting the external, and couldnt actually touch on diminishing the reason that you were having episodes (outbursts, meltdowns, ect) in the first place, aka reduce the emotional intensity in any meaningful way

and i also felt very similarly defeated, like what the hell am i even doing any of this for if im still going to feel like reheated nightmare shit every day for forever

well, i cant speak for your lived experiences and your milage may vary, but what ive found is that over time, putting the work into skills made to make it easier for others, inadvertently also makes it easier for you to process your own feelings. the time spent analyzing what is and isnt appropriate for people outside of yourself also, in a way, makes it easier for you to rationalize events to yourself, and get a better feel on what isnt appropriate or healthy, even when its directed at only yourself

Once i became more secure in the idea of being committed to actually, genuinely changing, it became easier to forcibly lessen the grip that ruminating on those thoughts might have on you otherwise. the distress tolerance skills you have to learn for preventing blow ups at people ALSO work when youre just trying to calm your own ass down by yourself. 

no lie, it felt like faking for the longest time. a lot of it is going to be challenging your own thoughts, over and over and over. it really is a game you have to play a long time, overwriting unhealthy habits you might not even realize how deeply are engrained in you, but it IS worth the effort. eventually it stops feeling like pretending. 

im nowhere near done with the work myself, and still have a lot of bad days. but also, holy shit, not all of em.

That + DBT + getting older and finding a balance in life that works for me. Good job, supportive environment, stable relationships etc. all really help.
I do still have very intense emotions but they aren't anywhere near as bad as they used to be.
Anger and impulsiveness are still an issue, being aware and stopping myself go down the rabbit hole helps a lot.
If stuff in life happens, (a friend dying last year was one of them) then I let myself go for a while, had some grieving therapy and sat with those emotions - that helped.

Therapists are expensive, so I am so grateful to have found groups of people recovering together. I've been doing this for about 2 years, and it got worse before it got better but the recovery has been good so far.

13,"Finding internal and external resources that help. For me finding out about nervous system regulation was absolutely life changing. My anxiety was crippling and for no good reason. But I found there were things I could consistently keep doing and it got a little better. Also not relying on others to meet my needs, trying to meet my own. Like when I desperately need a cuddle, I can run a bath or cuddle a soft toy and self soothe. Maybe call a friend and tell them what I need. For me personally I found guided meditations ok but trying EFT tapping (through an app, poor and lazy here) was absolutely amaaaazing. Will take me off the ledge like no one else can (it's me! Showing up for myself?!) 

Um and I also tried microdosing a week or so ago since I found a trusted source (LSD), for me it's like an ssri with a real hyperfocus on self growth but not in a victimised indulgent way, in a wow I actually want to help myself for myself way. I've been really focused on my self work since, like I can't get enough learning or contemplation. My feels are still intense but I'm starting to laugh at the absurdity of some, and also use the intensity to see what I need to give myself. 

I'm currently reading I need your love - is it true? By Byron Katie. It's super confronting but the audio book is read by her so it's a bit more easy to swallow. She really helped me confront the validity of my thoughts, and I've been through a few therapists and self help regimes that were an ok bandaid at the time but this is like a salve of self compassion. 

Also I guess I'm here on my journey because I can't afford to be anywhere else, suffering for this many years wore me out so much I just couldn't be with myself anymore. I had to believe there was a reason, the wounded victim can become the wounded healer - in fact the only ones who can heal (themselves or others) are ones who have been through the pits of despair and wrangled the ego to make our lives make enough sense to find the meaning in it all and grow beyond it. 

I've experienced happiness, joy and wonder on levels I had doubted their existence by spending time with myself and doing lots of shadow work, inner child work, contemplating, and practicing mindfulness. I can't even say one thing was the fix, it's all of them, with the somatics stuff of bringing the trauma out of the body - trauma informed yoga, acupuncture (my fave, I have chronic pain and can't take painkillers so this is my jam) chiropractor (if you find a good one..) EFT tapping, breathwork/meditation. And one thing I learnt is just cos it's meant to help you, it might not in the moment if you don't feel like it. I used to force myself to do meditations and I do not recommend that, it isn't very self compassionate or kind.

The philosophy and psychology of emotions was fascinating.  Just study ""anger"" and ""infatuation"" and ""happiness"" as individual subjects.  I became more emotionally analytic and less emotionally impulsive.

I feel like it was the best way to really process the emotion as opposed to all the triggers of the emotions.  I learned to drop the story and on the flip side, think of the story with a different emotion attached to it.

It just made me more ""manageable"" and easier to swallow for others, who can very much tell that Im pretty ""off"" after any extended period of time. It just taught me to make my symptoms manageable to benefit and not inconvenience others or make them uncomfortable, at my own expense. Regardless of any of my diagnoses. It didnt matter what I wanted help with, the ""help"" was managing outward behaviors to make me easier for others to handle or gaslighting/telling me to gaslight myself that its not that bad or Im being unreasonable or I just dont wanna not feel that way badly enough so I ""choose"" not to feel different and get better. My wellness was always evaluated by my external performance but heaven forbid I tell anyone I still felt terrible internally no matter how well I was doing or it was my fault and I wanna be that way bc I just dont feel better. It was honestly super damaging psychologically, damaging to my self esteem from a young age, and put me in a lot of shitty situations as a teen/adult.

There’s a lot of useful tools to behave less emotionally and this will help your relationships, but focusing on finding your happiness will help you regulate the intensity of your emotions.

17,"So true about ""we're making you less of a danger than helping you suffer less."" 

Some stuff I've been doing recently to help the suffering from having big emotions:

- spiral prep. When I'm gonna do something that I know makes me spiral, I write before why I'm doing the thing. I get the list in my head, I review it before the event. And after when I'm spiraling, the spiral prep is in my head along with the spiraling, lessening the spiraling. I can go into detail if you want, just ask

- not shaming myself for my emotions - I am not ""overreacting"", I am reacting. Sure it is more/more intense than people without BPD, but I am human too and this is just how I am. Not saying it's easy to not feel shame for big emotions or spiraling or splitting over ""little"" things. Environment plays a big role. I've recently moved back in with my parents (who love to always tell me I'm overreacting) and so those thoughts have increased in my head and they're harder to fight back. My point is, if you're the type to beat yourself up (like me), everything is not your fault, your environment and people around you play a big role

- not bottling up thoughts no matter how inane or ridiculous - this goes along with the not shaming myself. So I guess the first step is not shaming myself, and the next is saying the thought or feeling. However this I guess requires you have at least someone trustworthy you can talk to. Basically it's not about saying anything no matter the consequences, it's about not minimizing yourself and feelings

So to answer your question in the title, I think we are able to feel the emotions AND not suffer. Not saying the big emotions stop being distressing ever, but we can at least not hurt ourselves for having them. And the emotions themselves can become less distressing I think.

We just need support and community and healthy environments, and to work on our self esteem and fight internalized beliefs about we're ""overreacting."" This is all easier said than done (saying that in a gentle, understanding way, not in a condescending way).",brickycat22,1acmhn7

19,"It gets better. Intensity of emotions decrease with therapy over time in my experience, as you learn to tolerate them instead of trying to avoid them. 

This might sound counter-intuitive but emotions are temporary, they just come and go as you learn to tolerate and process them. So you just gotta get in the mindset of facing them head on. It helped me a lot making a challenge out of it as I'm generally up for challenges.

At this point, I can verbalize my emotions in such a healthy manner that I end up calming people down instead of antagonizing them further while still enjoying the benefits of having intense emotions.",Brightmist,1acmhn7
20,"I would say personally that the emotions are still intense (not as insanely intense as they used to be) but you basically learn different techniques/tools manage them better which is usually (but not always) learned by doing enough therapy.

For example journaling is an insanely power technique, put all of that shit down on paper, that usually speeds up the recovery time and then you can just throw that paper away if need be. Other techniques is just learning how to exit a situation and process the emotions yourself/later etc etc.

1,"You do deserve things. Life is tough, but don't trick yourself into thinking you don't deserve things. You deserve love and compassion, trust and communication. 


I'm sorry you're having the world coming down on you. 💔",GothicBland,1cltbvl
2,"You’re not a burden. I know some stranger on the internet saying that doesn’t help, but it is the truth, and I’m so sorry that your brain is telling you those things:( 

You don’t deserve to talk to yourself that way, or to feel guilty for that either. 

You are going through something hard, and you deserve lots of grace for that. 

When I feel at my lowest, Pinterest helps. I search exactly what I need, ex. “How to stop feeling guilty,” “how to stop feeling like a burden,” “how to be kinder to yourself.” It does help. 

You need to heal from this, and I know with all the other stressors going on that seems impossible, but do as much research as you can when you’re up to it. 

You are valuable even when you’re sick, even when you’re angry, even when you have to rely on others. Now all you gotta do is learn how to believe that. It takes time, but that’s all you need. Time and mindfulness. 

You are a human being. You’re not all good, it’s impossible to be, but you’re not all bad. I’d even argue that the fact that you care so deeply about burdening your friends and family makes you a pretty great person. The thing that holds you back is caring so much about what others think at the expense of yourself. 

There’s a balance that you need to find. And it is possible, I swear to you it is. 

I used to think I was the most unloveable person to ever exist, and I surrounded my entire life around being better and making others happy. But the only way you can truly make the people in your life happy, and yourself, is to learn how to not be so hard on yourself. Not to be EVEN harder. 

It’s not that you are a burden, it’s that you believe you’re one. That is the problem alone. 

It’s not your fault, it’s probably due to past experiences and the way others have made you feel about yourself, and that part of you needs to be healed is all. 

I know on my healing journey, I had to face a lot of horrible truths. About who I am, about how I let others treat me, and how I responded to their behaviour when I should’ve just walked away. But then once you get through all that, you get to the point where you realize, you didn’t know any better. You wanted to, you tried to understand, but you weren’t given the information you needed. And that’s okay. As long as we try now, even when we have setbacks and feel like it’s useless, even when the world turns it’s back on us. We can still get back up and start off where we left off when we’re ready again. And then every time it gets easier, and easier, until it’s okay. 

I hope this helps you, and I’m so sorry you’re going through this. You’re aloud to feel the pain that comes along with it, but do whatever you can not to let it consume you. 

Our feelings are tools, we can learn how to use them to help us get through things and figure stuff out. But you need to learn how.",jellybeanrainbows,1cltbvl

Now I work from home and I hate this company. They tried to write me up because I reported a senior agent for harassment. The woman harassed me on 3 occasions the final one was where she sent me a 10 sentence paragraph desrcribing how awful of an agent I was. They said what did did was innapropriate but that she was trying to help me. I said that wasnt help she belittled and mistreated me, she put me down and insulted me and would not stop after I told her to. They labeled me as aggressive because I said to her, ""you are not my manager, I am terminating the call and I am contacting my supervisor about this."" 

I told HR they were gaslighting me and showing favoritism and that this was very much indeed harassment and that I was documenting everything.  I told them that telling a black woman that she is agressive when shes being assertive ia a microagression. It can be viewed as discriminatory. After that they decided not to write me up.

9,"Hey friend. I SO relate to this post. I recently quit smoking weed almost 3 months ago now after over 10 years of daily use. I smoked daily for similar reasons to you, and also wanted to quit for similar reasons. My biggest thing is that I just don’t want to need something like that to be okay anymore. 
I wanted to quit for about a year before being able to, but I knew that I would when I was ready, and I did. 

I think it’s extremely important to give yourself a lot of Grace as you move through this. If you do decide to quit, try changing up your routine as much as possible, and probably getting rid of all of your stash unless you have tremendous self control. For me, I’m a stubborn fuck. That can come in handy in situations like this. Once I make my mind up about something, I’m doing it 100%. All or nothing, am I right? lol

The first month wasn’t as hard as I thought I’d be, mostly physical symptoms as I worked through lack of appetite, and differences in sleep. I recommend trying magnesium, and melatonin for nightly relaxation and helping you fall asleep. Melatonin is a life saver when it comes to this. At 3 months after quitting, I don’t need the melatonin unless I’m pretty overstimulated. And honestly, my sleep is so so SO much better now. I really enjoy having dreams again, and I just overall feel like sleeping is more productive. My appetite is back to full force too, like super full force. I’m actually hungrier after quitting. But during the time you’re going through withdrawal, I’d try having some milk, protein shakes, easy snacks on hand. 

After the first month, I had some shit show up for me that reminded me why I using in the first place. I had about a week long episode of being really really not okay. I was able to reach out to my therapist at that time, which helped A LOT at making me not feel crazy. But I had to remind myself over and over and over again WHY I am doing this. Because if I choose to just go back to smoking when these hard emotions show up, I’m never going to progress or really learn how to manage myself, and Heal. I found what was really hidden underneath my daily baked buzz and it was unsettling. But I know it’s something I have to work through, and I promise you, it’s gotten easier and easier and easier. I’m so grateful I stayed strong over that week. It actually helped me learn that my hard moments and feelings actually do pass. 
Which felt like a huge revelation after stuffing them down with weed all these years. 

I feel like I am slowly coming to a normal baseline. And I truly am not missing feeling so spaced all of the time, and having the want to smoke hanging over me ALL the time. I feel like I can actually be a bit more present with myself and others.

0,"I feel this. College has become a place of constant dissociation for me and my school doesn't give accommodations for attendance (and also doesn't recognize BPD as something that warrants any accommodations). I have found that having a set place to study has made it easier. For me, if I don't feel ready in even the slightest for an exam or presentation I almost certainly will bail and my dissociation makes it so hard to ever feel ready. It has been a lot of tries and fails with medication and it really ended up going to having some sort of comfort media (podcasts for me) that I let myself listen to while studying. I also play this little game of everyone can tell I am not there and is judging me for skipping class that makes me more anxious to miss class. I hope that this helps and I hope you can find a good balance because college is hard but college with bpd is near impossible.

If Lamictal was that radical in treating your symtoms I'd say that is alot of evidence that points to having bipolar.    

As someone else said there is not one single drug approved for use for borderline.   Most are a short term bandaid for treating some symtoms.    The treatment for borderline is dbt and has shown works long term.    

Lamictal and other moodstabilizers can radically trreat bipolar symtoms and are life savers.    They do not work that way for borderline.   

Now it is also common to have both borderline and bipolar.    And misdiagnosis is so common.   I suggest you go thru the criteria yourself and see if you meet at least 5 out of 9 ideally using someone you know well to help.

0,"It’s always talks about an FP till you become an FP. A lot of people justify it. I’m lucky as to where my FPs were also people who bullied me but I still like them. I think they’re cool people just not cool with me. I’m a lot more avoidant now, sometimes I come across this subreddit and the justifications of an FP overwhelms me so much I’m glad when I see a post about not having an FP. 

Been an FP to someone, hurt a lot and in the end i’m sure I’ll be a bad person to her for some good reasons some I think are problems of her own. I find it incredibly inconsiderate with people talking about boundaries here and there then do the same thing they would hate to be given.

It’s a learning curve, maybe it’s a lesson learnt but it’s not something you deserve, be sure to set boundaries earlier than later and PLEASE PRIORITISE YOURSELF. The whole “I love more than they love me” is very unfair. Please for the love of God you don’t owe it to her. You really don’t, plus she’s older than you, she has to learn to find help to be equipped. Otherwise it’s like a person sinking dragging the people around them with them.

I would say the way to make this into a silver lining scenario is to learn from it, recognize what about her you can see in yourself and work on bettering yourself with the motive of ""I don't want to be like her.""

As for your initial worry about how to handle what you're already into, there isn't going to be a peaceful ending where she accepts it. Her showing up to your apartment like this shows that much.

You'll have to accept that, in her eyes, when you step away for your own sake you are going to be the bad guy. Just remember, you aren't actually a bad person. It is okay to look out for yourself. You are not at fault for her issues.",Sp1n_Kuro,1bykbt0

0,"Tbh I wouldn’t talk to the psychiatrist so much about it, unless you think it was a side effect of your medication. I’d save this talk for the therapist. 

Now, while I understand the feeling of feeling like the things said and done during the episode were a different person, in reality (and to the perception of the person to got the short end of the stick) it was you. 

What you should do is message them. Something along the lines of “I’m sorry about how I acted/what I said. I know it’s inexcusable and no one deserves to be treated like that. Sometimes I fly off the handle because of issues in face in my past and I can make me react poorly to [whatever triggered you]. I act impulsively and say things I don’t mean but I know will hurt, and that’s not right. My mental health is my responsibility and i need to get it better under control. Im currently in therapy trying to do the work to not respond this way, but I still have a ways to go. I just really want you to know I’m remorseful and i don’t mean what I said. I understand if you don’t want to talk right now but I just wanted to say my piece and I want to hear yours if you want to share.”

Obviously you should make it More sincere and more applicable to your situation. Also, if it’s to someone you’re not that close to make it more short and concise, as they’re less likely to want a heart-to-heart but if it’s a close friend, partner, or family, say as much or little as you want.

you might be scared that stuff could get worse by communicating.

but if he is a good one, he most likely understands and even feels better about you and safer, by kinda understanding what’s going on. that could even prevent future problems by having that „secure“ line of communication to address when shit blows up in your faces again.

and if lucky, you even have something positive to remember and find courage in when you on this same bridge the next time. maybe connect something good with communicating yk - re-wire the brain and stuff.

and if it goes the wrong way, you can at least look back and say you tried.

1,"Your experience is to a T what I felt at first.. almost word for word lol. It took me a few months of spiraling post-diagnosis to actually come to terms with it. Once I was like ""oh damn this is for real"", I enrolled myself in therapy and got on the right medication like you did. You're doing great! Definitely on the right track. 

If you're interested in how I got diagnosed and what helps and doesn't I'll add it below ~

I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 for *years*. Never felt like I fit that criteria just right though.. then I looked into BPD. I think the media is **evil** in portraying BPD. Because of the stereotype, I never cared to look into what it actually entails. But when I did.. woooof. It hit close to home. More like.. a tornado blew through my house if you will LOL. Anyway. Talked to my therapist about it. I'd been seeing her for a couple years so I trusted her to give it to me straight. She absolutely did. She said she wasn't ready to tell me that I fit the criteria because she was scared I would fixate and spiral on it... Which I absolutely did once she told me, lol. Went to my psych, he insisted it was BP type 1 still, but did suggest to go to PHP to be monitored. Did PHP and they confirmed the BPD diagnosis. They did keep the BP diagnosis but changed it to type 2.. which made more sense to me. I mean, I took it seriously but I was in absolute limbo for a year about it. I only took it *seriously* about 1.5 years ago and decided to be proactive about it. Damn glad I did. I don't know where'd I'd be if I didn't go through treatment and get on the right meds.",OneShirtWrinkle,1cfmdfl
2,"Tbh it just fit everything in my life thus far up to that point. And still fit everything after it lmao. 

I couldn’t stop thinking about old relationships, and how shitty they ended up, how many people I’d just obliterated out of my life for no reason, how many people I’d come to believe were evil until reflection years later and realizing, they honestly didn’t do more than That One Thing that made me hate them completely. How many crazy things I did impulsively that just didn’t make any sense in hindsight, at all. 

There’s one moment years pre-diagnosis that still haunts me. I remember this guy I was seeing broke things off and he was very nice about it. I tried to be calm. But my efforts didn’t last long. I went scorched earth fury on him, can’t remember what I said but it was bad, I just know it was bad. And i remember one text he sent out of several— that said “You’re fucking crazy.” And it made me see ten thousand more shades of red. It made me feel like I had no choice but to opt out. I’m lucky my brother was with me, he talked me down and stayed with me until I was calmer. 

But anyway yeah, stuff like that just kept popping up in my memory like “hey, so why didn’t you realize that wasn’t normal?” 😅 I had other diagnoses already so I guess I just figured it was something arising out of those, I wasn’t educated enough to realize it had to be something else back then.",Melodic_Objective_70,1cfmdfl

I’ve healed in counseling and it’s taken along time. Ultimately, if you care or love someone, you really want them to be happy.

8,"I fear I should be on medication for these things, namely anxiety and depression, but the last time I took an anti-depressant, it messed me up so bad I tried to unalive myself. So I self-medicated instead with marijuana, which also messed me up after a while in different ways. So like, I guess no meds for me? But raw-dogging life sucks too, so there isn't really a win here.

But, as someone in holistic healthcare, I try to advocate for as little medication as needed (depending on the diagnosis), since intrinsic work should be done first. I'm not a fan of just giving people medication right off the bat due to possible addiction, needing to rely on it for possibly their entire life, and the long-term effects of some.

It's tough because the pharmaceutical industry, hospital funding and society pressures doctors into prescribing medication. In a 2016 survey on the National Institutes of Health government page, it was reported that 57% of doctors prescribed medication to avoid negative impact on the Joint Commission and 46% to avoid decreased patient satisfaction scores  Basically, to be reimbursed for their services, it's better to prescribe more. So I'm a bit apprehensive to go on medications. A good rule of thumb is to never trust a therapist that willingly prescribes medication after the first session.

And yes, medication can cause some serious withdrawals just like any other drug. But that doesn't mean you can't power through it! I have no advice, really, and I probably didn't give what you may have been looking for, but these are some facts that push me away from medication in general",cuetheconfetti,15tt6zt

speaking out my emotions, fears, etc. also help me to calm down. i begin to actually hear myself and realize i’m overthinking, etc. doing this with a trusted person is key though.

If not, I would recommend at LEAST talking to a professional (therapist, doctor, whatever you feel comfortable with) so maybe you can trade out the benzo’s for something more appropriate or you can just say fuck the meds altogether and gain the skills/tools you need to manage your BPD. 

I say this as someone who is currently in recovery from opioids (I’m only a few weeks clean) and am using suboxone to get off opioids. I’m also intensive outpatient treatment (10+ hours a week of group treatment). And it’s A LOT of struggle, pain and effort I have to endure. All because I chose to self medicate so I didn’t have to feel the feels associated with BPD. I wouldn’t wish this process on my worst enemy.

0,"“He should live without therapy like humans have been doing for thousands of years” Just because therapy and mental health recognition is a newer movement/thing, does not mean that it is not helpful for you. That is a very silly point to make. Humans also died prematurely for thousands of years before doctors, from colds and the flu- we found ways to treat it properly- but since the dawn of time didn’t come with that treatment, it shouldn’t be used, people have been fighting off illnesses for thousands of years without it- see how silly that sounds? Mental health is the same way. It is a part of your overall health and it should be treated, and therapy is a way of treating it, just like medicine treats a cold. 
Another note- therapy has become more normalized as depression and anxiety become more common. We haven’t had this extent of therapy forever, because we haven’t always been in the position with mental health that we are in now- just from 1990 to 2017, depression diagnosis increased over 49% [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395619307381#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20incident%20cases,Myanmar%20(1.28%20per%201000)) and Covid 19 pandemic alone increased anxiety cases by 25%! [link](https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide) mental health issues are becoming more and more of a common issue, and it just wasn’t recognized before. 
Seeking therapy is not weak. It is responsible. You are treating your health. It is a very common issue that needs to be treated.
If he still thinks it’s a scam practice that is on him. But many people need these services and therapists have to do lots of school to understand humans and to help treat us, they are professionals. That is not to say they are all perfect, but generally, it is something people will benefit from.

1,"Listen!!! I'm in the exact same situation omg. It's horrible!

I've been in a treatment center since January and also FP free since then. Making good progress and doing my therapy. A couple weeks ago I decide to try dating around. Nothing serious. It's going good just casual dates. And then I meet someone last week and it leads to us talking non stop all day everyday. 

We go on a date. It goes great and bam I'm obsessed. But after the date she started to become distant and I immediately think it's my fault and i stop eating for 2 days and can't function because I'm mirroring her mood. 

I've been making so much progress in dbt skills and it feels like I threw it all away in 2 days. Now I have all these thoughts that I did something or she doesn't like me or just it's all fucked up. And now I can't function. And I know my therapist would say ""it was just one date it happens"" but I can't let it go. I'm spiraling.

The way we've coped with this was by having some hardcore truth talks. Now, naturalllyyyyy, I have a real hard time believing his reassurances. Haven't figured out how to get past that one, or the energy sensitivity I have with him.

If it isn't clear, I mean like I can easily (too easily) pick up on his mood and physical feelings; such as feeling unmotivated, or sleepy. I then feel guilty for feeling the opposing and slip right there with him. I know this has something to do with having a POS father and just making life easier by not being in a good or productive mood just for it to be brought down abruptly and painfully.

14,"I've found myself in similar situations. But as I've learned to cope, Ive developed a more cynical attitude. Perhaps it may be an extreme but being a balanced cynic may help. When you meet someone, immediately have 0 expectations no matter how great they are. Until they've proven you're worth their time, view them as ""just like the rest"" no matter how much you want them to be. 

THAT DOES NOT MEAN treat them like shit or you don't want them around lol just give them a piece of you, then let them give you a piece of them. If they don't, then yk where they stand. 
Message for plans, and if they're busy, see if they offer to reschedule. If they don't every time, you know where you stand. 
Message them first a few times then stop and see if they message you first. If they don't, you know where they stand

It's really hard, but the key is not to fixate one one person. Having hobbies and working making money can only go so far when youre alone. You can also try making connections on reddit! There are some friendship reddits where you can meet friends. You can try using people to occupy your time, yet keep your distance while still having fun (I know that sounds manipulative, but when people don't show they care, it's easy to just have fun then bounce). Most importantly pay close attention to the people that do message you randomly. That's HUGE for people like us. But it's only huge when we don't fixate on trying to find or keep a specific person because we want to challenge and prove to ourselves we can earn their validation. Earning validation should be a challenge that leaves us exhausted. It should be smooth sailing and easy and fun and exciting. If someone doesn't make you feel that way, maybe it's time to let them go.

I've been through this plenty of times and after detoxing from my FP's who are toxic, I can focus on people that really care. So I hope this helps and good luck to BOTH of you ☺️😊🤟",section80babyman,mtba08

Maybe they got a new phone, or are traveling to a different country in which case they wouldn’t be able to use iMessage 

Perhaps instead you could email them to ask whether or not they can see you again? 

Emails can generate automated responses if they are indeed taking time off or vacation or something. Even if it doesn’t, it allows them to read it, and respond( hopefully) in a professional when they have a chance.

Blocking a past client with no conversation or notice or previous talk of boundaries is highly unprofessional and plain hurtful.

It isn't worth telling anyone. I would even strongly hesitate to tell a significant other if they don't already know because it places stigma or bias even if they claim it doesn't. I've unfortunately formed this opinion over 10 years of having moderately severe BPD because anyone I've ever told has ceased being in my life shortly after being told. And please, never tell co-workers or your boss EVER. I've only told a handful of people and regretted it each time. The first broke up with me that night,  the next 2  in a few weeks and the last one just started to act weird and call me mentally ill on regular basis. That relationship never progressed into anything, but it gave them ammunition to chalk everything up to ""you are mentally ill, therefore I'm always right and you are wrong"".

The second reaction is that people are greatly supportive and stay closer to you in order to reassure you and wanting to really help you through your problems

The third reaction is when someone looks at you in totally the opposite way than the second, they see you as a threat, as an enemy, as someone manipulative and that wants only to care about himself (that is, we know it, absolutely untrue)

My grandmother however did google it, not in attempt to understand but more to judge for herself and told me that I can’t possibly have that. Coming from the woman who I see like three times a year. 

From medical professionals I’ve had most of them say they can’t treat me and told me to go to inpatient because I’m too high risk for anyone to treat. That’s bs though because I’m no where near as high risk as other ppl w/ BPD that I’ve met. Not saying that they’re “worse” than me and don’t deserve treatment because of it or anything I’m just saying I’m not really as actively suicidal and they knew that so I don’t really understand the big refusal.

11,"Honestly if I ever say ""BPD"" people immediately go ""Oh yeah, Bipolar!"" and then I correct and go actually its called borderline personality disorder and honestly most people don't know what it is.

That said, my opinion here is going to be a little different from the majority. I've actually had really positive experiences with telling people. One of my good friends admitted recently that he did research on it to learn more about it and honestly that was really touching, because I never expect anyone to really care that much. 

I willll say its better to tell people when you're feeling super level and normal and not ""acting crazy."" Explaining from a place of calm is something people can relate to on some level. Explaining that perceived abandonment triggers a more-hurtful-than-normal response is honestly something people have probably felt themselves at least once in their lives. 

For me, its a convenient way to bundle ""depression, eating disorder, intense fear of abandonment, rejection sensitivity, impulse-based issues (substance abuse, reckless sexual behavior, excessive partying, living the ""fuck it"" mentality, adrenaline junkie shit), and anger"" into a tidy little package. Sometimes I mention that it falls into similar behavior patterns to ADHD, and that's a helpful and less-demonizing frame of reference, because everyone ""is a little ADHD,"" according to them.

TLDR: read the room before you say anything. Tell people you *want* to tell...not that you feel compelled to. Do it in a way thats safe and with people you trust, and always explain coming from a place of calm, not triggered-ness. It'll help you A LOT in the long run.",sadbabybrat,qv78g6

1,"None of that bullshit is rooted in DBT. In fact it goes against a lot of the principles of DBT, like showing a person in pain basic respect and validation of their pain. I’m so glad your partner left because he does not deserve that abuse and honestly I don’t think those providers are capable of providing actual DBT training. 

I mean for fuck’s sake, DBT doesn’t even use enforcing language. It doesn’t say ‘x behavior is healthy and y behavior is toxic.’ Instead it “invites you” to consider alternative mindsets. 

I’m so mad on your partner’s behalf. Please don’t let this abuser shape your view of DBT.",Insomniached,19ae5mf
2,"I was hospitalized as a teenager for severe depression and anorexia in Germany too. There was so much going wrong at that clinic. I could write a whole essay about things I experienced there that further harmed me. I know someone who works there and he told me about a similar situation with a transgender patient whom the treatment team refused to gender correctly. It was very upsetting for her as well and obvious that she wouldn’t be able to benefit from therapy if this basic part of her identity wasn’t respected. But that didn’t even seem to be the priority of her therapist. The person who works there has also told me other horrifying stories about patients not being taken seriously, intimidated and punished.

That doctor disrespected and manipulated your partner and is absolutely not fit to help mentally ill people. SHE’s the one being oppressive and controlling, not your partner. I‘m so sorry this happened and angry that so much harm is being done in places meant for healing and recovery. Many people working in psychiatric clinics seem to be more interested in exerting control and enforcing (harmful, pointless) rules and boundaries than in actually helping their patients by listening to them and learning about them with openness and respect.

I also wonder if people like that doctor ever try to put themselves in the patient‘s shoes and empathize with them. Opening up to a stranger, seeking help and especially accepting inpatient treatment takes a lot courage and can feel really scary. It certainly felt terrifying for me. Those working with mentally ill patients should be extra sensitive and compassionate, not extra harsh and hurtful.

I can't say that dealing with medical professionals is easy as a trans person, because so many are woefully uneducated about even the basics of treating a trans person, but any therapist worth seeing will respect their patient's rights to express their identity freely and be supportive of that. I can't guarantee he won't face further ignorance because there's plenty of it out in the world, but I wouldn't consider it the norm, and he absolutely shouldn't settle for it.

I heard it is quite strict and there are lots of rules. After reconsideration: it's a no-go no matter what type of therapy it is.

9,"ETA: while I am older, I am a more recent diagnosis and treatment, though I have had the symptoms most of my life.

39.  I was very quiet BPD with heavy masking by overdoing other stuff until I was hit with 2020 Covid (as a nurse), moving after living in the same place for 10 years, and starting grad school (which I did not stay in).

I absolutely broke down over many months until I was really really scared.  I did get the diagnosis a couple of months in, I have seen the same psych provider for 10 years, so she noticed the subtle pattern. Learning helped a little, but the dysregulation got worse and worse and ended up in the hospital during the worst of the worst with SH and SI.  After a quick stabilization I was discharged to PHP, 2 weeks, and IOP, 6 weeks.

I was 37 and I was tired of wasting time, I’d been battling mental illness that was marginally responsive to treatment for at least 25 years.  In my own research, I kept finding that the best treatment outcomes and even “remission” to the point that I wouldn’t have enough symptoms to fit the diagnostic criteria was MOST likely with the “full-model” DBT: weekly skills group, weekly individual DBT, Diary Card, coaching calls.  At least one year, preferably 2.  I have not been working or going to school, I do volunteer semi-frequently though.  After the DBT group, I moved to an emotional resiliency group weekly, focused on just that, continuing to manage strong emotions. Still do weekly individual therapy, there are no coaching calls in stage 2 DBT.

I am a couple months from my 2 year mark.  And I realized, just the other day, I slowed down in an upsetting interpersonal situation and all the same judgmental (self judgement), BPD type thoughts and emotions were there, but for the FIRST time in 2 years, they were NOT LOUDER, than my wise mind/logic mind.  

I would have never, ever, imagined being at this point.  My relationship continues to be a challenge as my partner is completely emotionally self-unaware. He does not recognize nor can he process them.  A big part of improvement was not taking so much responsibility for his emotions and emotional intelligence.  I was the “fix it or fault/fail” type pwBPD and had to learn somet hings I cannot fix and I should not fix them.  I can respond in a situation for my own benefit only, if needed, and that’s okay. 

Like I said, I am a nurse, I have not worked through this or gone to school.  School is indefinitely set aside, I went down that road for the wrong reasons to begin with.  I have a 13 year old son and a crap ton of pets.  I interact with a small number of super trusted friends (maybe 5), but am comfortable in situations with strangers or acquaintances most of the time.  I do want to go back to work, but I have zero desire to ever return to acute care (in hospital).  I have enjoyed public health/community health and am an excellent candidate for those jobs, but I don’t see enough positives to work outside the home yet.  I volunteer extensively with Boy Scouts, with and without my family.  Leadership teaching and summer camp nurse mostly. These things are very fulfilling to me.

I’m so sorry for the novel, but that’s what life looks like at 39. When I am having an bad episode day, I definitely feel like “I’m barely 39, how on earth will I survive another 30+ years with this. I can’t” I just try to redirect to the present 🤷‍♀️",perpetualstudy,13tzb45

Best advice I can give is - progress isn't linear.  It will speed up, slow down, pause, maybe backslide.  None of that invalidates the work you do.  Try to break things down into smaller issues to deal with, rather than a huge single issue.

And, med-wise - I found an anti-psychotic made a huge difference for me.   Super tiny dose, Rexulti - took away the ""edgy"" aspect,made me feel stable, let me handle things calmly.

They basically wanted me to think something was wrong with me for wanting to take care of myself.

1,"Hey there. I'm AuDHD as well and have been taking Lamictal for a few years. It is quite literally the only medication I've tried that has helped me so far with my BPD. If the medicine works for you, please don't give up on it or feel ashamed that you take it just because your stepmom is being some type of way. There is definitely a possibility they are acting this way because of how people view certain medications and treatments (I've had plenty of  people raise an eyebrow at some of the stuff I've taken- Lamictal included). But there's also a chance that the Lamictal is working as intended and you're now starting to be more aware of what's happening in your head and around you. That particular medicine gave me the ability to pick apart and identify issues better, as well as figure out what I'm feeling and why. Before I started taking it, I was so trapped in my head and only aware of what was going on in my brain. I had complete tunnel vision and didn't ""see"" other people or their reactions to my behavior, only my own emotions. It could very well be that the medicine is snapping you out of that funk, and now you are seeing what's around you more clearly. Either way, it's terrible to hear that they aren't giving you the support you need. Please please please don't let their attitude ruin the fact that you found something helpful!! That medicine saved my life and I hope it continues to help you no matter what they say. Something that might be useful to you is taking note of when you see changes in their behavior. Like writing down what you said and their reactions to it. This might help you find a pattern to their hostility and figure out if they're always like that or if they're just belittling mental health treatment. I know myself I can't always remember things that happen so I have to take note. If you ever need to talk about it or anything else my dms are always open and I hope this was helpful in some way!",Able-Safety8626,1aseuyf
2,"They really don't :/ They even refuse to believe that my eldest sibling has autism despite being diagnosed by one of the leading professionals in the state, however they treat my eldest stepsister like an angel even though she's also autistic and my other sister the same way and she's diagnosed with adhd. So it's very much a mixed bag with them, a double standard kind of. My stepsisters are allowed to have actual diagnosis and get treated with kindness, understanding, and respect while me and my eldest blood-sib are basically treated like trash. My other older sister basically gets treated like my step siblings because she managed to get good grades and mask her issues extremely well. 

And with my mom(I don't live with her) she is also autistic and has adhd as well as a lot of other things, so I don't get why my parent and stepmom don't want to accept the fact that more than two of their 5 kids are actually disabled? It's all so irritating really. And if I could, I would 100% move out of my parents house, but unfortunately my only source of income at the moment is doordash, which doesn't really get me much. I absolutely plan on going no-contact with them if possible because there's no way that they're going to change their attitude with me, in all 21 years of my life so far, I've been treated the same way. I'm even the last one of my siblings that is still living with them and I hate it. Thank god they're not here this weekend(they just left the house about 15 minutes ago) so I have some time to relax and not worry about them.

Just like you mentioned with your parents, mine get super snarky with me whenever I tell them about my issues. Like damn, I'm sorry that I'm trying to communicate my issues! And then they go and tell others that I'm the one not communicating with them smh. What's worse is that my stepmom is literally a nurse and my older sister literally just graduated college with a degree in psychology and is getting her master's right now. And what sucks is that they're not bad people- because I see how they treat my older sisters(minus my eldest sib but even they get treated better than me atp) and how they treat everyone else, but they're just awful towards me in particular. 

I truly can't wait til I actually have a job so I can save up my money and move out, get my cat from my mom's(my stepmom won't let me have her at their place even though my bedroom is big enough for 1 cat, it's a pretty large room), and cut them off as much as I can before completely going no-contact.",Witchy888,1aseuyf

She words it a lot better but basically, some organs just don’t work as well as others. Are any of your family members on medications for anything? Tell them to just get over it and see their reaction. 😅

Our brain is an organ that sometimes needs medicines. It’s a much more complex organ than others and I would definitely argue that science doesn’t fully understand it yet. We are learning so much every day! Just because there isn’t a brain scan to definitively say “YOU HAVE BPD AND NEED MEDICINE” doesn’t mean there isn’t a problem and you can’t benefit from taking a mood stabilizer (or whatever you are on).

3,"Ok so I discovered my own BPD diagnosis while getting my degree in behavioral biology and psychology. Low key the reason why I even chose that degree in the first place is because I wanted to be able to fix myself without having to go to a professional (I have a myriad of comorbidities including depression and anxiety). If I get the same education then I must be capable of doing all the same things a professional does right? Not exactly. I found that it really only made me extremely self-aware which can be a good thing but also extremely detrimental, especially for someone like me with self-esteem and anxiety issues. The exercises I tried to do that I learned about didn't really help me.

Bottom line although I think it's possible to improve on your own, it just would be much faster and a lot easier if you went through a professional and got therapy specifically tailored to your particular BPD. Without the 3 years I spent in therapy I would not be as stable as I am today. The problem is, when you're in a BPD episode, it's extremely difficult to maintain an objective, non-emotional perspective on what's happening to you. You need to either train yourself to pull yourself out of it or talk to someone that can. There is most definitely hope, I just think it'll be more work, and I want to keep it realistic as someone who has tried to fix everything on their own before turning to a professional as an adult. Definitely check out DBT and CBT books. Try to keep yourself aware of when you're in ""emotional"" brain vs when you're in ""logic"" brain. Isolate when your thoughts are a reasonable reaction to things or splitting. Once you're aware of this, work to accept them and work **through** them instead of pushing them away and splitting completely in the opposite direction. Acknowledge that your feelings are just thoughts, and at the end of the day you control your own thoughts. Remind yourself that although your reactions may be severe, your feelings are valid.

5,"So I wouldnt say I'm healed. But I am the most stable I've ever been. And most of that is due to my own hard work. I had an amazing therapist for a few months that helped me open my eyes to what I was actually struggling with. I had a hard time admitting that I was very emotional and had intense ups and downs for example. She ended up retiring and after that I got an awful therapist that literally said I would never get better, never get a job, never move out and that it was all in my head. 

I quit therapy after that, kind of impulsively got a job and moved out the house as soon as possible. And its the best thing I couldve done. Moving out of my old toxic household and being able to put up massive boundaries gave me space to work on myself. I still have massive mood swings, and sometimes I still turn to self harming behavior and the fear of abandonment is still very much there. But I can deal with a lot of it. And a big thing that has helped me, is acknowledging my feelings and allowing myself to feel them and recover from them.

My country is very Christian and anti-LGBT so I'm basically walking on a minefield. Looking for the right therapist gives me heavy anxiety because of that so until I get enough strength to do it, I'm trying to heal myself on my own.
I'm trying to watch out for my splitting and my episodes but NGL, it's difficult as hell. My FP is a very understanding person but she recently cut me off to focus on her own mental health - which I involuntarily took a big part in destroying.
Not gonna lie, this situation is really hard to get through, I split constantly and even experience panic attacks because I don't even know how she's doing or when (or *if*) she's going to come back.

The only thing I can do at the moment is keep on working on myself and healing myself. I'm going through the DBT book currently and I'm doing everything I can to avoid my triggers. I get my low moments often but I find that reassuring posts on this subreddit often help feeling better, even if just slightly. It helps more than hearing that stuff from people who's never had to deal with bpd - I know that we can all relate here so I think it's good that we can all give each other some reassurance and support.

There is certainly hope as long as you're willing to work on yourself. It's going to be a long and hard work. You will often feel like you can't do it anymore or that it's not working.

Sure, some people with BPD have a lot of partners but that’s not everyone.  They definitely should have asked far more open questions about symptoms and behaviors.  Something like “what does impulsive behavior look like to you?” Or “have you self harmed” or “explain to me how you view yourself and your place in the world”.  I’m sorry for your experience.

2,"hi there!!

first off, i want you to know how proud we are that you are reaching out. it takes a strong person to ask for help! let me give you a little bit of insight. 

splitting is a very hard thing to get over, for most of us. for example, i was on the phone with my girlfriend and i saw she was on her phone while we were facetiming, and i got paranoid and i thought she was talking to other guys. i started to split. i started to give her the cold shoulder. 

now one thing that you must know is splitting stems from a fear of rejection or abandonment. i split because i felt like whoever she was talking to (she wasnt), could take her away from me and i felt defensive. but she explained to me she was texting her aunt. i felt horrible. i started to apologize frantically and i was scared she would leave me. its a very common thing. 

now, i know it puts alot of pressure onto you as his SO, so i have a suggestion:
Reassure him. Most people split because they would much rather be the one who distances themselves rather than someone else leaving. maybe keep a journal that you both write in and use your thoughts to help build communication!

i hope this helps! if you need any advice, dm me!",,pmuejc
3,"BPD can easily cause abusive behaviors, most mental disorders, especially cluster-B, are known to do this when they're not managed properly.

It sounds like you're aware your boyfriend behavior is harmful and not ok, but you are confident that A) you've got a handle on it and aren't being exposed to anything you can't handle or which might cause *you* long-term psychological harm B) that your boyfriend is also taking accountability for his behavior and committed to a path where this behavior should be improving.

It might be helpful to move away from the term ""abuse"" or ""abuser"", which is an emotionally loaded term with strong moral undertones (we conceptualize abusers as bad people who willfully cause harm, not sick people who unintentionally cause harm). Your sister might be hung up by the fact that you refusing to identify him as an abuser means you are in denial about what love is supposed to look like/the harm he's causing. And you seem to be aware of both those things, but are extremely hesitant to use a word like ""abuse"" becuase you don't feel like it's fair to demonize someone who from your perspective is on the right path and dong the right thing.

It might help to establish some ""if this happens, then I will step back from the situation"" boundaries - your sister might just need to hear you aren't some battered woman in denial who will stay up until the point she's beaten to death. No offense, but someone willing to get into a relationship with unmanaged and undiagnosed BPD probably has their own concerning history of past romantic or life choice that also might be making your sister feel like you have bad taste in men or make bad choices. When I'm sick, I don't usually find myself surrounded by well rounded, morally good, healthy people, ya know? It tends to be fellow sick people, predators, and chronic enablers. So your sister might just need to see what differentiates you from an enabler, by seeing that you do have a grasp of what is/isn't going on and what *you* expect to see from your boyfriend to be comfortable that he's taking meaningful strides to recovery. Because a lot of people, especially women, have a tendency to become martyrs in order to take of mentally ill partners, and like....you're not a doctor. That is *not* your job. So if your sister has a reason to suspect that's what you're doing, then she's right to be concerned.

Telling her it's not her business and you're an adult is exactly what battered women say, so I suspect you're getting defensive and shutting the convo down, which is just even more triggering her ""my sister is in denial and going to get herself hurt"" bat signal. Maybe talk about what boundaries and means of protection you're instituting, and what you're doing to maintain your own health.

(Like for instance, even just being the partner to someone who is on a recovery journal is itself a huge thing, so you should probably either be in therapy or some kind of guided support group, becuase stuff like this *can* turn sideways very quickly. Not cause your boyfriend is ""bad"", but because recovery is not linear and when people can backslide it can be swift and BRUTAL. And your sister will probably be very reassured to see that you aren't just blindly trusting your own gut but instead relying on a more formalized and professional degree of oversight. And again, dealing with the residual side effects of being around the mentally ill *absolutely* is serious enough on it's own that you probably *would* benefit a lot from your own therapy through this process, cause even if your boyfriend is an absolute all-star at recovery,it's still a pretty slow and arduous journey)",External_Trifle2373,pmuejc

19,"splitting =/= abusive inherently. splitting is the emotions *we* feel - its possible to deal with or express those emotions in ways that arent abusive. mean, maybe, sure - but that isnt all abuse is.

when i split, i get SUPER bitchy, moody, and pretty hostile. thats not good by any means - but its not necessarily abusive. and in my case (because ive had some therapy) i can usually manage to pry myself out of being 100% ready to maim whoever im splitting on and communicate as best i can; ""i am feeling unreasonably angry towards you right now and this is what triggered it"".

OP said her bf said ""i FEEL LIKE i hate you right now"" and said he needed space. he was splitting on her - and he told her he was splitting, and made sure to remove himself instead of getting involved and being upset at her. how is that abusive? thats the like, ideal way to resolve splitting in a romantic relationship. 

being mean, or cold, or bitchy, =/= abusive. it absolutely CAN escalate there. but plenty of people are mean to each other all the time and its.. not abuse. thats a really heavy word that means specific things. OP has said in other comments hes not controlling at all, hes very supportive, and overall a good partner - and he apologizes for his splitting and takes responsibility for it. nothing about this reads as abusive.

your comment here is doing nothing but furthering the already incredibly hard to shake stigma of BPD being inherently abusive. splitting is something most pwBPD experience. are you saying everyone with BPD is abusive?",hatchins,pmuejc
20,This is dangerous advice. When a woman stops telling her family about the abusive things her boyfriend does to protect him she has one foot in the grave. If you are worried about the way you'll be perceived by your SO's family there is probably something wrong with your behavior. And BPD is not an excuse.,LBinaamba,pmuejc
21,"splitting isn’t abuse, it’s unfortunately something a lot of people with BPD have. if he’s not abusive in any way, then this is just his BPD talking. one thing is if he doesn’t stay on meds or doesn’t want them, he will never get better.",bbgxth,pmuejc
22,"Yes! Exactly. I think that if he truly feels guilt and is actively working on the behavior and not using BPD as an excuse, then I wouldn’t call or abuse",ceej_aye,pmuejc
23,"That's abusive. Read ""Why does he do that"" by Lundy Bancroft. Leave him.

I have BPD. I split on my boyfriend. When I split on him I tell him that I'm not feeling well, and will be quiet for a while. Sometimes I cry and he has to say, ""It's ok."" Sometimes he has to bring me a tea. Sometimes, after I've recovered, we have to talk about what happened. Which always makes both of us feel better.

Being cold, picking a fight, refusing to sleep next to someone... none of that is a symptom of BPD or acceptable in a relationship. It's an early stage of emotional abuse. It will get worse if you stay.

Again, splitting is a symptom of BPD. But what you do when you split is an expression of your character. He is showing you that he is a mean person.",LBinaamba,pmuejc

25,"I disagree. It’s unhealthy in any relationship to tell your family and friends about private things.

i sometimes pick fights, i’m splitting right now next to him and i have so much anger and just want to be alone. i usually do the cold shoulder and just want space rather than speak to him….knowing i’ll get over it in an hour or so.

34,"> I didn’t tell OP to stop talking, just stop talking to people who have no issue stealing away their autonomy.

Well that just sounds like paranoia. Which, you know, is a symptom of BPD. 

If you are in a relationship with a mentally ill person, you have to keep the lines of communication open with your family about that. They have to know how you're doing, how your partner is doing and how they're treating you. 

That's not a betrayal of the partner. That's just a healthy thing to do.

I've been the mentally ill person who doesn't want anyone talking about them. It sucks to feel condescended to and managed. But it's not really avoidable, and the alternative (to have no one keeping tabs) is dangerous for you and your partner.",LBinaamba,pmuejc

i’m sure there’s people who don’t have it as bad, but for a lot bpd has no cure, and yes if your diagnosed you should be on meds, especially OPs bf.

therapy is by far the best treatment for bpd because.. its a personality disorder...? medication isnt a frontline treatment for it. you might take meds to cope with comorbid issues - depression and anxiety are common in us afterall - or if its very extreme, you may want to be on mood stabilizers.. but thats still a pretty strong medication with many possible side effects that will not be for everyone. hell, not even for *most* people.

psychiatric medication is not a cureall, and especially not for things like bpd that are the result of long-lasting and ongoing trauma and neglect. if they work for you thats great - but saying that if somebody is diagnosed w bpd they ""need"" to be medicated is really ignorant and harmful to say. people with bpd ""need"" whatever treatment works for them.",hatchins,pmuejc

if someone IS unwilling the get help or take meds when it’s needed then yes that’s intensively toxic and they will not get better .

also stop looking at meds as some awful negative thing. if i say most people with severe BPD need meds, then yes they need meds. Especially if they are unstable.

My thoughts are the same. I get just as paranoid about people judging me or my spouse hating me or whatever.

They don’t change who you are. If the dose is too high then yeah it can mute you but that’s not the goal and you can adjust your meds if you don’t like them.

I think they help. Like I said, I still get the emotional spirals and emptiness but because my overall mood is buffered a little I have more spoons to deal with the negatives of this disorder.
