0,ive been a drug addict for as long as ive had bpd. i stopped doing pills but i still smoke weed even though i shouldn't. drugs make me behave poorly and make my mental illness worse,i_hate_sex_666,1bru59s
1,"I'm a bit addicted to cocaine, which started in casual hook ups with people. I'm moving back home with my mum soon as I'm just getting more addicted and don't know how to stop it, I'm awaiting an ADHD assessment as well.
About 50% of the time i use it I end up with horrible anxiety, which feels absolutely awful. I've also ended up calling the samaritans (charity helpline who listen to calls in uk) after using as the anxiety has been so bad. It's a rabbit hole I really wish I hadn't gone down :(... but moving so I'm not living alone should really help",Upbeat-Comfortable43,1bru59s
2,"I don’t recommend hallucinogens based on your mental health symptoms.  They can be great for some people, but if you’re already prone to mania and paranoia, there’s a really high chance of having the worst 8 hours of your life.  I did it and it permanently fucked me up, leaving me with a lingering existential horror that I’ve mostly overcome but not completely.  Psychic trauma isn’t fun.",bloodyvisions,1bru59s
3,"I had an addiction to coke and ketamine for a while, but I'm back to being a weed smoking alcoholic 🫶 I tried everything I could possibly score, but coke and ket were always the main ones- and it really fucked up my life and mental health for a while. Do not recommend.",1ashleyr6,1bru59s
4,"I regularly do a variety of drugs, i test them, im careful with dosage, c, k ,m, L. No pot

I take supplements to help regulate my nutrition and happy chemicals, 


I have no other options at the moment. When im sober for too long i start ping ponging between killing myself or others. Easy access to healthcare would go a long way. Whatev. Street drugs it is 💃",_-whisper-_,1bru59s
5,"I only smoke weed but I’ve been trying to stop. If I’m really strict I can quit but it’s hard not to use it as a coping mechanism. My psychiatrist wants me to stop because they haven’t done long term studies of it combined with my meds (which I assume is accurate to most of those medications) 

I also find that smoking is a wild card for me. Sometimes it relaxes me and other times it makes me paranoid and more anxious. So I personally have been trying to quit. I didn’t smoke last night which I’m really proud of. Especially cause I usually causally smoke every night",MeanGreenMother1986,1bru59s
6,"i’ve always been curious about pushing the limits of my addictive personality traits. ive tried cigarettes and it never stuck. then towards the end of 2022 i started abusing valium (50mg a day) and alcohol and lost chunks of my memory. i ran out and never really felt the need to do more. 

the following summer, i started smoking a lot more weed and taking edibles. then i was offered cocaine. and the rest was history lol.",Swimming-Finance-927,1bru59s
7,"I smoke weed every so often. For me it makes my thoughts rather dull for a bit and it's just really soothing for me when life finally gets quiet for a bit. It doesn't always help to self-medicate IMO, when my really bad time hits I have a rule that I can't smoke 'cause damn it really can make it hard for me to regulate. Some days when it's at the cusp of changing though, it's okay, I can get ahead of it just before it hits and I feel everything slipping.


I'm allowed to use it when I feel good, it's not allowed when I'm not. I'm not always perfect at it, but it's become a nice way to have more control in my life.",NegativeBeing8287,1bru59s

14,"I used to do hallucinogens a bit more than I should’ve, and while it could be fun, a lot of the time it led to severe breakdowns and crazy lows. I now just smoke weed on occasion and drink even less, it seems to help keep me from numbing myself and/or having worse breakdowns",That3mo0verTh3re,1bru59s
15,"I’ve used marijuana since I was 17 (now 27). Virtually every day. Never had an issues besides the classic smoke too much for the social function you are going to lol I have had bouts with abusing adderall tho and I’m an alcoholic in recovery. Alcohol was my go to to ease any anger, anxious thoughts, nerves, etc, however it eventually became not as fun and just made me get mad/annoyed all the time at my wife. At the end of the day booze triggered a lot of my bpd symptoms that I was unaware of until getting diagnosed and medicated for bpd around 4 months ago. No issues with any other drugs than adderall and alcohol, though I have tried Molly, coke, acid, and I still do shroomies every once in a while",tyzaginger,1bru59s
16,I've been abusing pills for a while now.,BulkyAlternative9509,1bru59s
17,"I think of it like this: ecstasy = mania on purpose. LSD = psychosis on purpose. I’ve done both several times and had lovely experiences, but I’m also acutely aware I’m playing with fire. Although I personally have had mostly pleasant trips, I once did LSD with someone who had a psychotic break and became violent. So be very, very, very fucking careful. Even with weed tbh.

If you decide to try anyway: 
- only do it with someone you really trust (ideally someone who is more experienced or more sober). 
- Look up drug interactions if you’re taking any medications. 
- TEST ALL POWDERS AND PILLS FOR FENTANYL AND XYLAZINE
- Be aware that ecstasy will make you feel incredibly shitty and depressed the next day. 
- And have an emergency plan!!!! I cannot stress that enough. Decide in advance what to do if shit goes left (i.e., overdose, psychotic break, panic attack, suicidality, paranoia, etc). Make sure whoever you’re with knows the plan too.",rufeelingitmrkrabz,1bru59s
18,"honestly i’ve done it all. hallucinogens have done a lot of great things but have also had some not so great things. mdma, aka ecstasy, is my favorite by far in the right dosages! i generally have a higher tolerance for things though and i think that’s always helped me ease into these things. if you do plan to. take anything i highly suggest a plan in case things go worst case scenario. i’ve been out in city’s when i had real bad trips and i shouldn’t have been honestly. 

long story short. plan out for the best and the worst. they can be great in some cases and not so great in others. everyone is different so don’t base your doses or expectations off anyone else! be safe and have fun 🖤",Critical_Shirt4221,1bru59s
19,"As a certified ADHDer, cocaine doesn't really do anything for me/us. It certainly doesn't make me anxious, but it doesn't really make me euphoric either. Just calm and kinda awake like a big cup of coffee. I find it hard to see myself ever getting addicted to this drug because it's just an underwhelming experience overall.

Not a doctor, don't take this as medical advice, but a lot of ADHDers have similar experiences with it.",HoldingMoonlight,1bru59s
20,"I have the same issue. I'm trying to get off it, but not faring too well. It's feels like I've replaced one addiction for another. If you fancy support or a chat anytime, hit me up. I'm also in the UK.",Solid-Society-5940,1bru59s

22,"Agreed. I have very bad depression. I mean when I’m going through it, I‘m going through it. Last time I did shrooms, I did them alone. Bad choice. I was already fighting my depression the first time I did it with someone there. The first time I did it was really good. I had a friend there with me. We both have BPD actually lol. I didn’t know at the time though that either of Us had it but yeah it was fun. We both were chill artistic people and she was more of a hippy type than me but we shared that sentiment. So it was a deep and freeing experience. We danced all night and made art. 

Unfortunately during the second time I took shrooms, I was alone. I was forced to face my own subconscious all by myself. One of the main themes was fear of loneliness. Dying alone. Getting old and dying alone. Being a miserable old woman with nobody in her life. Though was more focused on not having friends. 

If I took shrooms again now alone, I’d be very depressed still. They say small amounts of shrooms taken during the day can help with depression. So I’d suggest a small amount rather than the larger amount just to get really high. Start small and see how that feels and then go from there maybe. I don’t even like smoking weed anymore. It just makes me face reality in this very dark and pessimistic way. I’m good lol y’all have fun tho.",Candi-Bo-Bandi,1bru59s
23,"Not just 8 hours, if you take hallucinogens when you're even passively suicidal, something like ego death could be lethal. They're magical things, but you absolutely have to be in a stable place for a while before you go there (and do so with someone experienced).",busigirl21,1bru59s

26,"If you get anxiety from smoking, I recommend only smoking indica vs sativa. I smoke occasionally (like once every couple months). Sativa gets my anxiety and paranoia going, where indica relaxes me...but makes me couch bound with munchies lol.",lsant1986,1bru59s

31,It’s hard to describe.  There’s an incredibly violent entity out there with a voice like broken glass being poured into a cement mixer who tells you horrific truths about the nature of existence and once you hear them they always kind of live in the corners of your mind.,bloodyvisions,1bru59s

2,"Music does release dopamine, and before recordable/replay-able music technology was invented in the last hundred or so years, the only way to listen was to have someone play a song for you or play one yourself. Now we have on demand thousands of songs to choose from which didn’t exist for the majority of human history",No-Turnover8128,16i111k
3,It’s the same for me. I write music too and I don’t even know where it comes from. It just comes out of my head. It’s like a language I can understand and speak intuitively. Some people just don’t feel the same. Some people don’t get chills from certain melodies. I find that sad. I don’t know what I’d do without music.,Peachntangy,16i111k
4,"music has been my lifeline my whole life. Ask my mother who knows all about Amy Lee because Evanescence single-handedly got me through the trauma that actually gave me BPD. 
I am either listening to music, singing music, humming, or dancing to music in my head. (I'm also autistic so that might contribute to that as well as having special interest bands.)
But I know exactly what that feeling is. It's almost like you're having a mystical experience. It's as addicting as drugs for me. I couldn't live without it.
It also helps me process my emotions. I feel like I'm really bad at intellectualizing my feelings instead of feeling them, so when I listen to music it allows me to internalize them and process them which is why I usually cry a lot when I listen to music.

My current special interest band I have been listening to non-stop is Lacuna Coil. I've loved them since I was in middle school and I'm going to their concert for the first time in October! (Yes I have been to an Evanescence concert) [also both of the lead singers are reasons that helped me realize I was gay] {sorry this is getting way out of topic but I just can't help the chaos}",danskmarais,16i111k
5,"My only guess is that we’re more sensitive and imprintable than the average person. That maybe combined with rapidly shifting, unstable emotions and a tendency to idealize things makes it so music has a enhanced effect",NoahDC8,16i111k
6,"Idk but music can make me feel utterly invincible or put me into a depression. I’ve had car rides where when I start out I’m pretty neutral (basically the empty feeling) as it were or maybe even in a good mood but if one “sad” song or even if a small part of a song is “sad” eg a chord change, a lyric etc comes on then when I get to my destination I can barely function. Don’t wanna’ talk to anyone, all my energy has gone, could possibly become suicidal and I just wanna’ go to bed in a dark room and this can go on for hours. 

Conversely I’ve been into store with my AirPods on for like 10 minutes and an upbeat song will come on my playlist and my thoughts get so grandiose because honestly I have to listen to music when I go in the store ‘cause I get too anxious otherwise but yeah the “happy” song comes on and it’s like I start making all these wild plans in my head of what I’m gonna’ do, how massive tasks seem so easy. 

Sometimes because I’m out and I’m at the stores that one “happy” song can make me go on a spending spree that I don’t want to do and know I can’t afford but the feelings are too much but then of course I take the music away and I’m back to being well, depressed then pretty much because it’s like being on a come down and it’s ducking awful especially if I’ve spent excessive amounts and then I have to go about trying to sell the stuff I’ve bought. 

If other people are playing music, especially loud music I get anxious because I KNOW it’s going to change my mood drastically but I’M not in control of it and it scares me. 

I use it to regulate my emotions, to desensitise, to give me an identity (I play some instruments). Anyway that’s my story about music.",1HeyMattJ,16i111k
7,I feel you on that. Whenever I listen to my music I feel like I'm going into like a fantasy battle.,RustyRose42069,16i111k
8,"No idea the science and I didn’t even know it was a BPD thing until I read your post. How does one come to know that we experience music differently or more intensely? I can totally see that being true tho don’t get me wrong. Music can be very intense for me, and it does sometimes hit like a drug. It can go both ways for me. A song can make me feel untouchable and over confident. Another song will make me break down and bawl my eyes out for an hour. I think that can happen to most people with a powerful enough song, but I do think it happens to me more often, more easily, and more intensely for sure. Makes sense since we are neurodivergent, are we think and feel things differently than neurotypical people.",Arbornaut,16i111k
9,"Music is the only thing that stimulates the whole brain at one time rather than just sections. Different frequencies effect different regions, but still, the whole brain at once. This is why sound therapy is so amazing. So, it could replicate drug like sensations because it’s activating similar areas releasing similar neurotransmitters like dopamine (the pleasure hormone).",FriendTop6736,16i111k

12,"I also have always been drawn to music since I was young. I love singing, I used to tell my parents I would rather sing to people than talk. If I don’t listen to music I can start drifting into a really depressed phase. A good song will give me chills every time.",shrekswife,16i111k
13,"I listen to music almost 24/7. It’s so good and I love singing and dancing along. It’s really been the only non-therapeutical or pharmaceutical thing that’s helped me immensely. Especially when I just shut my eyes and hear all the instruments, the vocals. Mmm so good!",Songoftheday42,16i111k
14,"Did my science fair project in highschool on the effects of different genres of music on the brains of folks in varying age groups. All ages love music, tempo is a uniting factor in how things make us feel, but genre is often a defining generational difference (all pretty common sense). I listen to music for at least half of my day, if not more, and only because I don’t wear headphones at home so I can “talk” back at my cats when they meow at me. 

I think part of it is how huge our emotional capacity is and how empathetic we can be, so we feel the words being sung more deeply. I think part of it for me is that music makes me feel specific emotions I have a hard time explaining, so I can use music to communicate. It always sucks when I show someone a song and they don’t care for it. :(",rosiesunfunhouse,16i111k
15,I don’t know the scientific reason behind it but I am absolutely the same way. It makes me feel so euphoric. That’s the best word I can use to describe it but it truly feels there’s no words good enough to describe the feeling. It’s bittersweet,EastMedium9408,16i111k

Kenner and colleagues [18] found that participants with BPD were emotionally overwhelmed by music and could identify this state as being connected to their BPD.'

We, the non borderline, are the drug. Don't get me wrong, we know you don't want to be around us because of love. We are a drug called emotional stability, and lean on our identity, and abuse it when you get bored. 

We need to distance ourselves and then leave  because the relationship is so skewed in your way. We recognise that after a while, we ain't a part of this ""relationship"" at all. We are simply objects, like a pill, to be swallowed up more and more until the bottle's empty. So yes, you do drain us. You make us feel horrible about ourselves for trying to save you from yourself. 

Don't believe me?

If I were to grant you a wish, at the snap of my fingers, you could leave borderline disorder forever. Your emotions were regulated, you had lots of friends, you hurt nobody, you felt whole. 

Would you leave you? 

That's why we need to leave. We can't be down their caretaking drug addict. 

There is no perfect drug waiting fir you that you won't build a tolerance to. He/she dies not exist. 

My only advice. The only chance you all stand is to accept therapy. Omitt yourself. You are drug addicts, and your flings and partners are your drug. 

You can't keep flattering yourself that you are irresistible. That's insane. Nobody is. Why would we leave an irresistible person? We grow tired of being around a drug addict who is becoming immune to the drug. We do not change at all. We can hurt you like a drug if you abuse us to much. With each new drug you choose, the potency is wearing down on you. 

Same thing I'd say to a drug addict. Omit yourself. 

If you don't, you will eventually lose any friends you have left you will live alone forever. 

You can not look to others for self validation , nor drugs, nor booze. You will become a bum. None will want to be around you at all. We are not drugs. You certainly are not.",Feeling_Page_6970,1cpnfz3

37,"I did start drinking and smoking cigarettes when I was 13, other substances since I was 15 on and off until now, 21. I did have blackouts regularly so I do count it as risky behavior, it was triggered by impulse when I was struggling. I still haven't had sex with anyone, I'm scared of intimacy. I'm not asexual but still have hard time being intimate.

However, my ""risky"" behavior revolved more around impulsiveness like binging and restricting, SH, pushing people away when they came close to me, changing hair color and style, lately buying on Ali, I turn music really loud when I need it, I don't sleep just to obsess over something and overall pushing myself to the limit.

I'd say I was prone to drinking because I've seen it since I was really young. I was already introduced it since I was like, 4 or 5 as far as I was told and from there on, it was constant. My parents never hid cigarettes nor tried to smoke outside or in other rooms so when I was 13 and highly stressed, I'd take it to cool down and got used to how calm they made me, I didn't think about the consequences like unavoidable addiction. If it's not as normalized in your environment and you didn't have too much contact with it, that could be the case to why you're not craving it. Or you simply don't want it, you could simply not be attracted to those things. I'm prone to addictions so it could play a big part (dad's side of family have all been alcoholics). 

All in all, it depends on many things and trust me, you're not broken. I think that you're on the right path if you ask me, there's nothing cool or positive about these stuff, it mostly brings misery into someone's life. You still have control over what you want and don't want so it's a pretty positive trait.

no actually I totally get it, I personally am hyper aware of any sort of consequences so I rarely ever loose control over my impulses, so I alcohol drugs and even sex has never been attractive to me because it all requires me to sort of give away part control of myself (and my body), and I really can’t do that probably because I need to be in full control over myself in day to day life to be able to function somewhat normally and push my emotions (mood swings) aside to fit in, I think this especially makes a lot of sense if you have any sort of anxiety problem (like me)

also, I was reading this self help book and I think they had it explained pretty nicely. They were like saying that bpd is in no way consistent about how it presents in terms of symptoms, but rather every symptom has it’s own severity (if it’s present) and if you like put all of it together you get like a unique ""picture"" that is like representative of ""your bpd"" they can be similar but they rarely ever are the same (in between patients obviously) and I thought this is kind of important since I personally often feel like I’m ""not actually that sick"" and then deny myself help because ""oh it’s not that bad,others have it worse"", and I am pretty sure I am not the only one with that, soo I kinda thought that is important :)",Smol_lil_Plant,12njjax

Even when I'm in recovery, it takes so much effort not to use for any great length of time. I've always drank or used drugs to shut my brain off, not to party. The whole reason I tried any of them was to get out of myself because it was just so unbearable existing. But I still wish I never had. I just don't want to feel this way. That's all I wanted, was to feel ok, and all drugs did for me was give me shorter and shorter breaks, until I needed them just to function. It's not worth it, and it never was.

7,"Bro, I've been doing coccaine for 2 years now and trust me, that shit makes everything worse. You won't be able to even drink a few beer without craving to somehow get 50 bucks to call your plug to pull up and to powder your nose. Alcohol is already a damn strong drug, dude and trust me, it's better than speed or coccaine. Psychadelics are a topic in itself... You wanna risk fucking your brains up even more? No? Then don't do that... I wish I stayed to weed and alcohol. The only positive experience I've made was XTC, but the thing is, you can't do it in the rate you'll want to do it once you've got the taste of it as a borderliner... It pumps out all the endorphines, all the 'I'm so happy"" hormones and it's a feeling of pure happiness and loving yourself and everybody around you. It's awesome, but combined w a lot of brain damage if you take it too often and well, if you don't care about the 6 months of break between each time, you'll exhaust your happy hormones, damage your brain and well, if you do it like I did it you'll end up being a zombie. I did xtc every second to third day and I was simply not able to feel anything good or any motivation except when I've been on it. It's far more brutal than being lazy on weed... It's a joke in comparison. I'm not *that* experienced w all that, but everybody I know and that I've met told me to stay away from all that crap. I saw a guy mix his coke with idek what melted it and injected that shit into his legs or feet, idk anymore because I already had a few gramms (50 bucks for roundabout 0.6-0.8g) stuffed inside my nose. It made me spend time w people that I'd puke seeing again. It made me do so many shitty things which made me unable to leave my bed for 3 days because of I was ashamed and felt my stomach tensing to the point I thought I'd puke. *Out of shame*... Harder stuff ain't worth it... 30 mins of good till it wears off and you fall into horrible depression. ""Coccaine depresion"" is even worse than normal depression... Just the skightest bit of music will piss you off, but you're feeling too low and without energy that you won't even be able to raise your voice about it... Weed and alcohol mixed up is more than enough, my friend. I'm an addict now, but the nights I've been on coke weren't much different from the nights on alc and weed. And you won't spend 200 bucks on a mediocre evening spending all your money tho the last few capsules don't even get you on it anymore... Just an disgusting feeling of being awake. And the urge having to lay another line. And another. Every 5 minutes at that point. Basically spending 40-60 bucks in less than an hour on a feeling that feels like shit. Oh- You don't even have to be an addict to experience this lol. It's basically part of the *awesome* experience.",Young3ro,q0u0eg

10,"I am always high. Kind of ironic because I'm on a break right now but not really by choice. At my worst, or possibly my best, I had distillate which is about as pure as THC gets if you're not using diamonds.

I would take several drops before bed just to make sure I didn't wake up sober. I take shrooms when I can get a hold of them. On the same boat of trying my hardest not to get involved with coke, benzos, or Molly because they would get ne addicted, fuck up my life, or leave me unable to live without respectively.

Sobriety doesn't sit well with me. I can remember everything and while I can't differentiate what I'm feeling, I can tell it's too much. It's a lot easier to be numb and I'm less irritating to be around on top of it.

That and I'm almost always dissociated. After driving and suddenly no longer being in control of my body, I decided it might just be easier to get high and start dissociated instead of getting ambushed by it on the highway.",skepticorange,q0u0eg

14,"BPD and ADHD (as it’s been explained to me before) create habits and thoughts that reflect that behavior you’re talking about, OP. Ever heard of having an addictive personality? It’s almost like an all or nothing mentality where you either do no drugs, in complete sobriety, or you do all of the drugs (you want) all the time. There’s no in between. When your brain doesn’t know how to find restraint, it won’t. At least not on its own. 

With BPD and ADHD (with which I have also been diagnosed) the thought process to find a reasonable middle isn’t there or doesn’t function in a stable manner (duh). 

I also smoke weed nearly everyday. Have been for last 9 years, taking 1-2 week breaks here and there. Drinking has also been a problem. Even over consuming caffeine and nicotine has been a problem for me for years. My god even sex (and masturbation) is addictive. Currently I’m challenging myself to SOBER OCTOBER and so far it’s difficult (only been 4 days lol). 

If you’re not already seeing a therapist or taking meds you may want to consider both or at least therapy. If you’re in therapy talk to them about these concerns.

Honestly I’m so picky about taste and smell that alcohol has no real hold and I’ve not tried weed because my dissociation is super bad at times already and I don’t want that to trigger long or worse episodes. I overdosed on my anti anxiety medicine once, because I just needed the overwhelming emotions and emptiness to stop.

37,"Yes. I stayed away from hard stuff cause I knew I'd get addicted fast. I never loved alcohol but I got very addicted to it just to numb the feelings. Of course that just ended up causing more problems. More bad feelings. More bad experiences, relationships, money issues. Everything really. At my worst i was drinking a pint or more of vodka daily, I drank at least every few hours. I couldn't sleep through the night without waking up for a swig. Because of that my stomach was constantly hurting, maybe less if i was drunk enough to numb it. But i had a hard time keeping food down and often skipped eating all day. 

My advice is to talk to a psychiatrist about getting on/switching meds. For me the meds started helping a bit even while I was still drinking (which youre not supposed to do) and when I finally stopped, they've been working pretty decent. With those, AA and therapy I've stayed sober over a year now and most, not all but most days my emotions are manageable enough that I don't have an urge to numb them. 

I go thru phases of resting a lot, exercising more, getting into hobbies, eating lots of cheese lol trying to stay busy. Replacement behaviors to process emotions a way other than numbing with dr00gz. 

Oh and I got really into prostitution/escort/porn for like the first 8 months of my sobriety lol we all have a different path but a better life is possible. Theres definitely comorbidity with bpd and addiction but we can do it too

Anyway last couple of weeks I’ve been hitting the coke a fair bit and it makes me feel so much better, like how I think a lot of normal people feel. Not the euphoria that everyone explains, and I am doing small amounts. I know it’s not sustainable but the fact I know I can feel like that has been helpful but it’s a double edged sword because I know the quick solution is to take cocaine and it’s much less hard work than therapy etc. 

I dunno if I would say I crave it at the moment but It won’t be long before I get there anyway.

I don’t want this to be an advocate for doing anything like this for anyone else but I want to be honest. I’m fully aware this isn’t a long term solution, or any solution in fact, to my problems.",MOAJT,q0u0eg

78,"I did for about 10 years (weed). Daily, graduating to chronically for the last 6 (at my peak, I was blazing 12-15 ~.25gram joints a day). I've had to stop recently because the beneficial effects have basically disappeared.

Before, the cannabis would simply numb the emotions' intensity so that I could somewhat function and sort through them.

Now the emotions have become like a swirling ephemeral mass that I find myself in the deepest part of, drowning and sinking with each additional toke. It fucking sucks. It feels like trying to tread water in space.

My take on it is that weed is very helpful for self-medicating purposes. But it's important to recognize when you're self medicating and try to adopt a more sober regimen at some point. But life's fucking rough. So I'm also of the opinion that you shouldn't beat yourself up for having a habit when said habit brings benefits (in the short term).

I've quit now. And I'm slowly starting to feel my feelings become solid again. But instead of feeling the sharpness and heaviness. I imagine the emotions are soil. Upon which my soul can grow. Cuz otherwise, my foundation is constantly shifting. Like trying to grow tree on top of liquid/gasious dirt.",sztwip,q0u0eg

Maybe to focus on something other than racing BPD thoughts.

Looking back I wish I never started drinking w like 15-16, because all they give is a very small window of happiness, followed up by feeling gross and the overall craving that'll develope. You'll end up developing healthy habits like me! Who gets drunk, high or calls my coke plug whenever I'm feeling down and I literally can't do anything against it, because my whole world feels like it's falling apart and only doing drugs will make me feel different. Sometimes so that I can face my problems, sometimes so I don't have. But all in all I'm just running away from my problems by using them... And well, everyday life will feel way too boring so you'll do drugs out of boredom as well because this world appears to be dull and hollow, while that's just the projection of your own mind onto the world... I suppose you're in therapy? Best way is to stay in therapy, work on yourself and just... Finding things that bring you joy. At best one sports you really like. I did boxing for 2 years and it was an incredibly happy time... God, it's been 2 years since back then lol Oh and one last tip, if you don't mind 😅 Don't focus too much on love. You're probably still young, as I am, but I wasted so much time being unhappy about love that I desperately wish I could take back... You've got plenty of time!

I will agree with you on the hallucinations and paranoia though. They've gotten significantly worse over the past two years and the more I smoke the more worried I get that it might be permanent.

But like you said, beats being sober for the time being 🤷🏾‍♀️ I don't really know how to use in moderation",skepticorange,q0u0eg
128,"Yeah the cravings are beyond horrible. Your body is actually sick and you basically live to get high, nothing else matters. So many times I'd be up at like 5am just absolutely needing it, physically and mentally sick waiting for it to be time for the dealers to hit the streets. When you're that deep in it it's barely fun anymore, you just do it because you have to. You still love the feeling but you also hate it because you know you're trapped by it. It owns you. Getting clean seems downright impossible. 

Then even when you've been clean for years, you still remember how it made you feel, and wish you could do it when things in life are rough.

It makes you feel so good you can feel cheated with normal life. Ecstasy really hit me hard with that too. Like for the rest of my life I know there's a whole other level of happiness and pleasure I can't obtain from life. If I never experienced that (in excess), I think I'd be able to enjoy simple things more that other people do. But it's not enough for me.

Talk to your doctor too about your meds, and if you’re not comfortable with that doc, go to another (if you can). Take your time becoming comfortable expressing your concerns openly to your health care provider. Same goes for your therapist.

When I'm sober I have no desire to do other drugs but when I'm constantly stoned it's like ""fuck it, let's smoke meth with these crackheads who will inevitably screw me over and steal from me."" I'm a completely different person when I'm constantly stoned, not really caring about anything. My sober self despises the stoner version of me. 

I know I'm never going to change my life for the better when I'm on it, but I don't know how to prevent myself from relapsing like all the times before this. I need to go back to therapy.

16,"This is amazing I’m so happy for you and thank you for sharing your inspirational story ! I came in here for support tonight and this is the first thread I opened . My first comment too . I have been recently diagnosed with BPD . I’ve had plenty of time to think of how things went wrong so fast in my years I’m 44. My life is starting to make sense . I have always smoked pot and gosh I regret after a month of not smoking I’m back at it . There is a lot of inspiration here —I’d like to know how you quit marijuana I’ve known it’s been an issue for longer than I like to admit to myself - any tips on quitting weed ? I should of done this many years ago . 
Congrats again !",,lcb99s

22,"There's always time to rebuild my friend. I've had to do it many times, I've been through so many different friendship circles. Six months ago I lost my girlfriend and pretty much all of my friends through what was my worst mental health crisis ever. But what I've learned is I need to truly focus on myself and get my self esteem, self worth, self respect, happiness, and basically life in check so I can be happy within myself which then naturally brings good friendships that are meaningful and go both ways. Don't give up, persistence pays off, you've got this!",DepressedArtist31,lcb99s

You can do this! Happy to chat if you like",DepressedArtist31,lcb99s
25,"Honestly the withdrawals can be terrible. You have a lot to maintain in your life. If you’re serious about quitting I’d talk to your doctor so they can give you something for the withdrawals. The first two weeks I could barely function. If I had something for anxiety and sleep it would have probably helped so much. Not trying to scare you or discourage you, but people really underestimate the power of cannabis dependency.",amanda-panda007,lcb99s
26,"If you feel it's a problem or you can't limit yourself on it, then looking at cutting down a bit is a good start, better than cold turkey considering your responsibilities. I absolutely hit rock bottom so I was desperate for change. I had already done work mentally on knowing I needed to quit so I felt like those two things made it easier for me. Especially considering I had no responsibility, no job, nothing. So I could do other things to keep myself busy. It's really tough though, I feel like I was ready to quit and me hitting rock bottom just fast tracked that.",DepressedArtist31,lcb99s
27,"I feel like it’s okay to smoke a small amount at night if it’s just for sleep. And if it’s helping, that’s even better. If it’s not causing you harm, I don’t think you really need to stop. There are a lot of medical benefits to using it in moderation as you are. 
But regardless, I hope you can quit if that’s what you decide to do! It is definitely a hard thing to stop doing. Good luck!",_unsolicited-advice_,lcb99s
28,"Good on you for reflecting and putting the work in as to why you smoke and in what situations, and what it actually does to you. That's a huge first step! And you said yourself, you need to go back to therapy, that's a massive thing to admit to yourself. I wish you nothing but the best going forward. Follow your gut because you seem to know what you need to do, I'm sending all the strength I can to you, good luck :)",DepressedArtist31,lcb99s

31,"Yeah especially since the BPD diagnosis I now see how much marijuana negatively affected my BPD, my emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and so much more. I was kidding myself for so long because I felt like ""nah, I have a joint and I'm calm as fuck, it actually helps me"". If only I knew.

Education is definitely key, knowing how it affects you and what you're like on it compared to not being on it. It's great that you got to the 10 month mark! I'm confident you'll get there again and even beyond that! Sending you strength friend :)",DepressedArtist31,lcb99s

42,"I know friends with BPD who still smoke and they say it helps them. I can't speak for them or you or anyone else, but in my experience it actually worsened my symptoms and triggers, it was absolutely detrimental to my health.

But I knew deep down that I had to do it for myself, I wanted to quit for so long. As soon as I had that first day free from it I used that day to build my strength up. It takes baby steps, one day at a time, hell sometimes one hour at a time. It's hard work but it IS possible. I used helplines as well to talk things out, that was a great support for me.",DepressedArtist31,lcb99s

48,"The first couple of weeks I would sweat so much overnight, sweating all the toxins out. I had some pretty vivid nightmares too. But the way I saw it, I could have these symptoms for a little bit, and then have a fantastic life ahead of me, or I could keep smoking and just prolong the inevitable. Withdrawal symptoms suck, and you might need to go through trying to quit a few times before it sticks. But don't quit on trying to quit. You will get there when the time is right and everything aligns for you :)",DepressedArtist31,lcb99s
49,Yes! This is why I'm so scared to stop! Especially after 25 yrs of smoking it! I think I'd need to do it on a holiday period from work and get my ex to take the kids so I can sweat it out! I really appreciate you sharing your experiences and I will ask the doc for valium when the time is right! Blessings and all the best ❤️🙏,pe4cefr0g,lcb99s
50,"I believe some people it works good for, as long as like you said, it's in moderation. For me I could never do it in moderation. I just always wanted more more more. And that's why it became so unhealthy for me in so many ways",DepressedArtist31,lcb99s
51,"Another valid point and much appreciated! To be fair, my mental health nurse has no issue with me having a couple of Js and said if it helps me then do it! But I would like to experience life without it or at least be able to choose when I smoke it rather than me being too scared not to smoke it!  I did nearly do it last year... I got to 1 am without smoking a j then got scared cos I was wide awake and my brain was freaking out so I smoked one... I didn't try that again haha 🙄 Blessings and all the best ❤️🙏",pe4cefr0g,lcb99s

53,Super smash bros has been a good distraction lol. But thank you brother!,Taternuts94,lcb99s
54,I know quitting won’t be easy as it never is but I always feel better but then get back into it - years if this - any advice on how you set your mind to quit and rebuild - I’m in the process and wish I had read this six months ago I’m grateful I did now thank you again,,lcb99s
55,This 👏,,lcb99s
56,Step one is thinking about it. I thought about it for so long and couldn't bring myself to do it. But I'm positive that if I stopped thinking about it or just gave up on trying then I wouldn't have ever got to where I am today,DepressedArtist31,lcb99s
57,"Yes this is exactly the same experience I have heard from many! I really appreciate your insight and advice! I suppose I can't actually remember what it's like not to smoke it... I have no idea if I'd be better off it if you know what I mean.  For me, that couple of wee joints at night literally gets rid of my BPD haha... Its like the chaotic brain and stress of daily BPD just disappears and I know that's why I'm so scared of stopping it! I am sure I will wake up one day and know that's the day I'm going to stop! I did that with alcohol... Just gave it up overnight! Blessings and all the best ❤️",pe4cefr0g,lcb99s
58,"Sounds like a good game plan. I would also recommend investing in a treadmill or an exercise bike/ elliptical. When the anxiety / bouts of anger hit, that was the one thing that helped them to dissipate quickly (for me) plus it helps the sweating part obviously lol! Cause it’s really just energy that you’ve been suppressing that needs an outlet. Good luck!",amanda-panda007,lcb99s

60,"Any distraction is a good distraction if it means staying clean especially in the early stages. Video games are a good distraction for me too! I thought for ages that distractions are just a way to waste time and not do anything meaningful. And then I'd be even more self critical of myself which would then just send me further downhill. But it's all about perspective, and moderation. If you're doing something you enjoy or that makes you happy, then who cares what the distraction is? :)",DepressedArtist31,lcb99s
61,"Sometimes you have to go back to basics. Reassess your values, your motivations, your reasons to live, what you're passionate about, what works for you and your plans or goals and what doesn't work for you or your goals. I did a lot of groundwork with this over a lengthy period of time. I believe that all helped massively in being ok with quitting and sticking to it, while also finding other coping mechanisms and hobbies or distractions to fill in the down time. Hope this helps somewhat :)",DepressedArtist31,lcb99s
62,"Thanks guys. There's always gotta be one, haha",DepressedArtist31,lcb99s
63,Thank you for your reply...I already have a treadmill and use it regularly... Maybe a punchbag would be a good addition haha!  I have all the tools apart from time... But I will work on that! I have cut down my intake already... Baby steps to the first night without it 😱 I will get there.... thanks again and all the best ❤️,pe4cefr0g,lcb99s
64,"That’s how I see it. As long as my son is taken care of, who cares if I wanna “waste my life” playing videos games? I still take care of my responsibilities, I just love me some social escapism once I get home!",Taternuts94,lcb99s

0,"Weed helps me personally but it reacts differently with each person, if you're gonna try that, I'd maybe recommend getting medicinal marijuana or oil, you can buy dry herb vaporizers which is how it was prescribed to me. They usually work to find a strain that would help you and your symptoms.",inverteddingdong,18d6ot8
1,Blanket statement for drugs first of all. Not everyone with BPD is gonna fall into the throes of addiction. people without any mental health conditions develop substance abuse. I view drugs as a very neutral thing. Humans have been taking mood altering substances since forever. 100% pro harm-reduction. I love taking drugs it’s not a terrible thing to say. They do not control my life (well minus nicotine),girlidc18,18d6ot8
2,"Substance use and substance dependency/abuse are really different. If you’re doing it in moderation, or rather to the point where it is not going to affect your physical health, I feel it should not have a negative connotation. 

The frequency that would not cause ill affects on physical and mental health is far less than most people actually think and do.",sucrepunch,18d6ot8
3,"Short answer: yeah sometimes 

Long answer: not a good idea if you are prone to addiction as a person, as most people with BPD are, for reasons I hope I do not have to explain",CoercedCoexistence22,18d6ot8
4,[deleted],,18d6ot8
5,"Disclaimer- I also have bipolar 1 and no history of addiction. For me personally, yes, drugs can be very positive. However, I have learned to discern time, place, what drug, how much, and at what pace. I only do drugs when they will enhance my experience, not just because it's there. Example: Sometimes I'm in a depression phase and really want to go out to the club with my partner because I know getting out and socializing and dancing will be good for me. But I'm so exhausted (despite sleeping almost constantly) and socially anxious that it feels impossible, and if I can force myself to go I'll be miserable, look miserable, and bring the mood down. So some coke, speed, or even ritalin (I don't have ADHD) can really help give me energy and lift my mood.",spicypotatosoftacos,18d6ot8
6,"i went through a breakup last year before xmas and wanted to change they way my brain works because i HATED myself, i was isolated for the longest time before but i did an experiment this year and used multiple things, my drug of choice was amphetamines, they made me focused, motivated, confident, made me open up a little and took risks, found out i have a passion for tattooing, moved out from a toxic household, travelled and went to parties! but i HATE THE DRUG!!! it's horrible if u dont know how to control yourself and keep redosing. i took 1 line in the morning so i could get stuff done and didnt do it everyday, i took breaks from time to time.",samzzlolz,18d6ot8

10,"All obvious warnings aside. Weed I think is the common denominator here, definitely my #1.
MDMA did some amazing shit to me and really helped me process and communicate a lot of things with my partner that I would have not been able to in my BPD rage/ anger (both cheated and was super rocky, went to music festival together and worked out a lot of bullshit) We’re married now and it’s so incredibly healthy and didn’t know it could be like this. I can be myself with her more than anyone else and I was terrified to even try being myself bc I suck and don’t deserve love in my bpd narrative.
I LOVE mdma, like wow just wow. I get to feel sooo happy and good and let all the masks come off. I only take it a few times a year and take it responsibly (don’t abuse it, treat it as therapy/ healing). Also your partner and friends all tell you how much they love you, everyone is super nice, it feels like you’re 5 again but in an adult body. Plus the best warm fuzziness and just euphoria for a good 6 hours 🥰

14,"I was smoking sativa for a long time until I was moved onto indica strains, and immediately noticed the benefits. Having a professional analyse you, your blood work in the aim to sooth you is dope, worth a shot.",inverteddingdong,18d6ot8
15,"You might be smoking the wrong strain then :) for me, sativa makes me suicidal, lash out, angry, emotionally unstable, etc. but when I smoke Indica I feel super happy, energized, calm, less anxious, and I use it as a coping skill when I am in episodes. I immediately just start smoking if I am breaking down and I calm down within 20 minutes. My episodes range from 2 hours to an entire day. So 20 minutes and then just calm crying and breathing is a lot better than ripping my hair out haha yk? 

I’d definitely recommend smoking Indica first, then try sativa and see if your results are the same or different.",Slight_Ad2086,18d6ot8
16,"Yup exactly! I was on them for a few months, then everything got waaaay worse and scared the shit out of me. The first time I tried MDMA was a good 13 years after kicking any of those meds.

Their only concern was that nobody attempt to bring substances to the hospital with them, use substances while at the hospital during treatment times, or show up for the day visibly under the influence. Those types of behaviors would result in discharge from the program, at least in my case.",JackalFlash,1c8do98
1,"If they require you to stay sober for the duration, even if you don’t have an issue, I encourage you to try to do it. The one I went to would do random tests if it was a concern or safety issue for a patient. Otherwise, they saw it as you’re only hurting yourself treatment. If you aren’t ready for treatment, they’d just rather you come when you are ready and allow someone who is ready to have your spot. 

The reason I encourage you to stay sober is because I don’t have a problem with weed but smoked for the past 25 years very regularly. During that few weeks of not smoking, I found myself clear headed for the first time in… well, ever. I’ve been out for a couple of weeks and have decided to not smoke. It’s actually incredible the difference it has made; but if I didn’t try, I would’ve never known. My partner is shocked I actually stuck with it and also sees vast improvement.

1,"I was addicted for just over a year to black market THC (definitely more than just THC in that shit). I was using it to cope with a month long situationship that went sour, and I regret it so much. My psychiatrist told me the whole time that what I was doing was only going to create more problems. Here I am now, exactly 120 days sober, on antipsychotics that make me feel like shit, having gone through a pretty bad religious psychosis, contracting HPPD, and my BPD symptoms are 12x worse than when they started. Drugs never made anything better, I was just trading one set of problems for another, and now I’ve got both sets. I’m so glad I got sober, even though the withdrawal sucked for the first two months and me and my mind are still learning to live without substances once again.

Having BPD, we carry the heaviest sense of emptiness with us wherever we go, and a lot of the times we make it our life goal to fill that emptiness rather than getting to the source of it. Addiction, favorite persons, and rapid shifts in identity are all attempts of filling that hole. Rather than slapping bandaids on the issue, it’s our ultimate goal to delve into the depths of that dark hole within us. In my experience at least, that hole is left by a damaged, stunted inner child doing everything it can to feel alright, because that child was never taught to love and take care of itself, to be its own support. Getting sober is hard, but the journey of sobriety is grounds for a lot of very important work that can be done. Don’t run away from those feelings. Take a step back, listen to yourself, take note of what you’re feeling and why you’re feeling this way, and if you have to, just sit with it. Don’t embody your feelings, but observe them.

The best of luck to you, friend 💚💚",shitassmoneyman,1cmovf1

0,"I think a lot of us will relate with this, drugs make things feel ""better"" and then our usage becomes more and more frequent until it becomes the addiction. I've definitely dealt with the cravings when there were drugs I've only done once, but something that helped me lower my weed consumption was cutting it with natural herbs like mugwort. I'm not super knowledgeable on that but after about a week of it I noticed I've been feeling less like a zombie. I don't know what you specifically struggle with, but something that helped me a lot is weaning off instead of cold turkey, and also trying to purposefully be sober (like in the way people try to be drunk). I basically give myself time limits until I'm ""allowed"" to smoke or drink, and it forces me to distract myself with other things. You're not alone, and no matter how helpless it may feel, just know that as long as you're doing the best you can for you, that's good enough 🩷",femmesbian,1b8eb3v

But now you've added a whole more laundary list of problems, regreats and everything else that is stopping you from getting healthy in the correct ways to your list, making it harder and harder to do it. And that's if you make it through the whole ordeal. 

Find me an obituary where they say oh he died such a happy drug user, he showed everyone that using drugs, alochol whatever was the way to overacheieve, to overcome everything that held him down, to beat his mental demons. I don't think you will find that.

You'll find obituarties of people who died too early and never overcame what they used drugs for.

And you'll find people who died happy, successful, maybe they did use drugs along the way, but they had to once again go and kick that habit and go backwards to eventually go forwards.

The feeling in my case has never gone away and it’s still a very real fear of mine, but talking yourself down is all that can be done.

He’d show up like an hour later but I already felt so forgotten and alone. Then when I got older, I could have basically run away and nobody would have noticed for a while. My parents had zero contact (they’re divorced), so if I was supposed to be at one house, the other would never confirm I actually made it there. My parents were very hands-off, and I actually think that made it worse for me, because I felt like I only had myself to look after my well-being, and nobody else cared.

Any stimulants seem to lower my inhibition and make my rage very chaotic and excessive. I am more easily annoyed and angered, besides slowly killing myself with the substance too. 
I used to be able to smoke weed occasionally but I absolutely cannot now. Weed makes me so very paranoid about the people I am around. Even if they are close friends or lovers I start to wonder if they know me, do I even know them? And have a desire to flee immediately. 
Drinking occasionally is alright, but if I actually get drunk I get very sad/emotional. 
Truly, I don't need altering substances and it's now MY choice to stay away from them. I made the mistake of falling into addiction knowing my family history of it full well. I wasted years, money, threw away relationships. It wasn't worth it. I thought I could just dabble in substances and ""try them"", I couldn't. The physiological changes that the drugs produce in the brain cannot be ""over-willpowered"". 
Be so careful, the world has a dark underside to it all around us just under the surface.",SlinkySlonker,unffm6
2,"I was in a group therapy thing where they taught us about risk factors for different illnesses, and specifically risk factors for psychosis. Most recreational drugs and alcohol are very high risk especially if you already are predisposed to suffer from psychosis. Even not eating or sleeping properly make you more at risk, so if you are already in a psychosis prevention program i would not risk it at all. It’s not a good idea, i know some people claim it works for them but there is always a risk that something could feel good for years and then suddenly Bam psychosis. I know a guy who stopped doing drugs and then a year later suffered from a drug induced psychosis that was triggered when he started working out and burning the fat that had old drug residue(?) stored in it. I’m not sure how accurate or scientific that description is but basically he wasn’t doing drugs anymore but suffered from a drug induced psychosis a year later.",bubhoney,unffm6
3,Just don’t. Especially if u suffer from voices or paranoia it’s not worth it,NasyasaidNo,unffm6
4,"I'm a derelict drug addict that also happens to have severe BPD comorbid with severe MDD.

The best thing for psychosis prevention is to take your meds and not abuse substances. If you won't follow that advice and you fear being psychotic, avoid psychedelics (LSD and acid analogues, shrooms), any kind of stimulants (meth, cocaine, ritalin, adderal, modafinil), any dissociative (ketamine, DXM) and maybe high doses of weed/THC (THC/weed edibles).

Alcohol is a gray area, depends on how much you drink. Opioids, benzos and downers in general are usually fine regarding psychosis. Also take into consideration some drugs (like psychedelics) won't work at all if you're taking psychiatric meds. 

I've taken insane doses of acid just because it wasn't working at all and nothing ever happened, I still had months and months of constantly taking my psychiatric meds (mostly anti-depressants and anti-psychotics). Psychedelics can cause a psychotic break that will leave you in a hospital, it happened to me and I thought I was immune, it can also happen to you.",BerryCherryKoolAid,unffm6

Ultimately it's about ""do you want to be happy or do you want to be right?"" you seem smart so being right must rank super high up there. But this is similar to asking yourself if you have free will... the less you know the happier you'll be. 

And i know it's frustrating. How much you want to right the wrong in the world. But one person? Check what happened in all social movements in the last 30 years. It's not good news. I don't want to stop you fighting for your ethics, but at the same time others seem to be able to get into a social fight without letting that fight exhaust them to suicide levels. Think about it.

2,"I occasionally use drugs with friends. MDMA, and cocaine every once in a while when I’m at a show or partying.

I love alcohol. For me it makes me happy, eases my anxiety, and relaxes me. I’ve been a heavy drinker in my life but never to the point of it interfering with my work or school, I have noticed when I drink that the next day my anxiety will be bad or I’ll be in a bitchy mood.
For this reason I try to limit my drinking and save it only for the weekends or a special occasion.

I use to have a problem with Xanax. I was never taking it in large quantities like some people do to party, but I was taking it daily, multiple times a day, and sometimes would abuse it to just feel high. 
There’s nothing better in the world than Xanax, but holy shit it is super addictive and will really mess with your head. 
I now keep a restricted amount of Xanax that I get prescribed by my doctor Incase of a panic attack or feeling too overwhelmed...it’s hard but I really try not to take it unless I actually need it. My goal is to be completely off of it one day.

Besides that I’ve never really struggled with drugs. I don’t even like week tbh...I find it kinda boring and I usually get paranoid/anxious.

I’ve found the best way for me at least to stay clean from alcohol and Xanax is to through myself into the gym, SELF-CARE, and staying away/cutting off people who encourage drinking binges or drug use.

5,"I think substance use is actually a symptom of BPD? I've read in a few different places that they can be quite connected do to common impulsive behavior in us BPD folk, so I'm sure you'll hear about lots of BPD people and substance use. I am one of those people and identify as an addict as well.

I'd like to say I USED drugs, but it seems like I still do. I've used recently and smoke marijuana daily. I'll go over my drug history and different substances and how I feel about them.

My addictions started young like most with alcohol. I was a heavy drinker from the age of 17 until now. I'm 26. I still struggle to quit drinking and didn't realize I had a problem until about 2 years ago when it starting leading to bad behavior in my relationship ( as well as drug use that started about 4 years ago). The club kid life style and impulsive nature of partying with BPD lead me to try MDMA. It felt amazing and the high was incredible. The lows were unbearable. Eventually I was lead to Cocaine; something I didn't do often, but I have started using more and more and still am struggling to kick it at this time with alcohol. Over that time I tried Speed, meth, and ecstasy. Thank goodness I didn't. I've also used magic mushrooms, but as any ""psychonaut"" might tell you, the experience felt more beneficial compared to the other drugs. 

I feel like I'm struggling to condense all the experiences, so please feel free to ask me ANYTHING. There's no question too far with me. If you want to know what the highs and lows feel like, feel free to ask. As someone who's tried a lot, I can tell you the other drug that's ever felt ""worth it"" to me was Mushrooms and weed.  


Right now I smoke weed everyday to cut back cravings for other drugs and resist the urge to go out and do more dangerous things. I know addictions is addictions, and I the weed should just be a band-aid, but seriously can't quit the others without supplementing it at this time.

I've been clean (except weed) for 2 weeks. AMA!",,97slns

Sometimes I go a few days without a smoke because I’ve run out and I’m okay but I definitely miss it. For me I use it to relax at night and escape, I’m a terrible sleeper and it often helps me at least relax enough to get a few hours. Weed is still illegal in the UK so it’s a hard one for me, I’m currently seeing a therapist and I don’t know whether I should tell her. If she reacts negatively or judgementally I’ll lose therapy I’ve waited a year for. The weed also causes me to binge terribly which I find hard. Having the escape during the evening is such a relief though and I think there’s worse things that I could do. I could easily justify it by saying I’m taking it for medicinal reasons like I take my anti depressants to even me out a bit but it’s a hard one! ",awittyusernamexample,97slns

15,"I've done a lot of experimentations in my day: cannabis, LSD, mescaline, psylocybin, cocaine, crack, dextromethorphan, alcohol, tobacco, and so on. I've even split a sheet of acid (yes, a sheet, 100 hits) between my BFF at the time and his mom. I was a psychedelic trooper, for sure. 

The only thing that I truly enjoyed was cannabis, I almost feel like I've had a pre-dispositon to it since a very young age. Its also the only thing that I still use regularly (although I have been totally clean since Sunday, more on that later). 

Both of my parents were alcoholics, so I grew up under serious neglect and basically raising myself. I'm also starting to expose some sexual abuse as well. It wasn't until I had to cut my alcoholic mother out of my life that I knew there was a problem. At that point, I quit drinking as well. 

I feel that cannabis has seriously helped me in many areas of my life, including suspected absence seizures, no appetite/constant nausea, and my BPD in general. My BPD symptoms began to diminish at 16 when I started smoking cannabis and have been 100% gone until just this very year (I'm 41 now). It has made it possible for me to get where I am today. I love cannabis and consider myself to be a pot-head, but have always been able to keep my shit together. Graduated college, married, kids, great job; so I may be a ""pot-head"" but I'm no ""stoner."" Sadly, I feel that I need to give it up a for a while. I have both a wife and therapist that don't like the fact that I get high, so I've decided to put it down for the time being. As a result I've eaten 1 peach and 2 plums since Sunday and hit the elliptical 2 to 3 times a day in the 105 degree heat. It's difficult, because it really is the last thing that I've been able to identify with but I guess that's what it means to be a mature and responsible adult; giving up everything that you love again and again. *shrug* I guess I'm better at neglecting myself rather than being healthy and giving myself what I need.

21,"Yes it is. I'm not sure if I can fully chalk my addiction up to that, as i started with pain issues on opiates and nevee formed a problem til losing my scripts. But im sure I would've still had some vice if not heroin ha. 

Cocaine is rough. I hope you can kick it before it gets worse. I can't handle coke. Too manic. Meth is my downfall with stimulants. 

I agree that weed tends to be a bit less severe as far as addiction goes. But IMO the addict behaviors with whatever you're using really are what signals how bad it is . Weed can def be a tough one. Luckily its mostly mental. But mental can be really hard.

36,">Are you planing to stay clean long term or just for now or not sure yet? Have you ever used opioids? How is the clean stuff going from the coke? And lastly do you find yourself displaying any addictive tendencies toward other stuff in your life aside from substances?

Honestly, I don't know if I plan on staying clean and I don't know if that's the aspect of being an addict. In my head I don't know if I WANT to quit. But at the same time I DO. It's complex. What I would like is to be able to have to occasional beer with some wings with my girlfriend and her dad or a buddy, but I simply can't have jsut one beer. It will ALWAYS lead to more. Coke I can definitely do without for the rest of my life, but I cant help but have the odd craving or dream about it. The MDMA high for me is something I feel is ALWAYS worth the comedown/psych problems they cause me for weeks after, and THAT scares me. A part of me is like ""Well, I want at least one more MDMA roll before I die."" Other than that, I just want to be a normal person who can enjoy ONE beer or a glass of wine and smoke some weed on the weekends.  


I've never dove into opioids as it isn't really a ""thing"" in my ""troublesome"" circles. I'm sure if we were into them, it'd end up being around. 2 years ago before I learned I had problems and BPD I probably would've tried heroine out of  thinking it was romantic. Not a very wise/smart fantasy.  


Coke quitting is going ok. Except I relapsed about a month ago. I'm not AS hard as my other addict friends, but It's still something I crave from time to time; especially when I think about drinking and partying. I don't know if I'm addicted to the experiences or physically the coke at this point. It still comes from time to time, but drinking is the main battle for me, as it's something I did every 1-2 days as a binge for nearly 10 years. So I feel I'm not doing too bad quitting coke/the other stims.  


My life is full of addictive tendencies. I don't know if I'm just an impulsive person, if it's a part of the BPD black and white all or nothing thing, or if I just need to lower my intensity of interest on things. When I'm recording, I go none stop till I have a 10 song album. When I smoke weed, I smoke every day. When I drink, I have minimum 10 after I promise just one. I feel whether it's good or bad, I can't moderate in my life. If I'm going to do something, it's going to be all the way as fast and hard as I feel I can handle.

I also quit drinking coffee too for the same reasons (oh yeah, you don't want me to be addicted to something that I enjoy? Well I guess I can't have coffee either then...)

i believe it is possible too, but i also believe its possible to recover and still be able to use certain drugs at times without it being problematic so long as its not the substances you were addicted to.  some addictions also may call for maintenance drugs in some cases which some recovery programs hate on but it saves lives. ultimately i agree - just sharing my perspective :) ",chasingd0pamine,97slns

I found I needed a break and to be sober from all substances, and then I've gradually picked up weed, smoking and alcohol in moderation again.

The key thing to practice is the radical acceptance side of thinking ""Ok, I didn't eat great. But I'm GOING to eat better and I WILL do better and keep trying."" NEVER make yourself feel guilty about eating bad or not getting the help if you aren't exactly ready. Sometimes the stars need to align for you to be successful, but you can ALWAYS keep trying.

I use to do nangs/whippets a lot a few years ago but they didn't help at all. They made me manic and think I was a God who could do anything. That's when I made a lot of bad decisions.

0,"Hard drugs? I don't know. I use weed, amphetamines and I get prescribed ADHD meds (also amphetamines, in a way). I use my ADHD meds for stuff that is work/university related. I snort a maximum of 3 small lines of amphetamin whenever I have a really, really bad day or when I'm very tired and I have to work. I usually regret that though, because even from that small amount I usually get sick the following day. I'd say on average I do that once every two weeks. I allow myself to smoke weed on the weekend when I don't have to do anything anymore. 

The ADHD meds and the weed really help me when I'm careful about how much I use both of them. That seems to work great. The street amphetamines are shitty and they are probably unhealthy for me. I just prefer it over suffering. But I'd probably be fine if I just started working anyways, I don't know.

What happens to your life when you are in a state of heavy drug use? I think that's the most important thing. Are you getting very sick? Are you using all your money? Are your relationships suffering? Are you getting depressed?

>As a protective mechanism, devaluation is used to stabilize self-esteem and serves to ward off feelings of envy or fear of loss and dependency.

People with narcissistic or borderline personality disorder depend on the defenses against devaluation and therefore use it systematically and frequently. In contrast to well-integrated personalities, the devaluation is also more merciless and apparently more irrefutable.

I used drugs to escape, to help my anxiety, and because I feel empty all the time and I just wanted to feel something. It worsened my mental health though and I without going into too much detail I really had a lot of unhealthy coping mechanisms before. I'm still struggling but getting off the drugs (even weed), has been helping my mental health a lot more. I also have a bipolar diagnosis so I know that the drugs and that played a lot into my unhealthy behaviors too. I may have got off of drugs and got a little better but I still feel like there's a lot of work I need to do to be a functioning healthy person.

0,"Each to their own, I'm not condemning nor condoning any one elses drug habits, I can only speak for myself. I absolutely abused weed for years, I was addicted. I smoked every day - all day every day. I thought it made me feel normal, I thought it regulated my emotions. I stopped smoking a few months ago and I can't say that I was lying to myself I just didn't know any better. When I stopped I definitely became less anxious and paranoid. I gave up for a few weeks and then went and got some and went back to the all day every day for a while and I knew it wasn't making me feel better, it was making me feel worse. I stopped again. I've gotten to a point now where I want a joint the same way as my SO wants a beer when he comes home from work. I roll a joint when I'm going for a relaxing bath once or twice week to chill and that is pretty much it. I still crave it if I'm freaking out about stuff but I have the self control now to listen when I tell myself it will just make me feel worse.

1,"I've read that it increases mood instability and anxiety. Though when I tried it I didn't experience that. I think it's different for different people. The main reason I don't do it is because I don't believe in escaping from problems. You see, I'm severely addicted to video games, and have been since I was like 12. It got much worse when my symptoms manifested though. I have been trying to quit for the past 3 years, and only just started being successful at it this year. It's all because I wanted so badly to escape from my problems, my anxiety, my depression. I feel like that's what many people with BPD are doing with weed, and it's not healthy. You can't learn the skills necessary to deal with those things if you don't feel the emotions.

The difficulties in interviewing dozens or hundreds of clients currently using drugs is hard enough, but outside of biological responses the affects of drugs are subjective. You cannot ethically study them well high, so now those subjective descriptions are after the fact. Still, broadly speaking the idea makes a great deal of sense. If our brains are pouring out a great deal more dopamine or whatever, that would likely affect how much the drug could affect us in the normal way.

Imagine being 18 and going to a hot spring break spot. Now imagine that same spot but no one had any alcohol or any drugs.
Now it seems more like Bible camp correct ? 

No matter what we do, nothing will be as exciting as it was when we were using. 
Nothing. 

It isn’t only people with BPD. It’s the truth for everyone. 
We do those things because they feel good even if we know later will not feel good. We don’t care.

Most of us are natural addicts   Most of us learned at an early age those altered moments pretty much saved us even if they broke us later on down the road. 

I don’t have any real advice being I can never completely recover. Even if I am sober for so long I will always go back. I have learned to be okay with that though. It is something I want and it is something I will get. I just don’t let it ruin my life anymore. 
I do not do the things that I couldn’t control 
I may want to at times , but I am able to fight that urge with compromise. 
So 
Ok. I will not smoke crack but I will use coke at times. 
I will not drink every night until I’m blacked out but I will drink when I want to. 
I will not do meth. I will take another upper if I feel the need.",,m333ps
5,"> It’s about learning to not need that feeling anymore which many of us are not able to do easily.

Most 5 digit IQ thing I've ever read on rebbit. I respect all the posts ITT but yours gave me a different perspective. Ironically I always say that BPD is learning how to cope with pain: what you're saying is the opposite learning, how to cope not being able to achieve the greatest feeling. Never thought like that. I've been stuck in the consequences of the negative, but not on the consequences of the ""positive"". Thanks m80.",crayolaazul,m333ps
6,"I’m glad it helped ! 
I struggled for years blaming myself for being a bad person when in reality I’m not a bad person. I enjoy the feeling I just have to control the frequency and how far I go with it. Once you learn to adjust something to where you find comfort in it you are then doing the best you can do and still be happy with yourself. :-) 

Remind yourself : I am not on a drug diet. I am simply going to make better choices about my drugs.  Diets do not work. Ever. Lifestyle changes do

I don't think I saw much of him during the school week until my mom forced him to get clean when I was like ~6? My earliest memory is of my abuelo [grandfather] arguing with my father in Spanish because my father kept calling me a brat. I was maybe three? I had barely begun speaking at this point (delayed bc ear infections). My mom called him a ""sober addict"" or something of that nature—all he does when he gets home is sit on the sofa, watch TV, and complain. I used to fight with him as a kid all the time (and sometimes still do) because he would eat all my food. He had bad food allergies when he was a kid, so he would have to sneak food at night because his mom kept him on a strict diet. I remember him sleepwalking/sleepeating(?) during the first eight-ish years of my life. His mother also refused to acknowledge his ADD—it doesn't exist in our culture. His parents split when he was like 16 and he just went wild since he had no rules. Refuses to acknowledge his mom manipulated him ruthlessly.

My mother immigrated to America in '70. Her father was absent because he had to work the fields for a few years in order for them to be able to leave. They lost everything. Her brother's cat was poisoned. My abuela isn't the best with emotions (I have had to somewhat train her to kiss my cheek). She was hard and strict with my mother (will come up later). She [abuela] never received a formal education past the age of eight; she also received her first pair of rubber shoes at this age. Her parents divorced when she was really young, and the nine kids got split. She was sent with her father. She got a machete in her back for ratting on her step-mom, who was fucking the meat guy. She lived with her abuela on dirt floors, and they got by by cleaning. She was raped by her first husband at 18 (I hope it was 18, but it appears sometimes she's shifted ages in order to make some content more tolerable). Her husbands were all pieces of shit in some way, with her second husband (mom's dad) being the less shittiest. He wasn't that bad actually, he taught her how to write letters and numbers (she is a Simpleton) and tried teaching her how to bike and swim; he supposedly really loved her. I'm just bitter that he took a mistress. My abuela is extremely insecure and extremely emotional; now that I think about it, she appears to somewhat show some of my same BPD characteristics.

My mom's dad got sick with cancer within I think a year of them immigrating to America. I think he died the next. My abuela—who cannot read nor actually write—supported my mom and uncle by working in a factory and working janitorial. My uncle is her favorite; I think my mom reminds her too much of her late husband. My mom and uncle began working at a supermarket at ages 13 and 14, respectively. My mom, who had been praised as an intellectual prodigy in her homeland and skipped two grades, was pushed back here. She finished high school through night school, and at 17, she was living on her own, never getting IDed lol, and working as the top seller at a water bed store. She distanced herself from her mother for a few years. Had a few relationships; ended an engagement two weeks before the wedding (in her defense, the would-be-mother-in-law was crazy and was having her followed). Part of me thinks she married my dad out of fear (she was 27/28). She has a hard time regulating her emotions. She sees parts of herself in me, and I in her.

Mom and I think my dad may be bipolar like his brother, as we've noticed ""seasons"" of energy and of idleness—but it could be depression. My brother overdosed almost a year ago. Wow, it feels crazy realizing that. Nonetheless, I honestly think all the members of my immediate family (of whom I identify with) show BPD characteristics. I have predispositions on both sides (mom's brother is also BPD or bipolar—but I think it's BPD). Perhaps I'll share more stories of my crazy family if they're well-received.

7,"I'm ACOA, both parents were alcoholics. Mum committed suicide when I was 4, I found the body. Raised by alcoholic abusive dad who was lonely and bitter. Dad is epileptic and has TBI from a seizure from when I was young. all his mental health and physical health issues he took out on me. I was verbally and/or physically abused most days as a kid. I was bullied at school because I was poor and had zero social skills and spent most of my time alone. Extended family thought I was autistic (I'm not). Ended up at a boarding school on a scholarship, dad expected me to contact him but never called me unless he was drunk or showed any interest in my life. During holidays he would berate me frequently about not fitting into the family he married into while I was off at school. I attempted suicide at age 12 but never told any family about it. I needed serious mental health treatment but was too scared to say anything because I thought I'd lose my scholarship and my future. Ended up moving out at 16 to the city I was going to school in and supported myself through the last couple of years of school. Haven't spoken to dad for 4 years, he has a major health scare once a year or so that I hear about but I just ran out of fucks to give so long ago. Diagnosed with BPD at 21. Still healing.

12,"My mother has narcissistic personality disorder and my dad is an alcoholic. So YES. :(

Mother was incredibly manipulative, mentally and emotionally abusive. I was fairly suicidal right before I left home and in my first semester away at school.

She tormented me from afar, I suffered, failed classes, and I was incredibly angry for quite some time. 

I've successfully tempered my anger, through psychedelics and mdma. Also discovered I have pretty severe OCD while under the influence of mdma. I was in complete denial and balled when this substance allowed me to see what I had been doing to myself for years. I was also becoming an alcoholic myself, and quit drinking after psychedelic use.

My dad is very misogynistic, controlling and has serious anger issues. I was able to distance myself from him more than my mother and I'm now pretty estranged (parents are divorced btw).

Thanks for posting this. It's genuinely therapeutic to realize there are serious traumatic upbringings that can result in BPD.

As for the drugs, I've never taken anything harder than weed. Weed imo has been the best for me, as it doesn't cause me to feel down during or after the high, unlike alcohol. Weed helps me to control anxiety and lifts my mood if I feel down.

I was in an abusive relationship, the drugs made me feel like shit about myself, and eventually I spiraled. Now that I am in a better place, I know that doing drugs and hanging around bad influences are not good for me and now that I've stayed away from things and people like that I can better manage my BPD and MY LIFE. What's worked for me is the DBT workbook \(I suggested ordering one off of Amazon if you can, it's amazing\) In it are ways of managing anxiety and learning ways to ground when you feel yourself dissociating.

2,"I have the same problem. I recently quit drinking using kratom to help with withdrawals and this is the longest I’ve been sober for years. (Almost 2 months) 

I am so, so familiar with the depressive crash after a night of drug abuse. Keep in mind that after a night like you mentioned, especially while mixing substances, your brain chemistry is gonna be thrown way outta whack. For me, the thing that always kept me from quitting drinking was the horrible depression and emptiness I felt when I was sobering up. The easiest way to get rid of the feeling is just to get fucked up again, and so the cycle continues. 

If you really want to get out of it, it isn’t going to be easy. The physical stuff sucks of course, (make sure you taper if you’ve been consuming alcohol regularly. Stopping cold turkey when you’ve been drinking consistently can cause serious health issues and kill you) but for me the worst pat was crossing that mental bridge, working through all the emotions and trauma I’d been repressing with the help of substances, and waiting for my brain chemistry to right itself again. It sucked ass. I’m not gonna lie. But I’m nearly 2 months sober (3 more days!) and once I got through all that shitty stuff, things have actually changed. I’m not magically cured, my mental health stuff is all still there, but for once I’m not totally repressing things and living in denial. I’ve been a better friend, I’ve been cooking and eating healthy, and I’m starting to get back control over my life. I didn’t think it would be worth it, but it really is.

0,"Last year I spent almost $10,000 on cocaine alone. I quit that, but I've always been prone to going on really awful drug binges. I love prescription drugs(adderall and benzos), alcohol, acid, shrooms, molly. Basically everything but meth and opiates. I smoke weed every day and drink on most days. It's all impulsiveness and self-medicating for me. Once I decide to drop a drug it's usually not a big deal, so I don't really tie it to drug addiction... just my BPD and other mental illnesses. I don't do crazy things to get drugs, withdrawal or crave much. Since I started taking actual medication I quit everything but weed and whiskey and the occasional benzo if I have a panic attack. Mine definitely isn't tied into having an FP or a love life-- I have both and they don't really correlate at all for me.",TBS_Reruns,blafnl
1,"I can relate a ton to this. I have smoked weed almost every day for 2 years, and drank at least 3x a week for the same amount of time. I also have been using nicotine constantly for 3 years. I frequently use molly, cocaine, and LSD, too. My parents and friends tell me they think i have a problem, but when I run out of booze or pot I never do anything crazy or have withdrawals/ intense cravings. I think it is more something that just, in a lot of ways, allows me to be altered. I have a really hard time with interacting with people. I get so sure that everyone thinks I'm incredibly weird, unapproachable, awkward. It makes me avoid social situations unless they are with people I already know well. But using substances makes me feel charismatic and free, and really stops the anxieties of my crippling insecurities. I think substances might be a big thing for people with BPD because they allow people to finally kind of chill out and stop worrying so much all the time. In some people it might be the opposite, though. For me it's hard because my FP (boyfriend) is a cocaine dealer so I almost always have a supply of whatever I want. I think it has made me more willing to engage in using those things because I know I can be personable and charismatic like he is when I'm altered.",krkrkr2323,blafnl

3,"hey, i can really relate to this. especially the drugs / alcohol. for me even self harm all feels relatively addictive in the same way.  

I’m not sure whether an FP would be able to just completely replace your drug and or other bad copings, but that’s not to diminish that there can be that possibility of your life changing for the better by stopping the drugs for example. All depending on your tolerance and need for it, whether you have an addictive personality it will be a lot more challenging too but having someone to focus on and cherish can certainly be a nice thing to have in our lives. 

I would say don’t fully rely on an FP to make an overnight change, because unfortunately that’s not how it can always turn out with Fps, especially splitting... that’s the tricky part of depending on someone like an fp, but i do hope that things will get better for you in regards to your drug usage.

I’m definitely not where I’d like to be but compared to a year ago, therapy and just having a support network has helped me improve tremendously. I have terrible impulse control and a super addictive personality so once I get going, it’s basically balls to the walls. Point is, hope exists my friend, you just gotta take it a day at a time.

Personally, addiction hasn't overcome me with any particular substance either.  Of course, when going without food/water/sleep for days on end - a crash is to be expected.  But I'm still able to go weeks/months without 'em.

Another factor that I think might matter is the ""chronic emptiness"" and ""distorted sense of self"".

It's your life you should do what you want! It just makes me upset."" 

Like I literally don't *want* him to stop or even stop talking about it but it makes me so upset ahhhh. We came to a compromise that he'll continue doing it and casually tell me something about it (something he learned that interested him or if he was smoking with his friends and he had a good time, normal stuff) but we're going to try and work on not having full on conversations about drugs unless I feel like my head space is okay. One thing I know that frustrates me is that he used to not talk about drugs so much but this summer he started hanging out with new friends and it's all he talks about. By default one of my pet peeves is when someone doesn't have a personality outside of their drug(s) of choice. Idk grrr",blingeeclown,ctquz9
2,"Maybe the frustration has to do with a form of missing out (deep down) bc you know you can’t experience those things since you said smoking gives you anxiety, so it makes you jealous?

3,"Honestly I wouldn't doubt that lol. Both the jealousy and just being crazy ahaha. A big issue of mine is feeling left out (again... trauma lmao) so honestly it probably is that.

My brain is just all dumb ughhh. 

I feel dumb because he wanted to reconnect with these friends and I like already knew what he used to do with these friends so like I should've been prepared ahhhh.

I just wished I could smoke weed lmfao. My fucking stupid shit brain can't even let me do that,",blingeeclown,ctquz9

But my personal experience is I started using Cannabis for physical chronic pain but since then have started using it for episodes of depression and anxiety. I find that my symptoms usually get a lot better when use it as long as I stick to hybrid or indica.
As a warning: I definitely have issues controlling my usage of cannabis and it can also get very expensive. I have probably spent $600 on dry herb vaping equipment alone, not including the cost of the product.",GuiltDreadDepression,1bdas5i
4,"I had a talk with my psychiatrist about this. 
In short he explained it to me like this: drug use, like weed, alcohol etc makes every mental illness worse in the long term. Because every drug messes with your neurotransmitters and your brain in general.

I've gone month on occasion without for a T-break or to chill tf out, but end up picking it back up really quickly especially at parties. But DAMN does it fucking help with meltdowns. SO much.

8,"I think alcohol makes my BPD a lot more intense, yeah. Splitting on alcohol is a different beast. I’m a complete fucking bitch to my partner and I basically have to stay away from it. 

Weed can make me psychotic or it can make me think through things more clearly and make me see my BPD for what it really is. I guess I don’t really want to take the gamble. 

MDMA has helped me the most when I use it properly. 3 month rule, low dose to start with, one redose and that’s it. I find it incredibly therapeutic and I get so much out of it. But I’ve abused this substance because it was so good for me, lost a lot of the magic, and the comedowns have made everything worse. 

Basically, drugs kinda make things worse, yeah. I would avoid using them until your BPD is firmly and well into remission tbh. It’s mental illness that makes you more vulnerable to an addiction or having a bad experience on drugs. They can be awesome and a beautiful part of life, I just don’t think they mix well with BPD sadly.",futuregoddess,1bdas5i
9,"Personally, I don't handle THC edibles very well. At best, I don't have a lot of control over saying or doing stupid things. At worst, I literally split into three different personalities/people, which scares me tremendously. THC leaves me with some not great lingering side effects too. Alcohol is usually fine for me though unless I get really drunk, but even then, it's still not even close to how THC hits me.

13,"I smoke a lot of weed each day. A *lot.*

Does it help? Sort of. Certain strains honestly make it worse than others. I tend to lean towards Indica's. I think they're more relaxing; but honestly, it depends on what kind of weed you're smoking, because sometimes it makes it worse. Then I just don't smoke that strain anymore. Not a big deal.

You can have two Indica or Sativa strains that have completely different effects on the mood/anxiety, etc. I would say 90% of the time, I'm totally safe smoking an Indica. Once in a while, you hit that weird strain that makes your anxiety or paranoia worse. That's fine, get through the high, and light up something else.

The stigma around THC is actually getting better. There are new studys that are getting done correctly to show the benefits of MC. It's just like, someone trys endone, it doesn't agree with there DNA So they stop that and try something else. Everyone's DNA is different and some medications won't be for them. Gosh, antidepressants screw the brain long term more then MC. By the time these medications start to wear out the brain , we are in our 80's with problems anyways.

35,"Sobriety has been absolutely the best thing for my BPD. It takes a while for our brain to regrow any lost neurons (6 months +) to fully start to feel the changes. Taking a few weeks off of weed or booze won't come close to the clarity and coherence my mental health has benefited from in the long term. 

I was a heavy user to mask my symptoms. Sometimes in a split I would drink heavily just to make myself pass out and wake up ""back to normal"", which just make my concurrent diags. worse (depression and anxiety with ADHD). And I'd smoke a lot of weed to dull my brain because boy, when my ADHD was active and I had a split - I was absolutely toxic to myself and others, so smoking weed just kinda kept me calm-ish (numb) so I couldn't annoy people with my true self. 

In my journey of sobriety I'm able to be far more emotionally aware of my triggers and patterns, and a lot happier waking up without a hangover, and having energy to spend time doing hobbies and following my passions instead of being a lazy stoner all day.

94,"Just a heads up and not saying you’re wrong for not knowing this cuz it’s new scientific info cuz we are just now able to research cannabis - 

The Indica, sativa, hybrid thing turns out to not be real. There is no difference between the chemical makeup of an indica plant and a sativa plant (feel free to google it) 

What does matter for therapeutic and medical uses is the terpenes and the chill or energetic high is more based on the ratio to cbd and thc

If you google a cannabis terpene list it will show you all the different kinds of terpenes and then you can look up strains with those terpenes for those benefits

If you do weed without the terpenes (distillate) it feels very empty. It’s called the entourage effect 

That being said a lot of strains are already classified as sativa and indica based on the high you get from the thc and cbd content so it’s somewhat safe to go based on the vibe you’re going for by using indica and sativa. The only issue is most strains at dispensaries just don’t have CBD in them anymore. Which is why people say weed isn’t relaxing as much as it used to be

The difference in how the plants look doesn’t matter tho. (Which is how they’re classified) You can get some reaaally purple weed with indica leaves and it give you an energetic high and vice versa

Sorry I’m autistic and weed is a special interest so I thought it’d be interesting to know. I don’t want you to think I’m 🤓’ing you lmao

Here is a list of the most common terps in cannabis strains I found on LEAFLY

Myrcene may provide relaxing effects 

Limonene may alleviate stress and anxiety 

Caryophyllene is known to relieve inflammation 

Pinene may help with pain, anxiety, and inflammation

It’s also where the flavor of weed comes from

Plus it’ll help you get the strains you need for whatever problem you may need to medicate :3

Idk if you can put links in this subreddit but here is a website with a graph of the main different terps and effects [Leafy Terp Graph](https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/infographic-what-are-cannabis-terpenes-and-how-do-they-affect-you)",PuppyGirlBecca,1bdas5i

If I could control how much I drank, then I would be fine. But with my ""go big or go home"" mindset, there was no control. I finally quit drinking cold turkey a year ago, and while I don't think I'd be in the relatively healthy place I'm in now without any single one of the tools, resources, and experiences I've had, I think the one that has made the biggest difference in the shortest amount of time has been quitting drinking.",No_Recognition7135,1bdas5i

My dad always told me it was an acquired taste, and when I saw all the problems it caused others I didn't feel the need to acquire it. 

I have never smoked anything ever, and I  haven't really done other drugs either. I do have an addiction to surgery for many reasons. One of which is I like the feeling I get just before going under.  Or, if I am not put totally out but just made loopy/sleepy, I like that too.

I also am a virgin at 42 years old. I have never had a sex drive, nor been able to pleasure myself. I think it makes my life less complicated since I am not always thinking about sex or how to get sexual pleasure. ",esoper1976,ayjeu6

I've never done drugs primarily due to not having easy access.

I never had problems with the pain meds after. They really didn't do much for me, and now I can't take them because part of my psych meds includes Naltrexone which makes them not work.

2,"Speaking for my own experience only, not passing judgment on you, and I truly hope this doesn’t sound judgmental because it is not:
The times when I’ve reached out for help but haven’t been fully honest have not been successful, and that’s a true understatement.   Looking back I can see that it was the best I could do at the time (my reason for keeping things secret has usually been intense shame), and so I can forgive myself now for that, but I also see that even in all the pain that I was in, I hadn’t reached a point of desperation that was genuine enough for me to be at a place where I could be helped. That was a clumsily written sentence, here’s another try: I’m 32, I wasted my teens and 20s being miserable, creating problems for myself, pushing away people that I love/d and opportunities that I will not have again. If I had known what the future had in store for me, I would have taken therapy and suggestions in my support group a LOT more seriously from the start. This is life or death shit. Most of my adult life has been full of failure of varying degrees, one after another, because I did not accept my diagnosis, I thought I could figure things out myself, and because the mental health system sucks for people like us so we have to be sane enough to be our own advocates to get the benefit from it—starting the process of recovery hysterical and fearful and then drifting away when I saw how much work it would be has been my MO. My experience is I had to hit bottom over and over and over until I was just disgusted with myself and what I had done to my life (my life! My one time on earth!), before having moments of clarity where I saw that if I did not  begin to be truly honest, open minded and willing I might as well kill myself now because the fucked up shit was just going to get worse and worse the older I get.
Keeping drug use/abuse a secret when trying to seek treatment for serious mental illness is a recipe for disaster.
There is help.

3,"Yes, please do tell your therapist. Once you are 18, you will be able to know that your therapist cannot legally share anything with your parents without your consent. Although, your therapist will probably not tell your parents about your drug use, should you confide in her while still under 18 years old, unless she has grave & immediate concerns for your welfare. I am not sure of the laws in your country/state, but having worked in the field myself, I can say a therapist will usually prioritize your trust unless they are legally obliged to break it to keep you safe. I would also urge you to be honest with her about your use of benzos, as these can be particularly dangerous during withdrawal & you may need to access detox services if you want to suddenly stop your usage (depending on your level of addiction). Look, good on you for recognising that this is a problem - it can be hard to face that, and you obviously can see that you need help. This is a really tough road you're on, but you don't have to do it alone and you don't have to involve your family... but it may be worth thinking about what is keeping you from telling them? - family can be a good source of support in some cases (Granted - Not all cases!!), and I'd hate for you to not utilise their support because you feel ashamed or that they would perceive it as ""bad behaviour"". I don't know your situation, but I'm just putting it out there. If it's possible to have more members on your team, why not? ",smokestacklightnen,7fdg96

actually i am currently also addicted to ket but it’s MUCH better than years ago and the only thing that helped me were to get knowledge about what’s actually happening when your addicted and what’s actually happening in your brain on certain drugs and WHY you have to stop at some point. 
maybe it’s just for me but some things scared me that much, that i’ve started to fear most drugs.. because the most damage you can get from drugs is irreparable at some point.
changing my environment COMPLETELY helped much (i know that’s not easy at all but everyone was sick of me anyway and i can’t stand to watch me make it worse).. 
i also started drugs when i was like 14 and i always thought „i’m too young to have any issues from that“ or „i won’t notice damage until i’m older and i then im fucked anyway so“ haha very dumb of me...actually it’s worse for your brain to take drugs at a young age because your brain actually still changes and i’m 21 now and i often cry my eyes out because my brain can’t function like before and it’s really scary. i feel retarded for most of the time.
i remember that i thought about people who also used drugs like me but they didn’t had big issues with it afterwards but i know now that was impossible to do, cause as a bpd patient you feel so different from other people and our brains are not working like someone else’s.
when you use a drug to don’t feel certain emotions you will create a hole and it will get bigger and bigger and your brain will notice that it’s much easier to just have a hole and not all these emotions and suddenly you feel numb but can’t stop it.
or maybe you are numb in the first place and you are trying to fill that hole, it won’t get filled but it will get bigger and bigger until you ARE that hole (happened even on the drug that „ helped“ me before and i’ve thought feeling numb is the worst but drug abuse created a whole new level of numbness)
for example i couldn’t stand my empathy. everyone around me was making me feel like they did and i always tried to fix all their problems until i couldn’t take it anymore and started to reduce that empathy with some drugs. and some day it changed completely and didn’t had any empathy at all anymore. i’ve thought it will come back (because i had a healthy relationship again and wanted to feel what he was feeling or feel in love) but no didn’t happened until now... i’ve made myself feeling like a psychopath. i mean i’ve felt unable to have a relationship before but now it’s MUCH worse.
one thing that helped me personally was reading about rebirth and the tibetan book of living and dying. also if you haven’t faith in anything, there were a few moments when i realized that even though i don’t want it to be true, there are many signs that rebirth is a thing. but get your own idea of that... i’m not into religion at all and this rebirth thing isn’t about religion either. it made me change my sight a little bit because i’ve always waited for my death and wanted to die as soon as possible but after going into this rebirth topic (first i hated it all because fock off are you kidding me) i’ve thought that if i don’t make any effort in this life, i will have to do it all over again (just without noticing it). if you aren’t into reading, watch ENTER THE VOID (it’s a great and trippy movie even though you don’t want to know anything about this rebirth thing).

but that’s just my personal experience.

im sorry if this isn’t helpful at all, but i feel you so much and i wish i had someone back then to tell me that i will regret this so much in the future. 
and maybe it’s wrong to try to fix this with fear but in my case everything else wasn’t enough to reach me at that point. 
and you are so young, you can still make it all work out! and if you need someone to talk to, i’m here :) 
wish you the best! try to stay safe please 🧡",satanskittenz,gcmg7l
3,"I’ve battled addiction on and off for the past decade. A few significant, long and severely damaging bouts, lots and lots of extended binges, and just as many one time use kind of deals. 

I don’t believe I’ve successfully stayed sober for very long, because drug use has been one of my impulsive tendencies that occur as what I use as a coping mechanism in the event of what feel like “crisis situations”. 

The drug use is bad enough, but the recurring cycle of use, shame and guilt, self hatred and punishment (this a lot of times propels the use further after the initial high as I feel so intensely bad about myself, I almost unconsciously want myself to hurt more) and then grief as I fight to reach a sober and normal baseline again - is debilitating.

Psychedelics have had only neutral or positive effects. Haven’t really used other drugs that much, but I think MDMA, coke etc is ok to use once in a blue moon. I’d definitely never do meth.

Weed helped for a short time but eventually made my anxiety/paranoia 10x worse. 

As bad as I feel in general overall, the effects of those things make me feel worse in the long run. Even if they offer temporary relief at the time.

I had psychosis 2 times on it.  The amount of times I've used psychedelics at the doses I have (most was either 10 tabs or 5 grams of shrooms with DMT at the peak) had never given me psychosis.  

First time I was taking 100mg of  adderall a day for 4 days,  tweaking on reddit.  Wasn't eating anything and was hardly drinking water.  My vision was very distorted,  everything was fuzzy and jagged looking.  I was in the middle of a post and i just left my body for a second and entered this sort of alternate reality. I don't know how long it lasted (maybe an hour) and I made a lot of really disturbing posts that didn't make sense. 

Second time was with meth (it's almost the same to adderall,  just lasts a LOT longer and a bit more euphoric and less side effects). I was on it for 3 days (maybe 4) and was even getting a little sleep each night (the least restful sleep possible though) and was getting a little food and plenty of water.  I was taking 100 to 200mg each day,  and since it lasts so long it added together somewhat.  I was laying in bed,  trying to finally fall asleep for the whole night and I just started hearing music playing, which was a hallucination.

Ketamine is also able to fix my bad moods overall, so no more depressive moods and all that stuff.

But anyway I wouldn't recommend any of these especially benzos that are the most addicting drugs both physically and mentally being prescribed.

Ketamine on his side, they usually do small doses which are effective pretty much instantly and are lasting 1-2 weeks. So no risk of real side effects (as the ""main"" effects lasts 1 hour at most) and no risk of addiction either.

So its pretty much all, either you go for anxiolytics, antipsychotics, sedatives, SSRIs, nmda antagonists that are known to increase BDNF (ketamine, dextromethorphan, etc..)

For me, MDMA made me feel shit in the few days afterward, and there is quite a bit of evidence that it can contribute to depression, so I avoid it these days. 

For what it’s worth, most people I know who have tried psychedelics agree that it wasn’t scary in the way they expected it to be. Even if it is an uncomfortable experience, it’s usually just that, and there’s still a lot to learn from it. It’s extremely rare for a bad trip to actually have long term consequences. Whereas MDMA can alter your serotonin production for quite while. Keep in mind that with MDMA it’s also more likely that what you’re getting is not pure, or is an entirely different substance.

I would really just talk about it all to those people who are worried about you coping with drugs or drink or cutting. It’s so hard to lose someone you are close to. My greatest fear is losing my loved ones. This is really a time to live in the moment as much as possible. Feel everything and know that feelings pass. They are waves that can come crashing in or be calm and gentle. Go for walks, go in nature as much as possible honestly. If you like animals go play with them. Find a routine to stick to, even if it’s just a morning or night routine, this will give you some stability and control where you otherwise have none. Cry, scream, laugh, smile. All of it. People think going numb is good, but I feel like processing it all by allowing yourself to feel it fully and going through it is best. See if there are any support groups in your area or online. Connect with things that matter to you, art, music, nature. Break some shit if needed. Take care. I hope the best for you.",tabcatnine,15olkzk
6,"My fiance died 8 years ago unexpectedly. I came home from the funeral and ended up in the hospital that night.  
I crashed for months. I had no real friends, and the very few I did have turned out to be absolutely horrible people. I hung out with people I knew were bad for me because they had drugs and alcohol. I put myself in dangerous situations, and I closed my eyes.


I started spending time at the library. I would walk there and sit on my laptop or go find a book in the stacks (my advice is not to read every Nicholas Sparks novel. Charlaine Harris is pretty good, though). I was fiddling with my laptop one day, and someone started talking to me. He ended up giving me some advice - go get a job working at a bookstore. And I did. That job saved my life for three years. 


My advice is to find something that will keep you occupied, that will force you to be present. Every day was a struggle because it felt like I was swimming in water above my head, and there were too many waves. And then, one day, there were fewer waves. I smiled without feeling bad. I can't tell you when it will stop, and I can't tell you how bad it's going to get. We've already got abandonment issues, and losing someone like this, having a future stolen from us is practically unbearable. 

Don't stop listening to music. I couldn't stand it because music had been a huge part of my relationship. It took me a year before I could start to appreciate it again. 

But more importantly, you're going to be okay. One day, you're going to be okay.",evilgirlattack,15olkzk

8,"i’m so sorry for your loss. i feel for you. my ex-boyfriend took his life almost two weeks ago and i am still very broken over it. i think the same exact things. i want to cut, i wanna use drugs, i wanna binge drink alcohol until i stop feeling a damn thing. every day i think about lashing out on people, screaming at the top of my lungs until my throat burns, calling the cops and threatening them that i’ll down a whole bottle of my prescription pills, just anything crazy. 

these are all urges to cope with the debilitating loss of a lover and it’s okay to think these things and to feel like we must do them in order to be okay. but make sure they stay in your mind and not manifest into action.

what has been helping me cope with his loss is making him a playlist of songs that remind me of our relationship (songs we listened to together, sang together, dedicated to each other) and another playlist of songs that describe how my heart currently feels. songs that are broken and slow and sad and make your heart absolutely ache. one playlist is to relive the happy memories with your lover to uplift your spirits, and the other is to help you ride the wave of your sorrowful emotions.

another thing i have been doing to cope a lot is meditating outside, somewhere near nature. if things get too unbearable, i dip my feet in the creek. you could do this with cold water in a bath tub, too. it helps calm you down, trust me. it’s a TIPP skill from DBT. the freezing cold water shocks your brain to only focus on the cold water on your skin and nothing else, so you feel a little calmer and more rational to use your other coping skills.

i also have been watching movies and tv shows with my mom because she is my best friend. it doesn’t have to be your mom it could be anyone you trust.

these are just some things that have been helping me right now. i hope they’re helpful. again i’m really sorry for your loss. a grief like this and losing a lover is such an indescribable pain.",manicmommy8,15olkzk

10,"Allow yourself the space to crash and burn. All of your feelings are right. Your reactions in grief are RIGHT. What others expect of you is far less important than the real thing, and let that thing happen in any way it shows up. I think you’ll find your consciousness guiding yourself in the right way since you have done the backbreaking work of growth and getting to where you are now, especially in terms of addiction. Do not get caught up on what you can or can’t allow yourself to do or be. One of the most important thing you can strive for, which is one of the the most difficult things for us with BPD, is to not judge yourself in this world of judgment. Give yourself the room granted to any neurotypical person, to express your full self in the manner you choose. I truly believe that we are some of the most sensitive, soulful people on this earth, and what alleviated a lot of my self judgement was to trust in myself. Trust that you are a GOOD person. Which you are. Trust that you will do the right thing. Which you will, regardless of what that may be. Trust in your emotions, in your reactions, and don’t judge yourself for them or limit them. They are the only things that are truly yours.

12,"I’m so sorry, my love. I understand your pain- I was there in November. My boyfriend passed away in a car accident next to me and I had to go back home to our home without him. It’s hard, and it doesn’t get easier, but you learn to cope and work around the pain. Take everything at your own pace- even if you feel like you are okay suddenly, give yourself patience and the space to accept when you no longer feel okay. (I hope that made sense). Remember that you have people who love you, and would do anything to keep you from SH. 
As for feeling like people are tip-toeing around you, waiting for a breakdown. Don’t worry about what they do or don’t think. You have people who will love you regardless. Ask for help when you need it. It’s so much easier to help when someone is splitting than it is to plan a funeral- a true loved one will always that way.",OrneryConstruction69,15olkzk
13,"I am so sorry for your loss. I hate to be the one to say that I know how you feel, but I do. My boyfriend passed at 34, two years ago in July. I know that terrible feeling of feeling out of control, & feeling like you are just going to go insane. I know right now that there's not much I can say to make that feeling go away for you but I do want to let you know that some days you will feel numb.. those are actually the best days because it feels like you get a break from the really intense emotions. It's going to be up and down. On the hard days, do whatever you feel you need to do to take care of yourself and don't apologize to anyone for putting yourself first. Some days I literally took several naps just to make it through a rough day as an escape. Try to do little self care things, even if you just manage to get up and take a shower and put fresh clothes on that make you feel better about yourself. Distraction for a few hours helps. Spoil yourself a little extra when you can, just to make yourself happy for a little while. 

Keep that mindset that you have right now about not allowing yourself to crash and burn because you can't. Not only would he not want to see that for you, but also, if you let yourself go down... you will eventually have to pick up the pieces and the last thing you need is to make it harder on yourself. Even the hardest days are going to pass, and you will be so surprised how fast the time goes. You will be looking back two years from now, and the hard days aren't going to hit as hard as they are hitting you right now. You will get through this.

I’ve been keeping myself busy by cleaning and cooking. I know it sounds like nothing but maybe you could bake for others to comfort yourself and others.

i wanted the pain to stop so i too wanted to cut, i wanted to pop every pill i could find, i wanted to find people to scream at..i wanted to hit people, and this was all before i was diagnosed. 

what I did, that helped was i went into the bedroom after asking everyone to give me space to process. I beat the living daylights outta my pillows. i screamed as loud as i could into a pillow. i punched the pillows as hard as i could several times.  rinse and repeat. Over and over. 

the people around you love and care about you. thats why they are acting the way they are. they are trying to be there for you. its hard for the people who love you to see you hurting and not be able to stop it.

19,"I’m terribly sorry to hear about your loss, just try to take things slowly, baby steps, write things down, call it “my secret journal” , and let all that rage, anger, sadness, frustration flow. You cannot start a new chapter until you finish the current one. It can take a while to finish a current chapter just like why good author will tell you. So remember, self care, but most of all patience, and compassion. It is the small little acts of love that build up to the bigger finale. We cannot get it all there at once. For example, not that this example has anything to do with this this, but a couple do university and become doctors only because of the money, they become a power couple, they burn themselves out, they want the whole world, power , houses, wealth travel, luxury within 5-10 yes that is their choice but there are consequences for pushing things beyond limits ; it just don’t work like that. We have to abide by patience. I know it’s hard. Try to enjoy at least ONE good thing each day. If you smile at a dog and they look at you in the park, take a photo of it on your phone, pat it, etc. this is called mindfulness. It begins rewriting your brain slowly bout surely.

24,"Be prepared for grief to sharpen after any funeral services or celebration of life events.  Plan support to be around you even if at a distance. 

My 6yo daughter died in 2016.  It intensified my BPD in horrible ways.  After her funeral, when guests left and I had nothing left to do for her, was the worst for me.

I had friends check in to make sure I was eating 2-3 times a day.  I got a short-term prescription for sleep meds from my doctor because I was sleeping less than 3 hours a night.  I did not rush to make changes in my home that removed signs of my daughter's life. 

Those things helped the most.  Weekly therapy helped in a long-term sense.  Talking to people who understood my grief helped some.

I won't say it gets easier.  Just yesterday, I had a dream where my daughter was still alive.  When I woke up, I forgot she was dead for just a minute before years of grief hit me like an ocean wave trying to drown me.  The brutally hard moments do eventually get further apart and life starts to fill the spaces between the sadness. 

I'd also recommend getting a journal to write down memories as you have them.  Almost 7 years after losing my daughter, what plagues me now is the fear that I'm forgetting her.  Don't worry about getting all of them right away; memories flood us soon after the loss.  Just create a space for yourself to remember him and who he was with joy.

26,"There's nothing that is predictable or right in anyone's grief. It's such a difficult burden to continue living after someone close to you is suddenly not doing that. The day after my 3yrs younger little sister (29f at the time) died I had to be a passenger in a car and I was so hateful towards everyone I passed that could exist without missing her. Despite that and everyone expecting me to break, I still haven't. I've felt some big feelings and definitely lived with a lil extra depression salt on top of the entree. But breaking is something I've done over smaller matters. My world shattered when my ex husband cheated on me. But my sister died 4 and a half years ago. Her death kills me and hurts more than anything I've ever experienced... Yeah, even including all the shit that caused the BPD. 

But, the grief thing is hard to navigate. Everyone will do it differently. You might break at some point. If that happens, lean in and let yourself feel it. If not, whatever. It's easy to immediately numb yourself to absolutely anything, because you've been conditioned to expect the worst.

27,"My boyfriend died 4 years ago, on valentines day no less. Car accident. Didn't die instantly but was unresponsive when paramedics arrived. Probably felt no pain. I saw his body afterward. I'll never forget the way his eyes looked. How still his chest was. 

Losing a partner is, in my opinion, in the top 3 most emotionally painful things a person can go through. It was easily the most harrowing and traumatic thing that's ever happened to me. 

But it gets easier, I promise. Please believe me when I tell you, it gets easier. You slowly relearn how to be a human being again. Slowly you stop crying when you think of him, and start smiling instead. 

It took me over three years to truly recover. I'm really only recently not thinking about him every second of every day. 

But again, I promise, you'll learn how to be happy again, how to love again, and most importantly, that you CAN love again. 

It's ok to feel these things. To feel sad, angry, depressed, suicidal, hopeless. But it's also OK to be happy, to feel joy, to feel calm. It's ok to look back on your time with him fondly. 

Deal with this on your own time. Don't let other people try to tell you how to grieve. These things take time, especially for an intensely traumatic loss like this.

Two thoughts: in the short term, it seems like you may want to call a crisis line or go to the hospital. I dont know what experiences youve had with inpatient so not trying to force it on you but sometimes we are just not able to resist the urges and a safe environment can help. 
Another thought is that you may want to get a lockbox for your gf to put her meds in so you can't impusively take them. You also probably should make a crisis survival plan with your gf so you can talk about how to deal with these urges and what support she feels able to give you.

My first mushroom experience was amazing. It was a little mild, apparently, but its was probably one of the greatest experiences in my life. I felt so connected to the universe, I felt such clarity, I felt incredibly light.

My second and third mushroom experiences were NOT good. We think that the type we had were different and more potent than the first time, even though I had the same ration. I couldnt stand, I had to be taken care of. My brain was overwhelmed by signals coming from all over my body, like stand up, sit down, breath, stop, go pee, talk, drink, lie down, all at the same time every second. The second time I had extreme issues with my vision - not hallucinations per se, but literally like my brain was not receiving light input from my eyes, I was blinded just by never ending swirls and colours, like when you close your eyes but more intense. At one point, i opened my eyes, and my vision was swirling and refracted like a kaleidoscope, but instead of colours, in each refracted had an eye looking back at me, and it wasnt any old eye, by MY OWN eye. After I recovered I was sad to discover my (now ex) boyfriend had been off in the party having one of the best trips of his life. I had hoped we would enjoy the experience together, but seems my body just couldnt handle it.

A lot of experienced people told me its probably because my first experience was before the trauma that triggered my PTSD, and that you have to be in a very emotionally stable place to avoid a bad trip. It hasnt stopped me from wanting to do mushrooms again, that first time was just magical for me. But I do think I need to be a loooooot better before thats going to happen again.",BPD_whut,6ebdji

I would drink when we had problems and he used to (and I am sure still does) drink a lot too so that didn't help stopping to drink myself. 

Other good tipps might be to just drink something else instead like tea. You could get some fancy stuff from a tea shop and then it might feel special and nice to drink instead. Other thing is when you drink alone then you might be lonely and maybe you should start to get out of the loneliness to get aways from alc. Or you do it because you need to relax and should find other things to relax you like painting, hot shower when you come home, nice music, painting...

Well, MDMA and BPD are a bit of a weird mix, because it's like a 50% time you can have a good night and avery easy come down, or have a good-ok-confusing night with the worst come down imaginable where you'll just feel suicidal in a couple of days time and probably stay feeling a bit shitty for the rest of the week. It depends on how much seratonin your brain makes, how much mdma you take and also if you have outside circumstances that might trigger you into feeling more depressed than usual. I find MDMA is the diciest drug for me to take so I don't anymore. And MDMA comes in pills, mixed with lots of other crap.

I dunno what to say to you, because people have different responses to pills, and its the after effects, the depression, the morning light, that can really fuck you over. So no, I don't think 5 hours of dancing and feeling loved up is worth that anymore..",LittleChaotic,5ew5wv

Sure marijuana legal in my state now, but its still federally illegal and a lot of jobs (decent ones) do random drug testing. Which usually detects the weakest, safest one of all! (Marijuana) Now how am I suppose to hold a job when the very substance that would help me do my job and function in society is the one that is drug tested for! I even have a perscription for it for darn sake and that wouldnt even help if I ever was tested positive on a random drug test.

0,"First, can you describe the cluster of symptoms that you're referring to as a hypomanic episode?  People can be referring to a wide variety of things when they say this.  It's particularly difficult with BPD, because emotional dysregulation is a symptom of BPD, but it's a very different sort of emotional dysregulation than the sort that is seen in bipolar spectrum disorders.  You can certainly have both BPD and bipolar disorder, but you could also just be experiencing symptoms of BPD that are being exacerbated by medication.

Experiencing symptoms consistent with hypomania would be a paradoxical reaction to an antipsychotic medication like Abilify, which is normally used to treat such symptoms.  Of course, there are people who do indeed experience paradoxical reactions (a reaction to a medication which is the opposite of what would be expected), but this is a very rare occurrence.",Rain12913,1j6783

I was also able to function on much less sleep; I could bounce out of bed at 6am after only 3 or 4 hours sleep. I also experienced some of the 'speeding up' associated with mania (thinking, speaking too quickly). It felt amazing after the debilitating depression I had succumbed to only weeks before.  It also ended up putting me in emerg though, since it caused my body to overheat to a dangerous degree whenever I exerted myself. I was off it before the crash happened, thank god. 

If mania is drug-induced, I am not sure if that makes you bi-polar. My guess would be that it does not. ",bpd_princess,1j6783
2,"Personally sometimes I feel the things you have described below to another poster. LOTS of energy, needing to constantly do something, etc etc. But then I often feel really low after that, sometimes suicidal.

However the difference is that I knew that the low was going to happen - it didn't stop me feeling happy and laughing histerically at things others may just chuckle at, but throughout feeling really high, I was aware that I was going to crash...

This was not drug induced, and is a familiar thing that I deal with as a part of my BPD. The high's only last for less than a day normally, a day at the most, but I know/feel that it's often/probably going to end in a really bad low. I think that the really bad low is actually just a normal low, but because I have felt so good, it feels even worse than normal.

3,"Uh, I was put on an antidepressant and was cycling in between mania and deep depression. Later i was diagnosed as bipolar 2/ borderline personality disorder and when I was speaking with my psych she said almost all bipolar sufferers can't take antidepressants because they experience similar symptoms. That being said, Abilify is not a SSRI and from what I can see is used to treat bipolar disorder? If this is the case then chances are you are not bipolar but rather having adverse side effects to medication. ",clover92,1j6783

7,"I personally don't see cannabis as a drug, I've grown up with it, my parents have smoked it every single day I've been alive. I've been smoking since I was 14, I've even had a year off and I was in the worst place ever for that year. To me alcohol is totally normalised in society even though it's far more evil than weed, I mean it is literally poison. I know weed isn't right for everyone but for me I don't see it as a problem that it calms me down. What's worse, feeling suicidal, smoking a J and being instantly happy or just ending up self harming? 

I'll look for links later but I read a study that said that cannabis is the only medication that works for BPD, which I completely agree with. If you see cannabis consumption as a problem then it becomes that way, but I don't see a problem with it. I embrace that I have BPD and I embrace that cannabis helps me, remember it was the American government that demonised weed, our ancestors have consumed it forever, weed is a human being's right, it's the ultimate pain killer, it's better for you than most other substances (especially if you eat it), it helps my dad's arthritis/hypermobility, it helps us all wind down and to me a smoke is way better than a drink. Weed makes me wonder about the universe, alcohol makes me wonder if I should take my own life.

I know it's hard not being okay without drugs, but would you tell someone with cancer to stop taking their meds? Society had told us it's fine to take drugs to help our bodies, but for some reason it's not okay to take them for our minds. I mean would you tell someone with MS to stop smoking weed even though it's the only thing that takes the pain away? What about those children who have to take cannabis every single day to stop their fits? There is nothing wrong with getting stoned to help you, most people are on something, at least weed is natural. ",,aanovh

0,"Microdosing is when you take very small quantities of a psychedelic like mushrooms or LSD every day for a few days or weeks. So small of a dose that you don't get any visuals or feel anything. If you're tripping you're not microdosing. Apparantly it can help with things like depression and migraines.

I don't know if it could help with BPD. I know with my BPD I have experienced psychosis before, so psychedelics are probably a bad idea even in small amounts. Microdosing can intensify things like anxiety and mania which could potentially throw me into psychosis if I get too stressed out. If you ever hear sounds/voices that aren't there or hallucinate things out of the corner of your eyes when you're stressed out, it could intensify that and make you uncomfortable.

If you do try it, microdosing or not, try to use it when you're in a good mood and in a comfortable environment. With someone who can make sure you're doing okay. Like don't microdose before a job interview or something lol. Mushrooms can be fun if you take them normally, I tried them once when I was younger and had a good time.

1,"I use them to escape my feelings and thoughts, or to help me regulate them, I guess. Used to be just alcohol for a long time, and that especially was more about ""killing"" negative feelings. Like feeling depressed/anxious/heartbroken? Just drink until it goes away! (Spoiler alert, it would always come back even harder the next day). Also an easy way to avoid loveliness - just go drinking, and you don't have to be alone with your thoughts! But at some point it started getting old and I internalized it was just making it worse, so I toned it down a lot.
Then I discovered weed, mdma and psychedelics. I would not say I abuse psychedelics tho, I use them quite infrequently and you can't really escape negative thoughts with them - they will find you. So I only use them in a good mindset. Been quite therapeutical actually. Same with mdma, I mean that one I have used just to escape negativity sometimes, but again, quite infrequently, and that too has helped me learn a bit more about myself.

Now weed, on the other hand...Yes, I smoke pretty much daily. Basically because it makes me so much less anxious, helps me think more positively, calms me down. Should I learn to deal with emotions without it? Yes. Do I sometimes use it to avoid difficult issues? Probably yeah. But I'm not really worried, because I kind of believe it's just a phase, like alcohol.

I guess, but I’ve been hiding it from everyone in my life for so long and it gives me constant and chronic anxiety to the point where I dissociate when I’m not doing my thing, it’s like a cycle of “oh my god I feel so alive” “I can’t tell anyone” “oh my god, they know” “Thank god they didn’t find out, never again” “I need it”… I feel like the most debilitating symptom of BPD is the constant feeling of emptiness, never being content in urself or your thoughts, and always looking for some way to make yourself feel good. it’s like my FP is my addiction and I hate it cuz I know if I tell anyone my whole life would fall apart cuz no one would understand but not telling them also feels like it’s killing me… anyways the best thing that I can suggest is that if it’s a substance, find a primary care doctor who has good reviews when it comes to being compassionate to women and addicts, and make an appointment and be completely honest, ask what they think your next steps should be and hopefully they can direct you somewhere or to someone good! (I would say avoid going straight to rehab cuz there’s a lot of bad ones who just take your money, treat you like shit, and kick you out when insurance is done paying for it) best of luck!

You should take another appointment listing clearly to you doc all the side effects you have, you do not have to suffer through this. Doc don't typically give methadone because it feels ""nicer"", therefore it's easier to sell and most first treatment are subuxone and all...

1,Suboxone is basically methadone and naloxone together which is probably why you're feeling so on edge. I never got into heroin (mostly because it was all laced with fentanyl in my area and people were dropping like flies) but I know the purpose of both methadone and suboxone is to help you get off opiates all together. How long has it been since you started suboxone? Have you considered starting to wean off it if you can't get methadone prescribed? ,princess_angst,66jih5
2,"I have 1 side effect, dry mouth. @12mg. I take melatonin for sleep.  Advice: Take your story and rewrite it to benefit you. You probably made the best decisions you could in the situation you were in. Accept that, but now it's time to change. You feeling like shit after being unjustifiably angry is a good sign, you have a conscience. So stop the 'black and white thinking', no one is all good or all bad (exception: nazi's and sjw's). At your stage, sorting out one 'drug' affect's from another is harder, you have biology/upbringing/social etc. all these factors can interact. For instance, I've had depression since age 11, at 15 I tried weed - hated it. But my first taste of an opiate - wow - that made me normal. No other drug did that, until suboxone. (Look up mu and kappa receptors.) Once suboxone was in place, it enabled me to dig deep in my psyche (dbt) without the need to use, or making me bed ridden with the subsequent depression, etc.; my emotional self could mature, going through the 5 stages of grief, (and a shit ton of other things) accepting other portions of life and adopting healthier behavior in place. I had stopped suboxone at one point (insurance), and realized my anger while on it was actually my depression when I was off. The suboxone could be regulating other parts, enabling your full development. I always got stuck on depression. That's my theory with me. I hope you find it helpful. Look up ACE score for trauma, Johann Hari on addiction, Linehan for DBT, and come to accept the medical fields are composed of mostly average intelligent people running machines the higher intelligent people invented. Trial and error is key. It's a marathon. oh and I never tried methadone, too much work.",fuwockmen,66jih5
3,"False. Suboxone has nothing to do with Methadone. It is Buprenorphine and Naloxone together.

4,"My bad. They're both synthetic opioids (methadone and buprenorphine) which is why I got them mixed up but I guess my point was that suboxone would cause further irritability with the added naloxone.

Recently for me its all been edibles, as acid and shrooms are pretty hard to come by for me right now. But im liking the edibles because it still gives you a kind of psychedelic thought process and that's what's been getting my head going and thinking about all this identity stuff.

I use a dry herb vaporizer so I’m able to save up the cooked weed to make edibles. The come up definitely has me feeling much different than actually smoking or vaping it. I couldn’t put it to words, it’s a certain feeling surrounding your very state of being almost.

2,"Just a heads up edibles can be waaaaaaaaay more potent. I use to work in cannabis for Years, and it's my special interest. 

Not saying go try it again or anything, but edibles typically isn't the best route, as it can be wildly inconsistent. And for new users it can be VERY overwhelming.

If you ever tried it again, doing a tincture (similar to an edibles feel, but you can be way more specific with a dose) and go for one that is mostly CBD and a touch of Thc. 

Cbd helps to minimize the effects of thc, Giving a much more comfortable experience.

And with tinctures, you can get to the exact MG. Edibles even tho most places are tested now, Grey/black market or legal market (in Canada, I can not speak for other places), they still can be inconsistent. 
And when you have an edible, it is metabolized similar yes, but like a comment below, it is quicker. There is less for the body to break down because it is not a whole gummy or cookie or whichever. 

So in and out of the body quicker. It's a much more reliable testing method to find what works for the consumer. 

Ultimately cannabis interacts with everybody differently, cannabis is not ment for everyone.

Starting with higher cbd  to wake up the endocannabinoid system (apart of our nervous system that allows interaction with cannabjs), and slowly adding thc in there to see how it works. 

Most people do not need that much thc at all. But the cannabis market sells alot of high potency because building a tolerance happens rather quickly if someone consumes everyday.  

I hope that clarified my thought process a little more! 🙂",thelittlegingerfairy,15ee6g6

That's the beauty of willpower - it only runs out if you allow it to do so.

The thing to question here is, what is it about a couple drinks that gives you that perspective shift? Is it a feeling of calm? Is that from the chemical effect of the alcohol, or is the act of getting yourself a drink and indulging in a favorite ritual?

Is it because you feel detached from your reality and can briefly see things from a less emotional viewpoint?

In my personal experience, most remedies for emotional issues are salves more than they are solutions. An SSRI will dampen your emotional spectrum, but it is not going to make you feel happy, and it will not stop you from feeling sad. A drink can help you relax, but you'll never really be able to drink enough to forget. Even moving on to more powerful drugs, at absolute best you have a temporary transient escape, and by the time you are sober, the ball is back in your court and you have to deal with it.

I'd step back and try not to look at dealing with your issues as an attempt at curing them. That is a path to disappointment. Look at it as an attempt at making them better. 

Additionally, I would recommend looking into meditation. As a drug addict, its been one of the most helpful things for me. With practice, it has become an increasingly helpful tool in quieting a lot of my internal turmoil and obsessive thoughts, and I believe this is due in part to the requirement that one be actively working with that internal struggle. To ingest a chemical is a passive activity - you wait for the drug to take hold and render its effects, to which you eventually grow accustomed and receive diminished relief.

When you meditate, you have to work at observing and handling your emotional/mental state, and after feeling calmer, you have the potential to be more mindful of your situation. Its at this point it becomes much easier to say something like ""things will work out, its not that big of a deal, I am going to be ok"". 

That's the hardest part, because that is where you start to grow and change yourself.",,3gid0r

Plus they send you a thick booklet asking you to explain, in 5000 words, why you are sick.

However, to someone who is intimate with the substance, I think it's safe to say that they KNOW that it's just a temporary relief in the same way taking something for a headache or an ulcer may only provide temporary relief for an underlying problem.

Unfortunately.  I can very rarely control that indulgence and while I'm certainly not an alcoholic.  I binge drink excessively and I have problems with that lifestyle, as well as things that occasional result from it.

edit: I'd like to further add that it really seems to bring me up to par with myself.  If that makes sense.  It helps me to be the me that I feel I SHOULD be, or WOULD BE, if I wasn't so.....off.

Things got out of hand when i was in senior year in highschool and things weren’t going as well as planed. I thought if im not gonna reach my goals i might as well die.

2020 was supposed to be my last year in uni. But again, shit went south in the last stretch. I started mixing benzos and opioids while exploring psychedelics.

All for ODs, some of them aimed for death, others i think i just got addicted to the feeling of almost dying and then getting saved.

I work the steps, have a sponsor, am a sponsor, and I have developed a relationship with a higher power in which I've learned to surrender. Most of the time.

I love how the term addiction applies here, and I'm always relived when I see others take this seriously. My sister and mom are (were) addicted to drugs and alcohol and struggled with addiction most of their lives. As a teen, I got hard into drugs and then somehow got out of it when I became an adult. I always wondered how I was able to escape the grip of addiction when I would regularly drink to puking, crush and snort anything I could get my hand son, and include ""getting high"" as my number 1 item on my list of hobbies. Then it was brought to my attention that I didn't escape addiction, I just replaced my addition with something else - love, or the illusion of it. My life has been a series of failed relationships because men could never fill the void that was in me. I still struggle with it. Currently, I'm in a relationship with a man who will not enable my sickness, and so sometimes he comes off as cold. But I truly know that he is just looking to do what's best for me and for the relationship. I think this is the first time I've ever actually felt love for someone else. And I know it to be true, because in the past I would quickly look for someone else to give me the attention I want and then hop into another relationship. I am finding out that real love is painful at times. It's sticking with someone even when things aren't roses and rainbows. It's sometimes giving what you don't want to give, and accepting things as they are and not what I wish them to be. It's loving myself enough to know what I will and will not accept from someone else, and then sticking to it.

Thanks so much for this post and for the reading recommendations. I am going to look into each and every one of these books. Finding out that love isn't what I thought was devastating.

I'm in a scene full of mental health issues, addiction, and dysfunction. I can tell you how this spirals but you know this. Personally when I get hooked on something I quit because addiction (like you're in the middle of) is boring. And you know the episode you're going through is going to throw you into some rough water - you've given this a lot of thought.

I've seen this go so bad. I've seen prescription abuse lead to suicide. I've save people from heroin overdoses. I've seen people die from them. I've helped people kick. If you ever need to talk I understand.

Obviously you know you've got to go back to therapy and stabilize. Whether you're ready to do that or not is up to you. But addiction runs a slippery slope that leads to some real shit if you can't function and that's what you have to figure out. If you're not ready to totally quit you need to find a way to function.

You've got options. It sounds like you can't have a casual relationship with drugs. It also sounds like you're holding people in respect you shouldn't  - junkies, even the artistic ones, are pathetic deep in their habit. I know, I'm still horribly in love with one of them. You're in the thick of it. I'm going to say kick and dial back if you can't totally give it up. I would not advise detoxing into a K-hole but I've also never known anyone who's tried it.

1,"hey there, I’m sorry you’re having a rough time rn :( one important thing to do rn is to remind yourself that you are crossfaded, your feelings are absolutely valid but you’re not in your right mind, not thinking as clearly and balanced as you do when you are sober. 

I used to get cross-faded most nights and I remember how easily it would lead me into a negative spirals of thought, exacerbate my black and white thinking. I’d mentally attack myself, tear myself apart and it was awful. 

One thing that really helped me was reminding myself that I don’t have to give all my thoughts equal weight. We don’t have to believe all of our thoughts, some of them untrue or just plain stupid. I would think about all the ridiculous things I’ve seen people say or do while intoxicated and tell myself: “what makes what I’m thinking rn any different? I’m not some magical person who can get high and not have their thinking affected” sometimes it helps to give those thoughts a stupid voice in your head, one that’s easier to disregard. 

And I don’t mean to imply that your concerns are nonsense, just that you don’t have the ideal perspective on them rn. When it’s really hard to let go of a line of thinking, I’d tell myself “I’m going to put a bookmark in this idea. If I want to consider it further, I can when I’m sober.” 

I second paying attention to how you feel when using. When you’re ready to change your relationship to a substance/substances, one place to start is to think of it as an experiment. Try a lower dose or not mixing drugs and see how it makes you feel. This is what really helped me, because I found that I actually felt better when I did less, and just kinda naturally stopped using a lot of the shit I was doing. You’re not alone in this. There are SO MANY PEOPLE, who have struggled with substances, at all points on the journey, and connecting yourself to those communities and even just seeing how many other people have had this experience will give you strength. 

Hollywood idealizes and glorifies romantic love, we’re programmed our whole lives to think that romantic love is going to save us, it’s THE ANSWER, the most important thing, and the only source of life-long happiness. This simply isn’t true. While romantic love is wonderful and beautiful, there are so many other types of love we can experience...self-love, familial love, love for friends, love for community, love of nature, love for a higher power, love for pets, love for what we do, love for a hobby or a passion. If you’re looking for romance, go for it! You will find it. But be open to other channels of love, support, intimacy, and contentment. 

Please take care of yourself...take a hot shower, make some food, drink water, get really cozy, turn on some music or your favorite TV. Sending some warm n fuzzy vibes ur way!

I didn't hear from her for 9 days.

She contacted me and asked how my head space was. I told her it managed, my myself (go me) to make an emergency appt with a psychiatrist and a psychologist who specialises in suicide. The appointments were coming up in a few days and I was going to wait and see. I can always kill myself after if there's no real help. It was a long back-and-forth conversation in which she became passive aggressive, then just aggressive. I stayed calm and was trying to explain my truth as I understood it. I was very sick and my truth was probably not rational but it was still my truth. I was going to try hard  and I'd reached out to professionals with no support from anyone and that, to my mind, proved that I was looking to give myself a chance.

She eventually told me to stop wasting the psych's time and just go ahead and do it.

I want you to really understand how fucking lucky you are to have that person's unwavering support in the face of your overt emotional suffering and the hopeless coming from you. It's so important to have someone who's got your back no matter how hopeless and irrational you might feel.

Please don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you should be okay because you have support. Support isn't the cure and we still can suffer. I just wanted to point out what no support looks like.

4,"Cannabis is amazing for this. The problem is - you can't always be high. I also have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) which causes me to feel constipated all day long regardless of how much 'comes out'. Sometimes if you smoke, it will stop the convulsions in your intestines, which causes you to feel and be more constipated. Because when you have IBS, I hate to sound graphic, but you poo based on colon spasms. In other words, you are constantly running back and forth to the bathroom. If I smoke before I 'eliminate' in the morning, I stay constipated the whole day until the next day because the muscles don't flex in my intestines because they are calmed by the weed. 

Its not really common for most people, but for me, my BP is triggered by physical pain and physical irritability often. Including not getting enough sleep, food, feeling physically ill or fatigued, etc... so sometimes I have a BP rage episode before I ever have time to smoke before it happens as soon as I wake up (because I didn't sleep or because there was noise irritating me while I was trying to sleep).

If I was high 24/7 I'd probably be way better at maintaining relationships, but I'd be broke, fat, and too laid back to really accomplish anything. Weed used to motivate me a lot, but now that I've gotten older and my BPD is overwhelming, weed just makes me too tired to do any more than sit at the computer. I am in a disassociate/in-denial/psychotic irritability and rage phase for most of the day which drains all my energy and appetite.

Just knowing I had the capacity to feel that way was so encouraging to me.
Of course this was a lucky experience with good quality drugs and I've never had a bad  comedown either so I know not everyone will have the same experience.

1,"What is odd to me as that I never thought is was normal up until recovery, but I kinda did, you know?. I thought of it sort like a Dickens novel in a way, that lives were based on breeding. My sisters, the ones close to my age, got out from under eventually, 4, 5, and 6 years ago respectively. They were all meth addicts themselves, dad dies of a heroin overdose 15 years ago. But eventually they got help. 

The one sister works 60-70 hours a week in a factory to keep busy, the other does 40 as a janitor and has a high functioning SO, both got partial custody of their kids back. My mother made AA/NA her whole social life, she does 2 meetings every day, all her friends are there. I was quieter with it, no drugs, I never worked and moved often, but it was less apparent how messed up my life was, so I didn't do anything to change. But things got worse and it all culminated in my first real suicide attempt, which is when I moved back to the old home town and sought therapy. 

For so many years I just thought I was inherently different. This crap was all so normal in my social environment. Sure, I wanted the jobs and families and good normal folk have, but it was like they were from a different planet. I was the quiet one who just was there, but drug addicts, drunks, criminals, people with psychosis, untreated girls with BPD whose lives were the most insane messes you can imagine, this was my peer group. 

I thought it was normal. Not entirely, but I really thought some were born into one class or another, and that's just the way it was. The things I have experienced and seen, the chaos, bad deaths, all of it, I was numb to it for so long. Now I am in treatment, and how messed up it all is is becoming real to me. Now I have real possibilities, real hope for the future, and I just don't want this shit no more. I am no longer young, I get so tired these days. I am decided, I have to go partial NC with my uncle, 

I love him, but he is 60 and I do not think he can change or wants to any longer. I will give my younger sister a couple years, she is young and has suffered terrible things, she deserves it. But despite her feeling that she cannot be helped and is worthless, at some point she has to work to get help, I will guide her as best I can, hold her hand through it if I must, but I am not doing this forever. I can with a few years work have things, drive a car, work steadily, eventually get a 2 year college degree. 

I can and will do it, and I believe she can as well. But she has to let me help her find help. Because I realize now this isn't normal, or right, and I just don't want it anymore. I have enough crazy stories to last 10 lifetimes, none of it is interesting or shocking or fun anymore, it hasn't been in a long time. I just want something decent, to be better. If others want to die screwing around, hustling, living the life and playing the fool, so be it. But I am done with it. I intend to have something, be something. Maturing is insanely hard, but it is grow up or die, and I am growing up, after so very long. Thank you for the kind words, it honestly help.

I know it's detrimental to my mental health, but in the back of my mind I know I'll want to blow off some steam again partying or drinking. I realize that I have been losing a lot of my hobbies now. It sounds so ridiculous to admit these things and still say I want to keep letting loose. The longest I've abstained from drinking was 6 months and life felt...boring.

The other big problem is that once you start taking it, it's extremely hard to stop. If I miss a single dose, I'm crashing by 11am and almost always end up spiraling and splitting. The day after I miss a dose, I struggle to even get out of bed.

A few months ago there was a shortage and the pharmacy couldn't refill my Rx, so I went almost 3 weeks without it... by the 2nd week I was randomly sobbing almost every day, and was nearly suicidal by the time they got a new shipment. It's basically speed, so that withdrawal is no joke.

To prove you don’t have to do what your mind tells you, hold your cell in your hand and walk around while saying out loud, “I’m not holding my cell.” Over and over a few times until you realize you are defying what you’re saying and thinking. You’re thinking what you’re saying but thoughts aren’t facts and that’s a way to stop the compulsion and do something else. I have lists of healthy coping tools to choose from instead of my negative whatever of the day that I’m almost sucked into…like walk my dog, take a hot bath or shower, cold one too, yoga, drink water, journal, paint, go outside into nature and sit or google healthy habits and find some you’d like. Feelings and compulsions are temporary like everything else and they pass. Then defy those thoughts and do the opposite and something else you found that’s healthy. One habit at a time; not all at once or you’ll get overwhelmed. When you get a grasp on the things you listed, make another stickie to remind you that you can’t go back to the unhealthy coping skills just because you get healthy. We have to stay with the healthy ones and in the process of doing this, stop the self-defeating talk and begin saying “I can” and let go of the doubt. You can!

But something I find crucial to a meaningful life is having an activity that you really enjoy doing that takes a bit of concentration and builds a skill. If you don’t already have one, experiment with random shit until you find it. Don’t be afraid of being bad at it. You will get good by doing it.

Making music, writing and painting are the things I can get lost in. Other examples could be nature walks, martial arts or dance, reading, gardening, any kind of art. Is there any activity you’ve always wanted to try? Try to find something that makes you feel excited.

After working on something fulfilling and meaningful, my soul feels refreshed. This dopamine reward isn’t so short-lived or like a drug high. Bonus- it builds self confidence.

It's why it is commonly used as a sedative in hospitals (where the administered dose induces a hole), and is actually commonly used on children because their bodies handle it better than general anesthesia.

Most people become addicted to the feeling- really sounds like something I’d love to argue as being medically necessary or beneficial to someone with BPD- you’re literally making shit worse but pop off with your excuses. Ketamine IN SMALL DOSES is being used to treat some clinical depressive disorders … but CERTAINLY not in doses high enough to create the K hole experience. 



“One of the risks of falling into a k-hole is that you may have difficulty coming out of the state of dissociation—meaning you may continue to feel disconnected from the world around you and from your life, and you may develop ongoing symptoms of psychosis.3﻿”

Elevated blood pressure
Increased heart rate
Limited awareness of the surrounding environment
Loss of coordination
Nausea and/or vomiting
Short-term memory loss

68,"ugh… so dim, let’s unpack this

first of all, 

—- I’m accusing you of spreading dangerous misinformation because you’re claiming that microdosing ketamine is a good idea ——

it’s the fastest way to addiction. 
Of course your depression anxiety, impulsivity and whatever else you’re dealing with goes away if you’re just high all the time lmao.

ffs, it’s the most literal example of creating a *DEPENDENCE* on something by using it as a crutch, one can think of. 

*you’re telling people to take ketamine like vitamins* 

The amounts used in ketamine infusion clinics, *are by no means a microdose* the fact that you didn’t even do basic research about quantities and effects of ketamine and how it works, tells me you’re clueless, no idea why you feel you need to misinform people.

the reason those clinics offer infusions of bigger doses at a set and falling frequency, is because of the *afterglow* that ketamine offers, which may last days, weeks or even months depending on the person.
*The point of the treatment is not to keep you high so you don’t feel your problems but to rewire your brain.*

I never understand why people like you try to defend a misinformed opinion instead of learning something. 

Regarding the k-hole, *it is* ego death. 
and just like the ego death you can experience on psychedelics, it’s quite a shock to your system and may have positive or negative effects on you depending on who you are. 
Mine was wildly positive, never felt a pull to go through it again.

educate yourself. stop spreading dangerous bullshit desperate people might try and hurt themselves.",Smoltingking,n3xw2e

Then I love them, then I hate them, then I love them. It is exhausting.
