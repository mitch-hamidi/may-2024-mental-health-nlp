0,"Dbt does nothing for me. The problem I have with those sort of things is that It doesn’t matter how much I plan and make strategies when I’m level headed. When I get triggered and enter an episode everything becomes unavailable to me and I will not allow myself to help myself, I want to make myself suffer as much as possible when I feel like that so any sort of self help stuff just doesn’t cut it",,16jhp3f
1,"I've come a long way since my teens but I still have issues on a daily basis with BPD and I think I will for the rest of my life. Even if I got to the stage of not meeting the criteria I think I'd still meet a couple and they would have an impact. Maybe I have something else too because my BPD has calmed down a lot over the years but now I'm avoidant instead. I don't work, I rarely go out, the way I'm able to manage myself is to try to reduce contact with others. I've been in and out of therapy for 20 years. For me, I find the posts about no longer having BPD really invalidating. I'm happy for someone who has improved so much they don't meet the criteria but as far as I'm concerned even if I improve as much as I can I will always struggle with my mental health to some extent and I will always be neurodivergent. I will never be normal. I'm not saying this to be defeatist and maybe I possibly have something else too, autism or ADHD, I don't know. I try to make the best of my life and I try not to be miserable.",Selkie32,16jhp3f
2,"DBT helped me in some ways, a lot. But my ""cure"" is being as close to an actual hermit as possible. It allows me to sometimes interact with people like an actual human - pleasant (I think), rational, and all that. 
I'm on several meds including quitiapine (sp?). They help, I guess? But not interacting with people has been the best.",ParkerFree,16jhp3f
3,"Personally I feel DBT is just kinda condescending to someone w bpd. It has never ever addressed issues for me and seems like the therapist is just charging me for me to do everything myself. I am mindful, my problem is that I’m hyperaware. I really wish better options for therapy for BPD are made available.",666wife,16jhp3f
4,"This may be controversial, but IMO I’ve always felt like DBT is a therapists lazy way out. It feels like I’m doing their job for them. For me it’s extremely hard to receive and process treatment in a school-like teaching method/setting. One on one is what gives me the most BPD breakthroughs, by far.",Prestigious_Mud5382,16jhp3f
5,I’m with you. DBT doesn’t address the core issues,u_can_feel_my_bicep,16jhp3f
6,"In the UK they give us DBT and CAT for it. CAT is meant to target more trauma based issues, but honestly it didn't do a lot. It took me ages to open up about anything and I didn't get a chance to talk about half of what I've been through. I don't even know if there's a type of therapy that will unlock or teach me anything about myself, in a deeper understanding. I had to take an assessment for BPD again last week, scoring 74/90. Compared to the first time I was assessed which was 73/90, it basically stayed the same- and I think the first was before dbt treatment compared to after. So it's the same on a day to day basis.

I'm being put back into DBT again and I don't know how much it'll work. I can do what I can to make my life easier. But I can't control that people genuinely don't care enough to check up on me, hold conversation with me, invite me anywhere. It can't change my life/work circumstances, my triggers, the agonizing numbness and shifting identity, my weird ""obsession""with needing to be validated. No amount of self validation can repair what has been done. It's just a way for me to filter the disorder into something digestible. Something needs to be explored as an avenue. I don't expect it to be cured, but I'm yet to be fully understood.",Worldly_Worry2149,16jhp3f
7,"wait there are people who “get over” BPD, like…. within a matter of years? I expect to be like this for decades to come and that’s the worst part",Peachntangy,16jhp3f
8,I’m about to start MBT. I’ve been asking to have DBT but been refused cos of “funding”. So been teaching myself the skills ahead of MBT. But my BPD is dormant when I’m single so I also don’t think my skills will be available to me should I choose to date again. But I’m hopeful MBT will help sort through some trauma,iwicctp_,16jhp3f
9,"I've had CBT shoved down my throat so many times and I got tired of telling them I don't feel it helps. Eventually they finally tried (a very little amount) of DBT and I stuck with the full sessions but was honest and said I don't feel it helps entirely - I've since looked more into DBT myself, I find some of the things helpful but it also really depends on the severity of the mood for me, too. They tell me I'm just not engaging??

I was also on the same meds but came off them for a while. I'm going back to my Drs next week though as I'm having a difficult time managing at the moment, which will probably refer me back to the same place and repeat the above-mentioned, but I'm saving for private therapy in the New Year as they offer more beyond CBT/DBT and work specifically with a lot of the problems I have/bpd and bipolar, and other neurospicy.",No_Communication896,16jhp3f

11,"I honestly also feel like relationships of any kind are way too triggering for me and it doesn't feel worth it unless it's casual (and even then, it still affects me). I've been in therapy for years and it's still so hard. But I've made slow progress.",Throwaway928466,16jhp3f

13,The hard part is that you will suffer until you are able connect. It is the connection to others that offers us the healing we need.,KenDurf,16jhp3f
14,"Yes! CBT and DBT didn’t end up helping me. If anything I looked up a lot of YouTube videos, podcasts, learned about personality types, human design, Meyers Briggs, astrology etc.

Whether it’s fake or not isn’t the point, but KNOWING these behaviors and things about people (fp, family, friends, so’s) I’ve found makes it so much easier to navigate relationships without taking their words and actions so personally, it helped get me to a viewpoint where I didn’t see myself as the center of their feelings",wontwatchtheprequels,16jhp3f
15,"I’m not the best person to ask when it comes to therapy as I have gone through 30 plus therapists (maybe more), but I’ve heard good things about EMDR and BPD.

I can’t say I don’t find DBT helpful yet as I haven’t been able to effectively go through therapy at all, which I suppose is being treatment resistant in some sense. But, I get the concept and I know what to do in emotionally charged situations, I just can’t stop myself, or make myself act “rationally” in that moment. DBT just seems obvious and silly to me. Like yeah, I would do all those things if I could. But who knows? I’ve never given it a real shot.

Like you said, avoiding close relationships, especially romantic ones is what I do. It’s lonely. Life is insanely tedious anyway, so having that romantic relationship to destabilize my life completely always adds some much needed excitement. So I’m either depressed and bored out of my mind and detached from society, or a psychotic and paranoid rage monster who’s life revolves around her boyfriend. 

I guess my advice would be to try different therapies. There are a lot. More unconventional ones. EMDR, hypnosis, AEDP, even like music and art therapy, who knows? I think it’s worth it to try if your only other option is to separate yourself from the world. I’m going to try to take my own advice.",,16jhp3f
16,Dbt has helped me quite a bit but of course I still struggle. Just like everything else in life it is what you make it and therapy is extremely hard work. It’s not going to magically cure you and it is just mostly teaching you coping skills which are up to you to implement which is so difficult when you are in distress! But I’ve managed to use my skills in distress and if you can just do it once it gets easier from there on out. Don’t give up,stellablue2142,16jhp3f
17,"I don’t necessarily think “untreatable”…I think more “inaccessible”. You said in another comment that the NHS only uses DBT, which is ridiculous to me. There is no therapy that is 100% across a population.

Schema therapy, EMDR, ACT etc can also help some people with BPD. Those of us who were “treatable” do still have a predisposition for BPD traits to surface, just not enough to meet diagnostic criteria",ReineDeLaSeine14,16jhp3f
18,"I've never tried DBT I'm trying to get my doctors to refer me for it, tbh I don't want to say there's no hope for me and i can't improve but yeah i agree with you about BPD being treatment resistant especially in my case, I've been on every antidepressant under the sun since i was idk 15 or 16 years old, I take Paroxetine and Propranolol, I've lost weight twice, I exercised every single day for 2 years straight, I've had a few free sessions of therapy here and there, went on a meditation app thing to try and help me sleep and cope with my anxiety which it didn't, tried making friends, having a social life, going to college, working a job all these things have only ever been a temporary stop gap in trying to deal with the emptiness inside me. I think it's because BPD is very misunderstood by doctors, I feel like treating things like bipolar and simple depression and anxiety are easier than BPD because there's more awareness of it and its easier to manage because with bipolar its highs and lows but with BPD it's highs, lows, nothingness, and all the stuff in between mood disorders are easier for doctors to understand and treat than personality disorders unfortunately. I went to a doctor a few months ago and asked him to put me on mood stabilisers and he refused he said they're only for people with bipolar. I guess it's about managing BPD but yeah it really annoys me when people make out that if you exercise, eat right and idk take up a hobby you're magically cured, I've had hobbies and they've fizzled out, I've had ideas, bursts of creativity, joined college courses and they've fizzled out the only thing I do as a hobby is write fan fiction and I'm 32 years old if that fizzles out like everything else I'll go back to feeling the gnawing crushing emptiness inside me and i can't bear the idea of it I'm doing everything I can to hold onto the TV show I write fan fiction about because apart from my bf, my sister, my sisters kids and my cat it's literally all i have in my life I have no friends, no job, no real goals or aspirations I'm brassic and barely hanging onto my house. But yeah BPD is complex to say the least and I don't believe people who say they're cured from it I'm sorry but i just don't I've had BPD since I was literally a child it's not something that randomly developed in my teens or 20s I was born into chaos, dysfunction and fear it was all i knew as a little girl so asking me to become normal like everyone else means I'd have to completely rewire my brain or turn back time and make sure I grew up in a nice normal family home instead of with a mother who was a mentally ill drug addict and alcoholic. I will try DBT because I'm at the end of my rope with struggling to cope with my moods but yeah as I said it's a complicated and misunderstood illness for sure there's no magic cure or pill and there's not a one size fits all for everyone. The problem is other people expecting you to cure yourself rather than accepting and wanting to help you it seems.",apurpleglittergalaxy,16jhp3f

20,"I'm on quite a treatment of alprazolam, escitaloprám, quetiapine, levomepromazine, and risperidone. And it still isn't enough. My body keeps on building tolerance and it's frightening to say the least. I've only been diagnosed a few weeks ago and I don't know what to expect yet. I haven't been started on any other behavioral treatments so I have little to say about that in terms of experience. But all I know is that my doctor keeps on upping my doses since I'm building tolerance quicker than the meds take effect.

In fact if I'd stayed in church when I was 14, I'd have not developed BPD. I was happy despite the abusive home.

31,"I can agree with this. I've also struggled for 20 years (probably more but it really hit in my teen years) and probable that I have ADHD too - trying to deal with the other things first before I try to figure that out as I'm fairly newly diagnosed. I've said to people this is who I am at this point, which to a degree feels defeatist but I've tried so many therapies, medications, stays, even outside methods to cope, etc over the years. While some things I do feel I have a better handle on, even than say a few years ago. I feel like some of my issues all I can do is try to minimise/try to cope with and just live the best I can and how I want now, not how others want. Which honestly? That's all I want at this point now.",No_Communication896,16jhp3f
32,"Being a lone wolf is also what works for me. I don’t even get lonely anymore. I like people in small doses, and never want to live with anyone again lol

Some of the DBT tricks I still use when I’m getting ragey (rare, usually work-related) like the cold water face splash, paced breathing, burst of high intensity exercise like running on the spot or doing some push ups. 

I like radical acceptance too but that’s for general life not crises mode. It reminds me of Buddhist philosophy and Stoicism. Helps avoid existential dread and being able to carry on when conditions are less than ideal

33,"My experience with DBT never addressed my issues either. It was basically just like...gaslighting yourself into believing you are always the problem in every situation and you have to set your own needs aside and be a doormat in order to make everyone else around you comfortable.

35,"From my POV you do DBT to stabilize first and then you do the trauma work. But you don’t do the trauma work without having done DBT because it’ll destabilize your already unstable life. Does that make sense? So for me (and yes I also don’t like parts of DBT and I hate that it’s pretty shaming when not practiced right) I’m doing about 2 years ish of DBT. This helped me stabilize  from getting fired, mood swings, interpersonal relationships falling apart, and what helped me honestly was not the individual therapy but the phone coaching. The in the moment ‘hey I am going to text my ex hookup rn and I know it’s wrong but I don’t care. What do I do?’ And getting the validation and skills in the moment changed my life. Group therapy combined with individual too. It’s comprehensive DBT that’s important and nowhere to be found but I got lucky. Then the goal is bc they only do a year but I asked for two lol but they don’t keep you there. After that they want you to do the trauma work and it should be better bc you’ll get answers and processing and if it dysregulates you - now you know how to take care of yourself in the moment.

38,"I feel deeply that one of the kinds of traumas that impacts developing BPD, besides neglect and abuse, is isolation trauma. Feeling connection to others and feeling part of a community are basic human needs, just like shelter or food, and we are constantly starving of it. Everybody is starving of it in the developed world, at least. But it affects us in a more severe way. Some people just become anxious or depressed. But we have the difference of being starved in that way almost to death as children as well. I think being neurodivergent from birth also impacts this. 



I thought everything would get better when I left home, but I feel like I just keep getting retraumatized again and again as an adult. I feel so alone all the time. It’s hard for me to eat, and one of the reasons is that I almost always eat alone now. Even with all the suffering growing up, I’d always eat a meal with someone else at least once a day.

She also accused me of not really wanting recovery. Which is true in a sense, but I want to want it, you know?

You have to wait minimum 2 years For most services. And that is jsut to get an assessment. I've spent more time waiting for therapy then i have in therapy. Overall I have waited 2/3 each time I have done dbt. So at least 6, at most 9. I waited 4 years to get adhd medication when I was already diagnosed. I have spent most of my life since I was 15, on waiting list not getting any support. Then 6minths-year tops in therapy at a time.

So if you think that grass looks greener cool. But dont compare us and uk. I never said us care was better. I jsut said I cannot afford private. People think bc we can access free health care it's great here. But you literally dont know the shambles of the nhs, how fucked it is.

58,"> In DBT, three primary states  of mind are presented: “reasonable mind,” “emotion mind,” and “wise mind” (Section III). A person  is in reasonable mind when he or she is approaching knowledge intellectually; is thinking rationally  and logically; attends only to empirical facts; and  ignores emotion, empathy, love, or hate in favor of  being planful, practical, and “cool” in approaching  problems. Decisions and actions are controlled by  logic. The person is in emotion mind when thinking and behavior are controlled primarily by current  emotional states. In emotion mind, cognitions are  “hot”; reasonable, logical thinking is difficult; facts  are amplified or distorted to be congruent with current affect; and the energy of behavior is also congruent with the current emotional state.

>Wise mind is the synthesis of emotion mind and  reasonable mind; it also goes beyond them: Wise  mind adds intuitive knowing to emotional experiencing and logical analysis. In Mindfulness-Based  Cognitive Therapy, two other states of mind are  also discussed: “doing mind” or “doing mode”  and “being mind” or “being mode.”5 Doing mind  focuses on getting things done. It is multitasking,  task-­oriented, and driven. In contrast, being mind is  “nothing-to-do” mind, where the focus is on experiencing rather than doing. These two states of mind  are relevant to DBT mindfulness skills, because wise  mind can also be considered as a synthesis of doing  mind and being mind.

>Radical openness, the concept at the foundation of RO DBT, is a way of behaving. But it is also a state of mind informed by the central premise that emotional well-being involves the confluence of three features: openness, flexibility, and social connectedness. As a state of mind, radically open living involves actively seeking our personal unknown in order to learn from an ever-changing environment. Radical openness also enhances relationships because it models humility and the willingness to learn from what the world has to offer. As such, radical openness often requires us to sacrifice our firmly held convictions and self-constructs—and this is why the practice of radical openness can be painful.

>The therapist teaches twelve questions from Flexible Mind ADOPTS that are used to assess whether to accept or decline critical feedback and encourages the client to practice using them when feeling criticized (weeks ten to twelve).
The therapist informally teaches Flexible Mind REVEALs skills, with a particular emphasis on “pushback” and “don’t hurt me” responses, and uses this to facilitate targeting indirect social signaling on the diary card (weeks thirteen to seventeen).
The therapist discusses the importance of personal self-disclosure in developing relationships, practices Match + 1 skills from Flexible Mind ALLOWS in session, and assigns related homework (weeks eleven to eighteen).
The therapist introduces the concept of forgiveness and informally teaches how to grieve a loss using Flexible Mind HEART skills (weeks thirteen to twenty-four).

>Psychological health or well-being in RO DBT is hypothesized to involve three core transacting features:

>1. Receptivity and Openness to new experience and disconfirming feedback in order to learn.
>2. Flexible-control in order to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
>3. Intimacy and social-connectedness (with at least one other person) based on premises that species survival required capacities to form long-lasting bonds and work in groups

Source: https://www.radicallyopen.net/about-ro-dbt/

In a nutshell, DBT focuses on developing the Wise Mind so we can make better choices guided by both our logic and our emotions. RO DBT focuses on developing the Flexible Mind, which means re-wiring the rigidity in thinking that makes disorders of overcontrol alienate others and people who suffer it unable to easily adapt to changing environments.

74,"No, qBPD is a subtype meaning we manifest more than 5 traits to satisfy the diagnostic criteria. The difference is in the expression of self-destructive coping strategies. 

People with qBPD tend to express their painful feelings inwards — meaning we get angry at ourselves and want ourselves to die. We think if we didn't exist in the first place, the world would be a lot better off and we wouldn't have to experience all the hurt.

The other subtypes tend to express their painful feelings outwards or by ""acting out"" such as throwing objects, wrecking cherished objects, or snapping/lashing out at others *before* feeling guilty and wanting to stop the painful existence. 

This does not mean that people with qBPD will not manifest their painful feelings outwards. I know I have. It's just not the usual operational process, if that makes sense.

I think it's the same with bpd. Everyone with bpd fits the diagnostic criteria in some way. But there are so many combination of symptoms, so many different ways in how it affects someone's life, that eventhough it's not yet in the diagnostic criteria, it very much is a thing.

Then there seems to be an issue of miscommunication there, not an issue of personhood. Quiet/Discouraged BPD is a subtype. Everything can be explained to the client and spelled out especially the controversial relationship of clinical psychologists with the DSM-V for the past decade.

Here's the problem with how you're getting angry at clients who seek other therapists: You are taking it personally. If a client wants to seek another therapist because they're in denial of their diagnosis, that's their right to do so. It's their right to seek out a therapeutic relationship that is actually therapeutic. Eventually, they'll find the right person who can connect with them.

Inflexibility manifests in different ways. For example... Do you know Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory? How he has a bathroom schedule? How he always needs to be sitting on his spot in the couch? Now, can you imagine being on holiday with someone like Sheldon? He will be angry that there's no bathroom schedule on holiday. Or that the couch in the hotel isn't the one like home. That's a good example of inflexibility.

83,"Want to hear something ironic?  I fit the criteria for qBPD myself.  Except my file says high-functioning, which is another way of saying the same thing.  Because of my age, and when I was diagnosed, originally what was said was ""You are incredibly atypical for a male BPD patient.  Your behaviour fits the model for female patients, not male.  you hide your issue, and turn it against yourself""

It's not that I don't think people manifest it in different ways, it's that its all BPD, and that my understanding isn't so much how we manifest our traits, but how we respond to treatment.

A modified DBT is probably a good thing - because a lot of pwBPD simply can't work within the current model, for whatever reason.

My personal big issue with the term is this - I see it used as an us/them qualifier.  There's the ""bad"" pwBPD who hurt people all the time, and the ""good"" BPD people who only directly or actively hurt themselves.  It gets used too often to distance ourselves from those others who are outwardly focused.

Which I find distasteful.",Squigglepig52,qajxem
84,"I agree with this. I have seen again and again how people's conditions, experiences, and helpful possible treatments are invalidated within this community by being slapped with ""it's not clinical"". It's a low-key method I see so many people here employ to back up their righteous anger to hurt others in an effort to gatekeep and control not just their own reality but others as well. 

It's dangerous and shocking that this behaviour of acting out against others would be allowed here. Emotional invalidation hurts others and is part of the reason why a majority of us are here. 

Here's something from the DBT Skills Training Manual by Marsha Linehan herself:
>The role of invalidation in the development of emotion dysregulation makes a lot of sense, once you realize that a primary function of emotions in humans  (as well as other mammals) is to serve as a rapid  communication system. Invalidation of emotions  sends the message that the communication was not  received. When the message is important, the sender  understandably escalates the communication by escalating the emotion. When the receiver does not  “get” the communication or disbelieves it, he or she  understandably increases efforts to stop the communication, usually by some means of invalidation.

There are psychologists who specialise Cluster B disorders such as BPD who use the term in their clinical practice. Just because it's not included in the DSM-V does not mean it's not clinical. It does not mean it's not supported by evidence-based practice.

So here's my question for everyone who is so focused on their literal thinking that they lose the big picture on helping sufferers: If Dr. Daniel Fox and Dr. Ramani Durvasula — respected authorities in their fields — use the term in their clinical practice, then why shouldn't we?  Why the need to stamp it out? 

I am a registered nurse for over a decade that's been recently diagnosed with BPD. My subtype is Quiet/Discouraged BPD. I have a full time job. I undergo individual therapy with a trauma specialist. I am preparing to undergo Intensive DBT for 6 months and then I will undergo RO DBT for another 6 months.

88,"I hope you don't mind, but I just need clarification on some things so I can understand you better. 

>I can definitely relate to a lot of the feelings but I think usually my behaviour is a bit less extreme
 
May I know the point of reference? Less extreme than..? 

>I do feel suicidal sometimes after interactions with people that I've felt are abandoning me, I've also sometimes implied to people that I may kill myself, when I've been very upset

You said sometimes. Do you have na idea what could be the difference between the times when you don't and the times when you do feel suicidal? The trigger is abandonment. So what's the other factor that completes the equation into suicidality?

>When I was younger I used to wreck cherished objects but as I've grown older I can't imagine doing that. I definitely used to topple dressers and stuff in a rage and tear up photos and that sort of thing, and later I'd feel so guilty about it

The last time I wrecked a cherished object was years ago. I killed a memorable flatscreen TV that cost $2,800 by hurling my wedding band at it. I wanted to kill myself afterwards. I regretted it so badly. My husband and I spent money and effort transporting that across one country to the next when we moved. 

>My mother used to do that a lot (smash and throw things etc) and and I think it was a learnt behaviour that I managed to overcome as I've gotten older, but I do believe she has full BPD, she refuses to see a psychologist but all my health providers that I've described her behaviour to have said sounds like BPD

My mum used to do this too. She stopped when she threw a shoe at me and it hit me in the eye. Got a huge black eye and a wound. She won't see a psychologist either. I hope I can convince her to in the future. I have an idea of what she has, but after a chat with my
 psychologist, I've come to realise that pathologising her behaviour isn't really important to my recovery. My therapy is about me, not her.

May I know the rationale of all your HCPs with regards to them saying she sounds like she suffers BPD? Every psychologist I've seen told me they can't and won't diagnose anyone unless they've spent a considerable amount of time with them. Mine wouldn't even provide me a differential diagnosis of my mum. From my experience, they are particular about following the clinical process and using their assessment tools.

>My official diagnosis is general anxiety disorder, major depressive disorders, panic disorder and substance abuse disorders (alcohol, marijuana and benzodiazepine) and it said my environmental and genetic factors have contributed to mild personality vulnerabilities (which I think some of this is the BPD features my psychologist mentioned to me during our sessions)

That's a lot. I'm overwhelmed just thinking about all of it. If you don't mind... What criteria of each diagnosis did you fulfil?

>DBT is broken down into modules of 7, 8, or 9 weeks duration during which skills of emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, mindfulness and distress tolerance are taught. These skills roughly relate to the skills deficits that are experienced by people suffering with BPD.

>The courses and fees are as follows:

> •  Interpersonal Effectiveness Module (7 weeks):  $2870

> •  Distress Tolerance Skills (8 weeks):  $3280

> •  Emotional Regulation Skills (9 weeks):  $3690

I just copy and pasted the email they sent me when I made the inquiry. Since everything is going to come out of my own pocket and payment per module needs to be done in advance, I'm doing every hack in my expenses I can to put money in savings for it. Normally, I'd be appalled that the treatment isn't subsidised under the public health scheme, but atm I'm just glad there's treatment. It's not like the 70s anymore in which the diagnosis is like a Dementor's Kiss.

Anyway, while I'm waiting for the next intake and saving up, my therapist agreed it's a good idea to do workbooks with her. I see her every 2 weeks.

>I don't think the work on ourselves ever ends, nor does the potential progress. Even a few years ago, I don't think I could have realized how I was going on tilt yesterday and that I should back off and apologize. 

Thank you for sharing this. In a way, I believe the treatment for our illness leads us down the path of continuous self improvement (Kaizen) whilst building a life worth living. It should be how every person lives their lives, even neurotypicals.

>I also found CBT helped me a lot. Do NOT look that up as the acronym - Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, which is a bit more aimed at anxiety type issues. (Searching via the acronym is likely to lead you to some kinda icky porn).

CBT I found helped me with my pessimism. I was previously misdiagnosed with depression alone. And yeah, I did have depression I guess... But I didn't know it wasn't Major Depressive Disorder. Like... I kid you not, I used to walk through life with a ""morbid filter"", if you will. I always assumed the worst would happen. I thought by doing that, I was protecting myself from disappointment and preparing for whatever next crisis was in order.

And lol about the torture porn 😆. Thank you for worrying about my erm... modesty. I know about BDSM so no worries! I know exactly what you mean.

109,You’ve yet to point out any actual facts and have given your own personal experience over and over and how that makes you an expert to diagnose or question the diagnosis of others. The person you’re arguing with has actually posted facts and sourced information. Put the shovel down.,tradders,qajxem

112,"Apology accepted. Thank you. I'm really sorry about your dental infection. They are the worst! Local anaesthetic doesn't work too well on infected tissue either. Did you take the Morphine? Oxycodone (Endone) may be a good option once you're discharged just to take the edge off of the pain.

>My other issue, as I said elsewhere, is that, here on this sub,and elsewhere, I too often see people using qBPD as another way of saying ""good"" BPD vs ""bad"" BPD. As in, I'm not a bad person like those outward BPD people, I'm good because I turn it on myself. In that context, I find it problematic.

I also have an issue with this. There is no good vs bad BPD. There are subtypes... Like flavours of ice cream, if we will. I take offense at anyone who sees our illness as a flaw in character. No one thinks cancer is a flaw in character. It's not fair that mental illnesses have this stigma.

Turning the anger inwards is as problematic as turning it outwards. In fact, people with the Quiet/Discouraged BPD subtype often get misdiagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder. It takes a long time to even get the correct diagnosis, so we get the right treatment. As we are all aware, CBT, which is the go-to treatment for depression, is not usually effective for BPD.

0,"Not from USA so I know fart all about resources down there but typically with BPD the most recommended treatment is called DBT (Dialectical Behavioural Therapy) it’s a specialize therapy and different from what regular talk therapy is like and so far been helpful for me and lots others.

Thanks for being so understanding and helpful to your gf during her difficulties. Also side note: therapy can take a long time. Sometimes doing more is actually worse than less. For example when I did DBT therapy I was doing like 12-14 hours a week of therapy and declining so bad, now I’m doing 2-3 hours of therapy a week and doing MUCH better since I cut down drastically.

Gold standard therapy is called DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy).

If you’re in North America, you have no requirements to disclose your medical history to employers except in very rare circumstances (eg. Can’t get into the military with a PTSD diagnosis). 99.99999% of jobs have no legal right to your medical history. Many other countries are like this as well, but I don’t know the specifics.

For finding someone who specializes, what I can say is that I got diagnosed through a formal assessment by a psychologist experienced in PD assessments—he was a colleague of my regular psychologist. She referred me to him for a formal evaluation. 

You can check online as well. While specializing in PD is less common, I’d say BPD is the most common PD specialization I see. If you live in or near a city, it should be pretty easy to find someone who works with BPD, you can just search online. Most psychs will list their specializations. You can also ask if they do PD assessments.

You can search on google for DBT groups and/or psychs who do DBT as a starting point as well. Anyone who does DBT will be familiar with BPD, since I believe it was originally developed specifically for BPD treatment.",Maple_Person,1cprwss

1,"When I first started DBT I found it completely useless because it wasn't important to me to act more effectively to get what I wanted. It felt like so much of DBT was for other people -- how do I translate what I am feeling to make other people be able to receive it and be more comfortable. It felt even more invalidating for me, honestly.

I only felt good about using DBT skills when I got a group of friends who have BPD in recovery, a supportive and loving partner who I could talk through the feelings with, and a therapist who understood me. It was only with that space to feel validated that it started to feel good to use the skills and I could start to feel that feeling and move through it. (Because it is so strong and painful; but as others are able to see it, it doesn't feel as important to cling to it. And it doesn't feel as invalidating or frustrating to try to translate what I am feeling into the skills. It doesn't feel like masking anymore.)",,o6yvqd
2,"Because people can use behavioral strategies to regulate emotions and tolerate distress.

  
There are also non-behavioral therapies that have been developed to treat BPD, I've seen people say good things about schema therapy and mentalization based therapy. And I have read about transference based therapy.",,o6yvqd
3,"I really want to chime in here because I think it might be helpful. DBT is a behaviour-based therapy and when I started it I struggled so much also with this idea that I was being controlled or that no one cared about my inner struggles and only about how I acted. Over time I've learned that that's not what is meant by behaviour therapy, at least in this context, and when it is done right. It's actually just that our behaviours are linked to so many other aspects of our experiences. When we act in certain ways, it can influence our emotions and thoughts too. For example, with the opposite action skill, if I keep having the thought that I'm a failure, it might change my behaviour by encouraging me to stop trying to get a job or a promotion (just as an example). The more I act in ways that align with these thoughts (which are just thoughts and not facts about me or my life) the more the thoughts can seem believable and it can have a domino effect. But if I act opposite and continue to assert myself at work, or apply for jobs, or whatever, it's like teaching my brain that the internal script is just thoughts, not facts about me.

This is only one example but there are many others. The thing about behaviour is that it's a very concrete thing that we do have control over. In my experience, talk therapy never helped. At first, DBT sucked and I hated it. I told my therapist I felt like a dog being trained. But over time, it has changed me and I really feel it. I don't think my issue was big emotional outbursts either. My issues have been mostly internal, and it has helped with this too. Many of the skills just require so much practice to reach a point where they feel like they actually help and I think that is frustrating too. 

I also think that having a therapist who understands DBT and BPD is so important. I read in one of your comments that your therapist said people with BPD are manipulative. That is an awful comment to hear and for them to make. A proper DBT therapist won't make a comment like that. My therapist told me that in DBT they don't believe that people with BPD are manipulative. He validates my emotions which is so healing for me, and he has helped me work on my trauma. The skills have helped me learn how to regulate my emotions, cope with really intense emotions, improve my life overall by pursuing goals, etc. and mindfulness has been amazing for me to learn how to be present and to not constantly believe my thoughts and emotions. 

It won't change how I experience emotions entirely because I am by nature an extremely sensitive person. But it has helped me tremendously to learn how to cope and to find ways to improve my existence. When I started DBT, I was actively suicidal. Over time those behaviours have gone down and the urges have recently been going down more too. It has taken a long time though, close to 2 years. I would urge anyone reading this to keep working at it and not to write off DBT entirely. I have grown to love it and I don't believe it is a quick fix by any means. It is hard work, time-consuming, and has been so worth it for me. 

As for the religious component, yes Marsha Linehan is very religious and spiritual. This was odd for me too at first because I'm also queer. I have found though that those aspects are really just take it or leave it aspects of the program overall. It is not necessary to engage with those parts. Mindfulness is something anyone can benefit from, and a few of the skills do mention prayer or other things like that but that can be whatever you want it to be, or nothing at all. For me, I strongly believe in magic so I just change how I use that skill, or else I ""pray"" AKA talk to people in my life who are deceased. I don't necessarily believe they exist somewhere either, but I still derive some comfort from this. I don't believe that Marsha's beliefs in religion need to threaten our ability to benefit from DBT. In her memoir, she also talks about many of the problematic aspects of the church. The fact is, many people benefit from religion and that is something that over time I have had to accept to some degree. I won't accept if a person causes harm to another, but if they are religious and not hurting anyone and their religion gives their life deeper meaning or helps them move peacefully through the world, I personally cannot judge that too harshly anymore. 

Hope this helps.",symmetryfairy,o6yvqd
4,"I’m a bit puzzled that you say DBT doesn’t tackle emotions. I found that emotions were covered extensively in the emotional regulation module, as well as the mindfulness module. Behaviour modification can also be in relation to how you feel about yourself, not just how you react to other people in stressful situations. For example the emotional regulation module had many exercises in learning how to identify emotions as well as secondary emotions. There are also more “long-game” strategies such as how to maintain a healthy emotional baseline, cultivate a sense of identity, and find purpose through building mastery.

It’s not so much directing you on how to behave without explanation, it’s more like life-hacking, teaching skills to have a healthier life overall. I am atheist, and I’m sure many would probably categorize me as a quiet borderline (even though I reject that term), but it still helped me immensely. As with anything, it’s not for everyone, and it won’t work unless you are open-minded to it.",,o6yvqd
5,"I think this is why I get so frustrated with therapy and trying to ""fix myself"".  Like, okay maybe I shouldn't have thrown a temper tantrum, but the feelings behind those actions are real and valid and came from somewhere right? But other people easily blame you for fights, arguments, etc. and dismiss their own behavior because we ""overreact"".

And same, as far as therapy telling me I'm doing well because I'm managing outside symptoms. But like, it's just masking what buried beneath and I feel like I have to hide how I'm feeling to function properly in society.",Lost_Girl_104,o6yvqd
6,"Behavior often escalates situations and can cause more intense emotions in the long run, on top of being the most bothersome to your surroundings. The thing about BPD emotions is that they’re not really manageable. And I don’t mean that in a “all hope is lost” way, but I feel like we have unrealistic expectations of how to deal with them. I thought when I started DBT I would learn to deal with negative emotions by making it less bad or by finding a way to change my emotions but realistically it’s not doable. The focus in my therapy was on accepting there’s bad moments and they are and always will be worse than non-BPD people. On top of being able to tell why you’re upset as to not blame yourself or get more upset. Also do you can fix whatever the issue is. There’s not really healthy ways to deal with emotions that aren’t just doing something fun, which doesn’t really help (me at least). So it’s basically just acceptance. If you can’t accept it it’s usually the moment you get into harmful behavior, which is why they focus on that first",thedutchgirl13,o6yvqd
7,"As someone who has struggled with relatively mild BPD, I hear you. I did briefly tried DBT at my local hospital and found it to be kinda victim-blamey in that regard. Do you struggle with a disorder that makes you wanna die? Here's how you can hide your symptoms from others.

Some of the logic of the program struck me as circular, too. Like, for example, we were told that judgments are bad... but postulating that judgments are necessarily bad sounds like a judgment to me-- and a very black-and-white one at that.",,o6yvqd
8,"FUCKING THANK YOU! I've been feeling this way for so long and hadn't found a way to put words to it. My first encounter with DBT was in eating disorder recovery, and it just always felt so... surface level. Like, this is not the source of the problem! It's a bandaid at best. 

I dunno, I know there's something to the whole, remapping neural pathways, building new patterns, etc... And I also know that I'm a thought-spiraler, so maybe I'd benefit from it more if I tried again, but it just feels so much like a ""fake it until the problems go away"" approach, and I can't help but despise that idea. 

I've had several people tell me I shouldn't seek an official BPD diagnosis because I'm superficially doing okay, even though I'm struggling so much internally and am constantly in pain.",earthlogic,o6yvqd
9,It's because the mental health care system is only focussed on the fastest and most noticeable results like DBT and CBT. It always felt really invalidating to me (and I don't have bpd).,BrokenGlassBeetle,o6yvqd
10,i understand the frustration and feeling unheard. 1) seeing regular psychotherapists or doing group therapy is mostly talking and understanding your feelings and often the first step in mental health. 2) bpd is not being emotional or suicidal; it's having specific disordered behaviours because of it so they treat that. 3) who keeps referring you to all these dismissive psychiatrists? even general practitioners usually listen and prescribe SSRIs or refer you to the proper professional. 4) people with severe enough autism need to be given those tools to facilitate navigating social situations: they can't understand the reasoning behind it (because of the autism) but they understand it makes their life easier.,dysthal,o6yvqd
11,"This. I feel like changing behaviors is only putting a band-aid on the issue.

I feel we need to resolve the deep feelings that cause this BPD. No need to correct behaviors if I’m not feeling shitty no?",SoftBoiledPotatoChip,o6yvqd
12,"I really appreciate this post, internet hug if you want one. I'm on the Autism Spectrum (clinically diagnosed at 3 years old) and have many traits of BPD (7) (but haven't been clinically diagnosed yet, but was mis-diagnosed as Bipolar and Emotionally Disturbed when I was a teenager); I've been clinically diagnosed with PTSD (though the specific type of PTSD I have is called Complex PTSD isn't in the DSM, which is why I was only evaluated for and diagnosed with PTSD). I figured I'd add my two cents here anyway since this post really resonated with me. 

I agree with everything you've said, especially about DBT having parallels with ABA. (and in my opinion, CBT is similar to both of these therapies in a way. I feel CBT is less focused on behavior like ABA or DBT, but it's obsessed with changing thoughts and when it was done to me (CBT that is) the therapist who did it was super invalidating when I tried to tell her my home life was abusive and causing severe distress. This same therapist never believed me about the abuse period, and when I'd disassociate or get flashbacks in front of her (or just couldn't do the CBT), she'd say shit like ""Why do you choose to hold on to these memories"" and ""your mother had a worse childhood than you"" ""my goal for you is to have a more positive view of your mother"" and she even gaslit me once ""you never told me that, Shadowflame25 I would have remembered if you told me something that awful"" in regards to a traumatic incident I told said therapist *multiple* times over the years).

Anyway, I now associate CBT with invalidation, gaslighting and manipulation due to a predatory therapist I had who practiced CBT. 

And the few times therapists in Outpatient and Inpatient handed me DBT worksheets, I often felt angry and defensive at the wording in the sheets, especially when the word ""tantrum"" was used. 

And that ""half-smiling"" shit once happened to me as a *trauma response* during a traumatic situation; right before I experienced a form of disassociation called *Depersonalization*, which was *extremely* traumatic for me, and every time those therapists talked about ""half smiling to trick your brain"" I literally got flashbacks to half-smiling before Depersonalization during that trauma. I had to leave the sessions every time DBT's half-smiling got talked about because I'd get so distressed. Also, half-smiling has *never* tricked my Autistic brain into being happy, since (for me) half-smiling is a trauma response called Fawning, when I'm traumatized I can't fucking trick my brain into magically being happy! So I suspect that half-smiling crap from DBT only works on Neurotypicals anyway. 

I also experienced ABA as a child since I was clinically diagnosed with ASD at 3 years old, and it was used to take away my hand-flapping because my parents say the hand-flapping ""looked weird."" (My parents are also big fans of Autism Speaks and were severely emotionally abusive and emotionally neglectful to me while I was growing up) Now I have no coping skills when I'm overstimulated and either meltdown or disassociate instead of I don't know, hand-flapping! <sarcasm> Thanks ABA! Apparently hand-flapping is so shameful, meltdowns and disassociation is more ""normal"". I wish I hand-flapped instead. :(",Shadowflame25,o6yvqd
13,"I found dbt insulting. Not not useful but really invalidating and unempowering. And this is directly connected to the Buddhist influence and the capitalist state of human societies. I use dbt out of a pragmatic sense to look over how anti-justice and the ""broken mindset"" it's. And just because something is effective doesn't mean it's build on a right and ethical philosophical basis.",CombinationMean9957,o6yvqd
14,"This. This is really spot on what I think about this whole therapy mess. ""another therapy focused on training behavior without bothering to care about the person behind it"" and the paralell with autism is striking indeed.

I have dealt with a lot of horrible emotions, but I'm solely getting seen as worthy of treatment for a car crash I had because I was drunk. They care only about how to overcome the event but they do not care about WHY I did drink too much that day, and all what's behind it. It maddens me. Though when you think about how many ""health professionals"" consider us ""clients"" as if they were selling a car brand, I mean no wonder they do not care about us as individuals.

I am currently working with my psychiatrist only because he gives me needed antipsychotics - sorry you experience paranoid delusions because I do too and that's indeed nigh psychosis. I think the most needed thing for people with BPD is just a fucking simple listening ear. Usually, be it friends, family, partners, mental health people, all they know to say is ""you overreact"", ""focus on the present"", ""learn how to cope"". Hell they show well they don't fucking know what they are talking about. Paranoid delusions and suicide is not something you can just ""get over with"". And also, as you say, it never comes from nowhere. There's a lot of hidden (or not so hidden) emotional stuff behind it all. But I guess it doesn't sell well. Sorry this became a rant. But just to let you know, thank you for this post.",,o6yvqd
15,"That's why I like my therapist. He tries to understand that reason beging emotion. He is on my side, when I tell him I outburst on someone, but still he says, that it's better to manage your anger, than throw it immediately on person.

I feel really secure with him, because I don't feel like he wants to change me, he only wants to guide me to not being total asshole.

The bad thing is, that he is bored with psychoanalysis and diagnoses. Not like he doesn't believe in it, he just doesn't care. It was his least favourite subject in university. But he listens to me and tries to know as much as he can about BPD and DBT and so on.

He's addictologist (I go there, because ""being addict"" is the only option how your can get free therapy here...and I don't have 250 dollars per month on therapy) and thanks to it he doesn't care about diagnoses. Because if he did, he wouldn't be able to treat addicts and that is his main goal. Not pwBPD. 

I'm signed to DBT program. Wish me luck that they will accept me.",weedarbie,o6yvqd
16,"I had a lovely counselor who did my DBT. I was diagnosed with BD and BPD and went to seek help after I noticed manic behaviors. After all my behaviors were under control and my BD was managed by meds, she completely loss track of a greater plan and only talked to me weekly about whatever I complained about. She never talked to me about my family, which I told her I wanted to eventually talk about, or my identity, which I told her I wanted to talk about. 

She told me when she got me assigned as a patient she tried to pawn me off because she couldn't handle a patient with BPD. 

NEVER went into any of my deeper emotions or issues. When I wanted to talk about my family, she didn't help me work it out at all. Asked me to make a list of my trauma. Listed it out and never helped me work through it. And that was it. That was her helping me move through my past. 

My counselor that I had only helped me not explode. That's it. That's all I learned how to do, is learn how to walk away.",fifth-account-,o6yvqd
17,"This is just my two cents on the issue, synthesising things various professionals have told me. One of the keys to a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for BPD is actually a disruption in your ability to either work, function or otherwise socialise. In short, you're likely going to have a harder time getting a professional to see your BPD as an issue because in terms of quantifiable impact it's minimised in your case. Most therapy for BPD relies on behaviour because the root cause of BPD is almost impossible to address. DBT intentionally is focussed on behaviour and coping skills because it's the only thing that can really be directly targeted. BPD literally changes your neurological structure, and that can't be unchanged through anything really. It seems mostly behaviour focussed because that's where you'll see the impact of your therapy. Hope this helps.",ecciesforbrekky,o6yvqd
18,"I think this is just a semantic confusion-- thoughts are included under the umbrella of behaviors. The experience of an emotion is a behavior in a loose sense, but mostly they impinge on and clearly color and motivate what we'd more readily associate with the word ""behavior"", which is to mean our physical actions. I think treatment really is just about the full suite of what the mechanics are around the person who is suffering, subjectively and objectively.

This is not to say that there can't be therapists or people who employ therapies that are quite *literally* only interested with physical actions-- that to me, would seem extremely narrow and short-sighted. I haven't heard of that myself in modern therapy, personally.",Compassionate_Cat,o6yvqd
19,"I totally get this! I have had the same suspicion for a while...I think Marsha did a tremendous amount of good with DBT - however it seems like we might agree that there is something inherently invalidating about it perhaps?

The premise of the approach seems to place more emphasis on getting the right behavior than feeling unified while doing it. 

distress tolerance - learning how to put up with more distress? why wouldn't the emphasis be on putting up with less distress? 

radical acceptance seems invalidating too --- let go of the things that are causing your bitterness? seems close....but like its missing a piece. 

It also certainly has an undeniable catholic flavor to it.",,o6yvqd
20,"“The squeaky wheel gets the grease”…this is a universal truth. 

I think people who try to hide how screwed up they are (me included) actually have a way worse self love problem. You put everyone else so above you to protect them from you but I think the people who throw tantrums, put themselves #1 and in return, they get all the attention and help. It’s literally never worked out for me to hide things and I always was overseen and gaslighted (I have an eating disorder too btw and my therapist told me I looked fine and wasn’t because my appearance was okay, but I was only eating 400 calories a day and one time I straight up skipped eating 5 days in a row). Therapists are just people and you’ve got to remember you actually know best for yourself. Sometimes we all do get the wrong idea in our heads and their advice and guidance are really helpful but if you feel something strongly in your gut and it has nothing to do with you avoiding a problem or sabotaging,etc….don’t second guess yourself. Therapists can also get really wrong but have big egos

Having said that though, some people who throw tantrums destroy their lives so it is a gamble too. I have started to be brutally honest with people about what’s going on and how I feel though and even though it might not paint me in the best light it’s weird, I found people respect me more and I’m becoming way less concerned about the opinions of others. It’s very cathartic not to hide. Like, I think it’s a good medium between trying to hide and full on tantrums.",law05004,o6yvqd
21,"The way I see it, you have behaviors in your head too. A lot of it is concerned with changing those head behaviors into good ones, and making good choices and having a healthy perspective so that your outside behaviours are healthy and appropriate for long term prosperity as well.",rnelonhead,o6yvqd
22,"This was a good read. I have questions though; I have group today and I might be able to see what you are saying live- are you doing solo/group sessions for DBT or at home? From what I'm being taught, distress tolerance section is only supposed to be for use during intense emotions for like in the moment problems. Not written in stone when to use what tools of course, but I'm told skills in distress tolerance is supposed to be in conjunction with like ""oh shit"" moments ( like when I have to take meds on the spot to try to come back to earth) and we are supposed to then lean into mindfulness/ emotional regulation skills when we aren't so amped. What have you been taught? I'm curious how different people are being taught the same book. 

Second question is- I genuinely disagree with religion with respect to school settings unless its obviously a school meant for that or a course etc. I dont feel religion has a place in the lessons for DBT- is it in the text you are finding this or is this specific to a person teaching this? 

My last question is, is the therapist new? It's becoming more of a reality reading from this sub, that civilian side docs (I'm a veteran) are holding out on caring for those with BPD because they feel the person ""can't be worked with""; so instead of losing money on clients and referring you someone that is well capable- these greedy fucks are wasting ppls time and money imo. I feel biased/particularly annoyed about your doc because that was the same language used with me when I was hiding symptoms/off meds in an unhealthy relationship. ""You haven't been manic for months so you must not have bipolar anymore"". If thats the case, I'm the golden goose and scientists need to cut me up for the cure to pass along! 

Sorry for the long comment- it feels better to talk here than my weak ass attempts in r/chat. I hope you are able to find better help though because that's really saddening seeing stories where doc's are dropping the ball.",,o6yvqd

25,"I’m sorry to say it, but I’ve never met a useful therapist. The majority are hacks, and — at least where I live — the best ones are probably the ones only the rich can afford. 

You sound like you’ve done so much to make yourself better, even while struggling. And you shouldn’t put yourself down because you don’t lash out like a banshee the way I do. 

The empty feeling is one of the worst kinds of suffering, I don’t care what anyone says. 

Anyway, I have no advice. Just thought I’d let you know I relate. I’ve also had to make myself better or functional because the therapists I‘ve seen couldn’t do anything. They ALWAYS focus on the wrong things, or tell you to do things that you specifically said you cannot do or you’ll lose it.

I suspect that the reason why treatment focuses on behavior is because the goal is really just to make us ""easier to deal with"" or more palatable to people without BPD.

28,"Thank you for this post, you can't put it better and I relate a lot with what you wrote. You have absolutely right that most therapies, not only dbt, are focused on behavior. I had therapists that it's OK to feel anxious or angry or furious as long as I'm nice and polite with people. They were more worried when I start to avoid people and isolate myself or when I start to have conflicts with close people in my life. It's very invalidating because it's like they enable you to keep wearing a mask because that makes seem ""normal"" when you suffocate and can't control your emotions. No wonder why many people can't find for many years the right diagnosis for bpd even if the have all the traits, because they aren't too ""expressive"".

I never did dbt because nobody in my area specializes in this therapy, but I have search alone many worksheets, books etc and I find them kind of unhelpful in terms of managing and accept your emotions. I don't know dbt as a concept made me feel kind of angry because as you said it seem like very victim blaming. Maybe my feelings and taking things personally makes me see it this way but I can't understand how this is helpful for people. But from the other side many people find this therapy extremely beneficial so maybe this is the case. I just believe that dbt it's not the golden solution for everyone with bpd especially for people who have to deal with other disorders as well.

Your last paragraph said it all unfortunately. And I don't want to invalidate the importance of the therapy but it seems more common that it should for therapy to focused on behavior than emotion for every mental disorder. And I kind of agree with others that therapy has as main purpose nowadays to make you more functional for the society not helping you to understand and manage your emotions. Maybe the sad truth is that there is no way to change your emotions no matter what. I think you are very self aware and you just realize what exactly is going on with mental health care system.",Miss_miserable_,o6yvqd
29,"In my country mental health treatment is scarce and DBT ir practiced only in a few places like hospitals. Most of the psychotherapy is in the private sector and therapists use a variety of approaches. I mean there are some well known modalities like psychodynamic, gestalt, humanistic, cognitive, but therapists are trying to fit individual person's needs. And unfortunately personality disorders aren't recognized, you can't get disability because of them, so it is a person's decision to seek private therapy and pay out of pocket. But due to this same reason the treatment is usually at the deeper level, a therapist tries to understand clients' inner world, her underlying emotions and story, not to control the behaviour.

So I'm guessing it is a matter of the mental health system. If you're in some hospital, the first thing is to control patients' behaviour so that she wouldn't be self destructive or aggressive towards others. If you go to individual therapy where the therapist is really trying to create an authentic relation with you, the treatment would be more open and less organized.",sadwaves1992,o6yvqd

(I saw a YouTube video about Marsha talking about this once.) But because of ableism and pathologization a lot of DBT therapists don't get there.

also for seeking a diagnosis, you should do whatever you feel would help you best.

The reality is alot of mental health problems are caused by living in a pretty awful place with thoughts that dont fit in, it is that simple. Those thoughts can be chemically changed with some disorders but it does not work that way for BPD.

The thing is, if we want to live we do need to accept that. There really is not another option.

The failing is not focusing on the social problems that surround us and shape what causes us problems. Fuck the people who think communication is to painful with a mentally ill person, it would fix problems and as long as I dont demand a specific solution then its not only not unhealthy it is actually far more healthy than the majority of average relationships in the entire world.

Do we need to accept that we dont live in that world? Yes. Should we be forced to be told its all fine? No. We should be allowed to critique it, to ask why it cant change, to understand the forces that shape that.

It’s not like every aspect of religion is out to abuse people, it really pisses me off to hear anyone say that because true meditation is the highest pleasure, over any drug, sex or event, and I couldn’t have known this experience without studying spiritual practices and seeing what worked.

Teaching DBT is often presented in a very secular way, but the practice itself is deeply rooted in religious traditions.

I know I'm not being entirely fair here to DBT, and that there are very real benefits. In the main post I'm largely trying to identify what seems to be a worrying trend or systemic issue with our mental health system, and how it feels more designed to control than to help. Which now that I put it like that, next to the catholic thing feels even more familiar lol. But that's why I also brought up Autism and ABA to compare alongside. ABA is known to be abusive in ways that DBT, CBT, and other treatments aren't, and it really lays bare the motive to control behavior and enforce conformity. 

As for my therapist though, I've cycled through many over the past decade, usually staying around 6mo before ditching. Most recent one I ditched cause I specifically went to her for help with my BPD and she told me ""People with BPD very rarely actually commit suicide, it's usually just an attempt to manipulate those around them"" that felt like a very clear sign to leave.

69,">  I do and trying to apply the concept of behavior (something you choose) to those thoughts made me feel pretty worthless lol

Yes, behaviors are *chosen*, but it's important to be precise in our language here. When we say ""*chosen*"", what do we mean? We often mean that they're *freely* chosen. Not freely as in ""No one is going to crack their whip at you if you make the wrong choice"" ""freely"", we mean ""freely"" as in, **really** freely-- a product of you and nothing but you, something which makes you **ultimately** responsible for the product of whatever emerges from the thing you're calling ""you"" "". 

That specific idea, that last one, if you carefully think about it, simply makes absolutely zero sense. And this is why it's an unfortunate confusion to feel worthless about something like this, because it's simply not true that you're worthless due to some arbitrary thought or behavior that either occurs or doesn't, for reasons which, ultimately, you cannot account for.

Now, what does this say about.... guilt? Or shame? Does it make no sense to feel these? Well, these are *important* emotions, and they serve a purpose socially, because if we genuinely do something wrong, it's good to be reminded internally. And if we're genuinely bad people in any given instance, or collection of instances, then this is important too, because no one actually wants to be a bad person in principle.

Yes, there are bad people who will tell you something like: ""But I *love* being a bad person!"", so it's possible to be ignorant of the insight that no one wants to be a bad person, but such a person, if they could simply see themselves clearly, would be mortified by who they are, if they **could** be mortified-- this is what it means to say ""no one wants to be a bad person in *principle*"".

So whether or not we can freely choose anything, or if we simply choose it as a product of who we are, emotions like shame and guilt are still useful, it's just that they can lead us astray like any other emotion.

If you still feel worthless, just remember only the facts of the situation: You didn't make yourself. You didn't pick all the variables that made you, you(genes, parents, environment, upbringing, day to day experience, which neurons fired and which didn't, luck, and so on). This doesn't mean that your actions or behaviors matter any less, it just means that no one can point to a dog and say ""How *dare* you not go ""MOOOO!"" "" and understand how reality works. If dogs going ""moo"" is good, well then we should say ""Could you consider going moo?"" or ""Wouldn't it be best if dogs went moo?"" But *hating* a dog who doesn't go ""moo"", makes zero sense. If a dog couldn't go ""moo"", then only an insane person would say that is the dog's fault, and if this dog was suffering from feelings of worthlessness because they couldn't go ""moo"", well then, it's just a tragedy because there's no *good* reason for this.",Compassionate_Cat,o6yvqd

yes yes - very much agree. when we look at the origin (or as best as we can guess) of BPD it usually comes down to this right? Being raised in an invalidating environment.

Perhaps something to add to this is the role that our emotional response play in mental health. Is it sufficient to focus on thoughts and behaviors without adding in the emotions too?

 >The Internal Family Systems Model (IFS) is an integrative approach to individual psychotherapy developed by Richard C. Schwartz in the 1980s. It combines systems thinking with the view that the mind is made up of relatively discrete subpersonalities, each with its own unique viewpoint and qualities. IFS uses family systems theory to understand how these collections of subpersonalities are organized.

What is achieved in knowing “how you work” if you’re satisfied with the status quo, and not looking to change anything? You could probably circumvent treatment and just journal if that’s what you’re seeking.

>Maybe I'm deluding myself but I don't mind how I treat others, I'm already way too mindful of that

Really? 19 days ago you were asking another sub for advice on how to stop yourself from reacting (ie, imposing your pain unto others as a form of relief) when you perceive people being rude to you, and you said you often misinterpret these types of situations. I sense a bit of cognitive dissonance here. 

>I usually mistreat myself, and dbt didn't help with that at all.

If you usually mistreat yourself, why wouldn’t you want coping skills or strategies to change that? I’m not saying that DBT is the only treatment to accomplish this— but it sort of sounds like you wrote it off because the vibe is admittedly a bit corny and childish at times, and subsequently quit before you would even start making progress (it took me about 3 months).

I wish you good luck, dude. I’ve heard schema therapy is a popular alternative.",,o6yvqd
87,How do you define what a reasonable reaction is though? (I'm not trying to be argumentative either -- just a discussion!) Is it determined by how most people react in a given situation? Is it determined by what I value as a person? What else? I'm just curious what your thoughts are.,quanticbolt,o6yvqd
88,"I don’t really understand what you are asking or inferring. 

Technically, yes — your brain is producing the thoughts at that moment in time, and you only truly have control over yourself — but of course, your thoughts are also a product and negotiation of your environment, biology, pre-existing vulnerabilities, culture, social interactions etc. Unless you have been completely isolated from other people for your entire life, I wouldn’t agree that *you* are the only source of every thought you have, because truthfully, subtle or even invisible influence is everywhere. In more extreme situations like abusive relationships and high control groups, tactics such as thought reform or undue influence can be used to manipulate and implant thoughts within an individual.",,o6yvqd
89,that’s super fair! I think there’s a distinction to be made between dbt done in a group setting and dbt that’s able to be much more personalized in individual therapy. I have gotten a lot of benefit out of self-studying dbt but didn’t find group dbt as helpful.,,o6yvqd
90,[removed],,o6yvqd
91,"Like Rinz said, it can be subjective.

But - as an example, and I'm going to choose one that's super straightforward.  You text your friend some random, unimportant thought, like ""I think I'll watch ""Deadpool"" today"", you see they saw it, but they don't get back to you for, say, an hour.

After 15 minutes, you feel ignored, and get angry about how they didn't immediately respond, and start to self harm in a serious manner, and when they do respond, you rage at them.

OK - so, being ignored is a valid trigger for BPD, it's hard to deal with that feeling for us.  but - is hurting yourself and raging at your friend a reasonable response?

No - it isn't.  There was nothing about your text that required immediate response, if any.  There is no point to your anger or actions.

On the other hand - you literally catch your partner cheating on you.  you get super angry, and break up, right there.  Go home, toss all their stuff in a box, and put it by the door.

Totally valid trigger.  You've been betrayed and cheated on.  Being angry is a reasonable reaction - anybody would be hurt and angry over that.  furhter, you didn't hurt yourself, you didn't destroy their stuff, you just made a (good) call, and began to seperate them from your life.

Nearly anybody would find that understandable.

Of course, not all events are that cut and dried, but if we can manage to hold on our initial reaction for a few moments, we can ask if how we are about to act truly fits what just happened.

Personally, I've found that practicing the hold, and questioning myself about the import of the event, helps reduce how easily we are triggered. 

Hope that kind of illustrates what I mean.",Squigglepig52,o6yvqd
92,"Thats kinda for you to decide, and also probably changes for every situation and person, like some people live with mental disorders fine and without help because they don't feel like it affects them or others that bad, whereas if YOU don't like how you react or feel regret after, thats usually a sign you don't really wanna be reacting like that",rinz97,o6yvqd
93,"What kind of DBT did you do? Did you not have an individual therapist seeing you weekly in tandem with your group? DBT isn’t and wasn’t designed to be *just* learning skills (that’s just the group component). There is plenty of talk therapy where you explore more personal stuff (like causation) one-on-one with your therapist. 

>Sure it'd be nice to not scream at someone when feeling attacked, but I'm surrounded with understanding people who will accept an apology (and the time it takes to do that has been decreasing). 

People get tired of receiving apologies when the toxic behaviours that preceded them aren’t addressed or modified. You may think making any behavioural modifications turn you into a performing seal, but if your way of handling interpersonal conflicts isn’t working, it might be worth exploring.

>Dbt might be useful in stopping me,but in the end I'll still be in a head that function in ways alien to me,and that's what I want to fix the most.

DBT addresses those things, but I already know that it wouldn’t work for you. Treatment doesn’t work unless the patient enters into it with an open mind.",,o6yvqd
94,"This is so helpful to me. I know why I’m triggered by certain things, and I know that while there’s usually a kernel of “appropriate “ feeling , the extreme to which I feel that feeling is usually way out of proportion. I can recognize all of that, and usually in the moment. What I continue to have difficulty with is my response to that feeling. I don’t always know that how I’m reacting is disproportionate to the situation, but even when I do, the patterns of “this destructive action immediately alleviates the pain” are incredibly difficult to get out of. I also have huge deficits in executive functioning, and it takes me awhile to process things. Your wording of putting a hold on our initial reaction has clicked for me in a way that other ways to describe it (pausing; noticing; etc) have not. Thank you for your comment; it’s given me another small tool for my belt. 🙂",fashionweeksurvivor,o6yvqd
95,"It's all about the small tools, and keeping them close.

My DBT therapist explained our behaviours, our responses, as being like deep ruts in a road.  The more we follow those ruts, the deeper they get, and the harder it is to take a different path.

The trick is to figure out a better route, a more effective one, and then keep our eyes on the new path.  Over time, that path will become the clear easy to follow one, and the old ruts slowly fill in.

Every little success builds on the previous one.   

I find actually trying to visualize making a new path or trail helps me stick with it.

And, when I started trying to reduce my reactions, sometimes I would literally stand there telling myself, over and over""Don't react, don't act, not right now.  do nothing but breath"" until that pressure let off.

Listen -it's a hard road getting better.  You are going to have bad episodes -but having a bad day doesn't mean you've ruined days, weeks, months of work.  It just means you weren't prepared for that trigger at that moment.  So, think it over some more, and try again.",Squigglepig52,o6yvqd

That was during a 3rd initial assessment after they’d discharged me January 22’ without my knowledge or want for that.

0,"Inpatient vs residential are very different.
Inpatient is your classic 5150 “i am a danger to myself and other people” situation. that happened to me. they don’t help you in my case, they purely keep you safe for a few days and then you need to figure out route after. they’ll give you some meds and a diagnosis and you’ll have your group therapy, but that’s about it. i don’t really remember my time there, i made some close relationships but nothing of substance, i was in a very low place. i was also out of state so my insurance didn’t cover the charges, was definitely an expensive stay. if you need to feel safe for a few days, go to inpatient. 

afterwards i proceeded with outpatient, which was therapy 3 times a day 3 times a week. that’s the substance that really helped me, it was like going to mental health school.

residential is a longer stay, one of my best friends went and it helped her immensely. you pretty much just stay in a big house for a month or two and work on all and i mean ALL of your trauma. i was able to visit her every weekend and i saw a huge difference in her outlook on life. it was definitely expensive as well, but she was also out of state.

what i’m remind to say is, there are options. if you go to the ER and say you want to kill yourself or you’re scared of yourself, they will 5150 you. i hope you get the help you need. you’re not alone, this is just the start to your immense healing process.",HovercraftFar1087,18bweo8

2,I'm in treatment as I write this actually. I decided not to do hospitalization because I felt like too much of a spectacle when I did try. Currently I'm in residential treatment and it's actually been really helpful in terms of being SEEN and also occupied on the day to day. Less than solving my BPD or forcing it into remission my treatment is based on managing the rage and impulsivity. If you truly commit to the process and find a treatment program that works and sounds exciting for you absolutely it will help in some way.,happilyharperr,18bweo8
3,"It's not necessarily true that they will *always* 5150 you - that specifically means holding someone against their will. Sometimes if you haven't actively harmed yourself, they will decide you're safe to go home if you can commit to not doing that. Other times, you still get a choice; the unit where I stayed in early November was a voluntary ward, so even I'm only people who had attempted, they had the choice. I was told by other patients who had been to a mixed ward that the experience was a lot worse than ours, both because the actions of involuntary patients and because the mindset of the treatment team. For us though, the stay could be a bit longer; I met people who just did the 72 hours, but they kept me a week, and I met people who'd been there longer (it seemed like usually those were people who weren't responsive to meds yet, especially if they were experiencing psychosis to the point of not functioning).


Sometimes too depending on where you are, there are more options for care post hospitalization. I was hospitalized in a large city so that probably helps, but nearly all of I swear I stayed got the option to go through PHP. I wouldn't call that a substitute for residential care, but it's a lot of therapy that makes for a better transition from the hospital to outpatient. I'm still not in a *great* place but I think PHP made me much safer than I would have been without it.",torgoboi,18bweo8

Yes but has it been a consistent pattern of behavior over time? Are you sure??? I wouldn’t have guessed it from talking to you just now.” It makes me doubt everything myself so then I start to disregard things I do to keep my impulses in check.

That's not a personality disorder. They don't just disappear. But I guess that psychiatrist you saw would take one look at my arms and be like ""Ah, I see you have BPD!"" Ugh.

It seems like many therapists/doctors get a stereotyped picture in their head of what a disorder looks like and they can't recognize its variations.

25,"One mental health professional (not sure what her qualifications were) questioned me in a confronting and almost gaslighting manner about my own actions that I referred to as impulsive, obsessive and self sabotaging. 

I had been taken to the local crisis centre which is where I was assessed by this MHP. I went through my childhood and behavioural problems and everything that had led up to having an emotional breakdown at work - I was taken straight to the crisis centre. 

I told her that I had a history of ‘running away’ from home as a minor even though I loved my mother, I just wanted to disappear and just not be there. I went through my sexual assault history and the following intentional sexual risk taking I would do. The drink and drugs. The obsessive skin picking and hair plucking and the one time I spent an entire night - 10ish-5am - slowly cutting away my waist length hair that I loved, until it was only like 2inches long bc I was so fixated on my split ends, I just stood there cutting and cutting not even realising how much I had cut. My alarm went off at 5am and that snapped me out of it and I realised what I had done and just broke down - I couldn’t believe what I had done. I went through my various suicide attempts and episodes of self harm plus years of anorexia. And all throughout she gave skeptical remarks indicating that she didn’t think my history and behaviours were all that serious or abnormal. She was taking notes throughout as well. 

At the end she summed up what she had written in her notes saying that she would put together a report which would go to a senior member of the crisis team and they would decide what was appropriate treatment for me. When she read through her notes she had basically characterised my history and behaviour as normal young person troubles - I was 30 at the time and I had chronicled my entire life. She wrote that ‘patient reported not liking her split ends so had cut her own hair at the bathroom sink one night.’ All her notes completely invalidated my actual experiences. I had told her that I had aborted my most recent suicide attempt bc I just couldn’t bring myself to put my family through that pain as I knew it would devastate my mother and had said that I was only living for the sake of mom but that I wished I could just die. This MHP wrote in her notes that while ‘the patient had attempted suicide previously, the patient expressed no current desire to end her life.’ She went on with ‘patient reported using drugs and alcohol and engaging in casual sex.’ And lots more in that vain. 

When I told her that what she had written didn’t accurately represent what I had said, she went through some examples and basically said that what I had described to her was typical behaviour for women of those ages. I asked if suicide attempts were typical for 9yr olds as this was when I first attempted it. She went on a long rant about how everyone gets overwhelmed at times but the fact that I had expressed a good understanding of what my suicide would do to  my mother - that meant I was unlikely to actually follow through and that I didn’t currently have the mindset of someone that had given up on everything. I got really upset at that point and stormed out. I caused a bit of a scene at the crisis centre, shouting through tears that the place was bullshit. I ended up talking to a senior member of the crisis team and while he agreed that I had a point, he still gave a load of excuses of why the other woman had written the notes that way. Something about it just being an outline of my history and that I was just a first  assessment. I still ended up having her report put into my patient records and I’m pretty sure it set me back. I only got a diagnosis years after that and the crisis centre didn’t really do anything for me. My GP referred me to another team of therapists. But the crisis centre is where you’re supposed to go first and of course when you’re in crisis which at that time I was. I’ve been back there several times over the years and they never did anything for me. I went there when I was having hallucinations and all they told me was to make sure I stick to a sleep schedule- I wasn’t sleep deprived tho, at that time all I ever did was sleep! 

My experiences with the doc who actually diagnosed me was completely different tho but my experiences with the crisis centre has meant that I have just not gone there when I actually need too, like when my mom died very suddenly. 
Some people in mental health care just have no business being there. And there are many who just don’t have enough experience to be dealing with certain personality disorders. The doc who diagnosed me said that BPD is so board in its presentation that the diagnosing criteria just isn’t thorough enough in some cases. I have Quiet BPD and it presents very differently from other types of BPD. There’s supposed to be an effort going to reclassify BPD into subgroups and have diagnostic criteria for each group. But don’t know when that will actually come into effect. 

What your therapist said about self harm just shows their lack of experience with BPD IMO.

She shouldn’t deny you treatment JUST because you don’t have all 9 main symptoms. That’s not right. However, might want to consider (for your own benefit) the fact that they don’t always consider self harm as physically hurting yourself or attempting to end your life. Self harm also includes like denying positive things like socialization, or even exercise. It can be not taking care of yourself. It can be reckless behavior or behavior that can hurt you in other ways such as financially, like going to casinos or impulsive spending. This is what my doctor told me when I said I don’t typically have self harming behavior. After she clarified, I definitely do.

27,"Same here. Never engaged in physical self-harm, attempted once and survived due to mechanical failure. Many chairs have heard my story, not one of them got it right. Their biases and egos caused them to troubleshoot/diagnose poorly, they were dismissive. Their so called science is actually a subjective art which they dare not admit so as to avoid losing credibility. 

I say this as someone who has lived with this curse for over 5 decades. Quiet BPD it's called. It's real. I am a living example of it except for the ""self-harm"". Not one of them saw it, because they didn't want to see it.

No chair will ever be held accountable for failures unless they do harm to a patient that becomes actualized. No evidence of it? Didn't happen. Such is the world we live in. Accept it now or forever be angry. 

I gave up on staying angry about the failures of chairs, not easy in anyway to do so I won't say ""just let go of it "" because that would be insulting to someone like us. Instead all I can say is practice acceptance. Yes, I still get angry about it from time to time, hearing your story for example. But it doesn't consume me anymore, I refuse to let it.

The question is do you act differently today bc of what happened in the past. 1 Example: I have severe attachment issues and trust issue bc of what happened in my childhood and its affecting me constantly.

Maybe see a psychiatrist about it and also BPD comes with a lot of symptoms maybe search for symptoms of BPD and look if you can identify your self with it. Were I live you have to have 9 symptoms that are presenting in bpd to get diagnosed.

4,"Definitely. Getting the silent treatment from your parents is terrifying as a child!

Have you ever heard of the [Still Face experiment](https://psychhelp.com.au/what-does-the-still-face-experiment-teach-us-about-connection/)? It was a series of experiments done in the 70s. Up until then, the generally accepted theory was that babies don't interact very much with their parents, and any evidence to the contrary was parents projecting onto their kids. I'm going to spoil the description of the experiment, since it's pretty upsetting to read.

>!The premise is simple: mothers would interact with their babies regularly for a while, then suddenly stop reacting & look at the baby blankly for 2 minutes. And in just about every case, the babies melt down. They start doing everything they can to get their mom to react, then they start crying and shrieking. In some videotaped versions of the experiment, you can see the babies get so overwhelmed, they physically collapse.!<

So it's generally not good for babies & toddlers to get that kind of non-response. It's terrifying to them to have their caregiver physically there, but not interacting with them.

The reactions from the babies is extreme, and that's after only two minutes of non-reaction. You went through the same thing, but it lasted for hours. It happened more than once. That sounds overwhelmingly scary for a small child.

My mom would do similar - I remember a few times where she got angry at me and stopped talking to me, and I was so terrified I was physically clinging onto her and telling her I was sorry over and over again. It's a messed up thing to do to a kid. It's definitely valid enough for you to be affected by it.",crownemoji,19flqe2

9,"Definitely seek therapy if you can. Even without a diagnosis therapist can help you with the struggles your having. If that's not an option or you can't afford it try looking online. People who have the same symptoms and made progress in them could share tips and what helped them.

Also maybe look up DBP therapy practices. I was in a clinic specialized for personality disorders and that was the main therapy method that was used maybe you can find free courses or free exercise online. 

If you do get therapy also consider meds. I know it can be hard to open up to meds but it really helped me. Needing support from meds to feel stable is nothing to be ashamed of and trust me I've been there. Also thru being in therapy you could also get diagnosed.

Another thing you could do if its available in your country is taking a diagnosis test with a professional. Basically you get some answers sheets were you selected awnser from: yes this affects me a lot, to this doesn't affect me at all. Then you got truth some of the question with the one who is testing you to come to a proper diagnosis.

I’m wondering if there is a trigger? Can you do a chain analysis on it? It sounds like the wellness check would be the consequence on the bottom of the chain and the withdrawal/avoidance would be the target behaviour. 

Also, calling it “Silent treatment” the way you do here makes me curious about this as a punishment strategy for others. Are you angry? Is there fear under the anger that you are trying to soothe by withdrawing? Silent treatment is a destructive abuse tactic as I’m sure you’re well aware, but what is it about this tactic that helps you?

None of us can give you that answer, only you know your relationship and why you’ve stayed so far. I think the fact she’s beginning intensive treatment is a good sign.

I know my logical brain isn't the same as a neuortypical logical brain. There are fallacies in my logic based on my experiences and trauma.

I've known other people with bpd. A current friend, a recently former friend, and an ex was suspected to have it (they never saw a therapist). Now, the former friend had a boatload of issues and bpd responses I couldn't deal with and was setting me back. Being in her shoes I tried to make things work for a while. One thing my therapist said was ""if you expect some grace, why not give her the same?"" for example on things like she couldn't remember or got defensive. That doesn't work when someone is blaming you for being hurt by them. My ex and I are on ok terms and I'm currently trying to figure out how to take responsibility for behavior that I had no idea was as harmful as I recently realized it was.

I am a neurotypical who have had a loved one with BPD.

I agree with you absolutly, it is a terrible condition that need special care from the closed ones,  but there should be conditions: The pwBPD must be doing their best effort to improve and take accountability for their own actions. If you see yourself taking a lot of care for someone and they are... just not giving a damn and diving harder and harder in spite, hate and jelously without the intention of stop... it just drives you mad. 

At least they should be doing therapy.

Also, special treatment should be defined. During a decade I told this to myself, that they deserved special treatment, and I cut off a lot of friends from my life. I practically eliminated all my social life -even with familiy members- because they were triggers. And the effects of this decisions still last today, years after. This was obviously my fault, but when you put yourself in other's boots it is hard to discern.

17,"a few days ago someone asked in r/nostupidquestions in why ASD wasn’t classified as a PD, and i think a little of the info on the replies would apply here.

pwASD are wired differently from birth, and their problems stem from the fact that they are expected to act like people without ASD and function in a world that wasn’t made thinking about their specific necessities. but when those were taken into account, pwASD flourished and could work as efficiently any other person. 

with PD’s like ours, our problems do not stem from the conditions around us or the way we are treated. they *might* have been the reason we developed BPD in first place, but people accommodating our necessities in the present is a futile effort; the problem lies within our very personalities. to put it simply, and though it is hard to hear: we are the problem, not the world or the standards people hold us to. the word can bend to our will but our responses will be just as destructive, because we don’t know how to handle things any other way. 

that’s why pwASD receive support in how to embrace and work with their condition in a world where their necessities aren’t the norm, while we receive treatment on how to change our way of thinking and coping mechanisms; parts of our very core. 

it fucking sucks we were dealt such a shitty hand, and i too sometimes wish we got “special treatment”, but it’s not going to happen because it wouldn’t do good to us. the best thing to do is to take it one day at a time and learn how to *give yourself* a break if no one else will. we have been through a lot, and if no one else will acknowledge it, then we need to do it ourselves.",obooooooo,10rzyzw

25,"One thing that helped me was adopting a 'live it like you chose it' attitude. Sure, you have bpd, and that sucks, but there are surely a lot of positive aspects of your life that you don't struggle with. Everyone has things that they struggle with, and everyone has a responsibility to handle those things personally. Try thinking of your bpd as the struggle that you chose to get through in your life.",ewillia15,10rzyzw
26,"I'm with you here. ""Too harsh."" Lol? You didn't say a single mean thing. Just straightforward facts. To me, this reads as, ""I know I need to take responsibility for my actions but why does everyone need me to take responsibility of my actions all the time?""

OP is right. It isn't fair they have BPD. That part is out of their control. The rest of it though... No one is holding you to the same standard as anyone else as much as they are holding others to the same standard they hold you. The average person you interact with day-to-day is going to not care or not understand or cannot be bothered to make your day a little easier because x y z. This is where your therapy and skill work comes into play. You have to enter or continue participating in a situation where you're often triggered? Work on skills directly involving those scenarios.

The people you keep closer to you? Your closest friends? Co-workers (closer, not by choice), certain family. The ones you choose to share your diagnosis with etc. Sure! They should give you the benefit of the doubt. They are in your circle. They should treat you differently because they _know_. In a perfect world? Anyone would give you the benefit of the doubt _the moment they found out._ ""Oh, you have BPD? I'll try to be a little more thoughtful with what I say."" 

If people in your life are holding you to standards you are unable to meet at this time or never wish to meet, you need to (when and if possible) change the people in your life.",DeadWrangler,10rzyzw
27,"I don't disagree, but they didn't say they should be allowed to treat people poorly. They said they shouldn't be expected to reach the same level of education and such, and I agree with that. BPD can absolutely fuck up your life plans, and people do tend to act like you should be able to just get over it. 

Plus, we don't hold it against people with some other disabilities if they're rude and even violent, like dementia, down syndrome and such. We expect their carers to deal with it. Not saying BPD is exactly like that (or that the way we treat carers is okay), but a lot of sufferers need _help_ rather than guilt and shame. As a society, we're not great at handling mental illness, therapy is unavailable to a lot of people and despite them being _ill_  and without treatment, we expect them to somehow suppress their symptoms and deal with them on their own. It doesn't work like that though, if we could just ""behave"", a lot of us would. 

On one hand, yes, it shouldn't be used as an excuse, but on the other hand it _is_ a disorder, it causes behavioural issues we _do not choose_, and many of us are doing the best we can and it's still not enough. It's like telling someone with a broken leg to just ""take responsibility"" and start walking. We wouldn't do that. If someone refused to go to a doctor with their broken leg and demanded we carry them everywhere, yes, we would refuse. But if there were no doctors, no one who would treat them, or they just won't heal despite treatment, we'd have some sympathy. We might still not carry them around if it ruins our own backs, but we wouldn't blame them for their misfortune.",EpitaFelis,10rzyzw

Assuming youre working on it & not having harmful blow ups on them frequently obviously. But once I’m close enough w someone I just have a straight foward conversation ab what my triggers are, what being mad looks like, and that I don’t mean the things I say when I’m like that. I tell them the best way to handle it is not engage until the next day by which point I’ll be apologizing. I also ask them what their triggers are. As in deal breakers, friendship ruining type triggers. Even in an episode I can usually not cross that line. 

Anyways- the takeaway is if your close relationships can’t do this with you, they’re not meant to be in your life. And that’s ok, not everyone can handle it. It might hurt but it saves you both from hurt in the long run. And the right ppl will come around 💛",livingtoknow,10rzyzw

0,"Hmm,

I'm only learning about MBT through your post.

Some quick sleuthing leads me to the presumption that these might be a little more difficult to find because of the nature of the therapy. It is specifically meant to have a more forward, common-sense approach than say, DBT. The latter being more instructional, clinical, with lots of homework and handouts (hence it being really to find free DBT handouts online).

These seemed like the two most valuable websites I could find from my bit of searching.

[One](https://positivepsychology.com/mentalization-based-therapy/#hero-single) and [two](https://www.annafreud.org/training/health-and-social-care/mentalization-based-treatments-mbt/mentalization-based-treatment-adults/mbt-resources/).

Please, challenge or correct me if I'm wrong. Again, only just learned what this is called. Funnily enough, I know my current therapist uses a variety of methods in our sessions depending on what the theme or topic is. I suspect some of these skills being used as they seem to be a lot of ways I've learned to manage BPD on my own before going to therapy. It is the ""common-sense approach"" after all! It feels very familiar.

Thanks for the opportunity to learn something and I hope you find the resources you're looking for!

1,"I don’t know what kind of job you’re working or if you are in the U.S. but the U.S. has FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act) laws that allow you to take extra absence or leaves from work and the company can’t legally fire you for it. Personally I have what’s called intermittent leave because I have really bad stomach issues and chronic pain and I’m basically allowed to take extra absences more than the absence policy allows. 

When I was really struggling with my mental health a couple of years ago I spoke with my psychiatrist and they helped me with the paperwork to take a continuous leave of absence from work I think it ended up being about 4 months in total. During part of that time I attended a program like you mentioned and then the rest I spent resting and attending regular one on one therapy and just getting back to myself. When I returned I just resumed my job and everything was ok. Been working for the same company ever since. I was lucky enough to have paid into short term disability insurance as well so I got paid 2/3 of my normal salary for the full 4 months I was recovering.

Your therapist sounds far too rigid, DBT is not the only type of therapy that can help us.

5,"Some form of psychotherapy is the only solution if you want to attack your BPD. I would agree with your psychiatrist on that statement alone. However as much as he wants to point out our black and white thinking, becoming a psychiatrist requires a lot of black and white thinking on his end to get through school and read this clinical study and this one. A lot of times it does not make them effective communicators or willing ironically enough to see the gray area themselves.

You are trying to change your personality. There is no medication for it, which leaves some sort of identifying and changing the thought pattern.

Yes DBT can do that. But you can substitute what DBT is trying to accomplish with other things as well. And at this point just the words DBT is making you sick. 

""Mindfullness"" for instance can be found in a number of spirituality areas. And I don't mean religion, although some have their elements, but there are numerous areas of spirituality to explore with a component that will do for you what DBT is trying to get out of mindfullness. Again, where many doctors are too caught up in their ""science"" to not see this component for what it really is.

Everything that goes into DBT and what your therapists are hoping you accomplish: identifying your past traumas, identifying the triggering behavior, avoiding applying your past to your future, tricks for calming down in the moment. All of that can be found in numerous other areas. 

Sometimes the 6 weeks of this, 2 weeks of this, their worksheets, all of that, it just isn't clicking. Where sometimes a good book, an emotional movie or someone else sharing a personal story will resonate in your mind. It will make that hamster wheel click.

DBT was probably useful to introducing you to some things that have proven successful for lots of people with BPD to regain control of their emotions, which leads to their personality growing and maturing in a way in the same way other aspects of your personality grow over time. But that's the goal. But what gets you to make those connections yourself and take the steps to make these personal changes for your own benefit is going to be personal no matter how many workbooks they give you.",MainAction9667,1bj8alh
6,"DBT is not the only form of therapy that can help and ofcourse it might not work for everyone. Also therapy should be done when you are not in active crisis. You said you have PTSD and I needed to do some trauma work before I could work on my BPD but you especially can't do that in an active crisis. It sounds like what you need is psychoeducation on how to handle your active crisis.

I got only a very short course of DBT because of how this works in my country and now I am in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy because that's the only thing I was accepted into and it's working for me. My therapist also knows some techniques from DBT and they have been helpful too. DBT is recommended because it was made for people with BPD and has helped a lot of people w/BPD. That doesn't mean it works for everyone but sometimes it also might be a matter or therapist rather than mode of therapy.

Sometimes with BPD it's hard to sparse when is the right time for therapy due to the nature of the illness being rapidly switching between states. 

It sounds like your psychiatrist isn't really hearing you tho or taking your opinion into consideration and that really sucks. If you can change psychatrists that might help.",Typography77,1bj8alh

0,"BPD isn't treated with medication, only the symptoms are. BPD and CPTSD both require psychotherapy. 

Yes, defintley talk to your psychiatrist. They present similar, but there are some differences. Usually someone with CPTSD actually knows themself quite well, it's the trigger that brings up the trauma that sets them off at that point it can look like someone with BPD when they are triggered and have whats sometimes referred to as their Monster coming out. BPD is created by trauma from childhood, it doesnt have to be one certain event, its usually a longer lifestyle such as growing up with a parent who had a personality disorder. And theres where you get to the main difference, BPD is a personality disorder. BPD person can have self-image problems or will live and die through the relationships they make. They will then perceive and create the desctruive end to the relationship themselves. 

CPTSD will end relationships prematurely as well, usually over trust issues. BPD people have trust issues as well, but they will lie to themselves and others thinking they have trust the whole time with their partner or whoever, but at the same time constantly selfdoubting it and testing it.

The other poster is correct that there are currently no approved medications for BPD, only underlying mood disorders. It really takes a skilled clinician who has been working with you for a long time to make an accurate diagnosis, so definitely don’t trust anyone on here who tries to diagnose you. 

Regardless, DBT is actually still helpful for both and it doesn’t hurt to learn the skills. In fact, anyone can benefit from them. Really work with a therapist to identify the specific areas you need to work on and come up with some goals related to those.

This sounds off to me like it's not helpful.

Don't be scared about going into care it can be alot but it also can be the best thing being right there with the doctors nurses and medication.",fubzoh,1cde6km
2,"> why would you set yourself back when you’re doing so good for yourself. 

Treatment is never a set back, it’s always progress. 

The only experience I’ve had with private residential programs was for my eating disorder and I don’t think I was in a place where I was ready for recovery so it wasn’t all that helpful for me. I’ve had heaps of inpatient stays in psych hospitals and the majority of those were involuntary and while I was in an active crisis. My first admission was at 9 years old too and that was somewhat traumatising so I’ve never really had good experiences with those either. 

That being said, I think residential treatment can be extremely helpful and beneficial if you’re willing to put the effort in and be receptive to it, which it sounds like you are. It wasn’t helpful for me because it wasn’t my choice to be there, so I wasn’t engaging with it. I think your experience will differ to mine because of that. 

If you feel as if it would be helpful I recommend going.",vexingfrog,1cde6km

0,"I’ve been in many residential treatments over the last few years! It is a 6month to a year process most res don’t just let you leave without stepping down to another level of care- residential, php, iop5,3, op. Pls look at reviews when deciding where to go I’m not trying to be scary just make sure you voluntarily admitting to a safe space that’s going to foster healthy relationships and has happy clients!!- repetition of dbt + a solid routine and safety plan can be really helpful and was the stepping stones to my rout of recovery(I’m still in and would gladly talk to you about it). Dbt takes lots of practice you’re literally retraining your brain- it can be frustrating so don’t give up on the first go if things don’t work out for you, recovery is a process that’s not linear it would’ve saved me a lot of time to not get so hung up on my progress and instead look at all I’ve been able to take away. Treatment can be really fun and really hard- you make life long friends with the most interesting group of people, I have many friends I’ve gained from treatment and some centers I’ve been out of for almost 4 years now still talk to staff there.  
At the end of the day-
Treatment is what you put into it(as long as you’re in a facility that allows you to foster healthy relationships with others and yourself.) if you’re not putting in the hard work you’re probably just skating by I’ve done this it’s a waste of time(& money)- try to stay curious and have an open mind. 
For now my fav dbt skill for distress tolerance Is T.I.P.P it’s pretty common to use when highly dis-regulated emotions arise( I find temp to be the most gut wrenching pulls me out of almost anything situation) 
My fav skill for emotion regulation(one of the 4 sub cats of dbt along with distress tolerance, mindfulness, & interpersonal effectiveness) is check the facts- you can start practicing both of these in or out of treatmentn GL with your journey I hope this shed a little light on treatment and again if you have any questions feel free to reach out I have year of experience with this stuff (not an expert but bi-proxy it feels like I’m getting there) !!!! 🫶",Crazy_Set_648,18roxmt

0,"BPD usually isn't diagnosed under 18 because before then your personality is still mostly unstable and teenage years are considered very tumultuous in general, so not the most accurate time per se, to be assessing someone for an emotional dysregulation disorder. Also BPD is a pattern of behaviours, so doctors usually prefer to have a timeline of your behvaiours to show that it's chronic. They want to see if this emotional dysregulation and other symptoms last past your 18th or if it was just a period in adolescence. It doesn't make any difficult times during adoelscence any less valid btw, just means it isn't necessarily a chronic personality disorder. 

DBT is a good starting point! They teach you how to identify and manage difficult emotions, deal with interpersonal conflicts/boundaries, teach mindfulness, and how to deal with a crisis. It can feel really patronizing because it all seems very basic, self-care stuff, but it really does take a lot of practice to identify what you need to work on and actually apply the skills. You're usually in a program for 6-12 months but it depends on your program. And usually you have to do group meetings and individual. It's been helpful for me personally. 

I wish you the best & let me know if you have other questions!",rainbowlavalamp,191te6y
1,"Funnily enough, gender dysphoria has a longer standing, more universally accepted treatment protocol for adolescents than do personality and emotional regulation disorders. Emotional regulation difficulties and inconsistent sense of identity are already quite common in teens, so it's difficult to assert whether or not they result from a disorder and thus prescribe a treatment.

As for one on one vs group treatment, it's going to depend on your preferences (and there's no reason that you can't try both). Do you feel like you would get more value from individual treatment or from talking and listening to people going through similar experiences? But you also don't need group counseling to have that sense of community if that is important to you.",manofdays,191te6y
2,"Other comment is awesome and correct. They also hesitate to diagnose under 18 because the label comes with a lot of baggage and stigma.

I’d strongly recommend group over individual. You get to listen and help people through their problems - problems that you may not be going through yourself now, but likely have in the past or will in the future. You build camaraderie and see that you are not alone in this. And crying in a group is more comforting than crying alone.",cooldudeman007,191te6y
3,"Thank you for your response. I do believe that it is also possibly early for a diagnosis, but I do believe that the diagnosis fits. Due to trauma and other factors, it has always been harder for me to express emotions. But that isn’t all that I experience, I also experience as what I know of as splitting episodes and blackout episodes of rage. Is that something you experience? (out of curiosity)

For DBT, did you do both the group and individual sessions?",reeceneedstime_5043,191te6y

5,"It is early, but if it gets you into a helpful treatment for the stuff you're dealing with, then all the better right? I believe if my bpd had been caught and I was made to start working on my stuff when I was that young, I might've saved myself a lot of pain down the road. I also experience splitting A LOT, I would say it's one of my most prominent symptoms simply because it feels like the way I think about everything, and it's really difficult to change how you think and perceive things. But it has helped me a lot to think of ""the way I am,"" or ""the way I think,"" as just a pattern I've been following for years, based on trauma, and that it's not a concrete ""This is who I am and can never be changed"" type of thing. I hope that made sense!

As for DBT, I did both. My program made you attend 1 group and 1 individual setting every week. The group was so difficult (as someone with extreme social anxiety and paranoia), but going was really helpful. Even if you don't participate (which they probably will encourage anyway), it's very helpful to listen to other people talk about how they feel and experiences they have. I felt a lot less alone knowing I wasn't the only one thinking this way. I also have such a hard time expressing my emotions, so i really relate to what you said in your post.

1,"Idk, I think maybe at some point I did feel this way. You're right though, the highs are fantastic. For me though, I am so incredibly scared of the lows. It seems they get worse each time, and I don't really know how many lows I can realistically survive without doing something I'd regret. I think it's taken me time to get to the mindset I'm in now, which is complete awareness, of myself, my thoughts, my feelings, and my physical needs as well. It may seem mundane or muted, but I think that's the point. It's the mundane days that allow us to progress. It takes work, for sure. The results I think are worth it.",,1357uda
2,Me too. I feel so muted and different on medication. I love the highs too much. But I have a family who I have to be stable for. It’s so hard sometimes I just want to run away so I can fuck up my life without hurting anyone.,Sadsnail97,1357uda
3,"This is where I think therapy needs to refocus from fixing you to just helping you best understand your shit so that you can just figure out what your best life is. Individualized care. This person needs DBT. But then you, you just need to have a better understanding of yourself. You can build you life and people around that and those people will also be building you into their world.

I tried therapy and only got worse because we were trying to address it all. But I dropped therapy, assessed my life and everything a out myself, and realized I was in the wrong place. I'm still not in the right place but I'm in a better place. Physically moved and emotionally, things are more positive. I think there is a line in BPD where it isn't so much a disorder and rather a personality type. Understand yourself and build the life you want around you, don't try to do things or fit in places where you will always feel out of place.",AppropriateKale8877,1357uda

They can’t help you if you’re not fully honest with yourself and them. You can sign yourself in however I suggest actually doing the work instead of trying to get yourself out. They can hold you if they feel like your a threat to yourself or someone else. There is a way to get out however it would be much easier to just work with them.

Splitting is changing the normal happy lens to a super insecure and protective lens which comes out as passive aggressive. She’s doing a good job handling it by asking for time. She needs reassurance but space to soothe herself. 

It’s hard to cope when the trigger keeps coming back. You unknowingly triggered her and that’s okay it happens, but now she has to reconcile. Your anxiety might be making that difficult. 

My advice: send her one mature, compassionate and reassuring message saying that you made a mistake and you are here for her and you will give her space to cool down but if she texts you’ll be right there for her.

2,"The game they'll play is putting you under a ""service"" then a waiting list where you will wait to receive inadequate service after 6months + if youre lucky. you'll have to be strong and demanding for a chance in getting what you want because they'll try subdue you by saying ""oh you're under service"" escalate their commitment to provide service by demanding your needs aren't being met. You'll likely be ignored but take your complaints to any and alll who have power to pressure them. 
Or you can remove reliance of them and start dealing with it yourself completely independently and ask questions here if you get stuck.

0,"I’ve done it a bunch recreationally. For me it depended on what type of K it was. Sometimes it would have a drunk lighter body high feeling and other times it would be a trippier mind high experience. I’d say as far as the extent of feeling better goes it really was only effective under the influence of k but if I did too much I’d k hole and kind of dissociate thinking I was in a different dimension haha, that was also while doing other things. The positive of doing k for me in light doses was that it DEFINITELY helped me feel less depressed the days I did it and it helped me quit an alcohol addiction I had. I’ve never done it medically but I totally want to. I think the experience would be different and it’d probably be worth the money. Until then I guess I’ll just keep doing it recreationally",ThanksN00bN00b,vinq1w

I go through these periods where I feel excruciating emptiness (like I have no content, am just a body with no soul) and a total lack of emotion and all I want to do is die - my suicidal ideation gets so intense and persistent.

8,"Hey, thank you for waiting! And yes, I’ve been diagnosed with BPD and clinical depression but I would say most of the issues I have are due to the BPD. The depression for the most part is stable. To start, I will say that I have been trying to find words to describe the experience, but everything I can come up with just falls so short of how intensely healing that first session was. So I’ll just start by giving you a list of some of the initial benefits that I’ve gained since the treatment. 
First off, the most remarkable change has been an almost complete lack of suicidal ideation. I cannot put into words at all how intense my desire to end myself has been for so long. (Just check out the post I made around my b-day in Feb and you’ll have a bit of an idea of how it was) Even up until the second that I pulled into the clinic I was imagining just crashing my car into a wall. It almost gave me comfort to even imagine my own death. Since leaving the office that day, I went from thinking about suicide every second of every day to just silence. It’s not that I can’t imagine hurting myself, but I don’t find comfort in it anymore, and so the intrusive thoughts have just gone away. Thinking about it now, even just imagining it just does nothing for me anymore, and I have to really push myself hard to picture it. It doesn’t scare me to think of dying, but I can wholeheartedly say that I want to live. The desire to die has just been neutralized. This is a big thing for me as this was the main thing that I went into the trip with full intentions towards healing. But I could never in my wildest dreams have expected such a night and day difference. 
That benefit alone would have made it worth it to me, but the way the drug allowed me to organize so many different thoughts has also helped me dissolve so many blocks that I’ve put up in my head in regards to issues I’ve wanted to run away from. All the relationships I was hiding myself away from, all of the responsibilities that used to terrify me, all of the ways I’ve been mistreating myself and the lives around me. It all became so clear, but it didn’t come with guilt and shame. It came with compassion for myself. I think that’s because I could finally connect my past memories with each other in a way where I could make sense of some of my choices in the past that used to make me think I was a bad person. It’s like every bad feeling that was making me run and hide, though still certainly present, is half as scary as it used to be. Like I now understand the balance that all of the hardship has brought to my life, and I can start to appreciate it rather than hide it away. I can finally care about things again. It’s all now bearable to look at, and I’ve already made so many changes. This has been a long and busy weekend and I feel more alive than ever. I’m not scheduled for my next session until next week since I wanna give myself extra time to process my first treatment first, but If I can get it into words, I’ll make a post somewhere about what the trip felt like and how I organized my intentions through the trip. If you have any other questions or if you ever need to talk feel free to send me a message! I will say if you’ve never had a psychedelic trip before it might be overwhelming the first few sessions as you learn how to move within the trip, but my best advice would be to not try to control the trip. If things begin to get scary, you can always try to redirect your thoughts, but if it doesn’t work try looking more closely at what it is you’re being shown and if you can break down the memory or vision into smaller components of what it is, usually you can avoid spiraling into darker thoughts. One of my friends said that taking Ketamine is like falling through your consciousness, which is certainly true with all of the clarity it brings. I’ve also heard a quote somewhere that Ketamine is like the bridge between consciousness and reality, and that definitely rings true to me as well. Last giant benefit that I forgot to mention is, I don’t dissociate badly anymore. I used to dissociate several times every hour, to the point where people have had to slap my face to get me out of it. I could be in the middle of a conversation with someone and next thing I know I’ve been sitting alone in the break room for several minutes because everyone already left while I was in the midst of an “episode”. But no, I don’t feel like I’m under water anymore. I’ve only dissociated twice since the treatment and it was due to a lot of stress all at once but it was very easy to get out of on my own. Not only are my memories clearer to me now, but there is a sweet silence in my mind that has brought clarity to me just being. I hope this helps, x",juicy_pepperoncini,vinq1w

Saying this from experience, as I had to go through this when I was 20, in school, in debt, and had a measley on-campus job that helped me pay for my car insurance and gas. Then, when I lost my health insurance, Medicaid became my primary insurance, and it saved my ass.

0,"Ive been mentally ill since I was a small child. At 17 I was diagnosed with depression and was put on an antidepressant.  It barely helped. Then I graduated high school so my kids insurance program from the state dropped me. I had to wean off of the medication because my mom couldnt afford it.

I went years without health insurance so I had a hard time finding mental healthcare. Honestly maybe I didnt try hard enough. College was rough. Depression,  intrusive thoughts,  rage, no sence of self, unhealthy attachment to guys, binge drinking.  A friend of mine was diagnosed with bpd and the more I disclosed what I was going through she suspected I had it.

I eventually started dating my husband and married him when I was 23. Things were rough. Jealously,  co dependency, raging out at him. I was honestly abusive. His first gf had BPD so he wondered if I had it.

Eventually things stabilized. Then my mom died in 2014. Slowly my mental health detoriated. By 2017 I had reached a breaking point and had insurance so I got a therapist and psychiatrist.  I told the therapist I thought I had bpd and she told me I was too nice to have it. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with ptsd and Bipolar 2. I was put on a range of meds over the years. I also went through several therapists. I was even hospitalized. 

In 2021 I had enough with my psychiatrist.  I got a new one.  He diagnosed me with ptsd mdd gad and adhd. He said he suspected a personality disorder as well but would need time to diagnose. By the end of the year I was falling apart and had to enter a partial hospitalization program.  The psychiatrist there confirmed what my psychiatrist diagnosed me with and added on the bpd diagnosis. My psychiatrist agreed.

I have found a great therapist who does DBT and I  am doing much better.  I too am 39 and only now beginning proper treatment.",coffeemuffins,ye1ea1
1,"Your journey sounds a lot like mine, although mine has been longer: first psychiatrist at 5, currently 60.

Diagnoses: Depression --> Substance use disorder --> Bipolar 2 --> BPD + Treatment-resistant depression + substance use disorder (currently in remission).

Lots of meds alone and in combination, but never getting real relief; twelve hospitalizations between late 20s and last month.

My latest efforts seem to be helping gradually but inexorably. I am feeling better and more in control than I ever have before. I'm treating myself better as well. The two are definitely related, but I don't know which is cause and which is effect. Frankly, I don't care -- I'm just grateful for feeling better (when I remember to feel grateful).

I don't know about *Spectrum*, but I too am treating my BPD by combining a few modalities in a structured program as well as more treatment specifically for my depression. In my case, it's DBT + transference-focused psychotherapy + medication + meditation + mood / sleep / meds tracking + ECT. 

I'm glad you're working on yourself, and hope that you also find relief in whatever way works for you. It's a long struggle to find what works, and it's different for everyone, but we can recover.",,ye1ea1

2,They say the treatment is six months with the option to extend to nine or twelve months but when you go to them after six months they say oh we actually want everyone to do 12 months.  My psychiatrist was Andrew Zimmerman. He was awful. He made me feel like I had absolutely no agency over my body. I begged to be put with someone else. I'm a rape survivor and I said he made me feel raped. He demanded that I retract the statement and agree to keep letting him treat me or he would kick me out if the program. They don't let you have a healthcare proxy. They won't talk to your family to help them and you understand your treatment. I was put with a male individual therapist which made me very uncomfortable. I begged for two months to be put with a woman before I finally gave up. The reason they have such success is because everyone who won't be a success story drops out or gets kicked out.

I have super super severe ADHD and I don’t doubt that I’d be 5 minutes late or that I have to keep one foot down on the floor.. I also didn’t really resonate with the lady who would be my therapist. They also said that they would try to ween me off stimulants and I don’t really take too many meds often but it didn’t make sense that someone with ADHD wouldn’t be given ADHD meds. It just seemed like I would be further traumatized from the experience! I don’t know if I have a personality disorder but I do know how much ADHD impacts my life and I wasn’t sure if the program would attack those issues. Without this post I wouldn’t have been able to gain the insight needed though 😭 so thank you so much!!,unforgettablebaby,17w5b33

2,Yes it is normal for the rage to come and go. Same with the black and white thinking. It always seemed SO real like its always the way I felt and it was just me being fed up....then it would pass and I would feel like a complete jerk / idiot and totally confused as to why my brain was doing it. I thought it was pms. But turns out the problem was bigger. Definitely switch psychs if you dont feel its a good fit. I was afraid to because I thought I would be judged or somehow they would communicate with eachother and come to the same conclusion but that didnt happen. Clean slate and this one is much better! You dont even need to tell the current one your switching....just ask to a schedule with a different provider and it shouldnt be a hassle.  One thing I did after blindly picking one and having it backfire was making sure to look at their online profiles.  Some specialize in specific disorders further than just depression and anxiety. Or they will list their interests in things like mood disorders and such. That tells you they have better understanding of more complex issues. Just like a regular dr....some are family practice (know a little about alot) or they are specialize in areas where they know alot about a little 😁 because they are interested in that area more. Sorry for the looong answers. I have been around alot of drs. As coworkers :) they tend to be more open in what they know and dont when you work with them vs a patient. 😁,kalkat_99,f311yp
3,"Therapy works if you have a good therapist. I've dealt with so many that weren't good, but when I found one that was it was life changing. DBT/CBT definitely helps. You're not doomed forever, if you keep working towards it it will happen. I found that philosophy and psychology books helped me big time, as well as listening to talks from Alan Watts and Ram Dass which you can find on YouTube. And I am not recommending it, however, psychedelics like shrooms and LSD really helped me and shrooms has been proven to help significant depression even in terminally ill patients. Might be worth looking into but there are considerations you need to take into account if you do. Bad trips are no fun, 90% of mine have been good. It comes down to mindset and other factors.",Nietzsches-Burden,f311yp

BPD takes time to improve, but treatment does work.*   I hope this answers your questions   CBT from which DBT is derived and MBT are other methods of treatment that have shown some success in treating BPD, but I don't have stats for those.",damag3d_g00ds,f311yp
5,"Meds definitely are a big part of what keeps my bpd in check. Some articles I have read say that people can cope or cure their bpd with DBT alone. I was definitely not one of them. The symptoms I found are the worst for me are my impulsive actions (got myself in over $12,000 credit card debt at least 4 times 🙁) and my anger.  I have been trying to find the right combo of meds since I was about 21.  I am 37 now. I didnt get diagnosed with bpd till 32 though so I had a long time of just antidepressants only. I think the only reason it takes so long is because of different symptoms or reactions and finding out which works for you.... anything activating makes me super irritable. Depakote worked wonders but made my hair fall out. 3 other mood stabilizers caused kidney / urinary issues. Its really just trial and error. Right now I have found that Cymbalta with a low dose of lamictal works good. Dont be afraid to switch psychs! I had to ditch my last one cause she was dismissing the severity of my symptoms and throwing random meds at me. Most which made me batshit crazy and suicidal (which I never have been!)

Ugh, I hate that doctor so much and the exam was really expensive. I think it went for nothing, too, because it’s like those quizzes you find online for what mental illness you have.

The psychiatrist I was seeing pumped me so full of Lamictal I literally couldn't function. So, I was turned off, even scared of meds for a while. But I have a really, really good GP. I honestly trust his opinion far more than the psychiatrist I was seeing. The man is just a wonderful doctor. He has treated many patients over the years for BPD,  and is completely open to listening to my input as well as the willingness to try different approaches. So never be opposed to seeing different doctors, and just get more opinions. I'm a severe type B alcoholic, and when I'm on meds that are working it helps me stay sober. It just does, and I feel way better when I'm stone sober. But that's just my experience. I don't have MDD, but the BPD just makes me freaking miserable. So the right medication helps to keep my spirit higher and my mood from plummeting. Meds won't solve all of my problems, but I have benefited from keeping an open mind to them.",,f311yp

Fill your schedule with healthy things, don't leave any downtime. Dedicate yourself to running that schedule. Schedule in cooking meals and those things.

There are no FDA-approved medications specifically authorized for BPD. However, BPD is a social malady: it typically brings along friends. 

Pharmacology helps in addressing the impact of co-occurring conditions: for example, SSRIs for depression, Xanax or Valium for anxiety, modafinil or adderall for ADHD, and a fistful of stuff for bipolar and psychosis.

Therapy is the chosen treatment path for DBT itself: this, along with being intentional about lifestyle, can help tremendously over time.

I was misdiagnosed for years and put on a variety of antidepressants that barely scratched the surface. Don’t allow a doctor to be blinkered in their outlook.

It's a cruel trick of nature that we start to get better, the therapy is really paying off, we're building healthy routines and coping and *want to live* around the time our health starts to catch up with us.

It's the stress. Stress is a killer, and we are just about the most stressed out people on the planet. I used to joke that I would die of a heart attack in about ten.. nine... eight... seven.. if I didn't learn how to chill the fuck out. Turns out that's not really a joke, the constant ups and downs and anxiety does kill you faster, that's not even factoring in substance abuse.

I (27F) say this because it’s a luxury that I’m so thankful I was privileged enough to have. Not everyone does and even more not many families are as supportive. BPD doesn’t go away, it’s for life. Right now you’re 21 with your parents support and the opportunity to quite literally dedicate all your time to learning how to manage and thrive with BPD. Better to dedicate the possible max. 2 years to focus on building good habits, DBT skills, etc. than your whole life trying to break developed behaviors.

I was in college and had an attempt about a month before my winter classes resumed. I went to the hospital for a week and was out. I was feeling much better, I was doing much better. When it was time to go back to college, I decided I would go. Everyone around me, including my therapist, encouraged me to take some time away from college and just focus on getting better. I had a history of bouncing from rock-bottom to seeming great and I refused to see it at the time, so I went back. I did great for the fist couple months, but by March I had a failing grade in all of my classes because I fell right back into a huge depression and many old ways. 

I know how good it feels to think you've bounced back so quickly, I do. But after I failed out of that semester, I focused all of my energy on keeping a part time job and doing the work in therapy. 

Three years later, I can happily say that I am returning to college and finishing my degree. I focused on my mental health and learned so many skills that I use daily to keep my head on straight.

Medication has really helped me. If it's something you think might help you, see your primary care physician and tell them what's going on. They can refer you to a specialist that'll get you what you need.

From there you should probably figure out what is affecting you the most and will have the most impact on your life and work from there.

i guess what im saying is i know you want answers and its hard not having them but mental health is a life long journey even a diagnosis tomorrow may not be of any use because you could wait months for therapy or be hopping medications every other month for the next 20+ years. its hard but its what were stuck in",Questetheincubator,s6v964

The other says you'll be unable to help care for your children forever, and your partner will need to completely fill the hole you've left while all of them struggle with grief and guilt.

My husband is supportive of this plan (for now), as he has been dealing with this our entire 20 years of knowing each other.

8,"Ok, I'm just going to itemize this since I'm almost 100% positive this will piss you off. If so just discard.

1. Is your relationship with your Doc, um, ""irregular"" in any other way? Because I have to tell you none of this makes any sense from a professional's point of view. I understand the telehealth thing sounds like a license risk for the doc. Would you like to know what else is? Suggesting someone leave their entire family in another state to see you specifically. So it can't be about protecting a license because if something happened to you or if something didn't work out he is handing your husband a malpractice lawsuit and his license. Just throwing that out there. 
2. Quick google showed MA law this year said no specific barrier to in person providers had to be documented to do Tele. PO box or cheap address you don't actually live at in MA seems way cheaper than what was proposed. See item one for ""Doc's license"". It's already at risk.
3. How often are you seen? once a week? Twice? I see round trip tickets for around 100 bucks. That would take a lot of travel to even come close to being as expensive as living in Boston, I assume. 

I'm immediately suspicious of the doc and there is no nicer way to put that. That said traveling TO there seems cheaper and less disruptive on your family than moving and traveling FROM there. I mean at the end of the day no internet dude knows what is best for you or your family. Just my two cents though.",Seer434,pmkxdo

10,"I love the thinking out of the box! My doctor is very ethical so has already struggled with practicing across state lines while I’m struggling with SI so much. He has wanted to call the police to my house, but does not have the privileges to do so. He struggles with not being able to address safety issues. Additionally, he works for the top rated psychiatric hospital in the country and would be a huge liability to them.",sure_to_fade,pmkxdo
11,"I can absolutely appreciate your perspective. I also understand that the situation does come across as being odd. 

I’ll address each item. 

1. Our relationship IS “irregular”, however not in an unprofessional way. Over the years of not being directly treated by him, he has served more in the role of a mentor, life coach, consultant, etc. He has graciously provided guidance while being careful not to cross into what anyone would consider actual treatment. His suggestion to uproot our lives comes purely from my begging and pleading to figure out a way to continue to be treated by him. He has been given an extension from his boss to treat me while we find alternative care, but I’ve been searching for a therapist since leaving Boston and have yet to find someone who is able to make a difference. Treatment resistant would be putting it lightly. He also has a lot of trust in me that, if I were to move there, I would maintain my safety. Rightfully so. I would owe him at least that. 

2. He would never go against what’s right both ethically and morally. He already struggles with this given my safety concerns and his powerlessness to intervene. It’s one thing to place trust in me at the risk of his license, but it’s another to knowingly violate the rules of his hospital. At this point, he MUST be licensed in my state to treat me beyond the date given by his boss. 

3. I’m currently seen once a week. He is proposing 2-3x/week when his schedule allows if I were to be there locally. Round trip tickets from here to there are well over $300. It doesn’t make sense both financially and logistically to fly back and forth that much. Additionally, I’d like to do the intensive outpatient program. This is actually what initially led us to the thought of relocating. That program REQUIRES a 6 month commitment. But it’s $8k for 6 months vs $90k+ for 60 days of residential in the same program. I can handle $8k plus living expenses. I can’t do $90k.

I hope that clarifies things a bit. Again, I do realize it’s a unique situation. He is very much trying to help me within his ability, and it is MY insistence (and suggestion) that has led him to this proposal.",sure_to_fade,pmkxdo
12,"I was hoping it was the clinic administration that was the stickler for the rules, not your therapist. 

As you said in your post, 6 months might seem like a long time, but if you don’t get the help you need your family could lose you for the rest of their lives. When you consider that, 6 months is a reasonable investment in your health. I think if your family can afford it you should go to Boston. 

Is there any chance your whole family could relocate for 6 months? Could your husband work remotely? I know moving a family interstate is difficult, but again their lives might be radically changed if you don’t get the treatment you need.",Nervous_Seesaw_5393,pmkxdo

I have considered a permanent move to Boston on many occasions, but the cost of living along with my husbands inability to walk away from the family business means that it’s just not in the cards for us.",sure_to_fade,pmkxdo

It’s tiring but I’ve found in physical heath hospitals (I have fibromyalgia so am familiar with them) if i feel they’re not listening to me or think I’m exaggerating (attention seeking in their words) I call them out on it.

I was 15- almost 16. I was there until a month before my 18th birthday. I was told I'd be there for 6 months...
I did not go willingly. I was in the hospital for 11 days when two people - a large man and, maybe by comparison, a small woman- came and picked me up around 4am. They told me I had 5 minutes to get dressed. They took me on a plane and then dropped me off with other people who drove me to the wilderness camp. I honestly had no clue what was going on.
I got kicked out of the wilderness program because I developed frost bite on my feet so I was holding the group up because I couldn't hike. They gave me too small of shoes, but too big of socks. I was given a choice: a place with cows or a place with horses. I love cows, but am terrified of horses. I picked cows... I got sent to the place with horses. I was driven there by transporters from wilderness. Never once did I see my family.

Whether I went willing or not, because some girls did, I would still highly recommend to never send your child away. This was the second worst experience of my life. It brought me so much pain. I developed BPD, so now I'm even worse. I only had autism & ADHD before. I feel that if my parents actually learned how to deal with my illnesses & didn't have me go on medications I didn't need, which exasperated my symptoms (causing anger problems, hallucinations, & depression), my life could have been so much different. I still talk to women from there. I've made friends for life, but it's due to our shared trauma from that place.

I developed flashbacks, severe anxiety, and became a completely different person. Girls were always running away and trying to kill themselves there. There was a reason for that. My only ever suicide attempt was there. I've become so scared to get help now. If I need to go to the hospital, I don't because I'm scared I'll never leave. Please, I beg of you, try to figure out something at home. Is he medicated? I was medicated for bipolar, when I have ADHD & autism. The wrong medication can do more harm than good.

1,"It's alright! Thanks for your reply.

She doesn't say ""hi"" back. 

As for the reason for the argument, I'll start with context.

She's my brother's sister. The house's owner is their dad. She had just vacated her house and said he could have it. I figure she'd ask for rent, but I started preparations to move there before any talks about it, which looking back, was a mistake. Then she got another tenant without a warning and they moved there. 

Looking back, it was extremely dumb and naive of me. And I shouldn't been so damn upset about it, and it isn't even normal of me to be like this. 

I figure it was because I ran off of my Effexor for a few weeks, because I'm too messy (ADHD).

So far, this wasn't a problem for anyone other than myself, but this medicine have the nasty side effect of making your emotions become a trainwreck. I was irrationally angry and sad about it for a few weeks. 

I didn't tell her anything at first, until weeks later I decided to explain to her by text that I felt hurt by her actions for not telling me before bringing people in, so I could make an offer and hopefully secure the house. 

But she didn't budge and we went back and forth until we riled each other up to the point the mean remarks started coming from both sides. It's hard to tell who started it, because it was a gradual build up, so it depends on who you ask.

Anyways, she had a bad splitting episode and that took me off guard. 

She lost it and I was like, ""sorry, I went too far, didn't wanna make you mad"". She replied with, ""but you did"" and then blocked me. That was the end of it.

Looking back, I'm unsure if I was entirely in the wrong, and she wasn't aware I was experiencing medical side effects. I'm not sure if it would've mattered.",Flowy_Aerie_77,191dgtu
0,"Hi! I'm currently in the process of admission to res and I've been to residential psych, rehab, and residential ED treatment before. 
I highly recommend seeking out a facility that offers a full DBT program. These are few and far between in the US, especially if you want one that takes insurance. Skyland Trail in Atlanta, GA is your best bet financially speaking, but you won't be able to smoke if you're a smoker. 
Be VERY careful about signing ROIs. If you have ever had an angry outburst in a hospital/clinic/any medical setting that would document this, DO NOT sign an ROI for them. It will make it very hard to get admitted. Most residential psychiatric settings have disqualifying symptoms; find out what those are ahead of time. 
In the age of COVID you're looking at a couple months on a waiting list at least. Don't get discouraged. I recommend applying to multiple programs because it is soul crushing to go through weeks/months of pre-admission shit and being told no and having to start over with another program. 
Be nice to yourself during this process, as much as you can be. It's very easy to fall into the hole of  ""I'm so crazy nobody even wants to deal with me"".

You could go the longer route, where you first go to a Hausarzt, and then have the Hausarzt refer you to a psychologist, and then the psychologist can refer you to a specialist. At least, that’s how I did it for my adhd.

Bad trips often do have more lasting consequences like anxiety.

In my experience it's easier to have a bad trip on mushrooms. They can activate darker parts of my mind, and it seems easier to get caught in rabbit holes of thought. So far LSD has been much more stable, but definitely stick to safe amounts or you can lose the plot a bit. It's good to have a babysitter you trust just in case. And don't try to work through all your issues, just go with the flow. Maybe a guided meditation would be good to start with.

5,"Yes psychedelics is definitely not something you should abuse. All the horror stories I’ve read about people losing their mind have been from people who take massive doses or who did them too regularly. I have read a few studies that claimed people who took a smaller dose regularly had mood and personality improvements that lasted 12 months after their last dose but I’m not sure how credible it is. Sadly, I do feel like I’ve exhausted all other treatments at this point. I’ve tried multiple different types of therapy from multiple therapists, been on countless drugs. Nothing has worked for me so far.",anime_slut_,tnrmn9
6,I’ve tripped 3 times in total and the last one definitely did not start pleasant. I 100% think it was my fault since I didn’t really want to take them and had already been anxious that day. I had a lot of anxiety and uncomfortable breathing for the first hour. I definitely learned my lesson and now will only take them when I feel completely ready. I would love to try LSD but I doubt I’d find it in my area. It took me months just to find shrooms. Thank you for the input!,anime_slut_,tnrmn9
7,"That's why proper psychedelic therapy needs integration, one great experience can create the right emotional context to change your life, but needs to be followed by therapy and integration in order to be truly a game changer.",Dont_Blinkk,tnrmn9
8,"Macrodosing and microdosing are different things.

So far there are two main approaches when it comes to psychedelic therapy:

Macrodose (aka full psychedelic experience) with therapists in a safe environment, **ONE** session **FOLLOWED BY MONTHS OF THERAPEUTIC INTEGRATION OF THE TRIP** which are essential to a proper integration and use of the experience.

Microdosing: taking a **NON PSYCHEDELIC** dose regularly with specific regimens and cycles to follow. 

Of course if you are mentally ill and take psychedelics out of a therapeutic context with arbitrary high doses and regimens you are at risk of making your problems worse.

Microdosing with correct dosage and regimens while seeing a therapist every week or doing proper psychedelic therapy sessions are another thing.

I think of the medicine as something to help the symptoms and therapy as something to help the roots of the issues, ya know? I’m a big believer in the effectiveness of therapy. Not every therapist is a good fit though, not to mention all the other obstacles (like insurance and stigma and avoidance). Therapy has helped me immensely but only really started to help when I was able to let myself fully engage in the process. Watching other people in group therapy helped me a lot bc I related to them and I could see that these things helped them so I decided to plunge right in full force and do all the things that make me feel dumb lol",hhfajabags,mybn64

Sounds like you made the best choice for your family and the only one who can get your ex to help is going to be herself, unfortunately. and trying to get help is just the first step, there are so many hurdles to cross after that, US health insurance and our terrible mental healthcare system if you’re also American, like me.",hhfajabags,mybn64

Best advice I can give is be honest. If it is someone you care about, or who cares about you then just tell them the truth. Just be upfront about it, if you need help ask them for help.

Trusting people can be hard but sometimes you have to take the leap, just be upfront with how you are feeling. I will say though always trust your gut, it knows when someone is off lol. Text or even written letters can make it a lot easier if you are feeling anxious about certain topics in a relationship.  If they care they will be understanding and appreciate the honesty. If not?

Yesterday I asked a friend to let me bring her son to the park to play with my kid. She decided she was going to bring her 4 year old( my daughter is almost 9) and she always expects my kid to wait up for her 4 year old and it basically means my daughter can't have as much fun. I got stressed trying to figure out how I could ask her for it just to be a playmate with her son, but ultimately didn't out of fear of confrontation and making her mad or uncomfortable.  


After that I became extremely sensitive to loud sounds, and any external stimulation. So I started yelling when my daughter was screaming about a spider like she was about to die. 

I stopped and realized it was just the emotions of rejections that I was just feeling from telling my friend how I felt that made me sensitive. 

After that, I was able to compartmentalize that emotion, and calmy deal with the spider while my daughter was freaking out.

1,"Comorbidities such as anxiety and depression can respond well to medication - if you find that you suffer from them, using medication to lessen their impact on your life can make it a bit easier to tackle your BPD symptoms.       


In terms of BPD itself, therapy is generally agreed upon to be the most effective method of treatment. Dialectic behavior therapy (DBT) is helpful for a lot of people with BPD - it was specifically designed to help people with the disorder. It's a skills based therapy that helps with emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance, and mindfulness.       


I have heard that trauma therapy and regular talk therapy can help as well.       

It's important to find a therapist/therapy combo that feels right and works for you. It can take time to find something that clicks, or feels right, or seems like it will be beneficial for you.        




Just on a personal note, I believe that therapy can be very worthwhile to help with the symptoms of BPD. I've been in an intensive DBT course for ~8 months now. I still struggle a lot with some of my deeper-rooted issues (no sense of self, self-hatred, feelings of emptiness), but undoubtedly my life is better now for being in therapy. I'm still working at it, and I have a ways to go, but it genuinely has helped me a lot.",halikadito,pagtw4

The latter I struggle hardest to get help with since I rationalise and don't really care much about my actions, but I recognise on some level it's bad for me since I see myself being in prison, addicted to drugs, or dead if I don't get it under control.  

Initially I expected punishment or judgement with nothing useful to help me from therapy, but my therapist mostly works in prisons and says she is really familiar with things like impulse control, not thinking about consequences, etc. She has been pretty supportive but sometimes sounds unsure what to say and like she's trying hard not to judge.  

Most of what I've done so far is things like focusing on weighing pros and cons to try to stop living completely in the moment and acting on the intense emptiness/boredom that emerges when you aren't chasing the carrot and ignoring the stick. Finding ways to change my thinking, recognise my actions and their consequences, and to avoid acting on feelings such as aggression etc (part of this being pretty similar to dealing with feelings from BPD).

9,"I appreciate your sympathy and interest in working with people who have similar issues. 🙂  

There was something I read in psychologist Theodore Millon's book Personality Disorders in Modern Life about ASPD which I thought was interesting--when environmentally caused, it is basically reacting to what is perceived as a hostile world with hostility, with a patient giving her personal life philosophy as ""Do unto others before they do unto you."" I think it's ironic people lack empathy for the disorders that have to do with lacking empathy.

The way I see it, the attitude with stigmatised disorders like ASPD and NPD that are considered ""untreatable"" discourage people with them from recognising their own problems and seeking help, and that it's possible they are seen a lot differently in the future similar to how BPD used to be seen similarly. Definitely agree with them being most stigmatised--it'd be stupid to be open with my issues outside of somewhere like Reddit except maybe with my SO.  

Funny enough I was diagnosed with conduct disorder pretty young, but instead of it getting me early help, it was used as an excuse not to bother helping and to mistreat me which was part of my rationalisation against seeking treatment for years. Took years passing, symptoms getting more severe, some arrests, substance abuse, pressure from loved ones, to get help.

0,"When I went it was almost like a hotel stay with group therapy. There's a local place that's funded by the city that has a 5 day voluntary stay. Everyone had their own room but shared a bathroom in-between. No tv but you could bring books and what not. They used to let people bring unopened packs of cigs and food but they didn't let them do it the last time. No vaping either. Every 2 hours we got our phones for 15 minutes and had group therapy 3 times a day. We also met with a psychiatrist and our own therapist a few times. They fed us and there was a living area with board games and a tv and if you ever needed to talk to someone you'd talk to them in that area or talk to one of the staff, be that a nurse or one of the techs (they do the food and will wash your laundry and stuff). 

The 30 day one I had went to was the same except I had a roommate. Group therapy 3 times a day, daily affirmations and a therapist who we'd meet with twice a week but they were usually there 9-5. 

Honestly, sometimes it's enough to just get a reset. You can always skip group and just hangout in your little room if you're not feeling it but some places have different requirements for everything. Just don't expect to bring things from outside that can be consumed, bring plenty of books or board games and hangout and learn how to cope with your life struggles. 

The 30 day one really turned my life around. Really it was just the CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) they had us doing and hanging out people who shared my struggle.

0,"Hello friend. I was 5150'd a few months ago after an attempt. Inpatient was definitely helpful, but it was also horrible at some points. I was excited at first because I've always wondered what it was like and I thought I'd finally be getting top tier support from professionals, but that attitude caused more pain than anything for me because that's not what happened.

Other people should add in their two cents, but inpatient is a pitstop (I'm stealing lines from the super awesome nurse I had one day). It's there for when you're gravely disabled, a danger to yourself, or a danger to others. I thought I was going to get this awesome moment where my doc sits me down and walks me through some diagnosis I've never heard before and suddenly everything makes sense. Instead, my doc said I'm being a princess and that I'm so demanding and picking. Yeah he was a piece of shit. But a lot of psychiatrists are as you probably know lol, they're just trained in meds, not people for the most part.

The real healing started happening for me in the step down from inpatient, a partial hospitalization program (PHP) or an intensive outpatient program (IOP). In serious cases they'll try to send you to a residential program, but I managed to deflect that since it was my first attempt.

But even then, it was just a lot of group therapy in the program I went to. I was actually in their PHP voluntarily before my attempt (it clearly wasn't working at first). I made some changes like continuing to see my individual therapist while in the program whereas previously I hadn't been. I also just had an attitude change after my inpatient experience. Maybe it was because being hospitalized is validating in and of itself (I always feel like I have nothing to complain about and that life is this hard for everyone and I'm just a wuss).

The healing from the PHP/IOP I did was still mostly about stabilizing me so I wouldn't be a danger to myself in crisis. Getting my meds right and learning a few more skills, etc. Now I'm in a DBT program and feel like my real issues are finally being tackled and acknowledged. God I love DBT so much, ALL PRAISE MARSHA.

It's often short-term, less than 2 weeks, to get you stabilized and safe. Personally I've never spent more than 5 nights in inpatient. What you might find more beneficial is residential treatment, which is less acute, and long-term, usually 30-60 days.

It gave me intense panic being there and I actually “escaped” and walked down the street and borrowed a strangers phone to call my fiancé to pick me up. The best thing that helped me was an intensive outpatient program also called partial hospitalization . I’m an adult but I compare it to school. Show up at 8am and stay til 3pm with each day being different lessons. It gave me the structure I needed and I learned a lot while going. I also got interactions with people who have various mental illnesses and I enjoyed talking to them. I had multiple different therapists and also saw a psych once a week. I couldn’t do one on one therapy during that time though bc my insurance wouldn’t cover both. It took me about 3mos to graduate from the program and it did me so much good.

2,"i second dbt.

as for self awareness, i found it helpful to consciously try to bring things into my awareness whenever i could. overtime my awareness expanded to those behaviours without me trying and it became easier to notice when i was doing them which made it easier to address them.

so for the sake of this example lets say the behaviour you want to stop is stomping your foot but you don't even notice when you stomp your foot until after you start doing it and time has passed. to bring that into awareness you must reflect on it whenever you remember. so if you stomp your foot and don't even realize until 3 hours later; when you do realize stop and reflect on that behaviour. the more you repeat this the shorter the time it will take for you notice and eventually you'll be able to notice when you are about to engage in the behaviour.

Never give up. 

Learn how to reset your vagus nerve and have a trained counselor who understands internal family systems. 

Remember that bpd is just trauma from a certain stage of development that was complicated and pronged. Aka cptsd. So trauma therapies will usually feel meaningful. 

When buying books and reading studies and textbooks, focus on the most recent publications first because we still don't know alot but 10 years ago we knew fucking nothing comparatively. 

Also adhd and bpd have like 80% (I'm ballparking, I mean ALOT IF NOT MOST) of symptoms and many bpd folks o lying meet bpd criteria because living with unmanaged and unsupported adhd is really that hard. Especially if you are female bodied as adhd wasn't even recognized until recently and our research still doesn't cover it well. Aka the dsm criteria is all designed based off of our understanding of male bodied ppl. Anyways the deficits of hormones and neurotransmitter functions like dopamine overlap between both bpd and adhd and sometimes that devastate emptiness (not the shame and worthlessness but the joyrefusal, emptiness and lack of ability to enjoy,etc) is from a dopamine dysfunction and that neurotransmitters is what allows us to access pleasure, motivation, attention, function. So with medication some bpd folks don't even meet bpd criteria anymore. Not everyone but I find it irresponsible that all bpd diagnosis isn't followed but by an adhd assessment. 

The podcast adhd experts covers a lot of this. 
It's a podcast where doctors share the findings to their recent research - so even the doctors we see don't even know this yet unless they're hyper focused on new research which they just don't have the time to do.

Some of them are just counselors and are there to offer reassurance instead of investigation. With that being said, I think DBT might be a good direction to go in. 

Since it sounds like you want to know *why* you are the way you are and not just how to manage it, I think learning about how to use your brain better is a good option. There are tons of DBT workbooks out there ( I just purchased one called ""The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook"" by Matthew McKay, Jeffrey C. Wood and Jeffrey Brantley). Exploring how your brain works and how to get it to work *for* you is a different approach than CBT and I have heard it works far better.

If anything, it's certainly worth a shot. The most important thing to remember is that there *is nothing wrong with you*. This is just how your brain has learned to work and, if that's not working for you, you have the ability to change that.",YouProblem_33,pys21k

0,"I also smoke weed every day to manage my mental health and have done quite a lot of research on it, so if it's okay I'll put in my 2 cents.

Many studies have confirmed that overuse of marijuana is not a good idea if you suffer from BPD. It can absolutely mask the symptoms and make you feel a lot better, but it's a short-term ""solution"" that will lead to long-term consequences. Not only does it become a form of dependency/addiction which just adds to the number of problems we have, but moreover it exacerbates many of our symptoms when we're sober. We become less and less capable of managing our own emotions, something we already struggle with, because we keep taking the easy way out and smoking our problems away. But unfortunately we cannot smoke forever to evade our problems due to the health risks long-term marijuana use carries. Even if we could smoke forever, overuse of marijuana would, over time, increase our tolerance thus decreasing its effectiveness until eventually you cannot use it as an escape anymore. And then what? At that point we are left to our own devices after having relied so heavily on a substance for so long. Aside from dependency being a problem, studies have shown other direct negative effects of marijuana use on BPD symptoms (ex. memory loss being exacerbated).

I believe it is best to stop smoking for a while so you can return to your baseline self for a little while, let your BPD exist how it wants to without being clouded by substances, and then start to heal from the ground up. Then once you're a bit better, you can enjoy weed recreationally without developing that emotional dependency.

Long story short, it literally sucks, but coming from someone who also smokes weed every day, it is one of the many hard steps you'll have to take toward recovery. It's hard, but you can do it :)",premedidiot,ur57v2

6,"Hello!

First of all Ritalin is a prescription drug used to treat ADHD and is also illegal to take without a prescription, weed is the same for most places that legalize it for medical purposes only. Just thought I'd point that out and I've heard for people with ADHD it can be hard to get ADHD meds like ritalin because they are a controlled substance (my doctor was reluctant to put me on vyvanse due to having bipolar and BPD, but its helped me a lot after lots of persuasion and a proper diagnosis of co-morbid ADHD, BPD and Bipolar).

Anyway though, a reason why they may wait to treat you if you use drugs recreationally is because t**here maybe some people with borderline that you are in group sessions with you that are recovering from drug use** and discussing it or smelling like weed when you go into a group session ***may trigger them.*** Thats not fair to you to be shut down during a session you want to be open about and its not fair to them to be triggered while in recovery. 

Talking about drugs or going to the group intoxicated/under the influence of any drugs means automatic kick out as it doesn't create a safe space and may trigger people to use after. Thats what the rule is in my group sessions anyway.

Also **using weed can trigger psychosis in some people** and if your weed is laced with anything if you get it from dealers or its a different strain your not used to it can cause different and serious effects on your mental health/wellbeing.

You are getting therapy and if quitting weed and finding a healthier coping mechanism is one of the first steps to getting better treatment, its something you can work on with your current therapist. It can be a goal you set for therapy, and setting SMART goals (SMART is an acronym but I forget what it stands for rn) is a good thing to help therapy have structure.

We as borderlines like things done fast and like immediate gratification, and get more upset the longer we have to wait, *so I understand you being angry at this.* 

But this, being that policy the program has, is something you can't change so **what you can change is either quitting weed or choosing not to get into a program,** a program that can give you more healthier coping strategies.

***Im not saying it will be easy,*** espeically if you've used weed to cope for so long, but this doesn't mean you have to go cold turkey and doesn't mean you will be stranded without support. 

**My recommendation is work with your current therapist on ways to manage what triggers you to use weed** (as when we get triggered we tend to go for unhealthy coping mechanisms) and perhaps try to learn things to substitute those urges to smoke weed. 

One thing I saw was saying ""later"" when wanting to do drugs. *Its easier for our brain to say ""I****'ll have some later""*** *than saying outright* ***""no""****, but* ***keep saying later over and over again.*** 

Self soothing exercises, stimming and **distress tolerance skills** might help you cope in times when you may turn to weed to help you cope with the situation.

Do things that reward you for not smoking it, **like milestones mean treating yourself to something you enjoy that isn't weed related**, perhaps starbucks if you like that or buying your favourite manga or **anything that you enjoy doing that gives you feel good vibes.**

**You need to be at a level where you don't need drugs to cope before any therapy for personality disorders can be effective** as drugs can be seen as impulsive and also goes against one of the DBT therapy under emotional regulation: 

**PLEASE skill where A is ""Avoid mood altering Substances"", because mood altering substances, such as weed, can affect our mental state.**

Also if you are self medicated on weed and learning the skills, you may think you understand them or may think that they work but once you try going off of weed you will become dysregulated because you still will have that dependency on it, and the ***skills can only help so much if you have a dependency on a substance, which is probably why they want you clean for 4 months, so that way they know the skills will benefit you.***

Im sorry for all the judgmental comments***,*** I do hope you get the treatment from that personality department, but in the mean time I again ***urge*** you to try working on your dependency and any triggers you have that may cause it with your therapist as **you will still learn coping skills that may help you be able to regulate yourself more without the specialized treatment** (though that will most likely be the most effective treatment, the therapist is better than nothing)

**The choice is now up to you to give up weed or continue to not get the proper treatment.** 

Another way to decide is to do **Pros versus Cons** (feel free to do this with your therapist too as you know more about your situation than I as I am going off of what is in your post)

**Pros of staying on weed:**

* It helps manage my (your) anxiety
* I like doing it

**Cons of staying on weed:**

* I cannot get into the specialized treatment program
* I am dependent on it

**Pros of going to the program**

* I get treatment for my BPD that I am struggling with
* I learn healthier coping mechanisms

**Cons of going to the program:**

* I have to wait longer to go
* I have to quit weed

And then add the rest depending on your personal situation that you didn't tell us about here.

**I really hope you the best in this, please do what you can for your own mental health.** *You can't control their policies, but what is in your control is whether you follow them or not and that choice may also determine how your treatment and mental health goes.*",TheoryAddict,ur57v2

13,"While we're all in agreement that a weed dependency can still be harmful, I find it incredibly distasteful of them to deny you outright.

The idea is for therapy and DBT to teach you ways to manage your emotions during times of distress, and medication can be prescribed to bring you to a level in which you can apply this therapy. Often times, marijuana can be viewed in a similar role to medication (hence medical marijuana).

If I understand though, your situation is more recreational. Which is fine, and treatment can be done with a substance abuse specialist as well so as to bring down the frequency of smoking. From there, you'll have more opportunity to apply therapy.

If this is how they handle marijuana, I can't imagine what they say for harder drugs. Go cold turkey for 4 months? Seriously awful. I'm sure they'd not recommend that, but someone desperate enough for treatment might shoot the shot anyway.

It at least helps with an actual MH interview.

With cannabis I suppose it’s potentially problematic for finding best treatment. For example, if you could stop smoking and feeling fine, wouldn’t that be good?  If therapy is whilst on cannabis, then stopping cannabis leads to relapse, crisis potentially

I go take walks, run if I feel like running, cook, stuff like that that get my mind of the ""too much"" I know it sounds silly but it stills give some sort of dopamine release. 

Waking from a night of smoking after a really bad episode made the morning after even worst, and I would turn to smoking quicker. I re learned to enjoy smoking on social occasion, or when I feel fine enough that's it doesn't feel like a getaway type of thing.

And is your medical team generally on board with it or do they lean more towards suggesting you stop?

That oil can be used to help with muscle pain and anxiety though its expensive. However its like someone with ADHD buying a stimulant drug like cocaine to cope with not having a prescription stimulant and still getting addicted even though it helps with their ADHD (which is why, iirc, there is a high rate of people with ADHD who use drugs because they help but it can harm their chances of getting actual medication because it can look like they are 'seeking' stimulants. Just like them, OPs drug use is harming her chances at getting the proper, and healthier, treatment she needs)

When using weed as a crutch you’ll never be able to develop the healthy coping skills it’s uncomfortable but it’s worth it trust me I loved weed it was my sun my moon and my stars. Addiction is giving up everything for one thing, recovery is giving up one thing for everything.

177,"I think they do the 4 months policy as OP going to group sessions (which can be common in DBT therapy) either smelling like weed, under the influence of it or talking about it in group can create a triggering environment to people who are recovering from a weed or other addiction. It removes that safe space and this policy is to make sure OP is 'sober' from weed to help her treatment be smooth and also not affect other's healing journey.

My DBT group says if you come under the influence of any non-prescribe medications or illegal substances you will be removed from the group and may face repercussions from the clinic (the substances including weed despite it being legalized where I live, as it is the same with alcohol which is also a legal mood altering substance)

Not to mention using weed goes against a core emotional regulation skill taught in DBT (which is also the primary treatment of BPD) which is the PLEASE skill, specifically the A: Avoid mood altering substances (this includes weed). 

Not all skills in DBT work for everyone but PLEASE is a CORE emotional regulation skill and picking and choosing which part of PLEASE you do can throw you off and create emotional dysregulation. 

Even if it calms OP or others down it is only temporarily and can cause dependency in some individuals (not debating whether OP is dependent or not, but just stating it can happen). If you learn the skills while using weed then you may still be prone to use the weed to cope rather than the skills as you go to 'default', unhealthy coping skills.

I understand quiting cold turkey isn't good, espeically if its her primary coping skill from the past, which is why I think OP working with her therapist with the goal to quit weed and finding healthier coping mechanisms to replace the weed in the meantime instead of focusing on that specialized treatment will be the most beneficial. She can't change their policies but she can choose if she wants to quit weed and go to the program or not. Focusing on the goal of quiting weed and learning skills with her therapist rather than focusing on the specialized treatment will help in the extreme emotions she may feel regarding having to wait longer. 

I know because I wanted to start trauma therapy for awhile, but I couldn't due to not being emotionally stable enough to my mania triggering recently due to the change in weather and stress. I was SO pissed that I couldn't start the therapy and it was hurting me as I was so focused on getting that specific therapy when I could be getting therapy to help me cope thru my mania. I also triggered myself by trying to deep dive into my truama thinking I would start the one day and ended up not starting it, so to say I was salty was an understatement. I realized though that I was/am too dysregulated to cope with Truama therapy and I need to have that level baseline to start. 

The same can be said with OP having a baseline without the influence of weed in her system when she starts. They need to see and understand her baseline as it will also help them gauge what supports/treatment she may need.

Sorry for long ramble btw, My mania is currently in its hypomanic stage and I see my psych this afternoon and haven't slept all night so a lil bit on the rambly side (I tried to sleep because I did the PLEASE skill and took my meds which normally help me sleep but nada, rip)",TheoryAddict,ur57v2

I wanted someone willing to sit in the uncomfortable reality that it may very well *never* get better. Yet deep down I knew it probably would. Hearing a loved one express interest in wanting to just be there with me to internalize a world like that, one where things possibly never get better. Then it somehow feels okay. It bestows the kind of inspiration and motivation to want to improve the situation—for why not? I’ve already accepted this (terrible) reality, why not experiment with another one. And away you go.

Neurofeedback therapy supposedly works by “rewarding” your brain when your brain waves are in line - ie not showing signs of stress or
inattenton. You basically sit there with one of those qEEG caps on your head and watch TV or a movie, and the screen gets bigger when your brain waves are positive, which is apparently interpreted as a reward.

31,"Ritalin works by blocking dopamine reuptake causing a buildup in your brain, essentially you feel extra rewarded for the same task thus increasing motivation to do things. 

Your brain is always working to achieve homeostacis. So as you perpetually are taking Ritalin your brain lowers the amount of dopamine available to try and balance out to normal levels.   This lowered natural dopamine production for extended periods of time as your brain develops can potentially mean your brain will permanently have lowered dopamine at homeostacis which will present itself as worse ADHD than before you ever tried the medication. Poor memory, lower cognition, and depression are also possible. 

How much of a concern this is, is up in the air but it definitely is a concern and is more and more concerning the younger someone starts the drug.  

For an adult that's on a low dose it seems unlikely to be a real concern, at 21 I honestly wouldn't worry too much. Just take breaks from it if you feel yourself needing to up the dose. Don't let your doctor start the cycle of never ending dosage increases and drug switching. That seems to happen to a lot of ADHD people. 


Dopamine reuptake inhibitors typically aren't neurotoxic, but with dopamine releasers, permanent changes are a real concern. Be extra careful if they ever try to put you on anything with ""amphetamine"" in the chemical name of the drug.  Again, the dose makes the poison.

34,"I understand your reservations. It's very reasonable to feel like that. It is true that these days it takes around ten years to bring a new drug to market but I don't think all of that time was spent studying how people's bodies reacted to the drugs over time. Amitriptyline came out in 1961 and I'm taking a low dose, so I feel comfortable taking it. That doesn't mean it's risk free but the medication made a huge improvement in my quality of life and to me avoiding all risk is not worth going back to how life was before. 

For years it was very difficult to make appointments or plan outings with people or really do anything where I had to drive somewhere on a certain day because I never knew if I was going to sleep and be safe behind the wheel. When I'd say, 'Aw, fuck it!"" and dive anyway, many times I did stupid, dangerous stuff that I would never do while rested like turn left against a red arrow. When one day I almost got hit by a semi, it scared the heck out of me, and I vowed never to drive tired again. This meant that if I was tired on a day I had to drive somewhere, and I couldn't get anybody to take me, I was just screwed. 

Because like you I hate taking drugs, I tried so many non-drug interventions like mindfulness meditation, peaceful music, and calming scents, to no avail. But since starting the drug, my sleep problems have become pretty much a non-issue because I sleep virtually every night now. I have my independence back.

So, this is why I look at taking medication on a case-by-case basis, taking the particular medication and the person's situation into consideration.",sweetpotato779,c9i5of

I am really glad I was never put on Ritalin as a kid (was only diagnosed recently). I honestly didn’t need it then, my ADHD only really became an issue when I had to start adulting. The symptoms were definitely there as a child, but werent as noticeable when my mum was organising my life for me. 

I have to use it daily for the moment because I am on my trial period, but after I see my psych next week I should be able to use it as needed. I am planning on not taking it most weekends, and trying to limit  my use to 3 work days a week, as some days are busier than others at my job. 

Due to my past negative experiences with meds, I’m really not a fan of the idea of daily medication. One of the main reasons I was happy to take the Ritalin is because I know it’s short-acting and doesn’t have to be taken all the time.",,c9i5of

Lets take a random example, ice cream drops to the floor, my whole day is done and there is nothing i can do than cry and wish my life to be over (rly just random)

How i usually can cope with that is that i learned to ""build"" me a second emotional responce i can use as guildline how to react. This one is based on logic e.g ""it wasnt excessive, i can get a new ice cream if i want one"" or ""this doesnt makes my earlyer fun to nothing, i can get back there still"" and so on.
That also works with anger very well. When i want to act out on it i try to get a logic based alternative emotion and use this to act on which is never as agressive or impulsive as my first reaction would have been.

Bring up your concerns of mood swings to your psychiatrist and they may help you with looking into getting on meds to help with it.

I cannot stress enough the importance of having a therapist that is a. Reliable and b. Validates your concerns for bpd instead of dancing around the topic of diagnosis. If you have any issues with these it’s time to find a new therapist

I had done a mix of DBT and CBT in the past, as I had been diagnosed with depression and PTSD. I didn’t find what I had done had helped me that much. 

I find that schema therapy has really helped me understand what part of my feelings are being triggered and I can often stop my internalised downward spiral by asking myself “what schema is being triggered right now and why?” And then I can move on to how I get from feeling that way into dealing with it in “healthy adult mode”. 

I’m also not medicated, as I never found the right medication, and my psychologist and psychiatrist thought it would be best to not go on to any more.

Yes that isn't quite an accurate interpretation of the whole distress tolerance stuff (although I don't do dbt specifically). In my experience it's more like training yourself not to fly off the handle or break down in situations where that would have undesirable consequences. When you can handle mundane shitty situations in better ways, it makes it easier to react to your example of a 'legitimately' scary situation in a way that's useful, or that at least doesn't cause more harm. Like say, if you're having a bad day, your first reaction isn't going to be ""welp guess I'll just die then"" - whereas that might be how you think about it at the moment. It's not about telling you you're wrong go feel a certain way, it's more about not instinctively acting on that feeling and thinking it through a little first.

It isn't just for the benefit of other people though, it makes your own life easier when you're able to handle problems without them piling up and overwhelming you. I don't like the whole bpd label either, and yeah, the treatments do come across as 'reprogramming' to me as well - however, I would say it's overall been a useful tool for the problems I deal with.

11,"Yes, I did read those descriptions and regretted it, then wanted to read them again, then regretted it again lol. My mom and sister also have BPD, so it's not like I'm clueless about it being really tough for people around you. My main problem on that front is that I am just overwhelmed by everything, which tends to make me spew negativity left and right, which can be exhausting for the people around me, especially people I love and trust. From the outside, I look like a well adjusted lady, always chipper and happy (which is obviously completely fake).  

Obviously, if I do get a diagnosis, I will try it. What's ironic too is that I was already using some of the techniques recommended by CBT/DBT on my own (less formally, of course, but who hasn't heard of breathing, meditation or exercise to calm yourself down?). However, the idea of someone instructing me to do that just gives the the kneee-jerk reaction of digging my heels in: ""Oh, you think that will help? Well, I'll do it and it won't help, and then I'll be unhappy forever, that'll show you!"" Of course, that's completely ridiculous, but I just don't see how I could react any other way. 

I think each and every single one of these techniques feel like rejection/abandonment: you're not acceptable as you are. You're not enough. You need to change because you're a burden/a drain on society/you're not good enough. I have difficulty to imagine anyone, let alone someone with BPD, reacting well to that, you know? I guess many people actually do react well because they end up improving, but I can't believe I'm the only one having the reaction I'm having. 

The idea of a diagnosis and of doing CBT or DBT is causing me tremendous anxiety at this point and I'm basically more typically BPD than I've ever been, which I choose to think is funny instead of just being desperate.",DamnedDryad,cnarp0

14,"""I think each and every single one of these techniques feel like rejection/abandonment: you're not acceptable as you are. You're not enough. You need to change because you're a burden/a drain on society/you're not good enough.""

Mm that's an interesting point. I had those thoughts a lot when I was diagnosed, partly as a reaction to the shit that I read about people with bpd being some sort of hive mind of insidious, cold, calculating monsters incapable of empathy, and partly because the treatments sound like they're meant to turn you into a 'normal human' but you'll always be inherently tainted somehow. No one really explained it to me properly. Those sort of thoughts drove me to attempt suicide.

Since I survived however, I felt I had to be in treatment mostly because I 'wasn't acceptable' (eg not wanting to be an asshole). I did learn more about it in treatment and I while I still don't think labeling it as a personality disorder is helpful, I could at least understand the concept behind that. To me, it's not that a person is flawed beyond repair, rather that for the overwhelming majority of people diagnosed with it have gone through a shitty upbringing or some kind of trauma and it still affects how they navigate daily life. Your mind basically adapts to shitty situations and when you don't need those particular habits to survive any more, like self harming in times of distress or drinking like a fish, or even getting defensive and angry because that's the way you learned to protect yourself - that's when those things add up to a personality disorder diagnosis. I still think it's daft that we essentially categorise traumatised behaviour as a mental illness but that's how it is I guess. 

The idea behind the treatments for it is to teach you healthier ways to cope when things do wrong so that you don't get so overwhelmed by everything. You can handle smaller problems more easily and if something terrible does happen in your life, it's not the end of the world. I had to deal with something very painful to me this year (won't go into details here) and it's still something I think about regularly but it doesn't make me miserable all the time. I'd say if I had to deal with this a before I began any treatment, I'd probably be planning to kill myself. I won't lie and say the thought never crossed my mind but I was able to actually calm down and think it through properly when I did have these thoughts.

Your knee jerk reaction to being told what to do made me laugh btw, it's absolutely understandable, even if it does seem ridiculous. I was very much the same way. You're definitely not the only one who's had that reaction, I've met others who were very sceptical about the whole thing. If you are unsure about getting the diagnosis/treatment, you can still mull it over before trying anything. While bpd does affect others around you, the treatment is still primarily to help you.",gloriousgoldenass888,cnarp0
15,"That helps. Thanks. 

The more I read about other people's experiences, the more I realize I've already done some of the work myself. I still have a long way to go; it's like the volume of my internal monologue is stuck on max amd I feel lost without my bf (that's obviously not healthy). 

But there are behaviors that I see others report in themselves that I've grown out of years ago. I am 29; a lot of the really risky stuff, for exemple, I did in my teens. I must have learned something along the way, and some lessons were fairly cruel, of course. In all logic, this kind of therapy could help.

There is just something about being instructed to ""think happy thoughts, breathe and distract yourself"" that reeeeaaaaally triggers me. I wonder where that comes from.

0,"It sounds like you've had some bad experiences with therapy. I completely understand that, I've been through many similar things with many therapists. Therapy can help, but it's all about finding one that works for you. The last time I spoke to anyone (professionally) was a few years ago. I seemed to be running into the same issues... Either they treated me like a number on a page, they tried the whole ""don't want to do it- don't do it"" thing or they seemed to want to focus on one issue I was having, when i would try to explain what the real issue was. After a failed suicide attempt, I was involuntary committed to a psychiatric ward. When I was in there and I had a chance to speak to other people going through similar things, that seemed to help me. Now, don't get me wrong... I'm not saying fuck therapy and just talk to others going through the same thing. Maybe, try to get to know others who are going through these things and talk with them. Sometimes (in my experience) I felt better/more safe speaking to someone who I knew (or at least thought) wasn't judging me, wasn't just looking for the one correct answer to try to help, or wasn't just listening to me until my hour was up. There's never one correct answer, especially with this illness. However, maybe getting on a solid comfort level with a peer might help a little. Sorry I rant.

1,"Wow. Long road. :(

Good for you for still being willing to travel the path.

For me, I'm pretty new to therapy too. In the past it has felt the same way, where you're just explaining and explaining and explaining but never ACTUALLY getting anywhere. Running on the spot. So I tried it casually here and there but didn't actually find someone I connected with who I felt understood me and gave me value.

I think one interesting thing about BPD (I'm no expert, but just based on what I've seen!) Is that we crave validation. Makes it a bit tricky because therapists seem to be trained to not give in to that. Haha I found that challenging. The therapist that I feel understands me does a mix of validating my feelings while correcting me when I'm wrong - recognizing that I seek out someone who can make me decisions for me, and being supportive for me, but not so supportive that I can't stand on my own two feet.

He's suggested I go into a group therapy program since most of the problems I'm having are relationship oriented (friends, partner, etc.) and how can you resolve relationship difficulties.. alone. Lol to be fair though, you did you're introverted so that probably sounds terrible hahaha

I don't know if that's an option but I'm personally really excited to see how it works. I've also been working through the DBT workbook and following Brian Barnett's group on Facebook to get a lot of perspectives and improve my options when it comes to reacting to things.

I'm sorry you're crying every night. We're here for you bud. :( Stay strong, it's one step at a time. Not every step will be a good step but the ones that are will get you closer and closer to that future person you want to be. ",compassionatevillain,9rrxt8

I dislike people as well, it's very hard for me to talk to people and especially open up. I find that it's usually the smaller groups who gave the more sincere people in it, the people that have really been through some shit and the group leaders who aren't don't it for the money - but they're actually doing it to help people. I personally went to night group time, I felt the day wasn't for me. It can be difficult to find one in your area. Especially since BPD is commonly misdiagnosed as the wrong thing (not saying yours is). When I would go some groups though it felt like they were trying to diagnose me with something else, like I didn't belong there. I did find one that accepted me  though.

1,"The facility you're going to should have a packing list available if you ask. The last time I went I remember we couldn't have clothes with drawstrings - if you brought them they'd cut them off or they'd keep them in your suitcase and you could only get them once you discharge from the facility.

I'd say bring a journal (NOT a spiral bound one). Also bring some pens. One facility I went to didn't allow retractable ones, only ones with caps. Bring some markers and adult coloring books maybe? Helps pass the time! Bring paper, envelopes, and stamps so you can write letters to your friends and families (if the facility doesn't let you keep your phone).

I've never been to a facility that lets you have your phone or laptop. You can bring them but they'll be locked up until the end of your stay. Though one place I went to had a PHP step-down program where you were allowed electronics if you did PHP.

I did go to one facility that let you bring a non-touch iPod or MP3 player (basically any MP3 player that didn't have Internet access or a camera). Being able to listen to music made treatment so much more bearable. You can probably find a cheap old MP3 player on eBay or Mercari for $50. Don't forget a charger and appropriate headphones/earbuds.

Also bring some books. I found fidget toys to be very helpful, too. Like fidget spinners or putty. Bring some pictures of your friends, family, pets, etc. Some places have a board you can hang them up on or stick them to a cubby. Bring a comfy blanket if your facility allows.

6,"Is that possible even though we didnt really argue at the end. I was cordial till the very end. My last text to her was me expressing how much she meant to me and how I viewed us. I never judged her or anything. Some days later she texted that she knew things were up in the air between us and that no matter what labels we had for each other, I was going to be an important person in her life, She would always love me and care for me...

Always treated her like a goddess, with respect. She would actually feel so down on herself and say I deserved better that she didnt know why I settled for her.

We were distant the final 4 months most conversations through texts and calls.",vaztek2003,6hiwpk

9,"Then it could be nothing to do with you. You can tell her all those things and it doesnt matter. She probably feels like she doesnt deserve someone like you and when something is that deeply ingrained, it doesnt matter what you say to her. You may have treated her like a goddess, but if deep down she doesnt feel like she deserves to be treated that way, you cant really change how she feels about it. If she does, she needs to get there by her own logic and reasoning.

It COULD be she managed to do something that I did not, and fully regret - realise that you feel very toxic and take yourself away from someone you really care about, so as not to keep hurting that person. Go away and get your shit together. Stop putting your shitty behaviour on others and be self aware of how you are impacting other people. If you truly care for her, make sure she knows how you feel, which is sounds like you already did, then let her be. 

I have OCPD and something that is very hard for me is letting things sit. If someone is upset or mad or hurt from something I may have inadvertently done, I have a dire need to fix it and make it right ASAP. For a lot of people this is not what they want or how they fix things, like my ex. They need time, for the pain to stop and to think with a rational mind. To take care of themself first and assess the situation. I know it can be hard, but it could be she needs time to just get to a more calm and stable situation, before she can look at it rationally. Dont take it personal, and try to just let it be. Even if that means she never responds to you. She still got your messages, she can read them if she wishes, and she can know how you feel.

You cant just wake up in the morning and say ""okay brain! No panic attacks today!""

In a more gentle way, I would say that sometimes you wont get an explanation, sometimes you will, and it can be that when either way happens, it may still not help you. I would say instead the only way is trying to find your own way to make peace with it. ",BPD_whut,6hiwpk

- ongoing support from an addictions counsellor and a psychiatrist 
- meds: gabapentin, trazodone, cipralex, abilify (before it was latuda and both have worked really well), and progestin (birth control but hormones definitely affect mood and stuff)

1,"Yes. The right treatment really does work. She’s going to psych wards as her decision and it seems she is trying to get better, which is the path to recovery! 

Some of these other comments are rather cynical :( it sounds like you love her dearly, and I’m sure she loves you too. Something stressful triggered her relapse, it’s not that she’s suddenly changed bc the honeymoon phase is over or something. It is definitely your choice and right to leave if she is abusive and not trying to get better. People shouldn’t endure abuse. It is anyone’s choice is leave a relationship for ANY dealbreaker reason anyway, bpd or not. IMO if you felt like she’s just with you to use you as a crutch, then you would also be using her distress. But it just doesn’t seem like that to me: you want her to feel better. 

Therefore, I just want to tell you that yes, treatment works. No, don’t be worried that someone will stop loving you if they are happy. If she would stop, then she isn’t suitable for you. If you didn’t want her to be happy because of that fear, then you aren’t suitable for her. 

Question; does she have any “lucid” moments? Being hurtful to you, even though it’s not really in her control, is still not good for either of you. Please take care of yourself too!! Taking care of someone else is kind but you must remember yourself too. 

Is there any method you can think of to protect yourself? Discuss what she can do for you, and decide what you can do for yourself. Example; if she can’t hold back hurtful words, can she write a letter to you with them then rip it up? You can leave the room before escalation (coming back later)? If she’s hitting you, can you two do things that help prevent splitting E.g. doing preemptive calming things like hot baths (if not in the ward) 

Best of luck. And please remember in case treatment isn’t working... it’s not your fault.",,empqiz

Until she hits her own personal rock bottom where she sees she needs help, nothing will ever help her.

Think of it this way. Others are telling you, you have problem and need to get help. They actively try to force you to get help so you do as they ask to shut them up but in your head, there is no issue with you at all and the issue is either imagined or it's their issue that they need to deal with.

0,Hey.  I have been in residential treatment for BPD and I also happen to work in the residential treatment center industry so I am fairly knowledgeable.  What questions do you have?,normalornotwhoa,56uq5c
1,"I didn't know that residential treatment facilities existed for mental illness and/or BPD. 

Is it like a psych ward?",babydonut,56uq5c
2,"I've been to a adolescent partial hospitalization program not specifically for BPD, but used DBT as the main source of therapy.  My experience probably will vary from a lot of other people, but overall I do think it was helpful.  They were understaffed (spent most of our time with three unpaid interns), but just having the environment to focus on mental health and all that without any external factors was nice.  You just need to ask yourself where you are in your life and if it's the right decision.  If you're having that much trouble in your life for your therapist to suggest it, I would say you should definitely consider it.  ",,56uq5c
3,"I have been in and out of residential centers for the past 5 years. The biggest thing to keep in your mind is that no place is perfect, and you will get out of it what you put in. ",,56uq5c
4,"I'm curious, what is the cost of living in a facility like this?",babydonut,56uq5c
5,"What was your experience like? Was it a good one? What made you decide to do it? Did it help you like you hoped it would? I'm looking at Timberline Knolls, suggested to me by my therapist.",library_ass,56uq5c
6,"They exist! From what I can tell they aren't like a psych ward at all. Maybe like a rehab center. The one I'm looking at does all sorts of different therapy. DBT, individual, group, art, etc. ",library_ass,56uq5c
7,A middle of the road facility starts at about $750 a day. ,normalornotwhoa,56uq5c
8,It sound like pretty expensive but the one I'm looking at takes insurance and mine would be almost all covered.,library_ass,56uq5c
9,"TK is very well known because they spend dosh on marketing, that doesn't mean they are all that better than a smaller treatment center.  I will give you the pros and cons of TK. 

Pros 

- Half decent DBT program
- Specialized BPD track
- Nice campus

Cons

- You won't get much individualized attention because it is huge.  It will be more like taking classes at a university plus some extra therapy sessions.

- TK is well known in the industry for its staffing issues.  I have heard a lot of complaints of being switched therapists 3 or 4 times throughout treatment. 

- Individual therapists aren't usually properly trained in DBT.  They may have some CE credits but you will not get Marsha Linehan grade DBT there.  If you want Marsha Linehan grade DBT, you should go to Clearview or MacLean. ",normalornotwhoa,56uq5c
10,Be careful of what they tell you about coverage.  Did they verify your benefits for you themselves?  Are you aware that your insurance will not cover the entirety of the stay?  What they do is authorize 5-7 days at a time based on your progress.  Many treatment centers falsely lead clients to believe that their insurance has their entire stay covered when actually they only have the benefits available to them.  Having the benefits available to you and being authorized to utilize them are two very different things.,normalornotwhoa,56uq5c
0,"Yup, there are virtual talk therapy and DBT therapy options. You should be able to find something on an income-based sliding scale. My experience is with a specific insurance provider in the US so it won't be helpful unless you have that same access.",littlehelppls,itnj82
0,"You cant be physically addicted to weed, but psychologically, maybe. Did you give your friend 50mg of cbd or thc? you didnt specify.  Edibles hit different for everyone. I have to eat about 6x what any of my friends eat to feel the desired effects. Most times ive done edibles my friends are on another planet and Ill just be pcking up another bowl.  I would try smoking or vaping the weed/cbd and see how the effects change.  I personally find smoking raw bud (cbd or thc) always hits me the hardest. Concentrates dont even really do it for me",anxietyoutlet,bjld80
1,"Know that cbd needs a small amount of thc in order to feel the effects of the cbd fully. When I just use cbd I feel nothing at all but taking a small amount of thc along with it, it helps tremendously. It almost silences the mind, kind of like a default meditative state. Really good for anxiety in my opinion. Just do a little bit of research and try out which dosages work best for you.",,bjld80
2,"THC helps me a lot, but it's way too expensive and I tend to binge on it. If I'm having an episode and I smoke, instantly everything slows down and I can think clearly. I stop crying, the thoughts disappear, and whatever harmful thing I was doing seems pointless in that moment. In my personal experience, marijuana is extremely helpful with unstable emotions. Maybe not as much for bigger triggers, but it will chill you out.

I've tried CBD, also. It's not nearly as helpful. They do have these new vape pens that dispense THC oil with CBD oil (I don't have one, but many people I know do). Those are really great for people who think they might smoke too much.",,bjld80
3,"I started taking CBD oil somewhat recently and it‘s been really good so far. It’s helped calm me down and relax when I’ve started to spiral out of control emotionally or experience severe anxiety. It helps me feel more at ease and at peace in general. So far it’s seeming to help me a lot more than any of the actual prescription mood stabilizers, anxiety meds or ssris I’ve been on, and plus (for me at least) it doesn’t have all the horrendous side effects that a lot of prescription psychiatric meds have. I’d recommend giving it a try.",unfortunate_frog,bjld80

3,"this is my second try at it and me being more motivated and hopeful to heal has helped me. i used to think i was doomed by BPD and i would be like this forever, but i have been recently motivated and inspired by someone close to me that WE ARE NOT DOOMED TO BE THIS WAY. we can go into “remission”. the hopelessness before really stunted my growth and gave me an excuse to act like this, but now everyday i have been challenging myself and ive seen a change in myself and so did my partner before we split. i recommend it so highly. one skill that stuck out to me was “creating a life worth living” which is basically to immerse ourselves in things to make life beautiful, to see the beauty in life, like myself i love nature and driving and photography. idk the quote in itself really invoked a lot of emotion within me that i have trouble accurately describing. my personal therapist is ok, ive gone through so many and it’s basically like shopping around. its tough i will not lie",,m7jdvg

There is no cure for BPD, but with DBT and medicines for other symptoms (mood swings, depression, anxiety, yada yada) you can control it. It's definitely worth it but it can be long. It'll take a while for the doctor to find the right pills for you. Therapy has to happen regularly.

Also, I hear you. I always had trouble stopping destructive behaviours because I knew that all the DBT skills in the world couldn't address the root trauma and core beliefs that were causing me to do them. What finally got me to stop was when I expressed this to my therapist, and she told me that she would love to do that work with me, but that it's not possible until I'm safe. It was the motivation I needed to use the skills and take control of my behaviour, and now that I've spent some time addressing those beliefs and feelings my life has honestly changed. Also, none of that would have been possible without medication for depression to keep me afloat.

1,"**TW: Sexual Assault**

I don't have any recommendations but **stay away** from Timberline Knolls (Illinois, USA) at all costs. I spent 3 months there last year and while parts of it were very helpful, a therapist there currently has 6 counts of sexual assault filed against him. He sexually assaulted a few of my friends while I was there. There are a ton of articles about it. These are not just allegations. [In this article](https://patch.com/illinois/lemont/second-woman-accuses-timberline-knolls-counselor-sex-assault), he admits to it:

>During his first bond hearing on Aug. 21, the prosecutor said that Jacksa admitted to police that he ""probably went too far.""

I personally knew this man. He wasn't my therapist but he led groups I attended. I allowed myself to be emotionally vulnerable to a man who preyed on his clients/patients.

0,"DBT did not work for me. I have too many issues with authority figures to sit in a classroom-like setting and listen to someone tell me how to cope. It didn't help that the DBT program my insurance provided encouraged people who felt victimized by pwBPD to attend the same course. That's just my experience, but I think it's fair to say that DBT is not the only path to recovery.

Like you, I have also done some independent reading on the subject of BPD. I particularly enjoyed The Buddha and the Borderline: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder through Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Buddhism, and Online Dating, by Kiera Van Gelder. It's more of a memoir than anything else. I've also been lurking in this group and similar mental health subs for a while (I only recently began contributing). I find the personal stories of fellow pwBPD comforting - it has helped me to spot some similar patterns of thought and behavior in my own life that have been holding me back. This way of approaching BPD has helped me feel less alone while not triggering my issues with authority. I haven't tried to do a DBT workbook on my own (yet) though I have tried similar self-help workbooks in the past. I couldn't get through them either. I tend to lose interest or become overwhelmed by the amount of work represented in each page of the book. 

Generally, I feel healthiest and most at peace with my BPD when I work out regularly, stick to a healthy(ish) diet, prioritize time for creativity, and (the biggest challenge) verbalize my emotions *before* they take control and I reach exploding point. Just verbalizing my emotions - without judging them or even trying to accept them - helps me to recognize them for what they are and work through them. Sometimes I write it all down and sometimes I say it out loud, usually just to myself or my SO. I think the most important thing is to have patience with yourself during this process. 

I also do a LOT of novel reading. I think spending time in the minds of different characters & writers has helped me shake up my own perceptions of the world and helps provide my subconscious mind with more examples of how to react to negative stimulus. 

This is all just my experience though. I am far from being cured of BPD so only time will tell how successful my approach to self-care really is. I hope you find something that works for you.",,4wgfty

I'm really not keen on the idea of group therapy, but I am quite comfortable with one on one therapy that is more or less a fusion of DBT and CBT. (DBT lessons, but done in a 1:1 setting with more CBT talk through.) That's what I was doing with the psych I was seeing, and I really got along with him - I just can't afford the sessions though.

0,"In my admittedly limited experience this is why it's important to get professional support, therapy and treatment. If someone broke their leg and received no treatment at all, not even any painkillers, you can be sure they would be lashing out to people around them and hurting them. People struggling with BPD deserve treatment just as much as the person with the broken leg, and similarly if they are suffering and get no treatment, it's hardly surprising if people around them have a crap time. 

It can be hard to find therapists who will work with people who have BPD but in my experience this has been because most therapists have experience dealing with common problems (bereavements, depression, anxiety, stress) and less so with more specific conditions. I've had therapists who clearly were not very experienced with more complex conditions, and I've also had therapists who work a lot with therapies like DBT and schema. It really makes a lot of difference to have someone who's aware, understanding, knowledgeable and capable, as opposed to someone who is nice but completely inexperienced. So even if you encounter stigma initially when seeking treatment, I think in the case of most healthcare professionals it stems from ignorance and lack of expertise rather than genuine bad experiences.

3,"Thank you so much for all of this information and encouragement! I have taken these past two weeks to settle into this diagnosis and I have an appointment coming up next week with a doctor who will help me get a referral to someone specializing in DBT. It's just hard taking that first step because of my extreme trust issues. How do I know this therapy won't make my problems worse? I guess I don't. I guess I just need to take that risk and if it doesn't work, I'll look for another doctor and keep trying until something does help me.  I am not looking to do this on my own. I really don't think that would be a good idea.

I actually spent the past five years of my life thoroughly researching BPD. In college I majored in psychology and when I learned about BPD for the first time I remember staying up all night reading article after article on the disorder because I had never felt like I had a mental illness so strongly before. This pattern of obsessive researching has started again after that self harming incident, although its calmed down over these past two weeks. But directly at first I'd spend hours on end researching anything I could find on the disorder. The first video you sent was actually the first one I ever watched.

Overall that video was helpful in explaining the disorder but one thing I found extremely detrimental was the elderly lady with the short hair who said at one point (14:50), ""No matter how hard they try, despite their very best intentions, simply cannot regulate themselves"". Maybe what she meant to say was, ""Cannot regulate themselves WITHOUT THE HELP OF TREATMENT"". 

But my reaction to her saying this is a perfect example of how BPD affects me... If this doctor was my therapist and I heard that to me, I would likely never return to her again. Those words make me feel like she is mean, stereotypes all people with BPD believing that they are incapable of change, insensitive, unprofessional, and has no ability to help me. All of these thoughts would cause me to really believe them and not return, and it could have just been the result of a misinterpretation...her forgetting to say the words ""without the help of treatment"". I leave no room for interpretation. Black and white thinking. Splitting. And I don't see that I'm doing it until it's done...after I've quit therapy or my boyfriend leaves me or I stop showing up to work because the people around me were ""too mean"" for me to be around. I am actually really excited to get help for this because I am so tired of living like this. 

The second video with the doctor is also another good one I watched recently. I find this doctor to be really helpful too. My favorite one is: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJVkLyHd2v0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJVkLyHd2v0)

It is not a healthy way to communicate, and I totally relate to your disgust in people recommending others do it to anyone, BPD or not. 

Nothing gets me ramped up and more upset like someone doing that. I grew up in an environment in which it was the norm, and I always felt it was up to me to fix things that I had no way of fixing, or even knowing what the problem was because silence was supposed to say it all. 

The hardest part is that you are best off completely removing yourself from the situation and not giving the individual any sort of return contact unless they make it with you. You can tell them you're hurt by this, but it's best said when things have cooled down and... If for some reason you never hear from them again (because sometimes people are extra cruel), then all you can do is find comfort in your own silence, which takes an unbelievable amount of self-control.

0,"Mental illness is tough. There's no easy answer. For me, improvement has required a multifaceted approach including extensive therapy, experimenting with supplements, forcing myself to get exercise and engage in hobbies even when I dont fee like it, trying A LOT of different meds (not on them anymore), forcing myself to be social with peers...etc. You can look into DBT, EMDR, and IFS. Yoga has been honestly the best thing I've done for my mental health. I've also spend years and years confronting my thought patterns and trying to restructure them by challenging my thinking. 

Not very many people will say this, but getting better takes work. Its dufficult and time consuming work. Its doable, but it's a process that takes patience and a lot of self compassion. Treating mental health is like alchemy or cooking. You have all these ingredients to choose from, and to make the best recipe you have to pick and choose what works, and discard what doesn't. In a way, it's a life long process. That doesn't mean you will be miserable for the rest for your life, but it does mean you will learn life long coping skills and you will have to be disciplined enough to implement them. 

The prognosis for BPD is not too bad. It gets better with time. You are young. Being 17 is confusing and hard. You will be a totally different person 10 years from now, trust me. I just turned 29 this year, and I started to notice my mental health stuff around age 13/14.  

I tell this to everyone, and it's annoyingly cliche, but just take baby steps. Start by just setting really small goals. Dont beat yourself up. You are not abnormal. You condition is a valid response to the chaotic ans confusing world we live in. You can turn your experience into an opportunity to grow into a very emotionally intelligent and wise person. It just takes time and effort. 

Every time you fall off the boat get back up. I doubt you are the same as you were 5 years ago. Allow yourself to acknowledge how you've grown.",milkbug,m7gac9

(I'm not positive I'm actually managing the depression, though, because I'm still having great big horrible episodes of it. Just with the BPD symptoms vastly lessened. I should probably add another med tbh.) I was diagnosed with BPD a couple months after beginning Wellbutrin, and that was when I did some research and discovered it's also used in BPD treatment. Best mistake in my life.

Anyway, I'm on Wellbutrin 300 XL and it's as close to a magic bullet as I think I'm likely to find in this universe. My rage episodes had been getting more and more frequent and intense prior to starting it, people I loved were somehow the most irritating/frightening beings on the planet, I was dissociating all the freaking time, and I was having trouble concentrating and correctly sensing time passing. A host of weird stuff I couldn't explain but which was terrifying. I felt I was losing my mind. So I started this medication (150mg at first), and within an hour (because it works FAST if it's gonna work at all), I felt... Oh my god, it's hard to explain, I felt like something horrible left my body. I looked at my best friend and felt a little burst of joy, instead of the inexplicable ""I wish everyone would leave me alone, but they'd better not really do it, because then I'll know they don't want me anymore..."" that I felt constantly.

About an hour later, I accidentally broke a wine glass I liked, an event which should have left me sobbing on the floor. Instead I thought, ""I want to blow up...but...I also don't want to blow up. So I'm not going to."" It isn't perfect--if I'm under too much stress or too tired or it's very late at night and the medication is beginning to wear off, I can still have a meltdown. But a lot of control has been returned to me. I am able to do actual work in therapy instead of just fighting to get from one day to the next. I can concentrate, I can sense time properly, I can prioritize, I can decide I want to do something AND then go do it AND feel good about having done it, and most importantly, I can very often choose not to explode. Before, I would already be exploding before I realized what was even happening. It has sort of...slowed down the reaction process. I still WANT to explode, because I haven't yet healed my old thought patterns, but it gives me a few extra moments to consider the implications of my reaction and try to express what I feel in an appropriate way.",meimagino,4h65mj

I was so stressed that I was cutting just to have some sense of constancy and control. Work was hard, being around family was hard and I put my SO through hell. I was constantly on the verge of suicide and I did attempt once but no one knew. I felt like I was a prisoner in my own mind.

Lithium was what they put me on to get immediate relief and that shit is amazing, but they also started me on Lamictal at the same time since it takes about a month or two to build up. Within the month I felt a huge amount of relief. The dramatic mood swings were pretty much gone and I was able to stop cutting. 

I had to get off the lithium two months ago because it worsened a heart condition, but the Lamictal was built up enough that it's held it's own. I still have depression and mania, but the emotional whiplash is pretty much gone. Instead of cycling between the two multiple times a day, I'll only go through one or none at all. And when I do have a cycle, it's a lot duller and weaker so it's easier to use DBT and get out of it. It's not gotten rid of the emotions entirely, but it's blunted them and they don't cut so deep anymore. 

Lamictal is an anti seizure medication so some have hard effects from it, but I have had no effects whatsoever. It takes care of me and it gives me a fighting chance at actually being a productive person. It brings my emotions under enough control that I can recognize what's happening and be able to enact my therapy skills and stay on track. I still have low points, the medication doesn't fix everything, but it makes success so much easier to reach.",Cranksta,4h65mj
18,"When external factors are there, I still struggle. Lamictal is not a wonder drug. I'm still human and still experience difficulty in coping with tough situations.

But I'm not freaking out over every little thing anymore. So when something bad warranting an emotional response occurs, I haven't wasted all of my energy on hashing out other less important upsets. I can fully focus on applying my DBT skills to difficult situations.

I will give a small disclaimer and also mention that it seems to have impaired my working memory/ability to focus to some degree as well.

26,"Yes. It hasn't made them completely go away due to - like you mention - they (the symptoms/cycling of emotions/etc) are due to/triggered by external factors. But, like i mention, they give me the space between ""trigger"" and ""response"" to actually think about and formulate a reaction as opposed to immediately - without thinking - inappropriately reacting (if that makes sense - much like how CBT works, except i tried that and didn't find it nearly as helpful until i had AEDs in my system, particularly Topamax [which has research supporting it concerning treating BPD] and Lamictal). I do know Seroquel is good for BPD, and the only reason it's still ""off label"" is due to two assholes fucking up a large scale trial (the article the NY times published on this is a bit entertaining if you care to seek it out), but a lot of people find it helpful.

I have yet to be diagnosed with BPD, I was diagnosed with bipolar (once) but mostly with OCD and depression (3 times). My main issues are 1) moral scrupulosity (which may signify that I may also have a co-morbid OCPD) and 2) BPD mood swings, black/white thinking and emptiness.

I just got a high paying job in my field, and i've always been the type that doctors believe i have BPD due to high funtioning i can be in my career - that is, until they see what a shit show i am when i'm alone, or how insane my relationships are. I'm sorry your access to heathcare is so poor - i've had to fight tooth and nail for 7 years to find 2 meds that help me, so i can't even imagine how hard that must be. Even within one class of medicine, the individual meds can vary drastically in their effect, so i encourage you to try a few if they are known to help BPD (that is, unless of course, you have really horrible reactions to them [like i mentioned i do to most AAPs 2nd gens]). Best of luck finding something - and if you think medication may be a good aid in helping you recover from your BPD, best of luck in pursuing that avenue. It's so sad that we have to fight for what should be a right, as other illnesses - more ""physical"" illnesses in the eyes of others - receive treatment much more readily.

Thank you for your reply. 

Sorry to hear about the sexual trauma you experienced it sounded as though it was quite helpful up until then. Hope things have picked up for you and you’re getting support. Xx 

I guess I’m just worried about what I’ll be signing up for as my psychiatrist said it will be between 6-12 months. So I was wondering what I’ll be doing every day for that amount of time. 

They have said intensive treatment but of what sort? 
Did you have daily talking therapy for hours?
What kind of things did you do? 

Thanks again, I appreciate you taking time to reply. ",GlumBumble,amvfej

My feedback:

* ""gold standard"" - really?  According to whom?
* ""...wallowing in the symptoms..."" - lovely, compassionate word-choices there /S.
* Your statement about medication is nothing more than unsubstantiated opinion.  Plenty of people navigate BPD and lots of other mental illnesses without the use of psychoactive substances.
* Your statement about music is nothing more than unsubstantiated opinion.  Literally.
* While meditation seems to helpful to many I fail to see why Headspace would be required.  There are plenty of alternatives, many of which are free.
* Regarding therapy.  Firstly, the requirement for a therapist to have experience of BPD is essential not just recommended, essential.  Someone without training and experience in BPD WILL do more damage.  A ""few sessions"" will not be even close to enough.
* You seem to be trying to pass yourself off as an expert which you, clearly, aren't.

5,"That's completely incorrect.  Please see [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3158489/) which found that BPD has a very high rate of remission.

OP: psychiatric diagnoses cannot be officially ""rescinded"" per se, but if a patient no longer meets the full criteria of a diagnosis which was previously given to them, then they are no longer considered to have that disorder.  In that case, as others have said, then it will be said that their disorder is ""in remission"".  This does not remove previous documentation of the diagnosis from the patient's medical record, but new entries into their record will either not include the diagnosis or will say something like ""borderline personality disorder; in remission"" or ""history of borderline personality disorder"".

With that said, it's important to note that (especially with a personality disorder) it isn't necessarily the expectation that a person will no longer meet the criteria for a psychiatric disorder after the successful treatment of that disorder (as would be the case for some diagnoses like panic disorder or a specific phobia, for example).  A person with BPD can receive successful treatment and see a *huge* decrease in symptom frequency/severity and improvements in functioning while still fulfilling all of the criteria for the diagnosis and retaining it.",Rain12913,2f9ziw

And quite simply the psychopathological development of BPD goes beyond just the DSM's criteria for it - as there are many issues with its atherotical and the lack of psychodynamic perspectives for their determination of BPD.

There's a lot to consider and we're unraveling more of what attributes and constitutes into the manifestation of what becomes a diagnosis for BPD. How far have you been to through therapy and what kind?

And have you went through all the specialized treatments for BPD? - i.e. Transference-focused Psychotherapy (TFP) and Mentalization-based Therapy? (MBT)

16,"Sorry to rain on the parade: While scientific sources, you're positing absolutes here and drawing false dichotomies in correlating what are essentially ""before and after"" pictures.

I would encourage you to give this book a look [Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience](http://www.amazon.com/Brainwashed-Seductive-Appeal-Mindless-Neuroscience/dp/0465018777) - and the video-lecture-talks by the author Scott O. Lilienfeld.

Secondly, you do also realize that psychotherapy has been noted as a form of neurosurgery as well? - it's because of the neuroplasticity of the brain, and its remarkable ability to change. However of course, with a disclaimer, it may be a bit too convoluted to realize for BPD, but obviously many have noted that DBT has improved their symptoms - as you say your own symptoms have improved with therapy.

By my reference and your self-ancedotal notions, it should be fair to say that the neuroplasticity within the brain inherently allocates for change. However, whether it may be the *change* you would like, it may be too contrived due to the fact that we're dealing with your subjective self-experiences - and that psychotherapy is as much as it can be conducive to neuroplastic change is not an absolute solution as well, because of how subjective the psychotheraputic process can be.

But obviously, like yeah, talking to people and being aware of your symptoms, whilst mitigating the pent-up emotions with a psychotherapist is conductive for actual change - as well as neuroplastic change that goes hand-in-hand with it. Also, a therapist can promote and patronize subjective bias within the therapeutic process as well, despite however well-meaning he/she may be. ",,2f9ziw

>  The therapist I found works exclusively with childhood traumas and that for me at least, was the key in lessening all of the borderline symptoms.

Your therapist could be anything-under-the-sun as far as her clinician background and expertise goes. You do realize that therapists are pretty widely encompassing in their treatment population? Her focus on ""childhood traumas"" is very subjective and does exemplify her standards for treating BPD. I'm not denying your issues if it is of childhood trauma, but let it be know that there are various types of clinicians with their own respective ethos/focuses etc. that counteracts objective scrutiny as if shes effective or not amongst everyone else, as well as other therapists that have specialized treatment frameworks in hand for BPD clients. 

Essentially you're saying ""no single written model fits everyone"" that it's patronizing the discussion at hand, because it's too subjective to tell who and what your therapist entails and the given effectiveness and inclusiveness during the psychotherapy process, aside from your self-reported responses, which come with a bias. However, it does sound like it *is* working for you, but just because you still have some underlying tenants of ""BPD"" for over 40 years that doesn't make it an absolute for everyone else - nor is it an optimistic empowerment of sorts. ",,2f9ziw
20,"How come you were able to lessen a lot of your symptoms, but unable to lessen even more of it? Are you saying folks will hit a stagnating mark? - a plateau? I'm not denying the realities of childhood trauma that can have an effect on later on as adults resulting in a BPD diagnosis, but I think it is a far cry to impose absolutes here - despite drawing and correlating neuroscentific studies as those aren't to be recognized as deterministic givens. 

In fact, I don't think anything in mental health should be viewed as deterministic absolutes, as the interpretation biases can lead to false dichotomies; including subjective fallacies are very prevalent in the field, nonetheless making it challenging for researchers and clinicians alike to work together - without working *against* each other.

Perhaps your therapist that focuses on ""childhood traumas"" may not be adept with more specialized BPD treatment frameworks and training out there? There are just way too many variables and conditions to posit absolute answers, despite the longevity of your self-involvement with BPD.

However, what you say as a personal statement about BPD being mitigated is fair and probably won't be refuted, though the realities of newer and better treatment approaches make it ever-more increasingly optimistic by the given day.

Just my take on it, as someone who has gotten into a relationship prior to diagnoses, has been in a relationship while in treatment (which was actually my most toxic) and is currently in a relationship while still in treatment but further along.

I wasn’t going to break up with my amazing boyfriend because of that. He doesn’t deserve that. He’s half of this relationship and he thought/still thinks we are meant to be together. 
Anybody can be abusive, yes it’s more noticeable in people with BPD but that in no way means we are abusive. Implying we are is detrimental to the already heavily stigmatized disorder. My partner has set boundaries for us both and we have an incredibly healthy relationship and have for the past 6 years.

A lot of people have had really abusive families and are desperate for someone that loves them which is why they rush in without really thinking in the long term about how things are going to work out in regards to managing there issues.

There have been problems along the way sure but the positives massively outweigh the negatives.

People with BPD deserve to be in loving relationships as much as anyone else.",eraserway,cn7hab
5,"I don't think mental health needs to be a discounter in whether or not you deserve to be in a relationship. If you get abusive because of your symptoms, then I recommend you learn ways on how to treat others in a romantic context before you resume a relationship. BPD symptoms create trouble for relationships; I think they certainly scare people off, you can be too high maintenance. Your emotions don't make sense to the other person. It is completely possible to have relationships without treatment, though. Communicate with your other partner and set boundaries. This illness will always find ways to create turbulent relationships, so those two key things will reduce damage. Now, I'll say that while BPD does have good remission rate according to several evidence based modern studies of treatment effectiveness, DBT does not get rid of the symptoms. It teaches sufferers how to live with BPD in a way that is less detrimental to themselves and others they care about. I'm not in treatment right now and looking to be, but I don't want to be lonely. But also, if BPD should discount you from having romantic relationships without/before treatment, then should that apply to family relationships as well? I'm still as emotional around my family as I would be a romantic partner. If I didn't have people at my side, I don't know how I would find any reason to recover. The main reason I want to seek out treatment currently is because of a selected amount of people who I want to keep in my life and relate to in a healthier manner. I don't think I should isolate myself from others just because my relationships are affected by my illness. I can be too much, but if I cut contact with them, they'd worry way more and think my illness is only getting worse. And since BPD symptoms won't disappear completely even with treatment, where do I start on how to manage what can't be ""cured"" within the contexts of the relationships I do want to have with other people if I isolate myself from others?",,cn7hab
6,"Yes my hypotheticals were quite vague and I’m happy for you that your situation seems more stable than it was prior. 

I think my question was more directly to those who have a diagnosis, access to self treatment (not necessarily doctors and meds: could include self treatment/online therapy tools) but still play with their vulnerability in the form of relationships and crushes without acknowledging the long term damage it can do to both parties involved. 

But you are correct. Sometimes I am too absolutist in my thinking. Thank you for your input and your insights are valuable as they are first hand!",Tazbio,cn7hab
7,"This is what I was looking for don’t worry. Your experience seems fantastic and I wish you all the best, but your situation with doctors I can resonate with. Dare I say but I even have to self medicate with supplements or online pharmacies in modest amounts rather than trust doctors with prescription because of past withdrawal after abrupt cutoffs etc. Also therapy never seemed to help me, however when I said treatment I didn’t mean too generic as in just doctors and meds, but a whole kinda shift including mindfulness, self DBT (strangely works just as well if not better than an actual therapist) as it’s free and accessible, exercise etc. 

I think my only question is this, and I know it’s a bit black and white thinking but, if you did break up with your boyfriend or he broke up with you, do you think you could get by on your own (I’m not saying to not feel heartbroken at all) or do you think progress relies on a relationship being in place? 

Thank you for your initial response!",Tazbio,cn7hab
8,"Honestly, I completely agree with all of your points.

9,"In your current context your relationships with those around you seem healthy which is great. But what I mean when you say “but I don’t want to be lonely”, is what I’m referencing; To prevent yourself from being lonely and hurt, wouldn’t you resort to the negative symptoms of BPD even unintentionally without appropriate knowledge or sufficient treatment? Because the negative methods of this disorder would delay your progress into remission as well as hurt your partner. 

I agree that you shouldn’t be completely isolated from a social circle; in fact it’s very strong. But I guess what I’m trying to say is it’s different when you’re pushing towards being better rather than residing in making yourself and others miserable because “that’s just how I am” and it’s not changeable for example. Probably black and white thinking but I guess that’s how I see it right now.

It just feels like even through communication a partner would be constantly walking on egg shells, therefore not making them happy and then when they express this it becomes a very negative experience for you too.",Tazbio,cn7hab
10,"Oh okay, what do you mean by “plays with their vulnerability...without acknowledging the long terms damage etc.?” like do you mean not informing a potential partner you have BPD or simply saying, because I have BPD dating long term could be detrimental to both the individual and/or crush/possible partner?

11," I assume maybe what you meant when you phrased this post was that it is pointless to get into a relationship while out of treatment with no incentive to get better. I can say that is agreeable. 

But again, DBT can't erase or ""cure"" your symptoms. That's why you absolutely must be communicative with your partner and set boundaries. I am not out of treatment by choice, but due to life events that just so happen to interfere with my initial plan to enroll into a DBT program at an outpatient clinic. Negative symptoms affect everyone around me. Clinginess is a giant problem for me, and I have to hold myself back from smothering others in order to relieve paranoid thoughts that they don't care about, are about to ditch me, or hate me just because I am not currently spending time with them (lack of object permanence). This is where employing boundaries steps in, even as it is hard not to overstep them acting on paranoia and abandonment fears fuelled thoughts. I have to tell myself that others have their own lives and I must learn to respect that. Currently, I have downloaded a pdf of the DBT workbook as self help. Have not completed all of it, but it's a bandaid while I'm out of a more professionally structured treatment focus. I kind of think your view is a little...definitely black and white. Because you can't actually be ""cured"" from BPD. You will have to put extra effort into your relationships with boundaries and communication regardless of where you are at on remitting. So there is no point ditching romantic relationships unless you just believe you don't deserve them. Recovery from BPD is over a year long process and not an easy fix even with DBT, but it's not impossible. Communication will be a lengthy process with trial and error. Tell people your usual triggers, and they don't have to walk on eggshells. Doesn't mean you won't ever not be symptomatic, but it helps for others to know triggers so they have an idea on what is going on with you.",,cn7hab
12,"For example if you invest a lot into a person and they still break up with you, which would then completely delay progression towards remission or on the other side making the other person forever spiteful of people with BPD (I know that’s more out of your own control).

13,So you’re saying why even get into a relationship or invest in someone?,Jtatertot92,cn7hab
14,"Kinda, except the fact that it hurts us a lot more when untreated and can lead to really devastating consequences such as suicide, substance use or self harm. With BPD I feel as if we are more susceptible to these scenarios therefore it seems like an extremely risky game to play.

Further down the line, when you can put learnt practises into play such as mindfulness and other DBT techniques or even a successful medication, without a doubt a relationship is worth pursuing. But it honestly feels like a form of self harm to fully invest into someone without any self support as a backup.",Tazbio,cn7hab
15,"I mean everything you said earlier is still a factor even when in treatment, even further down the line. Yeah having those skills definitely helps a ton but doesn’t mitigate any of that. It sucks but you’ll never learn what works or doesn’t work, what’s healthy and okay or anything else about a relationship unless you put yourself out there.

It’s like before I joined the military, I knew a lot about it but actually experiencing it are two completely different things. I think an easy fix is just letting your partner or whoever you would like to date know. Then both people can make an informed decision whether it’s worth pursuing but just romantically isolating yourself until you’re better doesn’t sound the healthiest.
