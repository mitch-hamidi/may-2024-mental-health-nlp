14,Discharged from Psych ward - haven't been prescribed medication and still feel like I'm gonna hurt myself. Not sure where to go from here.,"Short answer is they were trying to push me out of the ward as fast as they could. I stayed for 1 week.

When I was there I just caused trouble to be honest, absconded twice, snuck in shards of glass to self harm with. kept trying to leave and some person touched me from behind without realizing what emotional state I was in so I got physical with them without thinking which isn't like me since I'm quiet BPD (or heavily relate to it at least).

None of the staff understood my issues at all. They all assumed I was just doing everything for attention or some shit. I barely spoke to the Dr's even so its partially my fault since I struggle greatly with face to face communication. So they just kinda fucked me around for a week putting me on a temp hold even though they were discharging me in a couple days, offered me medication (Abilify) but withdrew that decision. Then just essentially told me to socialise in the community more. Then psych talked to me literally on the last day and offered psychology, but good load of use that does me a day before discharge. I told one of the workers before I left I'm probably just gonna hurt myself after I leave, they just told me ""you have capacity. its your choice"".

Hopefully it’ll work out. I feel like my inability to stay awake has a lot to do with my depression (duh) and hopefully it can help with some other symptoms as well. My psychiatrist didn’t really tell me a whole lot about it... to be quite honest she was very willing to give me it (probably because I’ve expressed my dislike for meds in the past).

They decided that I needed to be treated with a bipolar mood stabilizing medication despite the referring clinical psychologist (and two other prior psychologists) diagnosing it as BPD. I have had very bad history with antidepressants driving me absolutely off the wall before (and I deal with some side effects still)… 

So I’m a little scared to even explain to my clinical therapist with whom I have a good relationship, about why I don’t really trust the diagnosis of the person she referred me to… because that therapist maybe looked at my file for 5minutes tops… just feel like that is not smart or safe :(

29,24F Need insight on finally getting prescribed medication tomorrow,"I'm 24 and have been diagnosed since I was around 18. I've only recently been talking to a therapist during covid and talk to her about my anxiety which makes me physically nauseous when in a work setting, difficulty regulating my emotions, splitting on my bf, and risky behaviors like weed abuse and really bad spending habits. But lately I've been feeling like I might have ADHD as well like my bf only the inattentive underdiagnosed ""female"" type. I always thought ADHD was what he displayed which is hyper focus and hyperactivity, but now I'm questioning if that's the reason I had difficulty in college and even now when I procrastinate things that are important to me.

I'm finally having my appointment with the psychiatrist tomorrow but I have no idea what symptoms to focus on. I've heard anti psychotics help with the mood swings and sometimes anxiety but my fear is only being prescribed anti anxiety medication when that's only one of the struggles I am facing.

I was prescribed Sertraline/Zoloft upon diagnoses, but have never really taken it properly. Typically I've had a history of leaving the pills untouched and then taking five at once for a (very refluxy) high. 

Recently my life has gone to shit, and as usual, I can really only blame myself. It's been exactly two years since my suicide attempt/hospitalisation, and I'm afraid I feel another crisis impending. So I did the responsible thing today, went to the doctors, and he prescribed me a new round of Zoloft, upping the dosage from 50 to 100MG a day, and stressed I keep up with the prescription.

My question is, how helpful has Zoloft been for those of you taking it to assist with relieving BPD symptoms? Side effects, both short and long term? How does it compare with other SSRIs you may have been put on?

44,"Got prescribed trazodone/desyrel, would like feedback.","I started taking Lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer about four months ago. I used to smoke regularly for anxiety before I got on it and have decreased how frequently I do smoke now because of how manageable my anxiety has been. I have been struggling with sleep and my psychiatrist suggested adding on a low dose of Trazodone to help me fall/stay asleep. 

Here's my problem; I have an intense fear of gaining weight. I'm in remission from Anorexia/Bulimia but still struggle greatly with body image. I legitimately panic about gaining even 2-3 pounds. I stopped taking birth control pills even though they only made me gain about 5 pounds despite how much they helped with excruciating cramps/pmdd. I still weigh myself on a daily basis. 
I've only ever been on Prozac as an antidepressant before (5 years ago) and it had increased my appetite, making me gain 10-15 pounds. The Lamictal has helped me so much, I really want to be able to try this new medication too and see how it does for me (can't hurt to increase those serotonin levels) and I would really appreciate some feedback if anyone has any of weight loss/gain side effects. As of right now it isn't too crucial for me to be on this medicine but if it could be helpful I'd be so proud of myself for giving into trying it out.

At the same time, I want to believe my doctor is an honest guy and is genuinely trying to help. When I google anything about Vraylar for anxiety or BPD, no results at all. However the class of drug it is, an atypical antipsychotic, has been studied with BPD before.

TLDR: I've been prescribed Braylar 1.5mg, been on it for two days, horrible nausea and sleepiness but what else is new with a new med, right?

But, like others I struggle with having a good, 'clean' sleep pattern without resorting to smoking lots of green, codeine or antihistimines...melatonin was useless for me, personally.

So my psych today prescribed me a small script for Seroquel 25mg, to take as needed for sleep. Am currently happy weight-wise and am wary as have heard others put on weight.

64,So I'm one of the few people prescribed actual Desoxyn (Methamphetamine); my experience with it. Anyone else care to share experiences with Stimulants and BPD?,"I'm one of the very few people in the world that is prescribed actual Methamphetamine (it is only prescribed in the USA and even than it is rare). Kinda annoying to fill my scripts because no Pharmacy in my town even carries it, so they have to special order it, plus it feels weird and I get weird looks I get when I hand a script in that has ""Methamphetamine 5mg x4 daily"" written on it, lmao! 


Anyways despite this substance being very strictly controlled I convinced my prescribing practitioner to script me it to trial it, despite him knowing that I have BPD. I have to say that all Amphetamine and Amphetamine Type Substances that I have tried have eliminated my episodes of Dissociation, but every single one increased the severity of my splitting, as well as the ""Talionic Response"" that Bordelines have. Also tolerance would quickly build resulting in the need of a higher dose.


Methmphetamine however is the first medication that I have tried that doesn't consistently require dosage increases, eliminated the detachment and cognitive dysfunction/brain-fog that comes with Dissociation, and has even helped me maintain a drive to succeed in life resulting in me applying for college and excelling in my classes! Also Methamphetamine (probably due to increased release of Serotonin compared to other Amphetamines) actually helps me not split, and remain cool in situations where I would have otherwise exploded, as well as giving me the confidence to take on social situations consistently.

65,Anyone diagnosed w/ adhd and been prescribed stimulants for it? How did they affect you? Perspective on adhd/bpd experience in general would be helpful to me please,"I was diagnosed w/ adhd several months ago and have tried concerta (methylphenidate, ""related"" to ritalin) and vyvanse (lisdexamphetamine, ""related"" to adderall). They have helped with some aspects but my life has continued to spiral out of control despite that. Avoidance of my stressors (right now being falling behind in school and the upcoming major life change of finally (hopefully) graduating and getting a real apartment, real job etc (not even mentioning relationship stuff)) + hyperfocus/anxious obsessing = I spent hours and hours and hours basically reading the whole DSM. I've just been feeling convinced that it's not just adhd + depression/anxiety, that has honestly just never felt right to me in a way that's hard to explain.

For a million reasons, I boiled it down to bpd and/or bipolar spectrum (mainly bpd). My therapist is having us move forward exploring bpd. She had me take the LPI and BSL and I scored *very* high on them but then on the other hand my mood will change for zero reason where I will feel like that's ridiculous and I'm ""normal"" and just need to get a handle on myself (not to mention the confusing overlap of adhd/bpd symptoms), and then it will change again from the slightest thing and I'll be completely debilitated again. ***It's like a battle between how I think of myself vs how I actually feel/behave.*** For instance I've taken the MMPI before but only answered based on my beliefs (which I've learned I ***cannot*** trust as that dumb mmpi result led to me regrettably partially transitioning, ayyy unstable sense of self), but when I took LPI/BSL I answered on actual emotion/behavior. Which I see in many posts here as I've been reading up on this sub over the last week or so. My mind is a rollercoaster prison of torture because I internalize everything even this stupid ""is it bpd or not"" question and that back and forth is so distressing.

Anyway if anyone has experience with having both these disorders and either how that process of determining the bpd after the adhd went, or how stimulants affected them as well, I think it would help me with trying to figure out what's going on with myself.

73,Is anyone “successfully” treated for BPD without antipsychotics ?,"Like, you do therapy, dbt, you even have other drugs prescribed (ie : for depression) you did research on BPD… you do everything you can do to be better or even healed BUT WITHOUT ANTIPSYCHOTICS and maybe you’re not healed (yet ?) but you are managing your symptoms and living towards being better. 

Is anyone like that ? I got prescribed Olanzapine last year but didn’t like it due to the negative side effects on the brain, cognitive functions. And I read some studies saying all antipsychotics did that. So I told my new psychiatrist about it and he said he understood, will think about something else but that it’s mainly my depression impacting negatively my cognitive functions rn. 

And today I’m trying a new med he prescribed to me saying it’s not bad for the brain actually protects it whatever, but I still looked it up it’s called Quetiapine and even if it’s rare it can induce motor skill issues, concentration issues (reading and writing) short term, and long term use can induce cognitive and memory impairments. I am very scared of that.

She prescribed antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, and GOD it made a huge difference, I gained a lot more energy, my thoughts are still really bad, but at least I'm functioning better. 

I've been dealing with very low self-esteem since I was 12, suicidal thoughts constantly, a lot of anxiety and paranoid thoughts about people hating me, at 18 I was diagnosed with depersonalization and dissociation, sometimes I starve myself on purpose because I think I'm a bad person, I couldn’t think of a single moment where I was happy, years have passed, my feelings every day are just emptiness, sadness, anger, anguish.

106,What medication have you found most successful for your BPD?,"Hi there, I am a 21 year old male, seeking advice, or even just different people‘s personal experiences with different medications to treat BPD. My partner, who is a 21 year old female, was recently diagnosed with BPD. After a difficult life, one that was full of neglect and abuse, my partner was diagnosed with Anxiety, Depression and PTSD… however it wasn’t until an episode last month, where we ended up having to get emergency services involved, that she saw a psychiatrist at the hospital and was diagnosed with BPD.

When she was diagnosed with BPD the doctor increased her dose of Prozac, which she had previously been prescribed for her other mental health issues, but the Prozac has not worked or helped with either her BPD, or her other diagnoses. Oh and before the Prozac she had tried Cipralex (not sure if I’m spelling it correctly), and it did curb her ups and downs but it turned her into a zombie so she got off of it quickly.

Which brings me to my question… but before I ask it I just want to make it clear that I am aware different medications work differently for different people, there is no “one pill cures all“ option, and that anybody who answers is not a doctor offering medical advice (unless of course you are a doctor lol). So, what has been your experience with medication and BPD? I know therapy is important as well and she is joining that soon, but as far as meds go, has there been a certain/specific medication, or even medication combo, that has helped with your BPD symptoms vastly more than others? What have your experiences been?

Thank you in advance for any and all answers… oh and in case anyone is wondering, yes my significant other did ask me to put this question out into the ether, and the reason is because they feel as though they don’t want to be jumping from medication to medication their whole life never finding the right one and would be more comfortable after hearing some other people’s experiences.

112,"Misdiag BP2, Diag BPD.  Temporarily stopping meds and life lessons","I was diagnosed Bipolar 2 5 years ago, but further recent psychological assessment shows BPD.  When I was diagnosed BP, I had originally thought that I had BPD, but my (very bad) therapist at the time told me I couldn’t have BPD because borderlines couldn’t be self aware.  I was diagnosed at a walk in clinic, and I practically lead the doctor to the diagnosis.  I thought I was rapid cycling BP, and I got prescribed Seroquel, and eventually Latuda and Pristique.

Skip ahead a few years, and the meds haven’t fixed the problem, just muted it.  Still lots of SI everyday, fear of abandonment/rejection, extreme emotional responses, etc.  When I recently found out that I likely wasn’t BP, I stopped taking my meds after a while, big mistake.  

First couple of weeks I felt physically sick, vomiting, dizziness.  After that passed I thought I was feeling okay, but my wife just told me I was a disaster.  The past two weeks have been absolute hell; crying all the time, quickly changing moods, paranoia about others and their intentions, extreme si, thinking my wife is going to leave me, really bad stuff.  

This morning I started taking my meds again.  I can’t expose her to another second of this condition, and I don’t want to hurt her.  I really wanted to quit the meds because they were making me so quiet and sleepy; I would have to go for a nap mid day and would often fall asleep at evening functions.  I was also able to drop 25 lbs since stopping the meds, but there’s no point in being thin and attractive if nobody wants to be around you.

Anyway, I’m not sure what this post is about.  Like you all, I’m here, I’m suffering, I’m trying to live another day.  As you may know, turns out Seroquel and Latuda are both prescribed for BPD as well, and those meds were obviously doing something.

Don’t quit your meds folks.  As much as you might want to feel normal, we are much better when we’re medicated and in therapy, even if the meds do come with negative side effects.  I hope you’re all out there doing okay, and please please please don’t give up.

125,Medication,"Been diagnosed with BPD since the age of 18 and I’m now 27 so it’s been almost 10 years since being diagnosed. I have been prescribed as many as 7 different medications over the course of time and nothing has helped but only worsened my manic behavior and made me absolutely suicidal. In fact, back in 2016 I was prescribed Venlafaxine by my PCP and I actually tried killing myself because of it. I haven’t been to therapy since I was 17 and that is because I’ve dealt with issues with Mental Health specialists and constantly being gaslit. Since my incident being on Venlafaxine and bad experiences with doctors for the last few years I have stopped bothering trying to get help and treatment. The last few years, my BPD has gotten significantly worse and recently, I have been trying to get help and treatment. I think I should also add, after taking a few college classes for Psychology, I did learn that BPD is something that cannot be treated with SSRIS. Which I should add, it makes a lot sense now. Anyway, I found a doctor in hopes that I could get the help I need only for him to just want to immediately medicate me. I did inform him of my past with SSRIs and told him I do not want to be prescribed them. So instead, he prescribed me a mood stabilizer and Mitrazapine for sleep. Mind you: I had not been prescribed or given any mood stabilizers before and I had my doubts. Well after taking the medication prescribed to me for a month, I am convinced Mood stabilizers are a joke. I feel no difference even on a higher dose and feel like dog crap physically. The Mitrazapine also knocked me on my ass for 15 hours despite what time I took it and when I would wake up, my whole body felt like it was hit by a bus. I called the doctor and he told me it was odd I was experiencing those side effects and he told me to stop taking them immediately. Then proceeded to prescribe me Trazodone for sleep which I told him before that it only ever kept me wide awake. He told me I should try a higher dose and I did but guess what? I was wide awake all night. Is this common? Is there something wrong with my body? I just feel like nobody wants to help me recover and just wants me drugged.

She asked for a detailed description of all health and mental issues wich included moderate to severe back and neck pain, muscle spasms and pain for tonsilitis and the aforementioned mental disorders she's now referred me to a specialist for these issues and someone that could perscribe these substances due to me being under 18 

So what should I tell the specialist and what might be the best drug because I'm also doing ongoing therapy but we've hit a dead end due to all ssri anti anxiety and antipsychotics not working so what should I say what would best be prescribed I also have heavy nerve damage from cutting",1664190182.0,False,1,0,domskii_uhh,None,xog3u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/xog3u5/help_with_medication/

Today will be the first day I’m going to be trying out my new medications. 

If anyone who has tried these in the past could share their opinions I would really appreciate it that!!

It did great as a sleep medication for me, but it was causing my BPD to be worse than it had been in almost a year. It was to the point where even my boyfriend, friends, family members, and therapist suggested hospitalization was the best route.

158,"My partner (21m) recently got diagnosed with bpd, I (20f) don't really know what to expect/how to help.","I started dating my boyfriend a month ago, though we were quite good friends for \~6 months prior. He was diagnosed with adhd a while ago and was recently diagnosed with bpd. He was diagnosed with major depression in high school, but that has not been an issue for a while. I do not have bpd and he is the first person with bpd I have met so apologizes If I seem ignorant or if I got something wrong, please correct me (he does not have a great understanding of bpd yet either as this is quite new).

From what I have read a lot of people with bpd struggle with intense emotions and unstable relationships. He has a really good relationship with his family and has a lot of long term friends. He is hyper rational and I have not seen him get really upset. I would actually say he is better than the average person at emotional regulation. This is something I know he worked on pre-diagnosis (he did this on his own, not with a therapist). So it does not seem that he struggled with the interpersonal components. 

He has a history of self harm, and some suicidal ideation, but far more of it was just self harm (clean for 3 years). He is a little impulsive/an adrenaline junky, though he is a 21 year old guy so some of that's to be expected. Furthermore, I would not classify any of his impulsivity as self destructive. The reason he thinks he got diagnosed is that he has rather intense dissociation. I have only been there for it once, but he doesn't make any sense, seems like he's experiencing entirely different things to reality and he is scared/paranoid. This is why he saw a psychiatrist in the first place. He has around 1 or 2 dissociative episodes a month.

He is rather resistant to treatment. He is prescribed meds for adhd which he almost never takes as he does not like how it makes him feel and he is rather against talk therapy. He did elect to see a psychiatrist as the dissociation thing really freaks him out. He has said that the dissociation is the only thing he would change about his life. When he got the diagnosis, his psychiatrist prescribed him antipsychotics but he never filled the prescription.

Anyways I love this guy, he is ridiculously passionate about life and it's infectious. He is super driven career wise and he has hobbies he really cares about. I love the talks we have and he is just so fun to be around. I also feel understood by him in a way I have not in past relationships. To sum it up, I really want this relationship to work and I don't know what my role in that should be. I would like to help him, but when I bring it up he is somewhat resistant, I feel like he does not want to inconvenience me. I asked him to think about triggers he has so I can avoid them, but he just said he does not have any. He is also very against being around me when he dissociates (which I have fully respected).

160,Seeking med advice,"*Apologies for the super long one, but I'm really in need of advice*

OK so I was diagnosed with BPD/EUPD and CPTSD early last year and I've still not received any treatment, meds or therapy. 

I'm 31 and feel like I'm losing the plot and cannot carry on like this. 

Throughout the last 15 years I've been given around 9 or 10 types of antidepressants and none have helped. This was before the diagnoses. Every time I've spoken to a GP, CPN or medic, I've stressed that I want to try a mood stabiliser as I don't feel the antidepressants do anything to help me, and I feel depression is a symptom of other underlying conditions. 

All the antidepressants did was assist in weight gain, which only amplified my self image and confidence problems. At my last med review they were adamant they were only going to prescribe me antidepressants until I was assigned to a CPN for treatment (on waiting list for 14 months, ongoing). So, I thought if they're only going to give me an antidepressant then I'll research the few I've not tried and I asked for Wellbrutin (aka Buproprion or Zyban). I'd asked for this once before and was told no as it wasn't used in UK. I saw it can help promote weight loss rather than weight gain. This time I was successful and they prescribed it, this was maybe 7 months ago now and still not much different in weight and zero difference to moodswings and life in general. 

They also prescribed Trazodone to help sleep.  They didn't work so they increased to the maximum dose, and when that didn't work they took me off them completely.

So I'm currently on Zyban which does nothing and Im still spiralling and having meltdowns nearly daily. I don't understand how they can ignore me for so long when im trying to explain whats happening to me. I do t understand how they can diagnose me and just leave me without any support or treatment or help.

I noticed UK and US seem to have different approaches towards medication for BPD.

173,SSRI medications,"hey so for context i’m diagnosed with anxiety disorder and unspecified personality disorder with traits of borderline personality disorder, i’m currently waiting to get further assessed for it since it was a short session and we didn’t go in depth about my symptoms and issues basically. anyway 

last year i got prescribed antidepressants, Paroxetine 10 mg and they did help slightly but they gave me painful libido side effects that absolutely affected my sex life so i decided to change medication

i’ve now been on sertraline 25 mg since march. i’ve never been so depressed in my life, it almost made me suicidal. like i’d get suicidal thoughts and i couldn’t get out of bed. it went on for like 2 weeks then it got better. last week i decided to take 50 mg instead of 25 mg and that’s where it all went to shit basically.
i’ve never felt this awful. constantly hungry but nauseous at the same time, i couldn’t cry which made me feel like i was gonna go absolutely crazy. i started screaming both on the inside and outside cause i felt so emotionally numb which i’m not used to cause i have extreme emotions and if i can’t cry i feel like i’m unable to express them and it made me feel like i was losing my mind..
i took 25 mg today and i’ll keep taking 25 mg until i stop completely cause i don’t think antidepressant work on me idk


im just a bit confused as to why i’m being prescribed antidepressants when i’m not even diagnosed with depression.

174,"ADHD, Lisdexamfetamine, and BPD","So, first things first, both my partner and I have both autism and ADHD, and we also each have BPD. I take Elvanse/ Vyvanse 70mg for my ADHD.
It goes without saying our relationship is rockier than a quarry, and most of our time together has been spent fighting. One of the complaints my partner gave me was that while I'm mostly stable during the day, I'm at my worst at night; I figured-out it aligned with the time my prescribed dose wears-off. At first, I thought it was a ""me-thing,"" but my partner was recently put on a trial of it, and it seems as if it has the same exact effect on my partner. My partner is now between prescriptions, and their BPD symptoms have returned to full strength.
Both of us seem to become noticeably more stable when on the meds, and unstable whenever we're off them, and not just coming back down after a dose, but long-term like with shortages, which rules-out anything to do with our circadian rhythms.

So, I wanted to ask the sub: 

Does anyone else have ADHD with BPD (with or without autism) with their ADHD being medicated?

If so, what medication?

Does taking that medication seem to affect your BPD symptoms?

Do you think the medication actually makes BPD better, or ADHD makes BPD worse?

175,Medications for BPD?,"So I am from Sweden and here, we don't treat the BPD per se with medications; we treat, say, the co-occurring depression or anxiety or sometimes the inability to stay focused. 

I used to take anti depressants but since I was fairly new at the clinic they didn't know how to deal with when I started acting weird on them (Cymbalta) -- they suspected I was bipolar (however that suspicion is now out the window) and I haven't tried Cymbalta or any other antidepressants since.
What I *have* tried though is benzodiazepines in different forms. The doctors tell me that ""This is basically the only medication for BPD that's available today in Sweden"". 

I just don't like the idea of being prescribed something (extremely cheap, too, because the government subventions certain medications at a lower price if you get them prescribed enough times), that is highly addictive, could cause sleep apnea, and be potentially life threatening in large doses, when I have episodes where I'm suicidal.

i was diagnosed with bpd when i was 18, which i think is too soon, and my psychiatrist is now unsure if its bpd or adhd od cptsd. 
when young women find out that this world is not built for them, they get angry and that anger is possibly bpd.

Sigh. I feel so defeated.


edit: I’ve gone through DBT Skills therapy classes (twice). It has been very informative and helpful. I just find it hard to stay ‘in the zone’ after a while and eventually fall off and resort to old habits.

My therapist suggested a mood stabilizer (Lamictal) and a couple other medications that could help me stay more consistent and get the most out of my DBT training.

After talking to my doc I was disheartened to find out that due to my autoimmune condition (Sine Scleroderma) it was advised I not start the Lamictal.

I’ve tried SSRIs and SNRIs in the past which seemed to work ok in the beginning but overall just did not address many of the pervasive issues I have.

Because of my condition I’m very limited as to which medications I can take. The only recommendation was to try SSRI again (no SNRI) which puts me back to square one.

185,Prednisone made my symptoms worse,"Cw: substance abuse, suicide mention


I(20f), have been sick with Covid and was prescribed prednisone. I have severe asthma, I’ve been constantly been prescribed it two or three times a year for when I get bronchitis, pneumonia, sinus issues, or any other respiratory issues ever since I was old enough to take pills (9ish). 

Some times they made me count down pills (one day or two I take 4 or 5 throughout the day, then three the next, etc). Every time I took it, I was many more emotional than usual which a common side effect is mood swings. In my adulthood I’ve been prescribed this twice. Both times was after I was diagnosed with bpd at 19, and it enhances my ugly parts of the bpd (anger mainly) and I never remember doing it at all. Normal episodes I remember bits and pieces. It’s like I black out completely. 

This past week and a half I had all my wisdom teeth removed. I was pumped with fentanyl before being put to sleep then prescribed an opioid (hydrocodine) which I wanted to avoid taking since I lost folks to opioid ODs. It didn’t do much for my pain nor gave me issues. Then this past Tuesday I had a positive Covid test. Called my pulmonologist who prescribed me a high dosage of that shit (20mgs three times a day for 5 days). I never had that much ever, I kept feeling like I was being pulled into a walls. Dissociated ten times more, felt zero empathy towards myself and loved ones, then it kickstarted my suicidal thoughts more which made me crave more prednisone for numbing my broken brain. I was in tears when my partner hid it from me, I got more argumentative and felt like I was becoming more crazier. Like I didn’t feel like me.

I had done other drugs (psychedelics, MDMA, alcohol and weed) and gave me zero issues with needing to take it constantly. Knew my limits and watched how often I take things. I never touched anything else. Weed helped my symptoms (few times a week. I used to smoke daily never felt issues with out it for months) which I’m aware doesn’t help all folks with bpd. 

Prednisone is known to amplify mental illness shit more, I had horrible reality issues. I was really sick that I needed it, been wanting to take it every three hours when you’re supposed to take it every 6-12 hours. I was acting like an ADDICT. I never thought my body craved steroids or craved anything like this before. I am going to make a phone call on Monday to my providers about it. I hated everything that it has done to me .

It helped me be able to collect myself before acting, pause on impulsive thoughts, bring the lows from a pit to a more manageable dip. That kind of thing.
But my ADHD and focus became a massive issue because although I felt better mentally I couldn't focus to save my life so my doctor prescribed me Strattera about 3 weeks ago.
I feel horrible.
I'm doing everything I need to do. Going to the gym, eating well, taking my medicine, getting out and being social. But I don't think I've ever felt this depressed before.

I've been on Strattera before (with Prozac) and I did amazing on it. So I'm not sure what the issue is. Has anyone else had bad luck mixing Effexor and Strattera?

When I got my wisdom teeth removed, I explained my situation and they allowed me to have what they essentially called 'the pill form of morphine' and although I didnt feel much pain.

It's the same with most other heavy meds: oxys, xannax, gabapentin, ativan, and a few others that people claim to feel ""high from"" I havent taken any of them often enough for that to be the reason, many of them were prescribed to me previously for assumed ptsd and a spinal surgery I had. Which makes me wonder if this high tolerance is from my nerves being damaged, being prescribed medications so young (15-17 I am now 20), or the high stress and tension someone feels with BPD.

207,Scared and overthinking ,"Hello.
Went to a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with MDD, trauma and bpd traits.
He said he can’t say for sure with trauma and bpd since both have similarities in symptoms, that he needed more sessions with me to figure out, asking me if I am okay with therapy.
He prescribed me with escitalopram, and set a date for the next session.

I searched up trauma and bpd, watched a video, and a part of it which the psychiatrist/ psychologist spoke an example that it’s actually very similar to how I act with my friend, with the difference is the anger and negativity all towards myself.

I told my friend about it, and also show her the video.
She was surprised, I asked if she hated me or held grudge with me, she said no.
She said that I am working on helping myself and that's a good step forward. It means that you care enough for other people you are close with and yourself to be better.
Yet I worry I didn’t do enough, and not quick enough that I lost control and they left.

I might be overthinking and worrying myself since there’s no exact diagnosis coming from the psychiatrist yet.
With what I searched online with bpd, I am so scared my friends would see me differently and eventually leave.

220,if mirtazapine isn’t the last medication i try i’m going to scream,"like the title says, i will screaaaaam. 

i’ve somehow managed to avoid medication since being diagnosed, apart from the odd crisis here and there when they’ve been needed as temporary measures. that doesn’t mean to say i’ve coped well without it, but that if i took medication to manage i’d be taken the piss out of for it. 

so i finally met my new psychiatrist today and after half an hour of explaining how well i’m ‘managing my symptoms’ he prescribed me mirtazapine. i thought i was fine besides the lack of sleep but.. meh. 

ssri’s were his first suggestion, but after a few weeks of happiness i reach a new low each time, the one snri i tried had me sent home from work because i felt so ill, and now i have the pleasure of taking something that might make me gain weight and sleep a ridiculous amount? i’m pissed. i’m now in my mid 20s and if i can’t function for work i’m gonna lose my job. sure, i could tell my boss, but i doubt they’d understand. 

i don’t know what i’m trying to say here, i’m pissed i didn’t try this sooner when the stakes weren’t so high, i’m pissed i’m still not functioning as a healthy adult despite all the cbt and i’m pissed about the fact this could very well be the drug for me and the only way i’m gonna find out is if i take it. 

if this isn’t the last medication i try to make things just a little bit easier i’m just gonna freeball this shit to the end.

i would also like that mention that i get prescribed lexapro but since i have crippling adhd, i’ve never been able to take them consistently. if i did start taking them consistently, will i actually feel better and stop having episodes? let me know because if you think antidepressants will genuinely help me then i’ll make the effort to start taking them.
