0,Recovery is possible,"I just want to share with you all that recovery is possible. I’m 34F and was diagnosed with BPD when I was 28, though I had been having symptoms since middle school. I have been in therapy ever since diagnosis - I did some one-on-one but lots of group therapy: an intensive out patient program, CBT, Emotional Regulation, DBT (which was extremely helpful - I recommend everyone with BPD to try to get into a DBT program) and now I am in ongoing group therapy as maintenance and to continuously work on my trauma. 

I moved across the country and began a Masters program last year. I’m engaged and building a future with my partner. I am making new friends and connections and taking good care of myself. I have so much more peace in my life and my emotional episodes are few and far between. When I do have an episode it is short lived and I recover from it quickly. It has taken a lot of work and commitment to myself, but all the work was worth it. I needed a LOT of new skills to manage the emotional pain and chaos in my life and I’m here to tell you that it worked and I’m really proud of myself!",1645279715.0,False,276,53,astridanomaly,None,swawek,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/swawek/recovery_is_possible/
1,Recovery,"Hello,
I’m really in desperate need of some hope for recovery and remission.
I’m 27 nearly 28 and was diagnosed maybe 5 years ago? I’ve since gotten my masters in art therapy. I see clients, run groups, and have a great rating on ZocDoc. I’m really helping people. But I cannot seem to get a handle on my own symptoms of this terrible disorder. I am miserable and it’s getting to the point where I’m so upset my vision is blurring while I’m seeing people. 
I don’t want to stop this work. I want to be useful and helpful and I know I am being just that, but I cannot keep suffering this way and still be helping others like I am. 
I need to know this gets better. I know I’m 27 and this is a bad age for this disorder. I’ve done countless DBT hours and I present normal and functional, but deep down I am intensely struggling.

2,“Recovery” and suffering quietly,"I have healed a lot over the years, however I think my BPD turned “quiet”. 

I feel like this only benefits my loved ones and those around me as I’m constantly suffering inside. 

I don’t know how to express hurt or disappointment without blowing up. 

So I remain silent. 

I constantly feel like my feelings aren’t valid and “crazy” “stupid” or “not a big deal”. It’s not even worth bringing up. 

So I remain silent. 

If my partner disappoints me I just ignore him and act passive aggressive until my feelings pass. It’s not healthy. It’s better than me blowing up, scaring him, deeply hurting him, etc. 

I’m sure yall already know BPD doesn’t like hurting people. 

Does anyone else struggle with this? Am I recovering or just getting worse? I know these are questions to ask a doctor, I’m just wondering if anyone else has this mindset.

6,Breakup Recovery,"It happened. Again. I drove somebody away with a month-long meltdown that broke their spirit and challenged their own mental health progress. This time, I made a beeline to therapy because I KNEW something was wrong and somehow I was able to finally recognize the pattern that had repeated again and quickly, my therapist recognized BPD (meeting with my psychiatrist this week for a formal diagnosis, etc).

I've been asked to step back for 30 days without contacting my ex (though, she's broken that once for a non-relationship issue and I somehow managed to stay on topic, yay me). And I want to respect that. She hasn't shut the door -- it's still too new and she honestly does not know what she really wants to do (her words, not mine)  and I respect that -- so aside from making sure I actually DO THE DAMN WORK on myself in terms of therapy, medication, healing, etc; I also want to make sure that I do right by her, starting of course with respecting the NC request.

Just curious if any of you have been through it, if you have tips, resources, suggestions, and maybe even success stories?  I'd like to know what worked and what didn't. This ""timeout"" really sucks but at the same time, this could be the most productive 30 days of my entire life and I think that's the only way to go about this with any hope of getting through it without totally breaking down. 

I've long known I needed help. This time, I WANT help. More than I've ever wanted anything in my life. Seeing the issue on paper, at least in my mind, makes it something that I can tackle and less intimidating than the unknown. Especially now that I know what's at stake.

8,1 year post recovery,"I don't have any one to talk about this with so I thought I might post it here.

cw: substance abuse 

At 17 I was diagnosed with BPD and OCPD. I remember thinking that I was doomed for the rest of my life and there was no way I would ever get better. I got accepted to my first pick university with a scholarship and thought that I must be fine since I was still seemingly successful (i was in fact not). I was abusing several substances while managing to keep my grades up. Before I left for university I had a major fallout with my parents. They knew I was struggling and tried to help but my dad had some anger issues so him and I could never communicate without having a massive fight. They also found out I was abusing substances. They didn't want me to go to university but since I had a scholarship they couldn't really stop me.

My first year of university is when everything fell apart. My grades had a exponential decline, I developed CHS (cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome) which at the time only had me in the hospital every over month. I also experienced my first brutal heartbreak which took me out of school for a week. I ended up failing a class, and I didn't know how to handle that because failure was one of my biggest fears and I didn't know how to cope. 

That summer I tried to get a new job (i previously only worked in fast food) and quit only a month in because I wasn't doing as well as I thought I should've been. I went back to fast food and the chaos and stress lead to several breakdowns and a few altercations with customers. I never got in trouble for those as the customers were being incredibly rude to the younger coworkers I had and I was just standing up for them. I guess something important about me was that I did not care if someone disrespected me or did something wrong to me (unless they were someone i trusted deeply or idolized) . I was more often than not set off when someone disrespected someone I cared about. I'm not sure if anyone else is like that. I am still like that but I have more control in my response and its not explosive anymore.

My second year university was the turning point. I was in the hospital once a month at this point. My grades were improving a lot but I was on track to fail calculus which caused frequent breakdowns at least once a week. One of them was so bad I quite literally smashed my phone into several pieces and that resulted in my parents driving to get me and taking me back with them. Both my family doctor and therapist basically said I was not allowed to go back to school for the rest of the school year.

Living with my parents was rough. In the hospital twice a month, a lot of breakdowns because I thought not being in school made me worthless, and an increase in my substance abuse. I also wasn't allowed to work which made the feeling of being worthless much more intense. To keep it short, this was the lowest of the lows. 

I started RO-DBT 3 months after being pulled out of school and it was a 6 month program that I did. Here I am a year since I started the therapy program. I'm back in school and on the dean's list. I have a healthy relationship with my incredibly supportive boyfriend. I'm balancing work and school. I can manage the same things that would make me spiral before. I was failing calculus (again) but instead of  breaking down I managed to study like harder than I've ever done before and managed to pull through with a 93. 

I guess all this to say that it will get better. I truly and wholeheartedly believed that I was never gonna get better and nothing will ever change. 3 years later I've proved myself wrong and I thought that sharing my story would maybe give someone else hope to keep going. Also I am almost a year clean from all the substances I used to do. I truly believe now that it does get better and I hope that this might inspire you to believe that it will get better for you too.",1709603103.0,False,2,1,cherryblasterfroster,None,1b6sx7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1b6sx7e/1_year_post_recovery/
9,Recovery is possible,"Hi guys,

I (23m) was admitted to the hospital on June 14th of this year after a suicide attempt. I spend 3 weeks in the hospital and 3.5 more weeks in daycare after which I started psychotherapy.

On the 4th day the doctor of the department said I likely had bpd and it felt as if my life was over. I heard all the stories about how bpd is incurable and I thought something was terribly wrong with me. 

Now, about 6 months later I no longer fit the criteria for a pd and only have bpd tendencies. I notice that I am way better at handling rejection, I am better at trusting others and I am better and handling my emotions. I am still working on my sense of self, but I am confident I will be able to improve in that aspect as well.

I have stable friendships, found a passion in martial arts (gyms have great communities), and continued my studies to hopefully become a doctor who treats people with bpd.

Therapy is the hardest thing I have ever done. It forced me to look into the mirror and realize that I wasn't just the victim, but that I am the person who needs to change. 

Everyone has a different journey of recovery, but please know that bpd is the best treatable pd out there and you CAN recover.

11,[Announcement] r/BPD Recovery Revamp," Hi r/BPD!

As you may have noticed, we’ve been gradually making some changes around the sub. As this community continues to grow, we recognize the need to become more recovery-focused. 

Moving forward, we’ll be placing a greater emphasis on recovery and providing resources and support for those who are actively seeking to manage their symptoms and improve their overall well-being. Our goal is to foster a community that is centered around hope and the belief that recovery is possible. We want to provide a space where individuals with BPD can come together to support and encourage one another, and where we can celebrate the progress that each person makes on their recovery journey.

We’ll be working to provide a range of resources and tools to support each individual on their unique journey. This might include sharing tips and strategies for managing specific symptoms, providing information on different types of therapy, or offering guidance on building healthy relationships and setting boundaries.

Recovery is not a linear process, and setbacks and challenges are a natural part of the journey. As such, we will be **prioritizing discussions around resilience, self-compassion, and the importance of staying committed to one's recovery goals, even when it feels difficult.**

We also want to make it clear that our subreddit is not only meant for people with BPD. **We welcome everyone who wants to learn more about BPD and support individuals with BPD.** We believe that it's important for our subreddit to be a resource for those who want to better understand this mental health condition and how it affects individuals.

Additionally, we want to emphasize that our subreddit has **zero tolerance for stigmatizing rhetoric. This includes sensationalized pop psychology terms used in various Cluster B hate communities.** We understand the impacts that stigmatizing language has on various mental health communities, and we want to make sure that our subreddit is a welcoming and supportive space.

We have a lot of things we want to implement in the coming months. So far, our priorities have been:

**Change the sub’s visual theme.** We have introduced a more cheerful vibe, not because we want people to think having BPD is fun of course, but because we want people coming in here to know that BPD recovery does not have to be scary, and that there are tons of wonderful people in here who are ready to help others feel seen and understood along their recovery journey.

**Revise our sub rules**. We’re going to be implementing new rules. Please make sure to review them before posting. If you have noticed your posts or comments are not showing up right away, it’s because we’ve increased our crowd control and implemented more automod filters in order to more efficiently filter out potentially harmful content that does not reflect who we are as a community. If your post is fine, it will likely be approved by mods.

**Community Awards.** We have added community awards members and mods can give out! They include fun things like the Stigma Smash! hammer, and **our new mascot, Gemma** (the little star character in our banner).

We have tons of other plans in development and we’re really excited to implement them, so please stay tuned!

Thank you for being a part of this community, and we look forward to working with you to create a more recovery-focused and inclusive subreddit.

I’m not formally diagnosed with BPD. I have ASD and CPTSD diagnosed but Im sure my therapist would give me the BPD label if I asked for it. 

Things are starting to click into place. I’m noticing my reactions are less grandiose, I can handle more social situations and I’m more comfortable taking accountability.

I thought I was fixed two years ago but a failed relationship and inventory of my other personal relationships showed me I had work to do.

At this point of my journey, I feel like I’m glimpsing a normal life. Is that really possible? Sometimes it feels like normality is out of reach. I worry that after this stint of healing I’ll find another blind spot that will make me feel like I’m starting over.

I know with BPD we have highs and lows, but I really hope that staying consistent in mindfulness and healthy habits will become second nature.

Either way I have found myself for years now, splitting on my partner, self harming and self sabotaging, afraid of abandonment, and codependent. And this week I've managed to stay in my confident/capable state of mind, forcing myself to let go of bad feelings that pop up. If I could do this long enough, think I could be normal? My boyfriend is really happy with me right now, I'm finally happy with myself (weird to acknowledge that), and I definitely don't want to screw it up. What are y'all's thoughts on recovery?

27,Experiences of recovery with NHS?,"Hi guys,
Just wondering abt any brits with BPD trying to recover without private help and what your experience has been like.

Personally I feel the NHS failed me. It took 4 years for me since the time I was incorrectly diagnosed with a cycling depression to figure out what why I was so unable to function healthily. Even then, i ended up going to private therapy, which I can now afford once every two weeks as all they can offer is their cbt therapy which did nothing for me before and I don’t trust whatsoever (partly due to the fact it was to treat depression, partly because there was absolutely no connection there and I doubt id find that with somebody assigned to me by the nhs).

Anyway, yh I hated my experience, and I highly doubt I’d ever entrust my mental health to the nhs again.

28,i don’t think recovery is possible (personal opinion),"I dropped out of college because of how bad my mental health got and it made my mental health drop even further because i could see that everyone in my batch started graduating already while I’m just sitting and constantly battling my BPD everyday. I tried looking for work and got accepted but I did something stupid and now I had to drop out of my supposed-job and it’s triggering my episodes even further. My closest grandfather passed away this year and life hasn’t been the same since. 

I just hate that I can’t seem to function like a normal person. I’m so jealous of everyone else who can successfully manage their emotions despite going through things. I hate that I can’t do the things that I used to do, the things that I used to excel at, and the thing is, i’m very much self aware of the things that I should do but every time I take a step forward I get sent 10 steps back, it’s making me lose any form of motivation that I used to have and the thought of it only adds and makes me lose my motivation even further. 

I’m on medications and it doesn’t help me anymore in any form whatsoever even if I increase the dosage (my psychiatrist told me to increase it if necessary). I’m just so lost and I feel so empty. It’s already been 8 years ever since everything started, I’m turning 22 in a few weeks. I’m just so tired already.

29,Im struggling with the idea of recovery. And money?,"I've been struggling with my bpd most of my life but I was diagnosed with it 5 years ago. I'm really struggling with the idea of recovery I'm pretty close to remission. I've worked my ass of in therapy and am no longer acutely suicidal though I can be chronically suicidal. - meaning I just get thoughts I don't act on them. 

I'm at a put in my life where I am living alone and have no friends. I have occasional contact with my brother we are reconnecting after many years. I'm very happy about this. 
Apart from him I am extremely lonely. 

I got a job but recently was made redundant my boss was chaotic and unpredictable I was only working there for 3 months when she said she is moving state and so I had to go. it was a small business. 

I'm currently unemployed and am looking to get an other job. 

I will be coming into some money later on - compensation of some kind I would like not to discuss in detail. 

And I don't know how my life will look it will be scary to think about all the options and choices I could have. 
I'm only me it feels like a waste. I have no hobbies passions or responsibilities 

I wake up walk around the block come home read my book. Pace around the house crying and then go back to sleep and eat it's so mundane and boring it excruciating sitting with my thoughts. 

I know money does not fix everything but I feel this could really open up my life. As my job and hobbies. Currently I am living on benefits until I can get a job. So the idea of having opportunities like this is very overwhelming being bpd. I can be impulsive and indecisive and I'm pulling my hair out about what I will do. 

I could probably move States? Buy a house? Go on Holliday or all three. 

I'm used to living my mundane boring life and the idea of this terrifies me. But the money I'm getting is a chance to set myself up and I don't want to stay where I am in life. 

Any advice on the idea of change and possibility would be appreciated.

34,Recovery wins!!,"I made so much progress over the past year and I'm so proud of myself and wanted to share that.

At the start of 2022, I finally got my official diagnosis. Then went on antidepressants for a few months.

I ended the relationship with my ex and I won't lie, the months after that were hard. But I'm in a much healthier relationship now.

I got rid of some unhealthy coping mechanisms and quit the antidepressants. Now only have some meds for when I feel an episode coming and I actually take them when I need them.

I found lots of new hobbies and go out more. I'm currently meeting lots of new people and making friends.

I started CBT and am actually following my therapist's advice. I really want to work on my issues and can see the progress I'm making. It's not easy and it hurts, but it feels good to finally let out what's been buried for so long.

I can recognize when my BPD is acting up and am working on understanding what causes it and going against it.

I just ordered a DBT workbook to be able to incorporate some coping mechanisms by myself without the help of my therapist.

I'm learning to ask for help and communicate my needs. Unlearning some deeply ingrained beliefs. Finally starting to accept my body.

Everything is so much better than it was a few months ago and I know I still have a long way to go but I finally feel like I can do it. Don't give up, it will get easier!

35,tips & ways of thinking that have helped me on my recovery journey,"- stop overidentifying with bpd. we are not our bpd. it is not a permanent part of us. we are traumatized and in a lot of pain. but we are capable of change and our brains are able to transform over time, with enough dedication. 
- cultivate multiple meaningful relationships. it helps us move away from FP attachment and codependency when we’re able to find comfort and understanding among a network of people, not just one!
- stop thinking of bpd as a disease. bpd is just a category someone made up to encapsulate the symptoms of specific types of trauma we’ve endured. we are not broken, we are just traumatized.
- it’s not our fault we’re this way. nothing is inherently wrong with us that justifies the neglect and abandonment we’ve experienced as children.
- we can focus on taking responsibility for our actions without judging ourselves as good, bad, worthy, or unworthy. nothing about us is permanent. everyone is complicated and has their own baggage too.
- practice emotional regulation & distress tolerance skills when you’re not feeling dysregulated, so it’ll be easier to use them when you’re triggered. focusing on calming my body before my mind has been super helpful. our trauma is stored in our body, so oftentimes when triggered, we feel the physical sensations first, then our mind tells us stories about them. if we try to simply use logic and “think differently,” it doesn’t work because our bodies are still panicking.
- it’s rare that any mistreatment we’ve suffered is personal, even if it looks like that from the outside. everyone has their own trauma and survival mechanisms that kick in when they feel threatened. the majority of people who’ve hurt you weren’t doing so as part of some evil plot. sometimes our monkey brains take over and we hurt people out of self-preservation. that goes for us and the people that have hurt us. we don’t have to forgive everyone, but we can understand that it didn’t happen because of something that’s especially wrong with us.
- cultivate self-love by looking at videos and pics of your child self. why is it easier to love that child? is it because they’re innocent and haven’t done all the bad things we’ve done yet? remember that that child lives within you; they ARE you.
- we don’t have to shame ourselves for our big feelings. we can accept them and feel them without acting in destructive ways. it’s okay to cry. it’s okay to be angry. it’s okay to be scared. we can feel those emotions without running away, without breaking things, without hurting ourselves.
- spend meaningful time alone. have fun by yourself! do something that you love to do without thinking about what other people want to do. enjoy your own company. find your passions.
- when you’re feeling triggered and tempted to engage in destructive behaviors, challenge yourself to do ONE thing differently than before. examples from my life:
“i’m not going to run away this time”
“i’m not going to drink this time”
“i’m not going to hurt myself this time”
even if you didn’t handle things perfectly, you did one thing differently, and that’s something to be proud of.

but i’ve found any treatment every offered never cuts it. i’ve tried so many treatments and medications and private treatments, holistic treatments, several forced and voluntary hospitalisations and nothing. ive been referred to as a “revolving door patient”. i did a short course of DBT informed therapy which did f*ck all. 

i’m in this awful loop of “you’re not safe in the community, we’re admitting you to psych.” which turns into “being in hospital is making you more sick we are sending you home with no help” and it just keeps on going.

39,I’m in recovery!,"Hi guys! I wanna share this because I’m feeling extra excited today!

My story with borderline is a long and complicated one. I was a troubled but really talented child and teenager, so for a long time no one even considered the idea of me having mental health problems. All the evidence was there, but it was ignored until I ended up in a hospital at the age of 17. It happened two more times after that, but it was hard to get any help only because outside of my episodes I was considered “high-functioning”. I was living on my own in a foreign country, getting good grades in college and graduating with a first, and somehow finding different jobs to survive. One doctor even said ‘you could never deal with this if you were that sick’ (wow).

In November 2021 I ended up being held on a ward and later moved to the safe house (from which I ran away but that’s another story). That was the day I said enough and pushed to see a psychiatrist and eventually I got through. 

After 10 years I finally got an official diagnosis and properly-managed medication. I also invested into private therapy and stuck with it this time. I feel so much better now! I still experience episodes but they’re much more rare. I have held a job for 10 months, I’m in a happy relationship and have a good group of friends. I even finally got rid of my anaemia because I learnt to take care of myself.

I also strongly feel that people should have a safe space to talk about their experiences with PwBPD without policing or judgement. I’m not going to tell anyone anything about what they experienced, nor am I interested in doing so. I just have an issue when misinformation spreads about what the disorder actually is. There are people who genuinely believe that people with BPD are inherently abusive because of BPD, and are just overall shitty people to be around.

47,Light at the end of the tunnel (recovery),"Just a few quick CW: mentions of SH, disordered eating, Suicidal thoughts, substance/alcohol abuse.


I had struggle with mental health in my early teens and it progressively spiralled as I got older. 3/4 years ago I was diagnosed with BPD, at this time I was pregnant and it took a of a toll on my already poor mental health. I was disassociating the majority of the time and using some very dark and concerning humor to get through.

Before becomming homless I tried everything to get therapy but I was denied (too much for some and not ill enough for others).

I came under a team specifically for pregnant women and mother but they have limited time with you and any progress I made was lost very quickly when i was left with nothing after the time limit had been reached. I began smoking and drinking daily to cope and turned to SH as a release.

My symptoms sky rocketed and I experienced auditory and visual hallucinations, severe paranoia, disordered eating, insomnia, major depressive episode and some dangerous impulsive behaviours. This was all made worse by constant moves every few months to temporary accommodations and I couldn't get through the day without wanting to end it all at least once.

The symptoms stayed likt this for a couple years or so and during that time, I ended up going into hospital for SH as it was very deep and my friend and her family were very concerned for me. At the time my son was awake, he was around a year ( my friend found me in the bedroom, called her family to take me to hospital and took my some into his room so he couldnt see anything). I'm ashamed to say I thought I would lose him and be admitted that day. Luckily for me the hospital let me walk right out without even having any stitches or seeing a mental health professional. This day was a big turning point as I had never cut this deep and I was utterly terrified for my life and my sons future.

I struggled with daily life still smoking and drinking to cope but rarely SH and never as bad as before. I was ashamed and guilt ridden because I was the main carer for my son and I was barley managing to keep myself looked after, I was lucky my friend helped so much.

In the 3 year period I had been on 4 or 5 different meds in an attempt to minimise symptoms but for me personally it only made me feel more detached, depressed and numb which didn't help with the intrusive thoughts.

Once we had a permanent place to live, my friend made an appointment with a private therapist for me and I came off my medication (though my psychiatrist advised many times against it and offering to up them to the highest dose or change them again), I came off them cold turkey and experienced serious shakes, vomiting and another increase in symptoms, but once the withdrawals had passed I began to feel again.

I felt present and less like a zombie, the days didnt blur together as much. I started therapy and the therapist was lovely, very understanding. She helped me find things I enjoyed and helped me be greatful for what I have and who I am.

It's been over a year since I've started therapy and since then I am now: 9 months clean of substance abuse, 11 months clean alcohol abuse, 1 year clean of self harm and no longer experience intrusive/suicidal thoughts.

I am now working part time and functioning as a human being, enjoying hobbies and not only managing to look after my sons but enjoying it, he is healthy and happy and very good at regulation and i dentifying emotions as we do it together now.
I have better relationships with members of my family and no longer struggle with all of my prior symptoms, though I do still have bad days I know how to take care of my self and regulate in those times and not hold it against my self. Recovery is not a straight road and there is always going to be rough days but there is a better day tomorrow. I am forever greatful to my friend, who pulled me from the edge countless time and without her I wouldn't have been here to start my recovery.

49,My first steps to recovery,"My first step towards recovery started with trust.

Growing up the only person I could trust was myself. My parents had made a habit of not being there for me except to hold up appearances of a well knit nuclear family, and my parents had instilled in me that friends were not to be trusted. They would hurt you too.  If you lacked the foresight to withhold your weakness people would use those things to manipulate you. I moved through life floating from person to relationship simply taking on traits or values as it became useful to the people around me.

I am so lucky to one night have had the realization that trust CAN be stupid but fuck it lets try. Its been 25 years and i cant keep living this way.  The biggest hurdle to overcome actually was “this person doesn’t actually care about my problems and are just here for the money they dont actually want whats best for me” Well in classic therapy fashion:  Who does that say more about? Me? the person in therapy trying to get better or the so called therapist whos supposedly just there for cash.

I connected with my new therapist and heres how it went;

*”Hi its so nice to meet you, i want to get this out of the way right now im really bad at therapy. I lie because i think i need to say the right things, im gonna have the urge to ghost and mainly im going to downplay and joke about things going on in my life but i WANT to be here and i want to change. Can we create a space where I can unlearn these habits?”*

Ive been cramming my schedule with different people so i wouldnt have to spend time alone, but at the same time it’s exhausting n i feel like im running myself dry. As a result ive been trying to spend some time alone but its still v anxiety inducing. I even find myself wanting to sleep all day to avoid planning any of my days, unless its with others. I do plan on going back to therapy but havent put in the effort to find one yet (don’t like my old ones). I realized yesterday that part of my anxiety is because I don’t have a “favorite person” to base myself around, the thought kind of terrifies me. I want to push past it and experience myself but cant help being scared. Can anyone, anyone at all, relate to this and maybe give me some advice on how to regulate myself, how to cope, if this is normal, if anyone else has experienced this!!!!! and what i should do.

Here we go 
-Exercise! I hate exercising especially when I’m stressed out or depressed but I find that specifically easy arm exercises I can do while I’m just standing around really helps get me endorphins and distracted and I’m getting stronger doing that. 
-Journaling. I know it’s a very common tip but having a place to get our emotions while you’re feeling consumed can be healthy, I use mine to get out a lot of feelings about something and then switch to doing something totally different to get my mind used to letting things go. 
-Healthy detachment and nonattathment , I like to visualize a the things I want for my future that don’t involve anyone else (graduating college, becoming better at things, being happy with myself single) and practice healthy detachment to anything that doesn’t contribute to that, this helps me stop dwelling on triggers and the past.

I've had a really difficult couple of years, with it reaching its peak last October when I had a suicide attempt and then had a very difficult recovery. Now I feel my life is actually getting better - I think my medication is helping, I've started university, I'm maybe more stable than ever. 

The medication I'm on made me realise how black and white my thinking was before, and it restored my libido to what I assume is a normal level (after what I think was straight up sexual dysfunction for years, i was so used to feeling nothing most of the time)

I think I have a crush, which is amazing!!! Cause I got so destroyed by my ex last year, I never thought I could even find anyone else attractive again, or be capable of dating again. It's been so long though that I'm worried it's a ""favourite person"" thing. Like how do normal people date?? Or flirt?? Or even just know if they like someone for real??? What if I'm just horny and I mess up a good potential friendship over it??

63,Dealing with Guilt in Recovery,"Hi everyone!

I (18F) was officially diagnosed with borderline and bipolar early this year, I've been in and out of therapy since I was around 12 and am finally starting to make some serious changes with the help of DBT, medication, and a therapist who actually believes in me and holds me accountable. 

I am gaining a lot of insight around how I was pre-recovery. I've been in the same relationship since I was 16, and my boyfriend has been put through the thick of my undiagnosed mental illness- more than anyone else. Remembering my old behaviors almost makes me sick, and I feel a lot for my partner and what I put him through; I was not always a healthy girlfriend or person to be around. I was impulsively doing drugs, had a lot of abandonment issues with no ability to cope, etc etc etc. I have made an active choice to be honest with him about my past actions and also commit everyday to working around my warped perception of reality and thinking. I am choosing to apologize for the last three years by putting my all into recovery and being a healthier person with better coping skills. 

With that in mind, I wanted to ask how people have dealt with not feeling like the shittiest person ever during recovery- because I know getting caught in the guilt and self-hatred will bring me right back to square one.

So I don't have an official diagnosis, but it's at least likely that I have BPD, and I am in the process of getting a new therapist.

I'm frustrated because I feel pretty stuck. I have definitely had BPD traits at least since I was a teenager (I'm 25 now), but it wasn't until I was 21 that I started to do research. Because of things like looking things up/researching constantly (and being on this subreddit specifically, even)and going to DBT courses, I have definitely made some progress. Many of my symptoms are not nearly as bad as they were before. And (CW: self-harm, drugs), I don't self-harm anymore, even in terms of doing things like smoking.

However, even though I am much better in a lot of areas, I still have trouble and have bad enough symptoms that it still definitely affects my life and the people around me, especially my partner. For the people who have made some progress, what do you do when you feel stuck? Is there anyone who has done CBT and DBT but don't really feel like they can get much more out of them that has advice?

71,How I'm stopping with the whole 'FP' thing.. (Recovery),"This is probably going to be a crazy long post. Also I'm just sharing what's been working for ME.  My goals here are not to trigger anyone.  If you're in a bad place with your FP or struggling with some dark emotions, this post probably isn't one for you to read (not at all judging you, I've been there and I recognize that I wouldn't want to read this stuff if I was having a bad day.)   I'm aware that most therapists are not aware of the term FP and that some people just categorize it under a broader BPD trait.  I personally disagree and I think that there's something deeper there but I've given up on trying to figure it out.   My goal has been (and in sharing this) for those of us who are SICK of the FP cycle and are willing to have the strength to look at for what it is and take responsibility for ourselves, our emotions and our actions.

The worst aspects of my disorder play out in my FP relationship:  black/white thinking, splitting, idealizing/devaluing, etc.  Below are some ""take aways"" that I have learned from a five plus year relationship with an FP.  It's a work in progress, but I am getting better everyday.    

1.  Making someone else responsible for MY emotions is wrong.   
2.  My FP's thoughts, perceptions, actions, emotions and ideas are their own and 99% actually have NOTHING to do with me.    LITERALLY NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.
3.  This is tied to number 2.   My interpretations of my FP's thoughts, perceptions, actions and emotions are almost always wrong.   Not misunderstood, or miscommunicated; WRONG.  Again, the vast majority of the time, my FP's choices and actions actually have nothing to do with me.  There's no judgment to them.  They're not negative or positive because it's not about ME.   Example:   The long pause on the reply text, the text that is just stating information but is read by me as being negative, me interpreting a certain ""look"" by them, etc.
4.  Even though I have spent hours, days, and weeks of time thinking about them, they are not thinking about me.   This does not make them a bad person.   They are living their lives.   They are thinking about their job, the weather, their other friendships, etc.  At times, they do think of me.  But in no way, does their level of concentration match mine.  It never will.  And it shouldn't.
5.  I have to take responsibility for the many times that I have tried to emotionally manipulate and control my FP.   This usually happens through gifting.  Whether it be a physical, emotional or even sexual ""gift.""   If the gift isn't given freely or if the gift is given with certain expectations of how the recipient is supposed to act after the gift is received, that is called manipulation.  
6.  I have to take responsibility for my lack of constancy.  My FP can be ""perfect.""  He can validate me, send me the perfect gift, send me a beautiful letter, etc. and in that moment, all is well.  Until, usually, the next day, when my need for validation starts all over again.   
7.  Again 6-7 are tied together.  I have to take responsibility for ""testing"" my FP.  This is another form of manipulation.   Where I take an action just to see if my FP will take the ""bait.""  Because secretly I believe that my FP loathes me the way I loathe myself.   So I come up with ways to trap my FP.   If they fail the ""test"" (being late for dinner, missing a text, forgetting an important date,etc.) my anger/rage feels justified.  ""See!! you really DO hate me!!""   
8.   I have to take responsibility for how I view myself.   Inside of all of us are little boys and girls who are basically scared to death.  No one has ever stood up for them.  No one has ever fought for them.  No one has ever truly parented them in a healthy way.   It's time for ME to be the PARENT to the CHILD inside of me.  For me, that plays out in mundane ways.   Making sure I pay my bills, making sure my apartment is clean and tidy, making sure I exercise and eat healthy, making sure I see my therapist, etc.  I'm not doing this stuff because I HAVE TO, I'm doing this stuff because for THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, I'm going to take responsibility for my life for that kid that still lives inside of me that's incredibly scared and afraid.   My FP can't do it for me.  I have to do it for myself.

And in taking care of myself and in loving myself, maybe one day, I can provide the open, loving, supportive friendship that my FP truly deserves.

Believe me, I know what it feels like to emotionally ""imprint"" on someone.  I know that we usually pick the wrong someone's.  I've purposely avoided talking about any aspect that involves the OTHER person, because at the end of the day, we can only control OURSELVES. 

I wish you all peace and I hope this helps someone out there who's fighting the same fight as me!

UPDATE 4/18/17:  I am going to post some of my original thoughts unedited.    I was worried it would be too long but I'm going to post it because this has hit home with a lot of you.   Some of it is the same info but it's a little more in depth and talks about the FP cycle that we all endure.

I have been incredibly frustrated with the lack of information and understanding in the therapeutic community about how people with borderline tend to latch onto one person (commonly referred to as FP.)   Most therapists are unfamiliar with the term and there is literally nothing in the literature or in the research (at least not that I've found.) I'm frustrated because this is something we need help with understanding and processing and recovering from as a community.

Most people will explain this away by saying this the idea of an FP can be attributed to the overall dysfunction displayed by some BPD traits (splitting, black/white thinking, idealizing/devaluing) and while this is true, there is something SPECIFIC and UNIQUE about this particular phenomena and how it relates to people within the BPD community.   If you go to ANY online community that includes BPD'ers you will undoubtedly see the concept come up and you will see people post concerns and issues that they have about their FP.

In addition, there is a COMMONALITY to experience that we all share.    It's like all of our stories match.  They are the most important person in the world to us.   They may or may NOT be our significant other.  The relationship usually has sexual or romantic overtones but it also may be completely platonic.   The common phrase that some people use is that it feels like you IMPRINT on the other person.  Their responses, perceptions, interactions, words, feelings, and thoughts completely control your emotions and feelings.   Everything they do from a facebook ""like"" to the response time of a text is VERY VERY important to us.    Anything minor can make us feel like we've been devalued and the emotional response that we feel is often devastatingly intense, so much so, that we may feel like someone kicked us in the stomach.    An example would be if we text them and they, for whatever reason, are unable to reply for six hours, those six hours are are an unimaginable nightmare where we feel like we're freefalling into emptiness and despair.  We feel like we will DISAPPEAR unless we get VALIDATION from our FP.

We are the best of friends.  We provide anything and everything our FP could possible want or need, in any way.  Physical gifts, emotional support, sexual favors, anything at all.   We will often change and adapt our personalities and opinions to fit theirs.   We will place them on the highest of pedestals.  In return, we need to be validated by them.   Every single day.  Sometimes multiple times throughout the day.  Sometimes hourly.  If we don't receive the validation in the way we want it, and in the time that we want it in, we then often retaliate by lashing out.    Using the same texting example, we send the text and don't hear back for a while so we may choose to text them and say, ""don't bother ever texting me again, sorry I was such a bother!!""  or something similar.

When we lash out, the dark feelings only intensify.   They become completely overwhelming and our minds are completely consumed.   There is NO remedy for the agony until the FP communicates, we apologize profusely and often emotionally and then reset the cycle to repeat all over again.     The sense of profound RELIEF and HAPPINESS we feel when all is right with us and our FP is amazing.  Life is worth living again!  Everything is OK,   Everything seems lighter.  The sun shines brighter.  All is well.  And once again, they are the most amazing, beautiful, intelligent and wonderful people on the planet.

We will often unconsciously ""test"" our FP by using certain words or placing them in certain situations or manipulating them.  This is because we secretly believe that regardless of what they say or do, that they despise us.   When we find ""evidence"" of what we perceive to be proof that they hate us, we tend to lose it on them emotionally.   This may play out in small or big ways.   They may be late for a dinner or they may forget our birthday or something similar.    Even though this is an incredibly emotionally painful process for us, there is a part of us that feels vindicated.   LIke see I knew you hated me, and now I have proof!

This repeated cycle usually brings out what we all fear the most.  The FP will get tired of the game and will eventually abandon us.  Even though we are responsible for most of the it, most of us are not self aware enough to see it.   The period of time without an FP is agonizing and many of us feel incredibly empty.

Ok so that's a fairly thorough portrait of what an FP is.   It's obviously dysfunctional.  It's obviously broken.  I do have to say that there are moments of pure joy and beauty too.  There is a closeness and intimacy that I've never felt with anyone else except my FP.   However, in order for us to make progress in our lives we have to find a way to move beyond this.  We have to find a way to STOP  this cycle from ruining our recovery.  I have spent many years trying to find a solution.  For at least half of that time, my focus has been on the FP themselves.  Are they a narcissist?   Why would they allow such adoration and gifting?  This thinking has only muddied the waters.  Ultimately, I've realized that we cannot control THEM.  We never could.  We can only control ourselves and our own thoughts and actions.  So the focus HAS to be ONLY on us.   I know that's hard for a lot of you to accept.  It was for me too.   There are a million unique situations where you could prove the point that your FP was wrong about this and hurt you when they did this, etc, HOWEVER, for the purpose of OUR recovery, the focus can and should only ever be about US.




1.  Making someone else responsible for YOUR emotions is wrong.   No one else is responsible for you.  Not your parents, not your therapist, and definitely not your favorite person.   YOU are responsible for you.   Inside of you is a little boy or girl that is sad, lonely and afraid.   They're desperate for someone to validate them, to SEE them and to make their world ok.  For the first time in that little boy or girls life, YOU need to be that person for them (yourself).  You need to take your life seriously.   Make your bed, pay your bills on time, take a shower, do the laundry, exercise, eat healthy, quit smoking and abusing drugs and alcohol.   All of those things that we consider mundane.   THOSE are the very things that build a safe, nurturing and secure environment for the child inside of us.   It's about taking care of yourself!  Thinking outside of yourself and in terms of taking care of the child can help.

2.  Often our perceptions are 100% wrong.   Like not just misinterpreted or miscommunicated but WRONG.    As hard as it is to accept 99% of the thoughts, choices, ideas, perceptions and ACTIONS of our favorite person have absolutely nothing to do with us.   Read that again.   They have NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.  They're not negative or positive.   They have nothing to do with you at all.   Our favorite person is a separate entity, a separate identity and they make choices and experience life through their own very narrow and understandably selfish lenses.   It's about THEM because it's THEIR life and THEIR experience.      We're interpreting their actions through own selfish lenses.   So we take great offense to whatever it is that they ""did"" when in actuality it had nothing to do with us.  How often have we wondered why our FP hurts us over and over again?    It's because there is no INTENT to hurt.   They are simply living their lives and being authentic to their own specific personality.   I'm not all saying they're perfect.  I'm saying that their actions generally are not meant to inflict the emotional anguish that they do.

3.   Another hard one.   They're not thinking about you.     How many days have you spent where your mind has continuously looped around your FP?   What are they doing?  What are they thinking?  What if they're hanging out with someone else?  The truth is they're just living their life!    They're thinking about you just as much as you're thinking about someone that's in your circle of friends (non-fp).    That doesn't make them cruel.   That means they're just going about their day.   If your FP is your significant other, they're still not thinking about you and shouldn't be.  They're thinking about what's happening at work.  They may be chatting with their friends.  They may be having lunch with their boss.   But they're NOT thinking about you.  So why should you spend all the hours in your day thinking about them?

4.   They get tired.     So they've picked up on the emotional cues and they actually make an effort and try.   They buy you thoughtful gifts, they send you a lovely note, or they text you a beautiful message.  Unfortunately, many of us have no sense of constancy in our relationships to our FP's.  So guess what, regardless of how nice the gesture was on Monday,  if there is more than a five second pause on a return text on Tuesday, they can expect an emotional, intense, angst-filled reply text.   This process over time can be exhausting and can lead them to feel like it doesn't matter what they do or don't do anymore.    They're human.  They get tired.   

One of the most important things I've learned from my FP is that most all of the time, everything IS OK!!  Our relationship is FINE.    Nothing is ""going on.""   They don't ""hate me.""   

It breaks my heart that for so many of us we lose the very people that we care about MOST in the world over literally nothing.   I'm not trying to minimize our feelings.  I'm just saying that sometimes.... most times... they're wrong.

I certainly don't have all the answers.  There are times we also need to stand up for ourselves more.   The POINT of this post is that we have to be our own SOURCES of emotional support.  Ultimately we have to know that we have our OWN backs!!  No one else can save us.  We have to save ourselves.    Once we've got that figured out, THEN we can be the awesome friends and lovers that we all know we can be.

74,losing motivation for recovery and random ramble TW,"TW for drug use and self harm talk

i feel as though i may be losing motivation for recovery. i'm using on and off again and haven't attended any NA meetings in a while, i'm struggling to eat enough, and i'm feeling suicidal again and spending most of my time inside my head. i'm starting to fall into that depressive spiral again. and it's not a good feeling.

i do think one of the things contributing to the emptiness in my life is the fact that i no longer have a FP. i miss the feeling of having someone to look forward to talking to and who i could lean on when i needed it but i guess it really is better if i'm not emotionally draining her anymore and she isn't there to cause all that emotional turmoil. it just really does feel empty.

being homeless also really contributes to the sadness i feel because, let's be real, it's not easy to recover in and out of shelters and on the streets. i want to be housed and i'm really trying but i get paid a quarter of the living wage here by the government. i can't rent and live off of what they're giving me.

i am, however, a good 4 weeks clean from self harm and it does feel good. i just don't feel like i deserve to be clean. it's just that i'm finally healing and all the hospital trips, pain and infections were enough to motivate me to want to end this decade (or more) long problem. i just can't give myself the credit for it. i don't feel like i deserve this at all. i'm depressed, right? i should punish myself. make myself feel something. but in the end i always feel worse and i want to heal and get tattoos over them because i'm so sick of the uncomfortable questions. but why do i get sad when the scars fade? who knows.

i guess i just needed to vent. i feel like an idiot lately. i need to stop getting in fights. act my age. find hobbies. but why is that so hard?

(kinda unrelated: on second thought, i do have a hobby. i love urban exploring. just where i live it can be pretty dangerous so i need to get transpo to some nicer spots. but the asylum here and our candy factory are mad interesting. not sure if this is allowed but if anyone has any interest in urban exploring i'm always here to answer questions because i've been through the works with safety prep and i've seen some things happen and i always want people to be prepared when getting into this hobby because i was that BPD kid who learned about urban exploring and went a little too far and wasn't too safe. let me know if unrelated stuff isn't allowed, i just find it's hard to find reliable information and i like to share my personal experience.)

i'm thinking of getting into boxing as well. one of our studios is offering a few free boxing lessons to people at the shelter. i feel like that could help me cope with some of the built up anger i feel. i feel really guilty for being so angry and it makes me feel like a bad person. i'm not sure if that's a bpd symptom or what but it's really bothersome. if anyone can relate and has found a way to vent their anger, please let me know.

once again, i guess i just needed to vent. if you've read this far, thank you for listening to what i have to say and i hope your day is a good one.

82,"feel like after years of ""recovery"" I've relapsed","Hey

I was diagnosed with BPD about 15 years ago and it just made total sense when I was told what I had. It was very much a lightbulb moment and I was so relieved that there was a reason I thought the way I thought and felt the way I felt. Anyway, I did years of therapy and tweaked my meds and all that jazz and it really helped.

I thought that I was, to an extent, recovered. Or at least in recovery.

But now I feel like I'm slipping back into old habits and thought patterns, although part of me thinks the only reason I felt like I was in recovery was because I had essentially pushed everyone away to the point that I had no interpersonal relationships and therefore couldn't get all messed up about them.

I'm so depressed again to the point that my doctor has put my meds on a weekly dispense cos I said I'd end up taking all of them at once and hope for the best, I'm self-harming regularly, I've had to take time off work and when I am actually at work I can't do my job properly, I feel like the world's biggest loser, I'm absolutely disgusted whenever I look in the mirror as I'm obese, and I half want to start drinking again even though I've been sober nearly five years.

I was sent to the local psychiatric hospital and was assessed, and now I'm waiting for an appointment to have my medication reviewed by a psychiatrist. I'm also on a waiting list for psychodynamic therapy but god knows how long that will take.

I kinda feel like I've got no hope left. Like the jealousy and splitting and all that is getting out of hand in the few friendships I have with my colleagues. I'm so lonely but I feel like if I do try to reach out I'll just screw everything up with everyone.

83,BPD Recovery through Medication,"Hi everyone. I’m going to share with you what helped me recover from my bpd. 

I was in and out of therapy and hospitalizations for years. I dealt with my trauma, I learned the coping skills but something was still very wrong with my brain. Every little thing bothered me and made me upset and anything could be a trigger. My emotions were so intense it was as if something traumatic was happening to me everyday. I had extreme episodes of rage and sadness that I just couldn’t control. I was endlessly suicidal. I was self harming in extreme panic. 

During my last hospitalization, I was really out of control and I had delusional paranoia that the doctors and my family were conspiring against me. It was horrible. The psych prescribed me an antipsychotic called risperdal in the ward that I had no choice but to take even tho I was terrified it would kill me or permanently disable me. As soon as I took it I noticed a sense of calm come over me almost like a benzo would. My thoughts stopped racing and for the first time i felt real relief from my brain without the messed up feeling from a benzo. 

When I got out of the hospital a week later I noticed I had blurry vision like as if I needed glasses. I couldn’t see the TV very well and reading or driving was impossible. It took about another 2 weeks for that side effect to go away. It sounds scary, but honestly I felt so good from having relief from my brain that I was happy to deal with it. 

It’s 7 months later and I am thrilled to say that I am still stabilized. It feels like night and day difference and my loved ones see it too. The only other med I take is the lowest dose of Zoloft bc the risperdal helps with my anger/paranoia/panic and the Zoloft helps with the sadness. I have tried well over 15 different meds but I have finally found this golden combo. 

There is hope! And if you were like me, feeling like you just aren’t trying hard enough to get better and blaming yourself for being the way you are just know that sometimes your brain is actually sick and no matter how many therapy hours you put in and coping skills you learn it will never be enough until you find the right medication. It’s not your fault! Don’t give up!

84,resentment towards recovery?,"This is probably gonna ramble and be at least a bit incoherent, but does anyone else have a lot of bitterness towards the world that manifests in a counterintuitive resentment towards recovery?
for context: I was homeschooled most my life in a very toxic household with very strange, countercultutal beliefs and I never formed friendships and I thought that not having a support system was my problem, but after I went out into the world and made those friends I realized there's no real way for these people to understand me in any meaningful way now. all the trauma I experienced, the sexual abuse, etc. was all experienced in a setting where I was just trapped at the scene of the crime, had not a single person to talk to or way to escape, and spent all of my time keeping my emotions under wraps as to not anger my family members. it feels like I was raised on another planet and no one else except for me is capable of understanding quite what that's like, unless they too have BPD.
 unfortunately it's gotten to the point where I really resent people without BPD when they tell me I need to ""get better"" or any other sort of language that implies there's something wrong with me, and I *KNOW* logically BPD is a disorder and it's supposed to be worked on, but emotionally it feels like I've overcome so much alone (and a lot of my ""toxic"" behavior is simply directed inwards so nobody can say I'm a bad person, since I'm not causing them any trouble) so why should they get to tell me how to cope with my trauma?
 I've had people say to me that I'm not trying hard enough to get better (usually people who barely know me too LMAO) and not only does that make me absolutely furious since I've spent literally years alone fighting to just stay alive and I've made incredible amounts of progress with SO many barriers against me, it makes the contentious part of me brain actively push back against getting better: it's like an instinct that says: you don't think I'm trying hard enough? who are you to even tell me I have to get better? Why should you get to tell me what to do with my life? I want to have a better life, but as soon as someone without BPD tells me I need to recover/get better xyz there is an immediate flare of ""well now I don't want to"".
it just feels so inauthentic for others to be giving me advice on how to cope - the majority of the narrative seems like I'm being told not to recover not so I can have a better quality of life and feel better, but so I'm less of a burden to society. I know this stems from feeling like I was failed by so many people who should've noticed over years and years that something wasn't right with my living situation, with my mental health, etc. and the number of people who have abused and abandoned me , so I've resorted to a very self protective state where I'm the only person I can rely on, and I know the people saying it to me now aren't the same people who have hurt me, but since the outside world wasn't there for me when I was helpless and alone, why should they get to tell me how I'm supposed to live my life after it? It doesn't feel like they're saying these things because they care about me and because they want me to have a better life, but because I'm a problem. 
deep down, I do want to feel better. but I want it to be on my terms and I really resent the feeling that there's an obligation to get better because there's something wrong with me - I'm the way I am for a reason : I've protected myself thus far and I've created a good life all by myself and I don't like being told that my diagnosis makes me Wrong, you know? it makes me feel like I'm somehow just a walking wound that needs to be fixed.

85,Actively sabotaging recovery WHY,"So aside from having bpd, I (21) struggle with alcoholism and substance abuse aswell. 
I‘ve been in an out of therapy this year. Did 10 weeks of DBT in a hospital and have had several stays at the crisis center. Since my first stay I‘ve decided to get clean. I go to NA meetings and once I even made it to 3,5 months. 
My recent relapse was shortly before my last hospital stay. After that I made it to almost 30 days, went to many more meetings and was coping quite ok with all kinds of triggers.

86,DAE think recovery makes them a boring dulled down version of themselves?,"I am self aware and I would say fairly recovered from BPD - I still struggle A LOT but I have good coping mechanisms for the more extreme behaviours now. However I often feel that I don’t like myself or my life ‘recovered’. My coping mechanisms make me boring, limit my life hugely, and sometimes make me selfish. 

I have to be so strict on maintaining my routines and schedule and make sure I do everything I can every day to stay in control, there’s no space for spontaneity or fun. 

For example, I panic if I’m out past 8 or 9pm because I know being tired makes me worse. I avoid anything that makes me feel too happy (like that excited, giddy feeling) because I find it can lead to spiralling and out of control emotions. Happiness is something I actively avoid because I feel so out of control with it and start to panic. All I do now is stay at home and watch Netflix. I try to just stay moderately depressed or flat all the time.

I don’t have many friends and I’m scared to make new ones in case I go back to old ways. I can be really selfish and prioritise my own needs above anyone else’s (eg. cancelling plans or not being there for people when they need) because I’m so scared to slip up. 

Although I used to be incredibly erratic and cause people a lot of pain, people also found me fun and interesting and different. I was passionate about things and I actually had more friends than I do now. I sometimes miss the crazy and fun side of myself. It’s conflicting as at the time that rollercoaster was unbearable but now I miss it.... I’m never passionate about anything any more. I don’t really care about anything.

87,What propelled my recovery,"Hey all, just wanted to reach out and share what has finally landed me to the point in my life where I actually feel emotionally stable and content. I was diagnosed with BPD at 21, I am almost 25 now and I consider myself to be recovered as I and no longer meet the DSM-5’s criteria for BPD and haven’t for almost a year now😊When you are at your low points BPD is mental, emotional and even physical agony. I hope this can help anyone who is feeling painfully hopeless or low know that you are not broken, you a beautiful human with a complex mind that is worthy of love and capable of happiness. 

1. Therapy
Having a therapist to talk to and rely on as a someone to listen to you without judgment and help you redirect your thoughts can be a lifesaver when feeling like you are trapped alone in your own mind forever, adding to the downward spiral that can take you to your personal hell. When I first started going, I have absolutely no trust in my therapist and would even lie about things happening in my life, but over time I developed trust and transparency and gained a better understanding of my own mind, what would trigger reactions and how to manage painful events and emotions that would come my way. 
 
2. Spirituality and connection to the world around me.
I’m just going to say that I think religion can be extremely toxic; especially to a person who already thinks in black and white. Learning about God/ Spirit/ the Devine energy that we are all connected by changed me by opening up my eyes that no one is either good or evil; there is no Heaven or Hell and instead incorporating the idea that a person represents how much love and connection to others they feel inside themselves has helped me to love others more as well as love myself for the beautifully flawed human that I am. I practice shamanism, and incorporate ideas from Buddhism and Paganism mainly. 

3. Mindfulness, grounding and attitude checking myself.
To say that I walk around like a blissfully happy, new person now would be such a lie lol. However, on my low days I now realize that I have the power to move outside of the storm inside my brain and take back control of my emotional state. More often then anything I find I am the person convincing myself that everything is pointless. When I do this I remind myself to be gentle, do some self care (like take a bath) and speak positive things outloud to myself, and encourage myself like I would do to a friend who is down, this took A LOT of practice

4. Journaling and reading
Keeping a journal these last 4 years has been so great because I always felt like I had someone to talk to when I needed to vent or sort through thoughts, and it serves as a great source of inspiration now looking back at the timeline of my life, as well as a way to see what has worked and not worked in my therapy and my self-therapy routines. 
Reading has been HUGE in helping me understand BPD and myself. My favorite books have been: I Hate You- Don’t Leave Me, The Buddha and the Borderline, Mindfulness for BPD and I have also read DBT workbooks as well as C-PTSD workbooks.

I deal with a ton of narcissistic, toxic people in my life and after teaching myself to own up to my own shit, I started learning that I didn’t need to take other people’s shit too. After realizing your own tendencies to develop co-dependant relationship and why that is, you have to stop letting other people feed off you and using you as a punching bag. Say NO as often as you need, telling yourself you are doing it out of love for yourself and that is more important than anything. Developing healthy space between yourself and others will help validate your own existence and give you time to figure out what you like to do, and what makes you feel good and bad. Listening to yourself is everything ❤️

BPD sucks, and there is so much stigma towards it that it can feel embarrassing to even start to get help. But just know that having BPD means you’ve been through some shit; you are tough and unique, and more than likely have a colorful past. BPD has been a gift to me even though I remember holding so much pain it physically made my chest hurt and burn. I swear to you though, through love, accepting yourself and not taking your own mind’s shit anymore you can feel better and live a productive life. Anyone who has read this and is on a path of healing-you have the power to do it and I’m so proud of you 💙",1596096584.0,False,30,7,Jazzyburty,None,i0i7om,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/i0i7om/what_propelled_my_recovery/
88,BPD stereotypes & recovery,"Getting to a healthier place, especially in regards to my emotions, has been hellish, and easily the hardest and most important thing I've ever done.

I've started being a lot more open about my diagnosis, and what its like to live with it. I've had some folks react hesitantly and be nervous around me, based on stupid, unrealistic stereotypes. Someone even asked when my split personality comes out! 

I've also had people be incredibly supportive, or surprised because some of the things I describe ring true for them as well. The most surprising reaction was that of my SO - he told me that he already knew who I was, and that giving parts of my personality an official title didn't change a thing about who I am inside. 

So I guess I just want to say to everyone that's working hard and making progress and maybe even suffering setbacks that I support you and even if we feel alone or left behind we aren't.

It sickens me to see how some people talk about us. BPD is demonized and misunderstood and it's hurtful to those of us who actually suffer from it - but we know what we're going through and that we aren't monsters, we are human and just as in need and DESERVING of understanding and compassion and love as anyone else.",1629763911.0,False,4,1,sasha_erin,None,pac7ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/pac7ah/bpd_stereotypes_recovery/
89,A metaphor for BPD recovery.,"At one point I was part of a crew, a family of behaviors, who roamed the oceans. We were a pirate crew. We had no home of our own except the ship that we sailed on.

We tied ourselves up to other ships when we came across them. We would dress ourselves up so we didn't appear threatening and for a time we would sail, tied to these other boats. The boats tied together were safer. They weathered storms because they were wider. We shared provisions. We relied on each other.

The issue, however, is that my crew and I were pirates. We had been raised in a way that meant that all we knew was the pirate life. We didn't know how to be a ship that was self-sustaining like the ones we tied up to.

Slowly but surely over time the ships we tied on to would realize that we were masquerading. 

Our pirate guise would become visible during a storm or when resources became stretched. If we sensed that the other ship was going to uncover us we would hack and slash and burn the connections that kept the ships together and sail away, leaving the other ship to wallow and recover.

Sometimes we'd see a new ship on the ocean. Bright and shiny and not worn down like the one we had slowly aged. In the night we'd sail over to the new ship, leaving a skeleton ship in place to fool the original one.

One day, standing on the bow of the ship I looked around and the fog that was often on this ocean cleared a little. Maybe it was the light, maybe it was the breeze, maybe I looked a little bit harder than usual.

All around me I saw ships that my crew had harmed. They were the same ships they had been, but with subtle differences.

Some no longer caught the wind in their sails like they used to. On some, their colors were faded. Others had erected protective barriers around them or invested heavily in weapons to keep them safe.

This ocean hadn't been like this before…it had only become this way because of us.

I turned to my crew and implored to them that we needed to change our ways, but they refused. Time went by and I witnessed more casualties and eventually I decided that this was not my crew. I could be somewhere else. I longed for seas where the sun glistened off clear waves.

I confronted my crew once again and begged for change, but they revolted on me. If I wanted change, I would have to leave the ship. They would give me no provisions, no boat, no support…If I wanted to leave, I could leave and swim for land. Or I could stay. 

There was no land in sight. I had never even seen land.

If I left, I would be swimming away from the ship into an open ocean. I would have to swim past ships who would look at me and laugh at me. Ships that would not pick me up if I were floundering.

For weeks I didn't sleep. My crew was all I had ever known. They were my family. I didn't even know how long I could swim for.

One day the crew broke away from another ship. What was once lovely and fair was left battered and broken, limping back to a port far away. My crew laughed and jeered and started looking for a new ship.

Standing on the deck I watched that ship sail away and resolved to never let that situation happen again.

I knew I couldn't swim very well so I decided to learn. I read at night while my crew mocked me. I learned everything I could about how to survive in an ocean alone. I confronted the fear and the risks and decided that swimming for shore was better than staying on board the boat with this sick crew. The mist had started to clear in recent weeks and as a result I could see the never-ending horizon. The enormity of the challenge was intimidating but it also helped me mentally prepare for what appeared to be an impossible task ahead.

Then one day, with my crew mocking and jeering me, some of them pleading with me to not leave, I stood on the end of the plank and stared over the ocean towards a land mass that I couldn't even imagine.

Many of the crew pleaded with me that they would die without me. Some willed me on, knowing that I would fail and swim back to the boat, where I would be even more of a hostage.

Finally, I thought of the broken ships and my resolve to never be part of creating another one and I dived overboard.

As I hit the ocean's surface the fear caught me and took my breath away…I couldn't do it. The ship was a safe harbor, there is nothing for me out here in an ocean that is threatening to swallow me up. 

I tread water, desperately wanting to climb back on board but I soon noticed that treading water was ok. I continued to tread water, listening to the pleas of my crew, until I felt like I could move away from the boat.

Turning my back to the ship and crew I had known all my life I took a deep breath and started swimming strong yet still uncertain strokes towards a horizon that didn't end, and a shore that might not exist.",1617035664.0,False,20,5,Grundini001,None,mfthcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/mfthcx/a_metaphor_for_bpd_recovery/

91,Recovery is possible.,"Happy 2021 everyone. May this be the year you find wellness.

I first started dbt at the end of 2018. I didn't finish it.
In 2019 my study schedule meant I could not attend any dbt. I decided to set 2020 aside to focus on it.

I started dbt foundations in January. I made it through til March when my Grandmother passed away suddenly.
 
I decided I needed to get back into group around June, all they had was a transitions group, I finished that and am now halfway through the foundations group again.

It has been life changing.

My main take aways are:
It WILL take time to get the hang of.
It's like learning a new language.
It takes practice. Every time you choose to use dbt skills, it's like building a muscle.
Mindfulness means paying attention to your thoughts. This is helpful because you learn to name what you're feeling. I still struggle with naming emotions but it definitely helps. 
Sometimes you've just gotta get through a crisis without making it worse. 
Don't underestimate how helpful and supportive others in the group can be. Although we know nearly nothing about each other outside of group, I have a soft spot for all my fellow dbt-ers.
Despite the negative feelings I first had when I was asked to cover my scars, I have come to fully appreciate the group being a trigger-free zone. Self harm/ substance abuse/ suicide can all be discussed in your 1:1. You're not being censored.
It's okay if you don't finish a cycle. Just stay in touch and ask to be put in the next group.

I also largely did all of this through zoom this year even though I was very, very resistant to the idea. So if that is the option in your area, don't let it dissuade you.

I hope this doesn't sound condesending. I had my doubts about dbt being this ~magical cure~. I believe I've had BPD since at least 16 years old, I struggled to get a correct diagnosis and did not get it til 24. I am now about to turn 32. It's been a long, hard road. I see posts regularly on this sub of people saying they know one day they'll die by suicide. I truly used to believe that too. I'm also not saying I'm 100% cured or that I won't have relapses, but I have better skills than I have ever had before. 

I'm leaving this sub (and this post was NOT meant to serve as a big explanation as to why), I just want to add it because, I truly feel that I no longer need the support that this sub once offered me. I am moving on in my recovery. Thank you for all your honesty, your DAE's, helping me feel less alone. Don't give up the fight, pals.

104,Splitting while in recovery,"TIL that my splitting trait is more prominent than I thought—specifically surrounding my relationships and friendships. 

Recently, I took the Borderline Spectrum Test that’s been circulating one of the subs, and one question that stood out to me was something along the lines of “everyone who has wronged me in the past is evil”—and I thought to myself, “wellll, I wouldn’t say *evil* ... but they are all just terrible. They’re all dead to me.” 

... I then proceeded to select the double thumbs up. 

Up until very recently, I was feeling very happy and confident with the progress I’ve made with my recovery, but in one fell swoop, it’s like it all came undone. I experienced a series of triggers I didn’t recognize, and I would soon discover that it was because I was severely downplaying some past trauma that needed to be addressed. A DTR conversation with a sort of romantic partner didn’t go badly, but it didn’t go as well as I had hoped. A prescription for my dog ended up being so much more expensive than I anticipated, but I had waited for it to arrive for weeks and I felt foolish for not realizing and decided to purchase it anyway. Everything seemed to stop going right. And I mean, every single thing. 

My logical mind is perpetually at odds with my borderline mind. This boy either wants me or he doesn’t. If someone I love screws up, they are suddenly incompetent and awful. I can’t allow one bad thing to exist without it tainting the entire person/thing. It is absolutely exhausting. 

And now I feel like I’m back at square one. My logical mind is telling me that this isn’t true, but my borderline mind is telling me to lean into the catastrophe (as I am prone to).

108,A weird way to recovery,"ATTENTION: do not try this at home

So, one year ago I had all the problems an economically and physically stable girl in a first world country could possibly have. Various drug addictions, an eating disorder, anxiety, rape survivor, you name it, I had it. I'll admit, I was just bathing in self victimization, and BPD lead me to bring most of these problems upon myself (I was big in self destructive behaviors).

I attempted suicide by different means a couple times before that, but one night in particular I decided to gather all the benzos I had laying around, get some booze and say goodbye to the world for good. As you can figure, it didn't work. And you know how it goes with benzos, you take one pill, two, ten, and then you forget how much you took, so I have no idea what exactly happened that night or the next days, I just know I was stoned AF for a whole week.

After that, all my meds were gone and I obviously could not ask for more without arising any suspicions. I had already been hospitalized for a month not much earlier, so in my benzos induced week long numbness I decided it was a good idea to stop taking my meds all together. After all, what was the worst that could happen? Another attempted suicide? I didn't really care.

I didn't expect much, other than just freaking out and going completely insane, but after a couple weeks people started telling me I looked like I was doing a lot better. Maybe they just convinced me of that, maybe it was true, as a matter of fact I started feeling a lot better for real. 

So here I am, one year later. I never went back to taking those meds, I went to therapy a few times and my doctor said she couldn't believe how much I had changed. Our sessions were shorter and shorter, to the point she'd just sentd me out sometimes cause I was just sitting there telling her what I had for lunch. I never touched any drugs again, I never felt the need to self harm or reach for toxic people, I never had a problem with food or self esteem ever since that happened.

I am guessing that overdose changed my brain chemistry or something. I do feel a lot number than I used to, so I don't get the emotional breakdowns, anxiety and stuff anymore. The only thing that bothers me now are recurring nightmares of how it used to be, but they don't really do any harm besides pissing me off. 

Since I know many people with psychiatric disorders attempt suicide in the very same way, I was wondering if something similar ever happened to anybody else. Obviously I'm not suggesting people attempt suicide in order to get cured, I'm just interested in the mechanism of what happened and if there is any logic explanation behind it.",1599561228.0,False,6,3,moodybiatch,None,ior8e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/ior8e4/a_weird_way_to_recovery/

Today I am headed off for a month of alone time, and really looking forward to it. (A different) partner encouraged me to have a great trip, and I just believed that he wanted me to have a good time. No intrusive thoughts about how he must not care about me to say that. No delusions of him wanting me gone. 

In between those two incidents is the hardest and best year of my life, medication, and 10 weeks of intensive treatment. A year I’d been building towards since birth. A Reclamation. 

What kept me going through some of my darkest moments was imagining writing posts like this, for you. Because we are the same. I was where you are. And I’m not anymore.

111,Still in denial of my bpd diagnosis - is it hampering recovery?,"Does anyone still feel uncomfortable with their diagnosis? I was diagnosed a few years back. To this day, I haven’t accepted it. Maybe it’s because it’s so heavily stigmatised that I’m scared to, but I also just don’t relate to a lot of the diagnostic criteria, and most of the time, I feel fine in myself.

The problem is that I still have regular bouts of depression, and when that happens I do lose control and become very self-destructive. I wonder if my denial of my diagnosis is stymying recovery? Do you think I could make better progress if I “embraced” (for want of a better word) my BPD? 

I do have a therapist who says I shouldn’t get bogged down by labels. I will discuss this with her at some point ofc, but would appreciate others’ thought, especially anyone else diagnosed but struggling to come to terms with it or can relate to this post.

114,I hate the person I have become through ‘recovery’,"(I’ve put recovery in quotation marks because I hate that word but I feel it’s just a universal way to state where I’m at). I’m. So. Boring. That’s the best way I can describe it. Yes I’m safe, yes I’m leading a relatively normal life which I never even believed was possible, I’m in a healthy long term relationship, I look after myself, I make decisions that benefit me in the preset and in the future. But am I any happier? Hmm. Other than with food my impulse control is somewhat impeccable now. (It used to be non existent). But it’s to the point where I will overthink almost every situation to the point i will ruin any joy in that moment, any excitement. Sometimes I simply won’t do certain things because I’m worried of the outcome. I’m that person who’s now always asking ‘is this a good idea? But what if this happens and this goes wrong?’ I ruin so many potentially fun moments. I used to care about my looks a lot and put in so much effort. I’ve always loved looking slightly ‘fake’. But over the past couple of years of drilling all the positive self acceptance mantras into my head I’ve become unrecognisable. I do still make effort I’m not saying I’ve let myself go unkept. I just don’t make effort like I used to and it’s only just hit me. I look so basic and that’s just not me. In the never ending search for the ‘real me’ I couldn’t feel any either further from whoever I truly am. I’d never to wish to go back to the way I was as it was living hell and it took me a lot of work to get out of that self destructive place that I had been in for so many years of my life. Therapy has changed me for the better but there are so many parts of myself I do actually miss. How can I get the old me back? Without all the bad shit. I have no confidence what so ever. I hate it.

115,One Year of Recovery,"I suppose I started my one year journey towards recovery a year ago, when I broke things off with a girl that I emotionally abused as a result of my drug addiction and borderline insecurities. The above two factors not to excuse the behavior but rather to explain it. The proceeding year has no doubt presented the most challenging year of my life. I want to document the key points of that year somewhere for feedback and in an effort to perhaps offer some a look at the life of a borderline individual fighting to live a meaningful, ethical life.

My first order of business was to come to terms with the awfulness I inflicted on my friends and family as a result of my own moral failings, fueled by my addiction and my illness. I grew to come to terms with the fact that some relations will never come back. That wonderful woman who I broke things off with will never speak to me again. But with recovery comes new relationships and new possibilities for hope. My relationship with my mother, who bore the brunt of my addiction is recovered, and for the first time in my life my father trusts me. I have a nest of supportive friends and to the friends I’ve lost I’ve at least made ammends to half of them. No romantic relationships, but I’m okay with that, I refuse to inflict myself on others till I am recovered from this disease. 

I tried full DBT and it changed my life. Yea, I showed up drunk and high to most of the sessions at the start, but slowly things clickedc and slowly I began to understand why I was there. Radical acceptance is a powerful tool, and so is checking the facts. 

The borderline impulsivity cut me deep and my suicidality worsened. I couldn’t tell fact from fiction here and I didn’t know if I wanted to die or if I was making it all up to threaten people into staying with me. Couple that with a flood of alchohol and I didn’t know what was going on. I developed a burning problem that still leaves its mark on my arms and legs. I developed a deep addiction to DXM cough syrup for its powerful dissociative properties, and my alcoholism and weed addiction took me to yet darker depths. All the DBT and all the admitting of past wrongs was getting me nowhere. I saw no way out.

So I dropped out of my first year of college to find myself out, and quit the drugs and seek therapy. I couldn’t do this by myself and after a DXM overdose I became ready to admit I was powerless over my addiction and my illness, that my life had become unmanageable, and that only a power greater than myself could restore me to sanity (I don’t mean god here, I am an atheist, if you’d like details contact me). 

So I checked myself into a dual diagnosis recovery program. The doctors told me that my borderline had driven the substance abuse so greatly that borderline was no longer the primary diagnosis, that DXM abuse was. Regardless I set about throwing myself wholeheartedly into recovery. I now go to groups from 9-4 every weekday, attend AA meetings in my offtime, attend Violence anonymous or Emotions Anonymous when I can, am working through my trauma, and I can now say confidently that for the first time I want to live, and that I have faith in my future.  I haven’t used in nearly two months after several in-program relapses, and I have 100 days clean off self harm. 

I don’t know why I wrote this all but I’d just like to say thank you for anything anyone reading this has to say.",1593287250.0,False,2,2,Number406,None,hh04dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/hh04dd/one_year_of_recovery/
116,My BPD recovery map,"I’ve been in recovery for 10 months. I visit this sub and I see where I was, and I want to give away what I’ve learned. If it helps any of you,
I would find that so fulfilling. 

It’s tough to know where to start, what to say, or how to say it. Because when I read posts here, I can tell that most of you are convinced that you are your BPD. You’re fused with the disorder. I recognize it, because I was too. I was exactly there. I knew, unshakably, that there was nothing more to me than my ricocheting emotional reactions and constant dissociation, nothing stable, nothing steady, nothing underneath. 

In recovery, I know that’s not true. I see BPD as symptoms, as a parasite that took over my mind. I’ve found, and maintain, equilibrium. I’ve been incredibly privileged and lucky. It hurts to think of all you wonderful people suffering from
this parasite of a disease, not knowing how wonderful and sane you are underneath it’s grip. 

I used to think, in the days of intensive treatment, that I was slogging through the swamp. Making a map. So that every time I found myself back where I started, I had a little more information about which direction to go. 

Sometimes when I look back on recovery, it feels like breaking a curse. You not only have to collect the right ideas and skills, you have to put them together in the right order. Build yourself a bridge to freedom. Keep tinkering until it clicks. 

Here are some of the principles of my recovery. They’ve only become clear in retrospect, so I fear that they won’t feel helpful to those of you who are actively suffering from the thought distortions of this awful disease. I wish I could take each and every one of you by the hand, and lead you out of the swamp. All I can do is show you my map. 

[trust your intuition, but don’t take it literally]
The best example of this was my suicidal ideation.  I noticed a contradiction: I wanted to die. But I was also frantically avoiding certain feelings and experiences (abandonment, first and foremost) because of my certainty that it would mean annihilation. Intellectually, I knew I wouldn’t cease to exist if I sat with my feelings. Intuitively, I was certain I would. Every time I found myself being asked to do something in therapy that I knew wasn’t survivable (e.g. deliberately trigger myself in a controlled environment and then sit in the discomfort without using coping skills until it subsided naturally, *shudder*) , I drew on that suicidal impulse. ‘Okay. This will kill me. I won’t survive this. I accept that.’ I feel, in retrospect, like
I was killing off my BPD, but in the moment it definitely felt like me. 


[accept the seemingly unacceptable, and see what happens next] I remember desperately trying to dodge the truth of my husband’s abandonment. I was in my therapist’s office, verbally pacing over the same territory. ‘He can’t do this! He can’t be doing this. He can’t just walk out on me after everything he’s said. You can’t just DO that.’ ‘Yes.’, she said, gently but firmly. ‘And yet — he did. He did do that.’ Radical Acceptance is the therapeutic term — it saved my ass whenever I was stuck, whenever I felt like I had no options, no choices. There’s always one: accept that what is happening is happening. That doesn’t mean you APPROVE of it, or like it, but when you’re not actively trying to deny reality, it’s easier to make new choices.

[desperation is a gift] BPD IS coping. I was coping, every second of every day. Even my ‘not being able to cope’ was a coping mechanism. I wasn’t happy, but I wasn’t dead, and that’s a bigger achievement than we give ourselves credit for. There’s a chasm of hell between giving up maladaptive coping mechanisms and building adaptive ones. I’m not going to lie to you, it’s excruciating. Feels like being peeled alive. The only thing that can get you to plunge into a river of acid is if you’re actively on fire. Despair and desperation is incredible fuel. There’s no substitute. If you can take it one minute longer, you will. When you can’t take it
one more second, that’s when change becomes possible.

120,"My journey as a Detective with BPD, from the top, through addiction, helplessness to love and recovery."," I (M35) found out last year I have BPD.  I thought I would share my story to show how it can effect someone perceived as high functioning, how I went from the top, to rock bottom and then some, suffered addiction, depression and suicide ideation and my journey back to health.  


I worked from age 19-33 for the Police where I was a Detective and Detective Sergeant.  I was a qualified Detective at age 25 and Detective Sergeant at age 27.  


I always knew I was different to others from childhood.  I got emotional in movies, news items and documentaries, could pick up easily if someone was in pain and was freakishly intuitive when it came to investigating and finding people who were wanted by Police, I was always in the right place at the right time.  Despite all this, I could easily hold in any emotion at work.  I could be empathetic but not become emotional.  


My job gave me the ideal platform to receive the constant validation I was unconsciously seeking.  It also unintentionally gave me and identity - a cop.  


Deep down I was depressed and masked it through an addiction to work.  I felt times of extreme energy and times I just wanted to stay inside and never come out of my room, closing off to the world.  


I had a wide circle of friends who would be perceived from the outside as “cool and successful” although was close to none of them.  These people also weren’t cool at all.  


I ignored my own needs and always put the needs of work and others in my life first.  Boundaries didn’t exist, I would always answer a call for unpaid extra time at work and friends who needed help.  Whether it was moving, emotional support, money - you name it and would have been it.  


I unconsciously used people pleasing and being useful as the basis for relationships.   


And anytime I got close to reflecting on this, and coming to any realisation about the people around me there was the next urgent case at work requiring me to jump into work, and a dangling carrot of validation attached to this.  I would always chase it.  


The work was also exciting, all consuming and masked many of my symptoms ;  


\- for example impulsive behaviour - I could drive fast and confront people,   
\-validation seeking - working hard to catch someone and solve a case.   


All of this was wrapped up in my addiction to work and avoiding being in my own head, and all behaviours were seen by colleagues as positives, not the hallmark symptoms of someone mentally ill.   


In my last two years in the Police two of my friends were shot, and one committed suicide.  I was charged with a minor offence due to my driving in a work matter in open Court, which after a year of Court appearances I was cleared.  The stress from these events never left me though.   


The stress interfered with my sleep and I lost my connection and sense of identity with the Police.  I also started a secondary business which further helped to stay busy.  It also meant I had a large amount of disposable income.  And fuck did I dispose of it.  


I was a social butterfly, although each group saw a different version of me.  One group used drugs recreationally.  I had always started away from drugs, but with my dismissive attachment style I now know of, my perception of being wronged by work made me “burn the city”.  


I started using MDMA occasionally in the weekends, which grew from once a month, to every weekend.  I want to make it clear that using drugs was very wrong in my position.  I did not work on drug cases, or involve myself in any type of drug work or with drug criminals in the Police at this time.  And I knew I would eventually be found out - I just hated life and didn’t care so much.  


I live in a city where fortunately the government and Police are not seen as corrupt, and it wasn’t long before my drug use was noticed, reported and I was forced to resign.  


I was 33 and suddenly everything that I thought I knew was gone.  Every bit of structure that was unintentionally keeping my Mental health at bay was gone.  I also had access to all my superannuation money, which made things even worse - unregulated, depressed, ashamed, unstructured and no need to work and plenty of money to spend.  


I tried to stop using drugs, sometimes I was successful for 3 months, but always going back.  My drug use went from using MDMA to now preferring cocaine in a country where it costs four times the amount as it does in the USA.   


Mixed with drug use was alcohol.  I just wanted to escape the pain and reality of my now life.  I was seriously suicidal and very nearly hung myself.  I still don’t exactly know what stopped me.  


The people who were my friends didn’t even care or judge, they knew I still had money and used drugs so encouraged me to stay the way I was.  It felt like my house had burnt down to the ground but they were still there to see if there was any buried treasure beneath it.  


I soon got a new professional well paying job, but lost it soon after for DUI.  Every bit of help I sought was only done half heartedly.  I was convinced by my parents my behaviour was a result of bad decisions and bad influences and I could easily put that to one side.  They would point to my achievements throughout life to prove to me why.  


After losing my job for a second time I sold my house and moved cities.  I didn’t do this to run away from my problems, but I knew I was really struggling with drugs and I wanted to break free of the connections I had.  I knew that I would get sucked back in or suck myself back in.  


After moving I took the time to reflect, and look inwards and start to take responsibility.  I found a great psychologist who didn’t suffer fools.  I committed to getting sober and wanting to find the route of my problems.  


I learnt that I had serious attachment issues (dismissive) and was emotionally dysregulated stemming from neglect and invalidation as a child and adult.  I had learnt that my worth from a long age was achievements and doing things for others, rather than to look after myself first.  I had repeated the cycle of this way too often.  


Some people in my life had really used me and wronged me, including my parents, and I was too naive to see it.  I had never set boundaries or expressed needs to people.  I never even called people out for treating me like shit, yet I loyally came to the aid of any friend being treated like shit by anyone.  


On learning about emotional regulation  everything started making sense.  It was crazy.  I had never valued myself, and thought I was only ever valuable to people if I was helping them, providing for them or completely ignoring my own needs.  I didn’t hate myself but I certainly didn’t show myself any love.  


I needed time to process and work through everything so I began walking 2,3 or 4 hours a day, eating clean and exercising.  I stopped drinking and using drugs, and for the first time in a long time began setting goals and being excited for the future.  


In regards to learning about BPD I read books, listened to audiobooks and watched YouTube clips.  I began journaling with a focused effort on the positive things in my life.  


Not long after losing my job in the Police I met my now fiancé.  She stuck by my side the whole way.  She has seen me at my best and been on the other side of me at my worst.  While with her I learnt what love truely means.   


I always had this romanticised version of ideal love, one of where all your needs are met, you don’t have to do the work and everything is great all the time.  I could do no wrong in this version.  While I am grateful to experience amazing attraction and chemistry with her, I feel I have grown a lot from my old version.   


I now know love is about showing safety, consistency and growing together through tough times.  It’s about supporting each other’s interests and goals 100% and compromise.  It’s about not giving up at hurdles and working to get through them.  I reflect on myself more and more.  I am grateful that she supports me and all my crazy ideas.  The first time I’ve experienced validation in a healthy way ever.  


My road to recovery has seen me starting to write poetry most days.  I found it very therapeutic, and a healthy way to express my emotions about various things that have happened throughout life.  


Since the clouds have cleared I now run my own business and study full time by distance.  I live in a beautiful part of the world and earn enough money to live in an apartment and do some of the things I want.  


I still really struggle at times, and while I have painted things as looking good, the reality is I have a lot of demons, and they are at bay.  


I am still tempted by drugs - sometimes I feel the urge is similar to running a marathon and then standing by a buffet trying not to eat.  But I had to not stop doing drugs, but break up with them.  I know this will be something I have to stay on top of forever.  


I still mess up in communicating with my fiancé.  I find it hard at times to navigate through conflict and to settle myself.  I get intrusive thoughts that I am not worthy or that she is going to leave me any time I can sense conflict.  I work hard now when I feel these things by thinking the opposite, and communicating what I am feeling and what I am doing to reduce the effects.  I feel incredibly guilty about the times I have been hard to be around, or my mind has tricked me that something is fact rather than a fear of mine.  


I get increasingly down on myself and all the failures I’ve made, from a start to life many can only dream of.  I sometimes feel suicidal, but this is more of a glancing thought rather than ideation.  


I have trauma I have ignored for 28 years of my life now surfacing and needing to be addressed and resolved.  This can at times make me upset, angry and feeling helpless and not knowing what to do.  


I’ve got rock bottom and gone through the trap door below it many times over.  I feel I am finally climbing out.  I know I need to work everyday to continue like this.  


While BPD can at times be crippling, the intuition I get, and feeling emotions when I am regulated and safe is an absolute gift.  I have tried and failed 10 times over, I am still here trying because it is worth it, and I know it is possible to get better and live an enjoyable life.  


I certainly have regrets and am deeply ashamed of everything I have done.  If I hadn’t done it, I could have easily coasted through life addicted to work without truely experiencing the precious connections life has to offer.  And I would have passed this same pattern of behaviour on.  


My journey has taken me from having what alot dream of, and to the very bottom and then through the trap door below.  Because of my job my mistakes have always been well known by everyone and aired publicly.  


For all those struggling, hold on.  It gets better.  I was nearly dead and I feel better today than I did yesterday.  I know it’s a long road ahead but a worthy one.  


To all of those struggling that didn’t have the luxury of the resources available to me, I sincerely empathise with you.  I know it’s hard and feels paralysing at times.  My partner is working hard to provide accessible resources to everyone for free here (R/BPDover25) as a place to start.  You are not alone and worthy of love.",1657252222.0,False,23,7,Key-Code-4296,None,vu1dwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/vu1dwp/my_journey_as_a_detective_with_bpd_from_the_top/

i can't really tell you how i began to recover. complete stroke of luck. when i was 21 i hit rock bottom. i got kicked out of my parents. i was living on a couch in a coworkers apartment. i had no job and no money. then i had like this psychological breakdown. i was in the situation i feared the most. then all of a sudden i started realizing all these things. it all became clear to me now. no wonder ppl thought i was weird. no wonder ppl treated me like shit. i had no self respect and was so clingy. then all of a sudden all these ppl i spent years feeling like i needed...i felt nothing for them. if they stopped talking to me i'm fine

in a twist of irony, they all started becoming 100x more attracted to me. after spending years begging these ppl to hang out with them, now they're the ones asking me to hang out. they're the ones begging me to hang out. im the one who gets to diss them. its fucking empowering

In my opinion, it doesn't do much good to act like mental illness is always easy to overcome if you are young and I believe that mentality only adds to the stigma for people who can't just ""get over it"" or ""get help"".

I've seen that phenomenon in other ways, too and it has always come across to me as invalidating/offensive instead of empowering.",1588674555.0,False,17,6,throwaway3478347,None,gdvbix,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/gdvbix/teenage_mental_health_recovery_is_overly/

127,Recovery is possible!,"Two months ago I was in a terrible, ugly place. I’d just lost my fp and felt forcibly isolated from all of my friends. My fp blocked me and wouldn’t respond to my apologies. I could go on and on about the terrible spiraling I was experiencing if I really wanted to.
However, about two weeks ago he finally responded and that conversation gave me a sense of closure. It still took me more time to move forward, but today I feel overwhelmingly positive about the future and can feel myself recovering. I don’t think said FP is my FP anymore, which is a huge mental relief. I’m starting to open up and talk more again, I’m making new friends, and I’m speaking more to my parents which is something that would have been inconceivable a year ago. I feel free of my childhood trauma too. It’s just such a good feeling to know you’re getting better.
I had so many doubts only a month ago about my ability to get better and improve my mental health again, but I’m seeing now how I’m growing and moving on. I’m wrestling with dissociation a lot as of late, but I’m hardly experiencing emotional distress in comparison to the last few months, which is a HUGE step towards the better for me.
Maybe this is only temporary, but calm periods like this in my life are worth cherishing and celebrating.

129,"the closer i get to ""recovery,"" the farther away i have to become","bg: mid-30s, borderline personality disorder, 5+ years clean, newly sober-ish  


i didn't start really showing obvious symptoms until i was in my 20s, and it all fell off the rails after my sibling took their life a handful of years ago with my emotional regulation mixed with my substance abuse. i have had very positive experiences along my mental health recovery path and have had a pretty open concept about my struggles even though i wasn't formally diagnosed until two-ish years ago. and the times between my cycles/peaks are growing farther apart, but the escalations have become UNHINGED, a point where i am not even close with my partner's family because they just don't feel i  am a good person anymore.

a lot of it was symptomatic of my environment - noaw i have a wonderful, peer-oriented job for a mental health organization that showers me with compassion and insight, i have a psychiatrist who spends time with me whenever i need it for as long as i need, i have medication management that began titrating per week vs. per month which creates a much smoother acclimation period, i have developed the fortitude to turn away from experiences that i know will trigger me (drinking, social over-stimulation, etc.). i feel like i am really doing WELL.

SO WHY IS IT that during this period of my life and in this stage of my recovery, i feel i have the most push-back? or the most non-reaction? somehow i created an environment for myself where the people around me knew how abnormal my behavior was - so my expectation was to have some recognition when i started to behave ""normally,"" or dare i even say ""peacefully."" i created an environment where people around me say both ""why can't you just be normal?"" and ""why do you expect praise for normal behavior?"" and it is so incredibly frustrating.

and i am realizing more and more, as i sit and really take the time to think about it, this may be the short circuit that has caused so many of my behavioral problems these past few years. and this year i would say i am the most ""well"" i have been, but also i would say i am the most emotionally distant from those ""closest"" to me as well. and maybe that is because i am used to being so OVER-reactive, that maintaining relationships in this state seems like i am almost dormant.

but my main concern is, what if i am feeling dormant because the next phase of my recovery IS asking specifically for those things that aren't freely being given to me? i have finally started living a life where people stop saying ""stop being dramatic,"" and now i am afraid to grow out of that stage for MY sake of asking people to SHOW me emotions instead of people telling me to put them away. the other day i started crying on a zoom call with my boss because i told her that i didn't feel like my projects were equally represented in a presentation she was giving for my program, and it caused me that much anguish to ask someone to represent me fairly. and her response to me was, ""it was really brave of you to ask for what you felt you deserved, and we can work making something that seems more fair to you."" it's that easy? it really was that easy.

and when i called my mom and asked her if she was proud of me for that, she said ""okay? people have conversations like that every day."" short circuit. words of encouragement? advice?",1653549042.0,False,1,1,myaskredditalt21,None,uy1vj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/uy1vj5/the_closer_i_get_to_recovery_the_farther_away_i/
130,BPD Recovery: A Never Ending Story,"I've been fighting mental illness for 8 years now. Medicated for 5. Depressed for 3. Diagnosed with BPD at 6 years. 


I left home for college.

Dropped out of college. 

Quit so many jobs. 

Began self harming.

Moved four times. 

Got married. 

Got diagnosed. 

Went to the ER on suicide watch.

Prescribed my best cocktail of meds thus far. 

Found a job I actually enjoy and gives me purpose. 

Cut my antidepressant dose in half.

Feeling the best I've felt in these long, rough 8 years. 


I am not a success story, but a ""it gets better"" story. As much as I hate that overused slogan. My story will never be over. I've accepted that I will probably have BPD for the rest of my life. However it IS manageable with the right tools: a support group, healthy coping skills, supportive medical providers, and for some, medication. It is such a relief to not feel that oppressive black cloud looming over you. I hope you all find peace.

132,Part of my recovery:,"After seeing [the post that is now pinned to the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/e3eytd/i_got_told_i_dont_meet_the_criteria_for_bpd) (written by u/iam-paigewolf), it made me think about how I reacted when my ex decided he wanted to get a divorce (in early May). 

At first, I was desperate to keep him around, but I knew better than to 'disrespect' the choice he made. My last ditch effort was to beg him to reconsider, because this was a marriage, it wasn't just a break-up. But even after belittling myself and scrapping my dignity, he still said no, and that was how I knew I needed to face this head-on as it was.

I couldn't avoid it. I had to face it and accept it. I was tired of the way he had started to treat me (post asking for divorce), so I did what I could to protect myself and quit communicating with him for two months (around late May). Because he hadn't started the divorce process yet, after those two months, I finally reached out rather justifiably angry, and told him to pull up his big boy pants and do what he said he was going to do.

I spent most of the summer months laying in bed crying. There was not a day that went by that I did not cry-- I cried even on my birthday. This lasted for a solid 3 months before I finally snapped out of it and decided I needed to kick it into high gear to take better care of myself. My mourning period, my wallowing period, my ""feel my feelings"" period-- it had ended. I needed to finally move on to a new stage of recovery, even though it still hurt, because at this point I knew I would just be ruminating and hurting myself even more. 

So when I finally snapped back into my humanity, I found new hobbies, I got 2 jobs, I made money, I treated myself well, I stayed active. I did everything I could to channel my pain in healthy ways. I decided to stop talking to him, again (his birthday is Monday-- it'll have been 4 months No Contact on that day). 

All I can tell myself is that if he wanted me in his life, he'd make the effort to keep me in it. And I have to accept that he's gone, he's not coming back, and I'm going to be okay. I don't need him, I will be fine, maybe even *better* without him. I'm proud of it, myself, and the progress I've made. He's lost out on watching me blossom into a better version of myself. I still have work to do, but he's gone, and I'm not doing this for his audience.

I share this not to document simply the recovery from this situation, but as a pwBPD reacting in new ways that are arguably more healthy than in past situations. I wanted to preserve my dignity, preserve the image of who I am in his eyes, and I wanted to preserve what little respect he had left for me. That meant respecting myself, too. 

When I was younger, I did everything I could to keep people around. Whether or not those relationships were unhealthy or abusive, I didn't care; I didn't want *anybody* to leave. I was manipulative, verbally and emotionally abusive, and I threatened to hurt myself (even doing it just to say I did it). I was incapable of handling people leaving. 

I did a lot of damage to the people around me and myself. I didn't have anyone's respect. I burned a lot of bridges acting this way. But in this current situation, I have been determined not to repeat these patterns. I wanted to prove to myself that I am capable of changing and of being better, not only for/to myself, but for/to others. 

I hope that with the sharing of these ""success stories"", more people will feel encouraged to keep going and maybe others will feel inclined to share their success stories, too! So let's keep it up.

133,Just wanted to share a little hope with you guys about recovery.,"Obligatory on mobile. Also, brief mention of substance abuse and suicidal ideation. No detail, literally just the words. but please skip this if you need to. 

Hello beautiful people, I hope all of you had a tolerable day at worst and a great day at best. 

I’ve struggled with BPD for as long as I can remember, when I got diagnosed everything just clicked. I was basically a textbook case by every sense of the word. Over the past decade, things have been tough obviously, but I eventually got on waiting lists and started doing DBT and EMDR therapy. It was hell for a long time, I self medicated heavily and ended up in severe addiction. To make a long story short, let’s skip ahead 7-10 years. 

Today, while I still have BPD and symptoms, the hard work paid off. All the nights crying myself to sleep, the intense fear of everything and everyone, the drugs and hyper sexuality, codependent toxic relationships, suicidal ideation, even the extreme poverty I lived in are coming to a close. I haven’t cried in over a week. 

When I got this diagnosis while I was relieved, I was sure I would be this way forever. It seemed like there was no end in sight, I gave up a lot, shut myself out from the world constantly. When I saw there was no cure, I held onto that and ignored the fact it is treatable. I was so incredibly tired of everything. I’m sure a lot of you know this feeling all too well. 

I wanted to share that for almost a year, I’ve been steadily in recovery (from BPD, I’ve been sober and clean much longer). I forget I have BPD sometimes, and my life is becoming manageable. It wasn’t until a about two years ago that I heard someone say they are in recovery, and after so many years all of a sudden I realized it is possible and went back through almost a decade worth of journals. In those journals I saw myself healing slowly, I just didn’t realize until I sat down and read it all. That was the moment I realized “holy shit this is working” and I couldn’t be more grateful and proud of myself. 

I wish I heard someone say they are in recovery so much sooner, hope is rare and invaluable to people like us. All I can do is hopefully pass it on, and remind whoever took the time to read this that you are worth recovery. You are NOT inherently unloveable, a bad person, or anything else. You are worthy of love, you deserve self love, and you can come out the other side of this. Is that waiting list for subsidized therapy months long? Keep yourself on the list no matter how frustrating it may be. Your life is worth the wait. YOU are worth the wait. 

BPD will always be a part of me, but it no longer defines me. I know how shitty it is to hear “if I can do it so you!” Because we all have such vast experiences. So I won’t go there, however I do think it’s important to be reminded that this long horrific journey is worth it, because you deserve nothing less then happiness regardless of your struggle. There was so many years I didn’t believe I deserved anything, not even to be safe. 

From one human to another, we can recover and lead fulfilling lives. We deserve that much.

134,Recovery story (DBT therapy),"I want to share a piece of my recovery hoping this can help others.  I’ve been active in AA and also currently involved in a 14 week DBT course (2nd time I’ve taken it - didn’t graduate the first time)

Recently I was in a relationship that was horrible for me.  I was sick, I was depressed, and I was losing myself. The relationship was with a substance.  Alcohol specifically. I was on my way to an AA meeting a couple weeks ago. It was for a friend who was celebrating her 1 year. I was excited but also nervous as this was not a meeting I had attended before. Lots of new people and I didn’t know the building. As I was driving into town for the meeting I thought to myself “I wonder if I have time to hit the liquor store first”. I’m 6 months sober. Where the hell did this thought come from. So I pulled into the church parking lot where AA was being held. Called my sponsor. Got some quick rational advice. And then I laughed the entire way into the AA meeting. 
Our thoughts are insidious. They manifest past traumas for us right before our eyes.  Whether we act on these thoughts is up to us. 
6 months ago, I would have gone to the liquor store. I would have bought some beer, not attended the meeting, and then would have been in a full blown relapse. But I didn’t. This time anyways. 
Our power for growth is amazing. This is changed behaviour I’ve not seen in my life and I’ve been diagnosed with BPD for over 20 years. I am sharing my progress in hopes to give some other sufferers some hope. I was a mess.  I was a drunk, I ruined my body with self harm,  was angry and full of resent for everyone who hurt me.   I was dying slowly.  I’m a mother of two , and I need to show my kids I can change. 

This is just my experience and I hope it helps anyone who is struggling right now. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. And there’s a saying I love :  if it takes you 20 minutes to walk into a forest, you won’t walk out in 5

137,Recovery going down the drain.,"I feel especially strange these days.

My college is all fucked up because of the virus, so I'm likely withdrawing; my ESA cat is dying from FIP; I'm getting next to 0 support from my friends in any aspect of my life; said friends are all moving away because of the school situation; my mom, who was more or less saved by her boyfriend (and who I really like) just dumped her.

There's more, but those are my major stressors.

SH/ED TW: >!I self-harmed for the first time in a long while, but in a completely different context. I really just wanted to feel something physically. Meanwhile, a few days ago I binge/purged out of boredom and apathy, and yesterday I hardly ate anything at all. I'll be the first to admit that since I started medication, restriction has been incredibly hard, so I've gone from a restrictive eating disorder to bulimia. The binging is a product of my BPD, and the purging I guess makes it bulimia? I don't know. Point is, I was surprised that I've finally been low enough to restrict that low. !<

I cut my hair, bleached my hair, dyed my hair three different colors in the past week, flirted with a guy who I'm probably going to hook up with, flirted with a girl who I'm interested in dating, abused sleeping pills in several nights, binged, partied and isolated myself all in two weeks. Now that I'm pissed off at my friend, who is my roommate, I've been locking myself inside my room.

I'm a mess, but somehow, I still feel nothing. My mood stabilizers work too well, I guess.

And now I'll have to save face at another party tonight with all my friends.

I don't want to. I want to be with my cat, I want my mom and her boyfriend to fix things, I want school to open back up, I want everyone to stay here, I want my roommate to apologize, I want to sleep normally, I want I want I want. All out of my control. It's all about control.

I'm so tired.

138,Encouraging studies on BPD cure and recovery,"Hi, I'm a former borderline and wanted to encourage people that BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) can be cured and/or greatly improved by good treatment.

I found some interesting research that is quite encouraging. Here is one study:

http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=209673

The results of the 88 patients in this study were quite encouraging; many of them recovered to the point of no longer being diagnosable as borderline, and they had quite severe histories to start with.
There is also this longitudinal study -

anyway, my last therapist said i didn’t have BPD because of a few reasons. He said he didn’t see me as manipulative and he also said most people personality disorders don’t think they have a personality disorder so by me thinking i have it negates that i could have it....

, my brother and sister have both told me they think they have BPD. 

all of these things lead me to think maybe i should start getting my shit together and deal with these emotions and issues. regardless of a diagnosis i still have the symptoms

140,"Recovery from BPD and addiction is going great, but I feel so damn lonely","Bit of context - I was diagnosed with BPD 7 months ago and also quit everyday weed use at the same time (totally clean for 7 months). I've put myself through a tonne of therapy (ACT and DBT) and done a lot of my own research away from those therapies. I've rewired a lot of my brain and have changed my life around completely. I am a completely different person to what I once was, to the point that I barely feel impacted by my BPD.

What I'm struggling with is the transition to this new life. I've always been used to being able to go to friends places and we'd have a smoke, or they'd come to my place. Or if I ever felt lonely I would just smoke by myself and distract myself with video games and time would pass easily.

With this new life, I'm doing better than ever have, but I've also pushed most of my friends away through what was my worst mental health breakdown of my life 7-8 months ago. I don't have a friends place to go to anymore, or friends visiting me. I know that I don't want to go back to that life of smoking with friends (or by myself), but I'm having trouble with what to replace that with. I know I still need to put in more work to find my own happiness, and my DBT course is still yet to go through the interpersonal effectiveness module which I'm dying to get through and learn more about. I'm just feeling kinda stuck in time and extremely lonely. Maybe that comes from longing for the friendships I have lost, maybe it's just because I don't have weed to pass my time easier, maybe it's because I haven't found some true sober friends yet.

I'm just not sure how I transition from a drug life with undiagnosed BPD to a life without drugs and recovery from BPD. I don't know how to adjust to this new life and be happy without weed or the friendships I had within that life.

144,I didn't freak out this time - help & recovery,"It's been a long slow 2 years of therapy for my BPD/CPTSD. 

Today, I was feeling that really incessant desperation to see my FP (boyfriend.) You know that clingy feeling like u want to absorb them into your body LOL. We've been together 10 months and it's been perhaps the most challenging and revealing period of growth for me in 2 years of therapy (I entered therapy single...)

I just invited him to spend the night tonight. He politely declined saying he needed a ""me"" night. Then he asked how my day is going.

A year ago, I would have gone full abandonment mode. ""Into the tunnel"" as it were. Whole day would be ruined. I'd be unable to focus or settle down. Stomach aches and mood swings, etc.

Today, I feel the pain of rejection but it just stays in my chest and doesn't take over my whole body.

Today, I quietly withdraw from texting until my emotional swing is under control, instead of reacting from pain or trying to manipulate/punish him for hurting me.

Today, instead of taking this as a sign of him losing interest, a kind voice inside me says ""boundaries are ok. Maybe u can take a ""me""night too. if you love him, take care of him, like he takes care of you."" 

Instead of lingering on the hurt, I focus my kind on all the fun things I can do by myself tonight (wine and Netflix, practice piano, call a friend to chat, etc.)

I'm going to be ok because I need to be there for myself... As hard as that feels sometimes!

I'm here to share these small victories with u guys and get support too. You guys, it still really hurts that he doesn't want to rush over and see me. It still hurts! It just sucks!!

145,Experience telling a boss or potential employer about BPD struggles and recovery?,"I did this in an interview. I felt like I wanted to honestly explain the year plus I hadn’t been working but also why I’m fearless and awesome and I’ve survived a lot of adversity and how my DBT skills will make me a great team member and how I’m not willing to hide things that are stigmatized and how personal experience lead into being an advocate (skill relevant for job). I didn’t make this the focus of the interview, she thanked me for my frankness, seemed sincere. The interview went very well but she never responded to my thank you note or let me know that she had chosen someone else which was odd because I had made it through a few rounds and she was clearly choosing between only a few candidates. Not sure if she was just slammed/disorganized/not great at follow up communication. 

Next job interview I didn’t disclose and got hired. It worked out in my favor anyway because this job is more flexible and has less potential for interpersonal issues but I just wanted to hear other people’s experience RE disclosing and work because I feel like sustainability of a job for me is linked to A) not having to hide a big part of who I am and B) my employer understanding and accepting I could be hospitalized suddenly or just have a very off day or not be able to handle the emotional content of my work for 24-48 hours and need a mindless task for a minute",1530559036.0,False,8,24,mefuckingtoo,None,8vleo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/8vleo3/experience_telling_a_boss_or_potential_employer/

148,Recovery Tattoo,"So I'm scouting for anyone that thinks they may be up to the task of drawing up a tattoo. Fairly simple with a more ""pen and ink"" style...Some back story:

I'm 21. I was first psychiatrically hospitalized at age 15 for what we now know is a Borderline Personality and Bipolar Comorbid diagnoses. I struggled keeping friends, I self harmed, I cycled, I had anxiety, and I hated my birthday because it meant celebrating a life I didn't want. By age 17 I had been in the hospital 4 times, as well as 5 months in a residential treatment facility. My grades were failing because I refused to attend classes and I found out I didn't meet graduation requirements. My 18th birthday reared it's ugly head and with the feeling of failure fresh in my head, I decided I never wanted to see it come. That hospitalization was a really pivotal moment for me. I can't name a time in my life where I felt more useless. After that I went full fledge recovery. I've had 9 hospitalizations total. It has not been easy, but the past 3 years have been ultimately fruitful. I managed to graduate, I'm holding my first job, my emotions are better, and I'm maintaining more and more successful personal relationships. I have a lot of scars and I would like something to distract a little bit, mostly for my sake. I want to see something that reminds me how far I came,  rather than the mistakes I made. I'm sure people make these requests a lot so I'm not sure it'll get seen, but if anyone feels up to the task for any reason, comment below and we can figure out a way to get in touch.

149,Recovery makes me question my sexual orientation,"I'm a girl and I pretty much always identified as bisexual, I've been attracted to girls for as long as I remember and I've had boyfriends/fwb/periods of being single and sleeping around almost non stop for 10 years.

Now that I recognize some sort of addiction or compulsion for sex and codependency as coping mechanism and part of my BPD... One part of me wonders if I'm really just lesbian and just addicted to ""what I can get"" - male attention. 
As much as I would have loved to, I've never been in an actual relationship with a girl and besides a few experiences I've mostly dealt with rejection on this side. Being with men is much easier and the BPD idealization cycles definitely helped with that.
But now that I see idealization with a new light, I don't feel so comfortable with the idea of building something with a man. And I don't know if my intuition that I want to be with women has to do with idealizing the unknown even though I feel like I think of it without excessive passion, or if my sexual orientation is really the core of it.

So I'm wondering if my idealization and high sex drive just helped my sexual and relationship coping mechanisms, because there's no way I could have dealt with things that way with girls. I don't think I feel attracted to men physically most of the times, I still enjoy sex but when I'm not in idealization of my partner it feels very mechanical.

\-Counting calories to try to restrict calories  
\-Exercise (I don't think I am doing enough to offset the calorie intake and I also don't feel like I am capable of doing enough to offset the calories because I have eaten so much junk)  
\-Fasting (This should have been obvious as a failure)  
\-Eating more fruit (kinda helpful but doesn't really do anything about the sweets and junk I eat)

162,BPD symptoms in full recovery until Husband left me,"My husband of 8 years left while I was sleeping, only leaving a note and a divorce settlement paper. Before that, I had been working on myself, overcoming emotional abuse, healing and maturing for 2 decades, to finally and unexpectedly arrive at mental well being. I went from being a generally dark person to being one of light and love and it felt amazing. I was even able to get off one of my psych medications. It was a truly remarkable turnaround that friends commented on. I finally had some healthy relationships.

My husband however did not see or appreciate it because who I was in the past left such a mark on him. His personality suddenly changed from being someone who is extremely compassionate and agreeable to an angry ball of resentment who finds fault with everything I do, holds on to bad vibes and assumes negative intentions where there are none. He also fought with me on everything. 

Through the struggle, I could not attend a friends wedding shower. She swore up and down that I was her best friend over all her other best friends but threw our friendship in the garbage like it meant nothing to her just because I was in pain and couldn’t be there for her that day. Then a friend of mine was trying to place the blame on both of us saying I should have known that if I came to the wedding shower I would be supported. I can’t know that! 

Now that he’s gone, AND a “close” (having uneven friendships is a theme in my life for another thread) friend is gone im dying a little bit more each day. I’m being forced to become a different person when I finally got there and I was secure in who I was, could enjoy wherever I was. Now I’m unbalanced and needy. Flat. Anxious. Suicidal every day. Actually tried to kill myself one night. Sometimes want to kill him and believe I might if he tries to take the house away. I definitely would have if he served me with papers and made me move out. I know I don’t deserve this and it’s making me depressed and go ballistic

The husband knows how traumatic this is for me but keeps insisting that it needs to be done and the pain will heal. He talks to me but he is unmoved by my suffering and general destruction. It’s like he doesn’t understand who I am. It feels like a total defeat and an indication that my life will never improve. All the self improvement in the world couldn’t improve my quality of life. Or maybe it’s happening because I improved, IDK. I’m being forced to change something that finally didn’t need to be fixed. 

So now I’m alone in this house, while he stays at his moms who thinks he can do no wrong, still gets everything I was doing for him, someone to cook, clean, do laundry and come home to. My parents are supportive in their own way but wont even let me come over because I am a Buddhist and they are so called Christians. I am livid and defeated. I can’t enjoy my life anymore. 

So this is what I get for getting better. It feels like my whole life is a testament to that failure, and I should just end it. I feel foolish for continuing to live and have hope just for it to get dashed upon the rocks. My husband was my longest and most reliable relationship over parents and friends. He was always there for me and gave me a new life and a new family when mine was so broken. We planned on moving and having an improved life in a state where their ideals are closest to ours and It’s gone. We were going to get new floors but can’t now because of the divorce/legal separation. My new and improved self is needlessly wasting away. Every day I want to kill myself in part to make a point to him and his mom that they can’t ignore and in part because I don’t want to live.

169,I passed my recovery support specialist training!,"I suffer from mental illness and alcoholism and have been in a training to become a recovery support specialist to help people like me and we were asked to write about our personal experience of hope. Here is what i wrote. Thanks for reading!


My personal experience of Hope has come in two parts. 

My first to experience a feeling hope was when I opened my eyes to the people that were sitting next to me in AA. I had been going for a while already but only because my family forced me if I wanted a place to stay. When I had my Moment of clarity and when I decided to get sober I finally opened my eyes and looked around and saw all these happy, smiling well-dressed teeth-brushed hair done makeup -on happy normal people and that gave me hope but if I did what they did I would get what they got I wanted to have the serenity that they had and so with the gift of desperation I gave up and gave in to the program of Alcoholics Anonymous and well be celebrating 3 years of sobriety on December 1st

The second one was a phone call from my mom while I was in Palo Verde after a serious suicide attempt. My family had spoken to a therapist who helped them understand what being borderline and bipolar is like and my mom said finally that they believed me and they understood me. I felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders my family finally that I wasn't just someone with bad behavior who made bad decisions but there was actually something going on in my brain that wasn't like theirs, that my reality was different from theirs and they finally got that to the fullest extent that they possibly could not being mentally ill themselves. I felt hope at that moment that I could get better. I hadn't sought help because I didn't think my family would approve and finally when they understood about mental illness encourage me to take my meds and to see a therapist and just were more understanding of who I am and how my brain works.

I truly believe that my alcoholism is so intertwined with my mental illness and I'm fully aware that I was self-medicating because my family didn't believe in psych meds I felt guilty taking them even as an adult so I would start them and then go off them really quickly because of the guilt. When my family finally accepted mental illness and that their daughter was mentally ill and when I accepted that I was an alcoholic and that there was a solution it was a turning point because my problems were identified and I found out the recovery is possible I felt like because I'm beating this because I'm beating the odds I can help others to do the same. I am someone who wants to die most days out of the week  the fact that I have a program that gets me out of bed  to give back to others  and medications to take that help me  and a therapist who is amazing,  & a great community and support system that includes my friends and family is just crazy . Mental illness and alcoholism don't have to limit our lives. some of our lives are cut horribly short but those of us who live have responsibility to give back to the addicts and alcoholics we're still suffering. Since discovering these two things about myself alcoholism and mental health issues, and believing the recovery is possible I have found what I feel like is my true calling in life which is to give back what I have been so freely given to me: a solution

170,Recovery Feels Like a Scam,"

I attended a new group tonight and on the drive over, I had a mini panic attack. 

While more people began filing in and crowding the room, I began to have a much more severe panic attack, and it was all I could do to exit quickly, fighting back tears and the heavy fight or flight feeling that overcame me.

Last weekend while driving, I also had a massive panic attack. It both scared me, and pissed me off. I’ve been working really hard, working tirelessly to accept BPD and CPTSD and meditating and practicing mindfulness—and my body is fighting against me. 

These panic attacks, beyond being humiliating, are fucking **painful**. The entire right side of my shoulder and neck feel like they’re flaring up, burning, sharp needles jabbing over and over into my skin. This radiating *heat*, that I KNOW is all in my head—but it hurts, and as much as I tel myself it’s psychosomatic, it doesn’t dampen the pain.

I feel paranoid all the time. Afraid I’ll run into someone I simultaneously want to see, and don’t. I’m **still** dealing with these feelings. Still wrestling with abandonment and feelings of worthlessness. I feel like all this is cycling back again after I have *just* dealt with it. Just felt like I was actually beginning to heal. 

I have done everything I know to do. And for all my efforts, I get attacked by this absolutely unbearable anxiety—I was never an anxious person. I haven’t been suicidal in a few months now. But it’s creeping in, and it scares me. It feels almost inevitable, this call of the void. I can’t seem to maintain happiness. I can’t seem to stay “recovered”. I was so anxious about “graduating” to going to therapy once every two weeks. I plugged away at trying to find groups that could bridge the gaps for me, fill the holes, to focus on my vision for the future—and it worked for a bit, but now I feel worse than before. I can’t handle a relapse, but that’s exactly what this is feeling to be. Relapse.

Recovery sucks. And it’s hard for me to believe that it’s actually real. That it actually sticks. That I can actually get better—and stay better. Because I just feel miserable. And it’s beginning to feel like the familiar hell I have always known, all over again.",1553912853.0,False,3,0,lzbumblebee,None,b76155,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/b76155/recovery_feels_like_a_scam/

173,Recovery with BPD an odd time for realization,"It was so hard to pick a topic for this post I in no way think I am fully recovered from BPD. I honestly laugh and joke at the fact I'm a borderline, Im super open about my diagnosis and love to slightly educate people on what it truly means to have BPD. I started telling my friends about being in DBT 9 hours a week, I talk about being admitted into a pysch hospital with ease no embarrassment behind it. 

Accepting the label of BPD was hard.. It took a lot, I think I even made some of my symptoms worse by reading too many books and articles about it. I had problems in my relationships, I lost a few jobs due to my emotions. I gave in to urges and impulses with no regard to the consequences. 

Well... Here I am some time later not sure how long it's been. This isn't a step by step how to get better guide. . This is it and it was simple. So simple it sometimes felt impossible, exhausting, and hopeless. 

Mindfulness, or a better non DBT term awareness. 

Trying to exist in the here and now, not dwell on the past or fear for the uncertainty of the future. 

Radical Acceptance, the ability to accept things as they are, surrender. Trust in the universe that things will be okay. Accepting the now even if I don't aggree with it. Radical acceptance isnt supressing your feelings and pretending everything's okay. It's accepting you can't change things and today you feel sad. You accept all of it without trying to control it, there's nothing to worry about. It just is....

Meditation I don't do it every day but I've implemented it more then ever. Right now I've been listening to hypnosis videos on finding your inner self, chakra balancing, getting over past relationships, etc. 

Having a positive mindset. Not playing victim when I wanted to. Not crying, not wallowing. I pushed myself to get up every day I didn't want to. 

Acting opposite. Doing the things you don't want to do when you need to do them. 

Sobriety from alcohol and hard drugs. Still smoke weed yes. 

Ending toxic relationships, leaving toxic jobs. 

Positive music, tv, books, movies, youtube, etc. Making sure I wasn't watching or reading anything that could trigger me or inspire me into depression or bad behaviors. This one was huge. Looking for more productive things to watch that will enrich my soul not distract me. 


DBT - helped a lot. Some of these skills I learned in DBT and I will attest that was a huge part of my recovery. But the power to control my mind came from consciously choosing to have a better life.

So far, I am in a much better place. I've taken accountability for my part in the issues in my life and attempted to reconcile with those who would accept. The others, I just made peace within and moved on. 

Though I had a moment today, where I was overwhelmingly sad. I'm pregnant, so it could be the hormones, but I had seen pictures of old friends together and they're all appearing to live a great life. Though I'm happy for them, I'm lonely. My husband is my absolute best friend and supporter, but I couldn't help but long for a best friend to confide in again, who wasn't my partner. And I've been planning our baby shower, and i've felt nothing but dread. I don't know who to invite, and the old friends who I am on okay terms with, might not show up. The ones who are sort of around in my life, also live 6 hours from me, so even though its completely reasonable for none of them to attend, I'm terrified of my lack of friendships being put on display for my family. 

I don't know who to ask to be a god parent. I don't know who I would ask to attend a baptism, or who would post ""proud of you!!"" posts, or if I'm even being reasonable being so fearful of the world knowing I am quite alone. I don't want to appear pathetic.

But on the same hand, I don't let people close. My husband is the only person who knows all of me, let alone any of me. No one around me really knows me. I have many co-workers who are very kind and friendly, but I can't allow myself to think they're friends; they're just people who are also doing the same tasks to get money to pay their bills. Though this segregation is what I've decided for myself, and as much as I feel I deserve to be alone, I get sad. 

One day I'll let people close again, but not until I can feel safe enough within myself to not repeat old patterns.

We’re young and we like to party, but for me ( someone who used to take drugs and drink on a daily basis just a year ago for months) those things are not my piece of cake anymore. I am clean, but my friend’s aren’t, and 90% of times when we hang out, drugs are involved. I don’t especially mind it, because I stopped as I felt that being sober was a better way to help myself and recover first - putting the “party life” on hold for as long as needed.
The problem is, my friends are insisting. Every time we go out, they try to trick me or convince me that I should be taking with them. It takes a while for me to make myself clear and say that it’s a definite NO, and by that time I can feel the tension and it literally feels like I’m blowing the mood. I wish they wouldn’t insist.

I mentioned that I’m doing this break kind of thing for myself as I need more time to reflect on what I wanna do next (university, job, hobbies that I lost or forgot about while I was under the influence of drugs or alcohol). 
I’m scared of talking about my BPD with them as I know the feelings of regrets afterwards will definitely hunt me lol and I don’t want them to see me in any other way
And at the same time, I feel that hanging out with them while they’re under the influence just makes me... uncomfortable. They’re all in they’re own world having fun and then there s me just watching my life play its course while I feel completely absent and detached.

199,Anyone in 12 step recovery?,"I have 2 years sober and it's for sure the best goddamn thing I ever did and I've probably never have been doing so well. But thats the problem. I'm still doing very bad. I look at it as that I started my life two years ago and that is not too far from the truth at all. I always say that I made a 175 degree turn. That's true. But it's also not. I've changed tremendously for the better. In the way that a ""normal"" recovering drug addict would. I've found a new way of life and it's amazing. But I still have bpd.  No need to list my bpd symptoms. Usual shit. My friends tell me that I'm working a good program but how can that be the case when my thinking is so distorted, I rage, get psychotic, cut myself ect? For example  I'm highly Impulsive and buy scratch offs and stuff which would be a major red flag for normal recovering addicts and people would be on their ass about it. For me, no one bats an eye. It seems that other people have a better understanding of what is me and the program, and what is mental illness than I do. They say it is different. I agree but I'm so confused as to how I can act and think like this as still be ""a shining example of how the program works and how a person can turn their life around"" so unsure, doubting myself. Hell I'll even doubt if god is real or if the program is bullshit or not. Anyone have similar experience in recovery? I don't know what to think or believe anymore.

200,BPD and my recovery,"I remember myself very well as a kid: I was very shy, I hated school, I lacked social skills, I was very emotional.  I was in and out of therapy a lot, being scrutinized by doctors that I disliked severely.  They didn’t know what they were talking about, how could they relate to what I was feeling, going through or understand the way that I felt?  Even at that young age I knew they were misdiagnosing me.

At school, I was bullied a lot.  I would feign sickness on the regular just to get out of a day of school.   As I watched the bus leave my street, the sick feeling in my stomach would subside immediately because I knew I was safe for another day.  Staying home in isolation gave me solace.  I didn’t have to deal with anything, at least for the day.  As a kid, I suffered from severe anxiety and depression, I know that now.  I was back and forth to the hospital for therapy following episodes as severe as suicide attempts; my poor mother and father.  My family didn’t know what to do.
Mental illness had a stigma attached to it back then, it still does.  You didn’t talk about it, you ignored and suppressed it.  As a family, we never discussed what was going on with me, it was swept under the rug.  I always thought of myself as a good kid though.  I respected my parents and our house rules, I never did anything illegal.  I feared repercussion too much to risk causing trouble, and was too anxious to risk breaking the law.  I was your stereotypical sister – stealing my older sister’s clothing and fighting with my twin sister.  I always felt that I had it a bit harder than my sisters though, I didn’t feel equal in the treatment we received.  As far as I was concerned, they had it easy compared to me.  They didn’t have the same struggles as me.  Both were smart and popular and had loads of friends.  I had isolated myself and didn’t share those characteristics.   Eventually, elementary school was over and I could go off to high school without anyone knowing me, this excited me.  Being bullied was over with (finally) and I’d make some new friends for once, maybe figure out who I really was.

High school was the best.  I excelled at every undertaking.  I was smart, MVP in every sport I played and actually became one of the “cool kids”.  This was how life was supposed to be.  I was well liked, well respected and I worked hard.  I had a great group of friends and we were good kids.  For the first two years of high school I was where I was supposed to be.  Then trauma hit.  Grade eleven: five friends of mine died in one month, to the day.  Each week, I futilely struggled to cope with another death.  I was suddenly and unexpectedly sinking deeper and deeper into legitimate depression.  I dropped out of school, I stopped playing soccer, I stopped being that stereotypical good sibling, truthfully I stopped interacting with my sisters altogether.  I was back to my elementary school self, the self I thought I had left behind.  Full of anxiety and depression, my family didn’t know what to do, again.  I was back and forth to the hospital, again.  Back on medications that I always took myself off of because, well, I didn’t want to deal with society’s ubiquitous stigma.  Take a pill to be happy?  Not me, I don’t need a pill to be happy, that’s just nuts!

Fast forward over a decade: I’m 30 years old.  It’s April of 2014.  I’m in bed, sobbing my eyes out and I haven’t gone to work in a month.  I can’t get out of bed.  I can’t stop crying.  I can’t eat.  I was regularly lashing out in fits of anger towards my family for no reason whatsoever.  What’s wrong with me!?  I remember my mother rubbing my back and me sobbing.  “I hate this feeling, I just want it to go away.”  That evening, I was brought to the hospital.  I met with my current psychiatrist (Dr. D), who admitted me on the spot.  I stayed in Mental Ward 2D for about a month.  My medications were monitored closely, as was my sleep, my mood; the doctors paid close attention to anything that could help them help me recover.

2D was full of interesting people.  I remember one girl freaking out into fits of physical rage and screaming at the other patients.  She spent most of her time locked up, where I definitely didn’t want to be.  One man in there just stood in the middle of the room, staring at the ceiling for hours.  Another woman who was in my ward kept telling me to “be careful of all the ghosts here”.  Apparently if we didn’t behave, “they’d come to get us”.  What was I doing here!?  I didn’t belong here!  I admit I was really sad and couldn’t function for a few days, but admitting me to a real life psych ward, no way!  I was there for a day or two before I started fighting with one of the nurses.  Finally, I packed up all my stuff and at ten o’clock in the evening, I left the hospital and went home where I knew I belonged.  I didn’t sleep that night and spent it crying uncontrollably.  The next day, I was brought back to the hospital and put under a “Form”.  I couldn’t leave the hospital for seventy-two hours, and was under suicide watch.  I was brought back to the same room I had stayed in previously and settled back in.  I couldn’t believe my life had come to this.  I was on medical leave from work, thirty years old and in a mental ward, which even if I wanted to I couldn’t leave.  I wasn’t even allowed to make my own choices, like a child.  I had severe insomnia, so I was awake all night while the nurses would do their rounds.  I stayed in my room most of the time and didn’t eat.  It wasn’t until after a week or so that I was able to leave my room.  I found the “family” room where all the other patients ate and watched television.  I met four other patients there who seemed just like me.  I got to know them very well, and after a time we started referring to ourselves as the “Fantastic Five”.  To this day, I still talk to and see these four people.

One day while in my room, Dr. D came in.  He wanted to discuss my diagnosis.  Diagnosis?  I already knew what I had.  “You suffer from anxiety and depression yes, but the big one is Borderline Personality Disorder.”  Borderline, what!?  What the hell was he talking about?  I don’t have a disorder.  He handed me a book to read.  Borderline Personality Disorder: An Information Guide for Families.  My concentration level was so bad at this point, even if I did manage to read it, I wasn’t going to absorb any of it.  I looked it over quickly, it was the least I could do.  Things like, “what might have been a trivial slight to others was for me an emotional catastrophe” and “are highly sensitive to what’s going on around them,” were excerpts that stood out to me.  I had always had intense but short-lived bouts of anger, depression and anxiety but I didn’t think it amounted to something bigger, something so severe.  I knew I had a fear of abandonment but I thought it was just one of those things that everyone felt from time to time.  It’s just a quirk of mine, maybe a character flaw that I could work on?  I didn’t realize that these were the defining characteristics of a patient with BPD.  Dr. D. quickly put me on some new medication which within days resulted in a significant difference in my mood.  My anxiety was decreasing, my concentration was slowly returning, I could actually sit still for longer than a single minute.  It was soon after my specific combination of medication stabilized and proved itself effective that I was released from the hospital.  Out of 2D, but ironically now I didn’t want out.  I was comfortable in my little bubble of crazy people just like me.  I didn’t want to go out into that big scary world and have to face my demons and fears.  I noticed a lot about myself when I was released though, a new perspective.  I couldn’t handle big crowds of people anymore.  I was very impulsive.  I had a very intense fear of being abandoned or of being alone.  It was scary being out in this big world, but I had to try.

Because I was admitted to the hospital, Dr. D. was able to register me into an outpatient program called the SMART Program.  The waiting list for this was huge but because I had been admitted, I could bypass this waiting list.  Essentially, it was a program for people suffering from BPD, depression and anxiety to help learn strategies and coping mechanisms for when times were rough.  I met a lot of other people who were a variety of ages, and were all going through similar struggles.  Each day typically started with a walk together.  We had our own therapists assigned to us and one who would run the group sessions.  I would meet with my therapist once a week, discuss my issues, the program material, family, friends, etc.  The program ran for a few months while I remained off work on a medical leave.  It was really hard work.  Getting up each day was such a struggle, but I completed my program and graduated.  That was a very emotional day.  I remember my mother saying she’d buy me the Tiffany Bean Necklace I had always wanted if I graduated this program.  Graduation day came, and we went to get it.  The lady behind the counter asked us if we knew its meaning.  “New Beginnings,” she said.  We were stunned.  Quite the omen!

Currently, I am back to work full time.  It’s still a war with myself to get out of bed in the morning, but one that I can now manage and nearly always win.  Some days are particularly hard, others are good.  I wouldn’t quite say things are great right now, but they’re good.  I’m getting back to that happy place and I can see a light at the end of the tunnel, one that is growing brighter with each passing day.  One of the most powerful contributors to a recovering BPD’s success is their support group.  I have been blessed with an amazing family and a boyfriend that every girl probably dreams of having.  If it weren’t for them, I would not have been this successful with my recovery, full stop.  I live with my boyfriend now and not only is he aware of my difficulties and struggles, he has educated himself in how to best help and assist me when I need it most.  He’s experienced the ups and downs, and because of his devotion and knowledge, he has helped pull me through the hard times.  I can only imagine the frustration of someone having to deal with a BPD because I know how unstable we can be.  Without him, I would not have the strength in me that I do today, and I would not have progressed as quickly to where I currently am.  He is my reason to smile each day and stick with this PMA  (Positive Mental Attitude).  Each day is still a struggle but I know that there is hope to living with and finding balance and peace within the clutches of BPD.

I hope this blog/site (www.bpdconnects.com) tugs at some heart strings and helps give you some insight and support to those of you suffering from BPD directly or indirectly.  Sharing our stories, struggles, and making more people aware of BPD, depression and anxiety is only the beginning of our road to recovery as a community.  It is significant though.

201,Is this recovery?,"I haven't had one of my frantic emotional blowouts for a few weeks now. In fact, I'm feeling pretty good. :-) I started a new job about three weeks ago which I expected to hate (it's in a call center), but it turns out that I enjoy it and am pretty damn good at it. I live with family right now, and I had to spend my whole first paycheck to keep us from being homeless. Normally this would make me feel taken advantage of, but they've all been so grateful for the assist that I actually feel proud of myself for helping. Pride is a feeling I haven't felt in a really long time. It's nice to feel like I saved the day instead of being the one who needs saving.

203,"Recovery (hopelessness, asking for support)","CW: Self harm, mentions of sexual abuse/pedophilia (non-descriptive), abuse and suicidality 

I've never been on reddit. I think I'm here because every other place online doesn't understand, or think that straight criticism will stop me from being a bad person. It doesn't. It makes me believe I'm past help.

I just split on my partner of 3 years. This was my first Big Split since my relationship with my abuser 4 years ago, and I'm not sure how to cope and do the healthy, right things. 

I was a serial cheater. So was my abuser. Cheating and infidelity are my biggest sources of paranoia and rage. I still deal with inappropriate flirting and relationships with friends despite being in a very patient, supportive relationship. I am aware of the double standard and want so badly to be a better person, but the moment I believe my partner is being distant or my relationship is failing, I try to self-soothe with other desperate people. 

My partner is my everything (obviously). Everything about them is creative and stimulating and brilliant. The kindness and patience was something they learned, being with me. And I'm already crying thinking of all the work that goes into it. 

They have a friend from one of their old theatre gigs and she is beautiful. They've been talking since the first time we started dating in my freshman year of college (but I ended up becoming monogamous with my abuser, and cut ties. We found each other again a year later.) Because I am scared and my impulse control is close to nothing, I went into their Facebook messages. This is a horrible, invasive behavior I have not been able to stay responsible for since my ex. 

And the friend and my partner flirt. At least, I know what my partner's flirting looks like. They call her stunning, and they said things to her that they used to say to me, and they joke about sex things (not overt, just comedy) and about being married. And they've had a history where they would surround themselves with friends they were attracted to in order to maintain an unhealthy source of sexual tension. (Sound similar?)

Because I am terrified of them abandoning me, I feel like even though they're not cheating (and are pursuing healthy, fulfilling friendships with others...) that they will realize I am a toxic, abusive person and leave me. 

I love them, but they also represent so much more to me. I am trans, and my parents were physically and emotionally abusive all during my upbringing. My father is a pedophile and my mother also probably suffers from BPD (but is more of an ""acting out,"" instead of an ""acting in"" like me). I also have a string of abusive or codependent relationships behind me where I was sexually assaulted or abandoned. I also have no steadfast friends. If my partner leaves me, I will be forced to move back in with my parents because I do not have the independence or money to avoid it. It's unfair to them but terrifies me everyday. I try not to frame it that way to them, but I think they are aware and it might be one of the main reasons they stay with me. They've definitely had a savior complex in previous relationships.

Usually, I am depressed enough that my drive to be anxious or paranoid is dampened by fatigue. I am now medicated, and my BPD symptoms have been in full effect. I am acting in, sometimes acting out, and I straight up accused them of being attracted to her last night, then self-flagellated and then ghosted for the evening. And I think they found out I was lurking as well. This is the first time in a few months where I've been this way to them, (the last time was an awful fight about our sex life; a whole other, terrible problem where I am a terrible person.) 

I'm usually quiet, and self-harm and self-destruct than put it directly on my partner (not good, but better than outwardly hurting them.) But after re-reading I Hate You Don't Leave Me and some articles about the abuse cycle with those with BPD, I'm realizing I'm still perpetuating those behaviors but just on a micro, below-the-surface level. 

And I just... know that I'm high functioning and self aware for most Borderlines... but its still not enough? I'm still not going to be a good person no matter how hard I try? I feel like I'm predisposed to be bad, and that being good feels like wearing heavy, itchy, suffocating clothes. And even when I'm Excersing, Eating Better, Seeing a Counselor AND Psychiartist, On Medication, Journalling, and Using BOTH DBT+CBT... I'm still this person. And I'll always be this person, because you can't completely recover from BPD. And I will always hurt people around me.

And that makes me want to hurt myself. Like, my brain is saying ""Let them leave you, or force them to leave you. You are a bad person, and you are hurting the one you love most because you are not well and want everything from them."" And then, if I do that... I'll be alone. All alone. And I'll have to move back home into suburbia. And I'll be stranded. And I'll lose everything. And that... makes me want to kill myself. I don't know what to do.

I really don't know what to do. Obviously we can talk about it and I can apologize and try to be better but I will always have a history and I will always be this terrible partner on the inside. 

I just want to die. And I'm scared.
