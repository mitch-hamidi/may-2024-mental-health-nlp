1,"i feel like i’m losing my battle and nothings helping i’ve struggled with depression since i was about 12/13 and over the years it’s progressively got worse and lead to a bpd diagnosis and what not. recently i’ve been doing really well after a really tough year with all the things you expect someone to go through (attempts, losing friends, addiction etc). but recently i’ve been breaking down so much and i honestly don’t know what to do. my parents are scared for me and i feel like my friends would be but i don’t tell anyone anymore when i struggle, it’s not worth it and i don’t want a pity party. my boyfriend helps in his own way but he doesn’t provide the comfort and reassurance that i’ll be okay, he’s more straight thinking and gives logical reasons to the problems and issues i have and i know it’s his way of helping but it doesn’t provide give the same help that a ‘i love u, it’s gonna be okay u have me’ would give. and i feel like no one takes me seriously when i am genuinely so fucking depressed and i don’t know how much longer i can do it. please help me. or just someone to talk to, i have so much going on in my head and it’s slowly killing me again after i though i was finally getting better",-Rosewiththorns-,1agxmz3
2,"The Way Social Media Assumes Things About and Is Portraying BPD is So Fucking Harmful and Frustrating like i’m a rare case of bpd developing at a very young age, i’ve dealt with it fo at least 14 years most of which were unknowing on top of a laundry list of other co-morbid problems and disorders.  the current social media narratives around this disorder is so fucking scary for me to see.  

i see teenagers on twitter and tik tok self diagnosing and talking about their “fps” with heart emotes and asking for advice on how to tell them.  like it’s just an intense fucking crush and not a horrible obsessive fixation no healthy person with good intentions towards you would be comfortable with/want you to have towards them for both you sakes.  one that it is your responsibility to manage and not put on another person who didn’t ask for it.  

it’s either romanticized enabling bullshit that mirrors my internal dialogue i used to justify some of my worst behavior moments that ruined relationships or are still affecting my life today.  and treats mood swings as a quirk instead of an incredibly invasive and overwhelming experience that feels like it retraumatizes you a little every time.

or it’s infantilizing and demonization.  “they can’t control themselves, they’re naturally manipulative, they have no idea they’re doing it and can never change.”  i am extremely aware of myself and my issues constantly.  to the point i have to also worry about accidentally gaslighting myself as a coping mechanism on top of regulating my fucked up emotions.  i work so hard to be self aware, manage my mood swings in a way that doesn’t lash out at others, limit pushing other people’s boundaries, and argue with myself and play devils advocate whenever i’m splitting on someone.  

this condition has permanently altered how i function as a person and made my life so much harder than it needed to be.  and despite mental health being such a “hot topic” for people to throw attention to and improve the narrative on?  i’ve never felt more misunderstood by the world than the last few years.  and it’s so fucking frustrating.",0w_l,mtba08
3,"How to cope with family who doesn’t believe in mental illness i have been diagnosed with bpd late 2020s and currently working on myself to improve on my bpd.

4,"Lost my FP/partner and now I’m addicted to dating apps hoping to find someone else to latch to. my partner and fp broke up with me about 2 weeks and ever since i’ve been addicted to swiping on all dating apps. i would do it for hours and then cry because i realize no one, based on their profiles, would replace him. ever since i’ve been stuck to my bed unless it’s a meetup from the app. i’ve been filling that void with meaningless hookups, good and bad sex. there was only one person i met that i feel can be a thing but i know he would never be my fp. i don’t. know how to live without one.",100260,"172cqod, 15tt6zt"

i’m really torn about life. i don’t want to live the one i have but i’m doing all i can to change it (life worth living dbt prompt thing) and it keeps getting worse somehow. i’m all kinds of fucked now because i quit my job to ~ pursue my dreams but really, no career will ever give me the fulfillment i need and i can’t think of anything that will.

i’m just tired and really unable to trust anyone because i feel like everyone is out to get me. i should have never quit my job, even if they undervalued me to the point they had me crying nearly every day. i’m scared i’ll never find a job again, scared i’ll never be financially stable and horrified at the path i’m taking. i’m a fuck up and a leech but i can’t bring myself to commit.",1837949059,utcea3
6,"(LONG) Looking for any kind of help regarding a friendship/relationship with someone having bpd. hello everyone; this is going to be rather long so thanks to everyone actually reading over all of this, i really appreciate it, english is not my first language and i am very confused about a lot of stuff that's going on so i am really sorry if there are any passages that might be confusing or hard to read/understand, i'm trying my best.

i met this girl (online)  somewhere around june last summer; she was in a relationship when we actually met, with no intentions of anything more than friendship between us. her (extremely toxic) relationship was basically over already at this point (which i did not know at this point of course) and the break-up was basically a few days after we first had contact. 

she had her best friend/favorite person which was basically there for her all the time, but apparently she found me very interesting as well, so we had quite a lot of contact during this time as well. i'm a generally very empathic person and am always happy to help or be there for someone if i'm actually able to help them feel better, so naturally i did. she grew attached quite fast and we basically had contact every day without exception, (via chat at first, calls/talking via discord later on) due to her mental state at this point, she opened up very quickly to me(about her having bpd as well), talking about basically everything and i had absolutely no problem with this. i was actually happy for all the trust she put into me. 

all of this was very interesting to me, and mental illness is something that is very interesting to me anyways (i had depression for quite a while, as well as some other mental health issues; still in therapy as well, but i'm at a point where i'm actually stable without any limitiations to every day life or anything similar) and she actually suggested me a book about bpd since i mentioned that i was openly interested in understand her and the illness. we grew attached quite a lot over time - still: as friends only, but we would have some cheeky flirting going on all the time, nothing serious though. over time, this had become more and more though, with her even telling me that ""she would probably have fallen in love with me, if she wasn't right in the middle of lovesickness"" which was obviously very flattering for me, but nothing more than that. at some point we even went over chat logs with her ex, for her to realize that she wasn't the (only) problem in her relationship and only at this point she actually noticed how terribly toxic her relationship and ex-bf actually was (i was sincerely shocked over how cruel people could actually be.). obviously she wasn't completely innocent how her relationship went but this was nothing one-sided at all. 

due to this she could finally conclude the relationship and any ""chance"" to ever actually get together with him ever again.  this is where it probably started getting complicated as i slowly started developing feelings that involved more than friendship and it was quite obvious that she did as well. this all happened around 4 months after we got to know each other and at some point she actually opened up about how she was feeling as well and that she actually fell in love with me. due to her only coming out of a 2 year relationship and the distance between us (around 7 hours) we didn't go that much further into this and just went on with how it went between us anyways, doing stuff together online, the usual flirting, watching movies together, etc.

fast forward, in november we started planning to actually meet up and we did actually meet in december. this was a huge thing obviously (her therapist; she started therapy in late october that year; actually scrutinised this heavily and i was actually unsure if she'd actually pull through, with all of this, but she did and we met up)

 the time was amazing, with her getting to know my family, me getting to know hers, we had tons of fun and an amazing time together. there were so many signs of how great we actually fit together; all the stuff like her mentioning that i actually made her feel good and beautiful for the first time in her life (she did have some terrible relationships, she was actually completely confused when i started adressing compliments to her, as she never experienced something like that in her life.). we actually were together for a few days, when she realized that this was all too fast for her and she was not ready for a relationship at this point, which obviously made me very sad but there was nothing i could do at this point that would actually change anything so i could only accept this for now. we simply carried on as before as... ""very good friends""? i guess. 

there has been a lot back and forth since then with her saying that she definitely wants to see me again, that what we have actually is a relationship, just without calling it like that because she's afraid of it. her saying that she has no time/power/strength for a relationship but on the other hand. her telling me that i should stop having any expectations or hope as she is unable to actually ""love"" or ever have a ""healthy relationship"". her having her priorities everywhere but about having a relationship at all. at one point she actually mentioned that she wants to see me again, but that i shouldn't have any kind of hopes about ""getting together"" at this point, that she just wanted to see me again, that she just wants to have someone be with her.

i honestly sometimes have no idea at all what of this her bpd is and what's actually rational thinking of her. this permanent uncertainty is really nagging on me and is sometimes making me feel really terrible (especially her mentioning the fact that she cannot have a relationship at the moment, feels really bad.).  

there are so many contradictory signs where at one point she tells me about how we do actually have a relationship, i just shouldn't see or call it as one, as this is what she's struggling with; her telling me how she's completely trusting me and how important i am for her but on the other hand the fact that i should not have any hopes or expectations as she's way too scared of not being able to ""fullfill""? them and losing me altogether. 

once again, i am really sorry about how complicated all of this might sound (it is extremely complicated in my head, so it is actually really hard to write this all out.) and i'm really hoping that everything is understandable to a certain degree. at no point ever have i ever thought about ""ending"" this or to stop working on all of this as she really is everything i've ever wanted in a partner, i truly am in love, as complicated as it might be, i honestly do not care and am happy to push through all of this, hoping for a positive outcome. it permanently feels like she does not know at all what she actually wants or needs herself even though how obviously i am ""enhancing"" her life and making everything better and easier for her (this is not supposed to sound arrogant or pretentious in any way: this is actually something she has told me very often). she has terrible (mental-)scars from her former relationship with some of them that haven't even started healing yet at all (though, i really hope, that therapy is going to help with this) and i would be more than happy to show her, that there are is another kind of relationship than the ones she had until now.

 i am sometimes struggling though. all this back and forth is - sometimes! - very exhausting (there's times where this is worse, times where everything is a lot clearer and easier as well though). times where it's absolutely clear that she definitely wants a relationship and all of this, and other times where it feels like there is no chance for us to ever get together at all. this uncertainty is extremely hard to bear for me from time to time.

i am unsure what kind of help or support i'm looking for here, but at this point probably anything and everything is going to help. just writing all of this down (as confusing as it might be, i am really sorry) was already helpful for me. anything that i could read, learn or do, any kind of opinion about all of this, honestly everything is probably going to help me so i am happy about whatever there is to say.

if anyone actually bothered to read all of this: thank you. if there is anything unclear (of which i am sure there is quite a lot of) i am absolutely happy to answer any kind of question, thanks for reading this and thanks to everyone that might try to help me out with all of this.",1air2d,"1befrjf, 1befrjf"

i am just about done with my constant need for validation  and attention. stuff that my birth givers should have given me but failed miserably at and are seemingly unaffected by. why should i suffer when they aren't? what did i do to deserve this? my life is a fucking warzone filled with trauma and pain that can never heal. 

i am dissociating right now and typing shit to placate my inner child who wants some sort of an answer for all this suffering. why? why me? what did i do to deserve this illness? why do i have to suffer?

i know that i am not alone and there are several others in situations worse than mine. however, i can't help but be miserable because to heal i need to get therapy and that very important shit is expensive. 

life probably sucks in worser ways for others and i am not trying to invalidate their experiences or sideline their struggles.

i’ve pretty much lost my fp, because i fucked up massively, he’s not replying to my texts and i’m pretty sure i’ve been ghosted - i’m not sure how to prepare myself for when that happens or how i can bring myself out from that because i’ve never lost a fp before, they’ve all just sort of faded out. 

im too tired to do anything, i’ve got deadlines and work that i’ve been avoiding, and i just don’t know how to cope. i’ve got extensions on university work, but i’m pretty sure they’ll eventually get sick of my bullshit with my mental health and kick me out. 

i’ve tried to get support the best i can, but literally no mental health services will see me, i’ve exhausted every charity and my university’s sessions of therapy they can give me and i just don’t know how else to be proactive and get help. im on medication, which takes the edge off, but i’m still nowhere near stable and all they can do is up it, which doesn’t help.

i really need a clean space to keep my thoughts and feelings from being overwhelming and chaotic. i’ve tried to explain this so many times but he says because of his own mental health, he cannot force himself to do things he doesn’t want to do. for example, if he’s already in a low, the thought of doing a chore/task is unfathomable for him and ruins his entire day. in response, i told him that i hear him and i will try to understand. but i feel like he hears my needs but doesn’t try to understand or accommodate me. i’m not asking for marie kondo’s house. i just need a safe place for me because everywhere feels unsafe. 

it’s really causing me to spiral because i feel angry, resentful, unloved, sad and that i need to leave the relationship. but he’s also my fp so i never really could actually do it and i don’t want to. he’s wonderful in so many ways but the fact that we just talked about this last night and the kitchen is a disaster this morning has me in emotional shambles. everything is just too intense.

b isn’t anything too special, but i could feel myself imprinting on him. fp alert! this hasn’t happened to me in years and it’s scary. i want to lovebomb him and tell him i love him today. but i know i don’t love him. i don’t know why my brain is doing this. i say things to him about other guys to provoke an emotional reaction, then lose it when he doesn’t take the bait. it’s exhausting. 

however…sometimes i feel like he’s also not completely neurotypical. he asked me to move in with him. he calls me baby sometimes. he always says i don’t show him that i like him (which is crazy seeing as i’m in lovebomb mode). when i tell him i like him he says ‘you’re just saying that’. he always makes jokes about ‘my other guys’ even though i’ve told him there are none and to please not say that. when we first made out he kept ignoring my boundaries and that made me… want him more. wild, right?

i’m hesitant to post this purely because i know there’s mixed opinions on minors receiving bpd diagnoses (i’m 16f) but i want to do it anyway.

i went through severe trauma in my childhood and suffered a lot since. the last time i saw a psychiatrist was at 14 and he said i did have very clear traits of bpd but that he wanted to see if it would go away as i got older. i got a bunch of diagnoses including unspecified bipolar disorder but it didn’t fit. i received cbt and emdr and to treat my trauma and other diagnoses and a few different meds but it wasn’t effective at all. 

it’s recently got to the point where my behavior has spiraled out of control and neither my mother, current psychologist or school or really anyone in my life knows how to handle me anymore. so tonight i have an appointment with my psychologist and she told me they’ve been in touch with a place that specializes in personality disorders and can help treat my symptoms and possibly diagnose me if they are certain i have it. 

to get into all my symptoms would make for a very long post but if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask. i’m just very anxious because i don’t know what to expect and i wasn’t even aware of how much problems i was causing with my behavior.",Adromeda_G,1b0qxii

27,"My best friends I was very dependent on left me and I have no idea what to do i’m a girl who just turned 16 a couple days ago. i had 2 friends i knew and messaged everyday for almost a year, we had a gc together and we would just infodump everything about our lives to each other. i vented there a lot about my mental health issues, mainly my bpd. i also feel like i created a fake character just to be liked by them. i was so dependent on them and their love and praise. i had no other place to vent and they seemed to be understanding of my issues so i thought it was all fine. i think a big part of the reason they started to dislike me was that despite being so mentally ill and unhappy i’ve had a rather privileged upbringing compared to them and supporting parents. i’m not even sure how most of my mental health issues developed, i believe it was genetics or because the schools i went to as a very little kid had terrible teachers who damaged me mentally. i already felt like this made my problems invalid but of course i couldn’t change my brain or how i felt. 

it was my birthday a couple days ago and they both wished me a happy birthday, i felt a little ignored by them though. we continued on as normal until i posted a screenshot of me achieving something in a game we all played and friend #1 suddenly blocked me and left the gc. i asked friend #2 why friend #1 blocked me, they said they had no idea and they probably just wanted a break. i then said i was scared i did something wrong and friend #2 said they didn’t think so, so i didn’t worry and just moved on with my day. i was worrying they would both leave me, but i denied it bc they both knew about my extreme abandonment issues and that they were some of my only friends so why would they do that to me? then i saw friend #2 unfollowed me on all social media, that’s when i panicked. i decided i would leave them before they left me to avoid the feeling of abandonment so i unfriended them on other platforms before they could. then i got a very long message from friend #2, they explained that we can’t be friends anymore. they were aware of my issues and said that i need to seek professional help, and that they can’t help me and they’re afraid they’re enabling me and making it worse. they also told me i need to grow up bc i’m 16 now and can’t be a kid forever, they think i haven’t changed the whole year they’ve known me and act like a dumb attention seeking child. they brought up some behavior and things i’ve said that were rather stupid and damaging but i didn’t realize they were. then they said they still care about me and they want me to find better friends and be happier. i cried reading the message, i wasn’t even angry at them i was just sad. i wrote a reply apologizing and wishing them well too, but it didn’t go through because i assume they blocked me. then i got a message from friend #1, they called me spoiled and ungrateful and said some other nasty things about me. 

i couldn’t stop shaking reading the message and i wanted to believe it wasn’t real. i wanted to believe none of this was real. i wanted to stay with my friends but it was over and there was nothing i could do. they were just celebrating my birthday a couple days ago and it felt so unreal. this was only a few hours ago and i can’t stop crying, i really don’t know what to do and i feel super lost. i feel like a spoiled brat and like all my issues are invalid. i only have a few other friends besides them and this guy i had a crush on left me about a month ago and i miss him like hell too. it also hurts knowing that both of them are still friends without me. i know friend #2 wants me to get professional help but i tried therapy a couple months ago and it didn’t work out or help because i have a lot of trouble opening up to adults. i feel like i wasted so much time talking to those 2 friends and caring about them for nothing. i’m just so lost and i can’t stop crying but at the same time i feel guilty for it bc of how “spoiled and ungrateful” i apparently am. how can i cope with this and move on? 

tldr: my best friends left me. one of them was nice and mature about it but the other one was nasty and made me feel like shit, to them my problems aren’t valid bc i’m a stupid spoiled ungrateful brat who needs to grow up. i don’t know what to do now because i was so emotionally dependent on them and i can’t stop crying. i need help coping with this and moving on.",AdviceRepulsive,1c0563s

during this argument, i had begun to have *feelings*; ones that i hadn't had in a looooong time. but i pushed them back. okay, i'm being irrational. we end up at home and go opposite ways.

this morning comes and he comes to talk to me. it begins another argument. all day i have been feeling worthless and depressed. i've stopped my medications, and i don't feel like this is a reason to start them back up yet. i know i'll be okay again soon. but even at work tonight, i just flashed back to the arguments, and i just had a really down night.

wise mind says it's an argument; he's over it, so i should be too. emotional mind is telling me i need to leave him so he can find someone better for him [this is always my thinking during a borderline episode]. i know i'm overreacting, so why can't i pull myself out of it? why am i so in my head? i really hope after some sleep i'll be okay, but i woke up in a shit mood this morning... idk what to do.

i left my career over a  year  ago to be a stay at home dad, we were basically working just to  have  kids in daycare. i love my kids with everything i have. with out  going  into detail lets just assume we have gone through the full gambit  of the  bpd life all compact in the last year, there were signs prior  but  really triggered full the last 6 months.

she   did finally agree to go into treatment and they do specialize in   personality disorders, trauma, depression, and anxiety. their program is   geared to help, but it is only a month to a month and a half. i love   her from my depths, unconditionally. i have overlooked  some of the  negatives because of ""love"".

i  am  learning so much through this and other groups, i need to set hard   strict boundaries, and take care of myself too. i don't know if we will   even get that far. i want to wait till shes done with the program first   to talk about separating, then only discuss it after with a family   therapist, and at a 3 month point really discuss if this is what we   want. give it time, don't make a rash or emotional choice. i'm sure you   all understand how my partner would take this.

my  partner has pushed literally everyone in their life away and is pushing  me away now. they  want to ""co-parent"" after divorce, but we have never  co-parented. its  all been on me majority of the time. if we do divorce  it would not go  like they think, both sides of the family will speak  on my behalf, i am  the caretaker, i tend to all family matters. they  are in a facility,  have taken a few leaves from work do to mental  health. i really don't  want my partner to ruin the life they have, and  have worked really hard for,  but it feels like they are set on it with  out realizing it. mental  health issues suck.

56,"A positive post about losing an FP hi everyone, just wanted to come on here and write something about how i’m feeling, i hope it might resonate with some of you. today my most recent fp, a fwb situationship thing i had going on, ended things. he wasn’t mean about it and it was fairly amicable, but still hurt. i hadn’t admitted my true feelings for him and stuck around because i felt like i would rather have it than be lonely.

usually i would have had a complete meltdown. i did cry after it happened of course, that’s normal. i called my mum to talk to her about it as i couldn’t stop ruminating, afterwards i felt so much better in myself. i’ve reflected on the fact that as much as i feel i’m getting better within relationships with communication etc, i’m still not focusing on me out of relationships.

i still rely on them to make me happy as i have a lot of struggles making friends. i’m 21 and moved to a small town, about an hour away from my family, for work. i love it here but there’s not a huge social environment which makes it hard to make friends. i do get lonely and started to rely heavily on my fp for time away from home, for something to do. i knew from the start he was probably fairly emotionally unavailable due to a recent breakup but told myself i was too, so it didn’t matter.

i soon realised i had feelings and that maybe this style of relationship isn’t right for me but that’s okay. it’s okay to want someone for the long term who will want me back. i don’t want to keep begging people just to see me. i’m still learning to not constantly give myself away to people just to have them around for a little, as it feels like second nature to me. i also want to try and do things for me. so many times i’ve started to realise i put things on hold for people. for example, i was hoping to get a cat at the beginning of this month however i put it on hold because i was travelling to see my fp so often. it starts to feel like i can only leave the house for them, it’s just not healthy. 

i know many of you probably feel the same and i just felt like airing it here. we are worthy of the same healthy relationships ad everyone else. we deserve love and to put ourselves first in life. i’m proud of myself for being able to think this after what would have been devastating to me before my diagnosis, it just shows me how far i’ve come. big love to the bpd fam, we got this!",Artistic-Monitor4566,y5ay6h

i need opinions, because i feel like i’ve been in a nightmare since i met my now ex.

he pursued me heavily (i was just ending a relationship with someone else), asking me all kinds of questions about myself, my interests, my past exes. two weeks into talking he wanted to be boyfriend / girlfriend. i told him we were still getting to know each other, but that i liked him a lot. he took this as rejection and brought it up repeatedly in later arguments about how i don’t like him as much as he likes me and he’s not good enough for me. he would bring this up a lot especially if i was upset with something he did or i expressed myself in anyway about how i was feeling. that he was a failure and would jump to conclusions about ending things and him abruptly leaving my life. he also would talk about sex incessantly with me, but he seemed almost terrified to actually have sex with me in the beginning. his words not met by actions.

he was never wrong about things. anytime we argued (usually provoked by an insecurity of his), i would end up apologizing just to get him to calm down. he would go silent on me, gaslight me to punish me. he never ever apologized or took accountability ever for his actions.

he then met another girl, who he at first said was his friend. he started mirroring her (suddenly was interested in things she was to copy her like he did with me) and triangulating me, comparing me to her all the time. when i would say how i feel, he would blame shift and say things like i was being ridiculous, but stilll continued hanging out with her. when i broke up with him and deleted him everywhere, he lost it and started posting everywhere bragging about her to make me jealous (within the same day )

i'm trying to hide my emotions from her now so that she stops struggling with the intensity, but that upsets her too? and it doesn't even work most of the time, she can tell when my emotions change literally from the way my eyebrow moves even if i try to not show anything. 

and i said she should maybe try reading more about being with someone with bpd, and dealing with the rapid emotion changes etc, and she said she doesn't want to, so that's confused me too because i don't understand why she doesn't want to fix this issue. but she's also at the point where she's not happy in the relationship because of this. so i really don't know what to do?

86,"I know I'm self diagnosing, but its the first time in my life I felt like my problems made sense i've struggled with depression, suicidal thoughts, very poor self esteem, etc for as long as i remember. i always thought i was just regularly depressed but i never understood why my emotions were so unstable, why i could go from feeling like a king, to very depressed and hopeless in hours. why i overthink everything and blame myself for everything.

i've never understood why i can be hopelessly obsessed with a girl, and feel insanely jealous for no reason. but still be so afraid of commitment.

i've never understood why i'm so afraid of rejection and abandonment, and push people away because of this. 

i've never understood why i just dont know who i am, why my personality seems to adapt to whoever i'm with at that moment. why i just feel so empty so often.

yesterday, purely by chance, i found out about bpd, i've heard of it before but never knew what it meant. hearing about the signs/symptoms for the first time (for example [here](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder)) it just made so much sense, it was so strangely releaving, but depressing at the same time. 

for the first time ever, my problems make sense in some weird way.

the universe is like a simulation, a tale, so let’s compare our trials like a video-game or a book.
you are a character that technically faced some of the hard bosses before the main quests, without upgrades, without experience. 

you won, you were just a child and you won. even though it feels as if you lost a few battles and gained a few scars. we look at the npcs and see their attire as “flawless or unbroken”

you forgot you gain experience points, valuable life lessons, we depend on of defensive gear to face small threats, because the game is now wired to expect more bosses. learn to not react, but observe.

darling, you are the wisdom of an over powered player that’s misunderstood. you’re inner child feels like frodo but you are gandalf the white. 

don’t let these small threats defeat you, you already won. be patient, accept the hardship, the injuries that make you feel defeated. that was a wicked journey in the past and you’re the most bad*ss hero. 

you faced this universe early with nothing to give, in return it gave you so much more.

the ability to feel empathy to the roots of a soul, to detect when something doesn’t feel right. you know the patterns most people ignore, and we punish ourselves because society doesn’t understand us yet? it’s a shame on them. how could hobbits understand the trails dodo faced? don’t surround yourself with people to refuse to honor your survival. 

you are destined for an adventure.
seek it.

i’m really desperate for someone to talk to but none of my friends will understand so i’ll just vent here if you don’t mind.

i spent the last 4 years of my relationship believing that my partner had bpd and blaming that for all the difficulties we faced and the way he acted. he might still have it, i’m not sure. what i failed to realize until recently is that i might have more of an issue than i thought.

i’ve always had extreme anxiety and obsessive thinking. i’ve always had mood swings and am easily irritated or angered. i’ve always struggled with self-harm. i’ve always done absolutely anything to avoid being abandoned or would act in very shameful ways when i felt threatened.

anyway, tonight i think i messed up. my ex and i broke up about 7 months ago but remain friends. we usually talk almost every day but haven’t spoken as much this week. my car died in a parking lot today while i was running errands. i called him for help and was already really stressed and upset about the car. i jumped down his throat asking why he hadn’t been speaking to me lately and then started panicking about the car. i was so angry he didn’t immediately jump in his car to come rescue me.

after getting a tow truck sorted, he texted to check in and i told him i was on my way home and would call in a bit.

about an hour later, i tried to call. he answered but he was on a date. i absolutely lost it and hung up on him. then i texted a paragraph about how he obviously didn’t care about me any more and that this was the end of our friendship. i knew i was acting dramatically but i was so angry and so hurt that it felt like i was out of control of my body. i sh’ed for the first time in months and it was bad. i couldn’t stop crying.

it’s been a few hours and i’ve calmed down a little bit. now i’m just filled with shame and regret. i’m terrified i’ve finally messed things up for good. he can see the real me now and i feel like every outburst drives him further away. it’s no wonder he doesn’t want to speak to me- everything is a fight or dramatic.

at times like this i feel like all the progress i've made the past years didn't even happen.

i had a small argument with my roomate -well not even an argument rather a disagreement, and my response was to just put on my backpack and leave to my parent's place.

i feel very guilty because we had a party two days ago that we hadn't cleaned up yet and now he has to do it by himself, also i know i wasn't right with the disagreement either. but i acted like a child and just fucking ran away from my problems like i usually do.

i just feel suffocated, like i can't turn anywhere where i don't feel like shit, like i can't escape or just hide away if i need to. i feel like i have no freedom in my life or my actions, that i'm just being dragged along and that i'm a supporting character in other people's lives. but i know this is all because of me and i'm the reason i don't feel safe anywhere.

i just needed a sense of control so i left, and went to a pharmacy to take out a bunch of sleeping pills that i was prescribed a while ago but never bought them. the simple thought of having them around me calms me in a weird way, like i am here by choice and not because i don't know any better.

125,"[20F] shame for overreacting. i need advices (recently diagnosed) i understand this story will not be either particularly intriguing or uncommon, but i need advices, because i’m worried i may ruin a relationship i deeply value.

one of my best friends is also my “friend with benefits”. 
i was under a lot of stress during this month (exams) and some days ago i had to leave for a trip with my family. a trip, which is supposed to be something fun. however, this only brought me even more stress, because my family isn’t easy to deal with and they genuinely drain the life out of me. i love them, but a week is… difficult. 

i was supposed to see this friend the day before leaving, but he forgot due to a couple of reasons (some personal commitments + finished internet connection on his phone), and he also forgot the day after was the day of my departure. this deeply hurt me and i sent a couple of pitiful texts to him and also called him on the verge of crying. he apologised, but later in the day he texted me something on the lines of “i think you overreact a bit, enjoy your trip”.

now i can only think about how a burden i am for the people i love, how little i consider them, how paranoid i am (this wouldn’t have happened if he didn’t finished his internet). he is clueless, not sly, and i have always known it, but somehow i burst. 

i feel shame, so much shame. i won’t see him till the end of this week, maybe even later, and this thing hurts. in a different situation i would have tried to “get back on the horse”, explain myself, spend some good time to faint this shameful memory, but now i can’t and this follows me. the paranoia, in particular: i cannot help myself but think how much easier would be not to have to deal with me at all.

the next day, he pretended like he had never been disappointed in me. he even got mad at me for making it seem like it was his fault that i relapsed. i didn't want to sound mean, so i had to pretend that he wasn't the reason i relapsed. i don't know if he ever forgot that day, but i never have.

my thinking is like it’s good to be obsessive bc it keeps me focused on him. like almost everything i do is for him in some way, i work to make money for gifts and stuff for him and i work on my physical health so he doesn’t have to stress over it. i focus on school so i can get a good job to support us. im even looking into therapy (even tho im very scared and dont want to) bc he said i should get help.

i literally dont know how to stop thinking like this ? ik its codependent and ik i could easily be used in this situation but i gen dont rly care. i need to change but im honestly rly scared he wont like me as much anymore if i tone things down.

recently, i’ve been trying a new method of communication with him where we write each other letters to detail how we feel about certain things, as part of an exercise toward healing and understanding between us. the letters can get very intense, because we both reveal things that the other didn’t quite realise. he’s mentioned in his that i have a huge stake in his life and that he takes the letters very seriously, but it’s been a week now since i gave him my most recent one, and i haven’t heard back from him.
he’s leaving for a month-long trip around europe in a week, which was a completely spontaneous decision that he made about a week ago. i’m excited for him, but i’m also very anxious about the impending loneliness and the fact that i probably won’t get a letter back from him before he leaves. i’ve asked him to text me pictures now and then of where he is and what he’s doing when he’s there, just to keep in touch, but i have this seething fear that he’s going to neglect to do that.

162,"I'm so obsessed with him. i don't know why and i hate it. well, i do know why, but i shouldn't be this obsessed with him after so long. he was so kind and so easy to talk to. i poured my soul into our conversations and it was everything. i stayed up until 6am each night just so i could see him. 

context: he's my ex bf's(a) best friend(b). a and i had only been dating for a few weeks when he introduced me to his best friend (b). at first we were friendly, and it was great. us and some other people would hang out regularly and all was fine. until i started catching feelings for b. so me and b started hanging out sometimes. nothing ever happened between us, but i could feel something there, and i think he did too (we talked about it very briefly and put it behind us, he neither confirmed nor denied anything). i figured the next best thing to do was break up with my bf, as i obviously didn't love him. 

fast forward to now,  a and i are still friends but i don't talk to b because a gets jealous (even though we aren't dating). but i can't help the urge to reach out. it's been months, i think since november or september or something. i want to so bad. it's gotten to the point where i'll check his location throughout the day, and when he's at home i consider sending him a text. i never do though. i always fantasize about what our lives could be like together. 

in all honesty, i just need a rejection from him to move on. i know he'd never like me, i'm a bitch who's ""hormonal"" and ""over- emotional"" and i suck at everything. i also think i fell for my fantasy version of him, not him. i wouldn't know because we haven't talked in a few months and i've fantasized about him more than i've talked to him now. 

it just sucks, you know? i think about him so mucoh and it hurts. it hurts to not be able to talk to him, and it hurts knowing he'll never like me like i like him, and he'll never know how much i like him. 

for weeks, every weekend we'd go driving around at night. i'd be high as hell and we'd just talk, about anything and everything. it truly was an amazing experience, and i'd do anything for it again. absolutely anything. 

i'm just stuck running circles in my own mind. i could reach out to him so he could reject me, but then it might circulate back to a and he'd never forgive me. i could just live with this myself, but it eats me up and i hate it. i could try casually talking to him, until i trust that he won't tell anyone. i don't know. i overthinking way too much. i'm just obsessed with this god damn man and he won't get out of my head.

i have quite literally every symptom and it’s effected me from a young age, going back as far as late elementary school. 

the issue is, they won’t.. actually diagnose me, due to my age. i’m receiving treatment in the form of medication and therapy geared towards borderline personality disorder treatment, minus the label. while it’s helped some it’s certainly still an issue. 

what should i do? i feel gross saying i’ve probably got it without a diagnosis, but.. it’s really the only thing that explains everything, and quite literally the only reason it isn’t diagnosed is my age. 

while i know it’s not a major issue, it does stress me out quite a bit; it’s ruined my life even when i’m careful and again; everyone i’ve seen has brought it up as a likely cause bht won’t diagnose me as i’m too young.

173,"Found some old screenshots and that was not a good idea was looking through some pictures on my phone as i had taken a screenshot of a cookie recipe from back in 2015 and went looking for it because i want to make them this upcoming weekend. i found two different screenshots i had taken. one back in 2015, and the other back in 2016. reading what was on both was not a good idea.

both were from two different people. one had been involved with from 2014-2015, and was toxic. we both knew it was, we both admitted it went on longer than it should have. he acknowledged many times that the way he saw/treated me was unhealthy. the one that i found from him had something similar to what he told me one night over the phone which was “i don’t see you as a person, but just a toy i play with”. it did a serious mind-fuck on me. i’m starting to address how much of an impact it had on me in therapy. and it’s been brought up many, many a times with my psychiatrist over the last five years. needless to say, it did a fair amount of damage. 

the other one was from someone who i’ve been on/off with via e-mail for years! who i refer to as the accountant. not a spicy accountant, but it’s what he’s been doing as a job for the last 20+ years. we’ve known each other since 2015z and unfortunately for part of it i was unmedicated, and when i was, there were zero emotional regulation skills that were being used. so needless to say it goes without say that the screenshot i found from him was him being ultra dismissive and using words against me. that one hurt as well. 

reading both of them triggered me somehow and i had an hour long meltdown. i remembered that back then i had zero respect for myself and would let others hurt me emotionally because i could. i’m slowly working on not letting that happen anymore in therapy.

the accountant and i are in another back on phase right now, and it’s so much more healthier than what we had previously. i was going to email the accountant the one screenshot i found and be all “hey, remember how toxic we were back then? found this and we were not good each other then”. i had the email composed but didn’t press send. because i know if it did, it would bring up a lot of hurt on both our ends. 

i went through some emails we’ve been sending each other the last two years.  i’ve done a lot of self-growth over the last few years both mentally and physically. i ended up making a note on my phone of all the times he’s told me he’s proud of me. and these are two that he’s said to me that mean the most in the last six months.

-i’m very proud of you for the progress you’ve made with your personal and social development.  your progress is very much out there and much appreciated honestly.  way to go - and i can appreciate that it hasn’t been easy for you.

-you’ve come a long way, you know

i have apologized to him and held myself accountable for how my words and actions hurt him over the last couple of years before we started talking again in 2019. he’s proud of the amount of progress i’ve made with both therapy and meds the last few years. and i really do hope i continue to do small things that make him proud of me. it really is the small good things some days",DefiantKnowledge1303,"wlfrt3, wlfrt3"

this past week or two i’ve noticed he seems to grow less and less interested. he replies slower, he doesn’t express his affection verbally near as much as he used to, doesnt show much interest when i’m talking and doesn’t laugh with me as much. just doesn’t seem as excited. he used to get so excited when i came home but now he just says hi. he’s not completely disinterested he’s still kinda affectionate, but i can’t help but feel like it’s different. and that he changed so fast in such a short amount of time. 

he’s opened up about his preferences in women, and i’m kinda the opposite of those preferences. i’ve opened up emotionally quite a bit as well and he seems uncomfortable or frozen when i do. he’ll even kinda make jokes about having sex with other women. i’m starting to worry myself and think that maybe now that he’s getting to know me he’s not as attracted to me, and that maybe i was just being lovebombed. but i also tend to overthink things a lot and make things worse than they seem. i wanted to hear what you guys might think, any advice or commentary is appreciated.",Dinkelodeon,1b92zml

188,"Honest question - possibly a long one? okay, let me list out the following:

1. let's say i've been feeling the scope of how much i'm not a priority in people's lives. which, is okay i guess - for the most part - because i'm in a different time zone to most, and they all have families, etc. i think everyone i know prioritises family, and i don't understand that too much, as because of my life, friends mean everything to me. disparity is there, fine. so, i have been quite understanding of less and less contact. but, when i actually ask for help, fight all instinct and thought to tell them maybe i need a bit more monitoring, or more presences...it doesn't really happen. 

2. i am quite tired of being more active in checking in on  them. bridging the gap, as it were. trying to have a chat, etc. it feels all the more difficult because of my mental state. 

3. it has got to a point where the communication with the people i consider friends is more of a surprise when it happens, as opposed to something i can count on. i should say that i don't talk to them about all the bullshit, just want to have the company - so it isn't always a serious conversation. and i always ask, if it is a serious conversation, if they have the space for it, and definitely tell me when it's too much, which they have done. 

4. i'm feeling the old need to distance myself from people. i am in a bad place, so i am aware that it might just be a symptom showing up. but, at the same time, is it a bad thing? if a need is not being met, and i am counting on it, isn't it better if i learn distance again, and just get by on my own? like i am left to do anyway, feeling that much more alone and isolated? 

5. i guess my question is, is my thinking so skewed that it's a terrible idea to take some quiet time from everyone? i mean, i have already told them that if i am quiet for 3 days, that they should probably reconnect because of what i just recently learnt about emotional permanence and the other thing. i have no reason to think they'll do it, and it's usually me who thinks i should do it so i don't delve deeper into my aloneness.

190,"Should I let go or should I stay? my girlfriend with bpd (19f) and i (24m) have only been dating for 2-3 months. the 1st month was bliss and we would be together for a couple of days every week. she was open, affectionate and available. but i’ve felt that after our first trip, she’s been cold and distant. 
it started as saying she can’t text, can’t call, then she can’t stay over anymore, can’t see me on the weekends. holidays rolled in and i’d only get a text/call every other 2-3 days. she would tell me that she’s busy so frequently even during the holidays, she would often say that she needs time alone which i’ve always respected. when i brought up that i felt she’s been drifting away, she told me that i can leave if her schedule doesn’t work for me, i’m taken aback by how reluctant she is to meet me in the middle. she would be the most responsive when she needed to borrow money and/or having a terrible day.

having dealt with family problems on top, i snapped(in text) and told her that she doesn’t do anything for me even when i try to be there for her when she needs it. i apologized the next day having realized that i snapped while she was in class. she told me that she’s on the fence about our relationship, and that when people snap they mean what they say.
after i apologized, she told me she needed time alone. i haven’t been the best at this as i kept asking about ground rules for example, if we’re still exclusive; to which i would get the same answer, she needs time alone. 
because of the lack of something concrete between us, i told her that i won’t message until the weekend only to check on her but also that i’m open if ever she messages first.
we’re having minimal contact now and it’s just me checking up on her as she got covid recently. weekend is up and i’ve been letting her now how sorry i feel for her, that i’m here if she needs me but she’s mostly replying in one words and gets irritable (which she does so often now, but were so talkative in the beginning of the relationship).

i’ve been reading about bpd ever since she brought it up on the first date, and it seems to me that she’s splitting (i really don’t know).
a couple of days back i’ve realized that i can’t really pin my reason to stay on the hopes that the person i’ve met in the beginning would come back. and that i need more communication and physical affection in a relationship, which we’ve been lacking.
i’ve held off in calling her, and/or texting her about this as right now she’s in the hospital. it seems cruel to drop it when she’s the most isolated and vulnerable.
i’ve sent her “i’m here if you need me, get well soon” messages, but i don’t know how to break it off with her or if i should stay in the relationship and wait for her to “come back around”.

i thought i met the guy of my dreams a few months back and we talked non-stop, enjoyed dates together, made plans. after so many shitty relationships and guys, i thought i lucked out. 

i get depression episodes and i've been getting better at getting through them. i was so scared to open up to him but i realised i needed to when i was in the middle of an episode 

i told him what i've been diagnosed with, mentioned my ptsd is from a previous relationship (absolutely no further details) and even though i'm working hard at getting better, i still have my off days. 

i tried to keep it as vague as possible and didn't trauma dump him either.

he messaged me on christmas day weeks later wishing me a merry christmas then radio silence again.

then about a week later i see on his fb he's in a relationship with another girl. i don't know this girl but from the photos on the post she's drop dead gorgeous

first of all, i'm not diagnosed but i have many bpd traits and i'm currently seeking treatment and responses about my mental health through professional help

so... sometimes, mostly when i'm in the middle of a crisis, when i look myself in the mirror i do not recognize myself. there are situations when i even feel like my mind is outside of my body and i can watch things from outside. but today it was a little bit different. i woke up feeling empty and down, so i took a bath to see if it'd level up my mood. after it, when i looked myself in the mirror, naked and with my hair wet, it was like i was looking at my most ethereal form. i didn't saw the properties of my appearance that make me the person i am, my personality. it was almost like i was looking at my spirit: genderless and no material related personality traits... it was like only my conscience and my spirit was there in my reflection.

did any of you went through something like that? i'd appreciate any comments sharing your experiences.

p.s.: i think it's relevant to say that i am a very spiritual person and i'm actually a medium, so idk rather this episode is related to my mental health issues or to my spirituality.",DyslexicGhoul,pb0btz

it's a mood stabilizer and i've never taken one before, so i don't know what i should be looking out for in terms of affects? i am experiencing worse than usual low moods and anxiety. i also couldn't sleep last night and i woke up about 7 times. i had one of the worst episodes i've had in awhile, to the point where i was feeling suicidal. i practically blew up on my boyfriend and he had to talk to me down. granted i did forget to take it one day but it's such a low dose and i haven't been taking it for that long i didn't think it would make a difference that drastic if i missed a day.

tldr: i had a messy breakup and now i don’t know what to do because they’ve changed so much and i no longer know where i stand or what i should do. 

i’ve had three serious relationships and they all had the same blueprint. i wasn’t really interested, they confessed, i gave it a shot, i fell in love, my mental illness(es) (depression, anxiety, bpd, the full works) hurt the relationship, messy breakup, they end up hating me, the blame falls on me (though to be honest they weren’t angels either by the end of it). 

all of my exes were (imo or to the best of my memory) really sweet and innocent and i really truly loved them but after the breakup they all changed to the point where i don’t recognise them anymore. like it feels like i didn’t even know who they were, and now that i see them again (irl or on social media) it’s like ??? were you always like that? were you like that when we were together? 

i don’t know if it’s worth mentioning but all of them relied on me in some sort of way wrt mental health (talking them down from panic attacks, helping them figure out how to handle anxiety/depression) because i’ve had a shitshow time with mental illness so i handle it well and i handle their breakdowns well but when it comes to my breakdowns, they can’t handle it no matter how much they promise to stay or stick it through with me. i can handle myself but it most often means shutting down and well consensus is that people dont really enjoy being shut out (which i completely understand). 

am i just fucking these people up like i’m so guilty for what i’ve done (breaking up with them or generally allowing my mental illness to ruin the relationship) even though i rationally know that they didnt exactly do everything right either. 

what hurts the most now is that i still very much love my most recent ex and i know leaving them alone is the best for them, but i still really want to work things out and i want to tell them that i’m really fucking trying my best to be a better person for them but they’ve changed so much like i don’t know what to do anymore because it seems like they’ve moved on. but the last i remember we agreed we were on a break. i really dont want to reach out and ask them about it when i’m not ready yet bc then it’s just another round of hurt for them and if they’ve already moved in then i should just stay away. i’m really just i don’t know i already hate myself enough i don’t know what else i can do to punish myself or let them know that i really am sorry for how things turned out.",ElectricalString1577,1cd5hqa

218,"BPD barely existant outside of relationship hi! so i got diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 2 years ago, and my doctor very loosely said i could have bpd as i suggested it, and now im actually getting an appointment to be tested for it thursday. since that day 2 years ago, i've been paying attention to my symptoms. i even explained it to my ex gf, and she tried understanding me more because my bpd/behavior was basically controlling our relationship.

my bpd ""traits""/all of the symptoms emerged a little after i got into a relationship with my now ex-gf (it was super tough to leave but after like 40 breakups within 3 years, it broke off for good). im guessing because of all the trauma, cheating, lying, she did which made my mind completely fucked... bpd, relationship ptsd idk

anyways, its like a checklist with how spot-on everything is considering bpd. when i found out about bpd, i felt so much relief, despite it being the worst thing to ever come into my life. i believe i have genetic predisposition to bpd and that trauma from my relationship ""woke"" it up??

my worry/tldr: my symtpoms have since mellowed out ever since our relationship ended... and since im getting tested for bpd this thursday, i feel like an asshole/really anxious/upset bc theyre nearly gone now.

question: has your bpd mainly/only showed in relationships? mine practically emerged from mine

i guess its good im getting tested anyways to get help in general, and it can help with my future relationship too. im just hoping i get an answer and since bpd (most likely) has been controlling my life for a while, it'd be upsetting to say the least, if it wasnt bpd all along. i know bpd can get confused for quite a bit of other things, but i know how certain i am with this",EmLee-96,"168360n, 168360n, 168360n"

i have been dating an amazing girl for 11 months now. i suspect she has bpd. last august, she lost her brother (who she described as her father figure), and since then has been unstable. 

last december, she pressured me saying that we cannot continue the relationship without a future, and that if i'm not planning to propose, she would not continue talking to me. so last week i decided to propose. she said that she has to think, because she's not sure about our characters compatibility. when i told her that this was a no, and that i'd rather break up and move-on; she didn't let me go, and said that she didn't say no, that she still loves me, and she was happy to see me. 

i am disoriented and confused. before proposing, when i used to call her, i found her talking late at night on the phone. she swore and promised that it was her sister, but i still have trust issues. my friends shame me for accepting such a bad situation, because ""obviously you're her plan b"".

here's the catch: i don't really like people that much. i don't find them interesting. i'm an introvert and i prefer to spend time alone. however, my mom died when i was only 10 years old. so maybe that made me afraid? i'm scared of the mask mandate being dropped because then my coworkers will see my ugly face for the first time. i might even quit my job when that happens and look for another one. i hate the idea of someone thinking i look a certain way, and then being disappointed when i take the mask off.

my understanding is that psychologists only help you talk through things. but what if you need a diagnosis? they cannot diagnose or treat with meds, only psychiatrists can. 

so will the therapist (psychologist) just refer you out if they think you need more? i don’t want to pay for 2 initial consults because they can be quite expensive, but i also do not want to assume i am going to need a diagnosis.

236,"not sure what to do hey! i don’t normally make posts or anything but i’m really worried and i’m not sure where else to find help… i have this internet friend that i’ve gotten really close to in the past year, and we like each other romantically but haven’t set a label to it. a few months ago she told me that she has bpd and since then it’s helped me understand her a bit better… i’ve been trying to research a lot so it can help in case things go back but it looks like i still have a bit of trouble. things have been a little more bumpy than usual since the year started… last night was perfectly fine, it was really good actually, and this morning too. but one thing led to another and she suddenly told me that she thinks we need a break. 

i’m not sure… i asked her if this was just a bad day and she told me that wasn’t the case. i have no idea what to do because… did she really want me to go? did she want to push and keep me away? and i don’t know whether i should actually stay away or push back. i’m worried that i’ll mess up even more. i know that i want to stick with her for as long as i can.

i really love her a lot so this is really tough but i know that she must be feeling a lot worse than i am… she’s really strong and i care for her so much. i’m kind of heartbroken. i keep thinking… maybe she does mean what she says about me. i always try to be patient with her so i haven’t snapped before… she normally reaches out to me again eventually whenever she gets a bit mad at me? is this the same case? because it seems more serious than usual. after she told me she wanted a break i told her that i’ll always be here.

i’d appreciate it if anyone replied with advice or their perspective of things… or anything that can help me understand better. i thought maybe she’s having a splitting episode but i don’t want to assume anything wrong… i’m pretty worried so i hope things can be solved. i want to do my best for her. thank you!",Expensive-Willow-570,1092tji

my psychiatrist try to make me say i am angry, but i’m not. i’m rarely angry, i’m just sad and hurt. that’s the feeling i struggle with the most. she acknowledged that the test results show i had ptsd growing up and events in my adulthood that would lead to ptsd.

what is it that makes you sure you’ve got the right diagnosis? 

i think i have cptsd and insecure attachment (anxious), making me so vulnerable and afraid to being abandoned. i don’t have that rage and throwing things or hating on people. my symptoms only show up in close romantic relationships.

262,"Question regarding cheating with BPD hi there -

i (22m) don’t have bpd but i’m asking about cheating because i found out my (now) ex boyfriend (22m) with bpd cheated on me throughout the course of our relationship of just under a year with many other people. 

naturally, i got upset and upon finding out broke up with him but since he has messaged me saying things like it’s because of his bpd that he was trying to sabotage the relationship and provoke me to break up with him to punish himself and also that it was meant to liberate me from the relationship because he doesn’t deserve me.

i’m also upset because i found out he cheated earlier in the relationship. it destroyed me and we had a lot of conversations about it - i thought it was a one time thing and expressed to him that if it happens again i’d leave. at the time he also blamed it on his bpd saying he was “testing himself” or something like that and i worked really hard with him to regain my trust in him. however since, i’ve come to learn that he was just manipulating me and continuing to serially cheat. whenever i’d ask him about a guy because he was acting suspect he would be so great at talking to me and putting my mind at ease when in reality my suspicions have turned out to have always been correct.  

my question is does this make sense? i don’t want to believe it’s all due to his bpd because he never told me about the cheating (i found out from a third party and proceeded to look at his phone) and it was continuous throughout the relationship so i can’t imagine he ever actually intended on telling me. 

long story short i’m just confused and ultimately don’t want to believe that this was just a symptom of bpd because he’s blaming everything on his diagnosis and making himself the victim. in my mind i find it hard to believe that he would betray me so much and so willingly to provoke me or free me when he was actively hiding it from me - it feels like he’s just using his diagnosis as a scapegoat for getting caught and had no intention of ever telling me about his infidelity - like he wanted the comfort of our relationship (which on all other accounts was actually quite stable and felt fulfilling and interesting on my part) while also sleeping with other people on the side.

267,"I see so many articles about ""dealing with someone with bpd"" but not any for the one who has it when their partner uses it against them? i'm not sure he even realizes he does it. since it's been put out there, i feel like he uses it to explain irrelevant things or invalidate me when i'm upset because it's just the potential of bpd? 

when i am venting about trauma, he has the tendency to say some invalidating things. we had a conversation recently where i wasn't too upset, wasn't crying, just felt a bit clingy and vocalized that. he made a comment that my childhood couldn't have been all that bad and some other things he thought were comforting. they were not. i told him ""you might think you're helping me, but you are not. please stop"". instead of stopping he felt he needed to explain his reasoning. i, again, told him ""you're making me mad. stop"". this ended up being a whole argument, he just ""didn't want me to spiral"". despite the fact i was clearly communicating and rational prior to him not listening or respecting when i asked him to stop. 

i am so tired of having my emotions weoponized against me when he is just acting like a jerk or insensitive. i dont know how to make him realize he's doing this to me.

275,"New fp + my BPD backstory i thought i was safe from having another favorite person for a while after i got over my ex-boyfriend, which took months to do and required so much hard work pushing him out of my everyday thoughts and so on. it was two days before my birthday when i basically forced myself to be completely over him, knowing it would ruin my birthday if i woke up expecting a ""hbd"" text and didn't end up getting one. it ended up being the first birthday for as long as i can remember where i didn't sob uncontrollably for no particular reason. for some reason the night before, i decided to take one of my friends along with me to meet this guy who she was friends with after we'd exchanged a few texts about potentially seeing each other individually since we had so many mutual friends. as the night progressed, i began to realize how attracted to him i was, which i tend not to take lightly because of how rare it is for me to catch genuine feelings for someone. on a regular day, i'll feel completely asexual until months later i'll randomly meet someone and start to like them. a lot. like to the point where they are all i think about and i become completely obsessed. anyways, we haven't seen each other since then. but he is now without a doubt my new favorite person and has been for almost a month. i once had an fp last for going on three years, and it wasn't fun. i mean, to say the least. i turned down almost every advance i received, even if i did like the person i was getting romantic attention from, it felt as if i was betraying him even though we hadn't spoken in years and he expressed no interest in getting back together with me. i lived my life every day feeling like he was watching me, and could hear everything i said including my internal thoughts. any time i would say something slightly embarrassing even if it was to myself when no one was around, the phrase would repeat in my head until i felt complete and utter shame due to the fact that it always felt like he was watching over me, judging me. i experienced the same thing with my most recent favorite person, and the second i realized it was recurring with the guy i like now, i kind of started to freak out. because we barely know each other. i told him i found him attractive and he seemed excited to go out with me, but for some yet-to-be-discovered reason, i always tend to catch feelings for extremely mentally ill people. like myself, i guess. i thought he was perfectly well, which caused me to mask my true personality in order to seem healthier for him, but he dropped the bomb on me that he went into a depressive episode and doesn't want to accidentally push me away because of how overwhelmed he would get when getting to know someone while feeling like this. i don't know what to do because i am in need of constant reassurance, and i cannot expect that from someone who i recently found out doesn't even consider what we have to be a talking stage. i don't wanna lose feelings for him, as freeing as it would be, this feels so innocent and better for me than any other relationship i've been in. i just want him to feel the same and be expressive of it. i feel so trapped. sucking in my stomach even when no one is looking and feeling like i need to look cute while brushing my teeth because i feel as if he is watching my every move like he's god or something is so dehumanizing even though in a way, i am doing this to myself. sorry if that was rambly and all over the pace but anyone who understands what i am trying to say, can you offer me any help? what advice do i need in order to stop my life from revolving around this?",FuzzAway7,1cra8gn

i... i had a really bad point last semester where my insomnia got so bad i went into the hospital for 5 days... i hadn't been diagnosed by then as borderline but it was so horrible; it left me traumatized and my eating disorder (which was getting bad) literally got boosted. i lost 5 pounds in those days. they treated us pretty shitty in there. there was not even a threshold of control over my life and i was losing it. the stress was so big that they put me under the highest dose of temazepam and i still didn't sleep through the night.... i pretend shit was find to get the fuck out of there. and then. after a few days i finally could sleep a bit. drug-heavy sleep, but sleep!!!!!! i was so happy!!!! and it was ok for a few days, even weeks. then the stress lowered and then went up. fast forward a few weeks i started getting sick because of the medication. the dose was too much for my body but there was nothing i could do but wait for the next appointment with my psychiatrist &amp; psychologist. the same ones who were like ""u don't have bpd lol, we've been treating you for years, we would have known"" 🤠

why do i tell you this???? well. my insomnia has been getting bad again and the stress is really getting to me so the medication is not enough. it's really hard for me to go about life these days. my ibs acts up when it wants to. can't fucking sleep.

also!!!! i went to my new psychiatrist and they basically told me to only use clonazepam/klonopin for like when i feel like i really need it. i've been on that medication for years and have used it pretty steadily every single day and it's pretty shitty because my body is like ""gkwkkfkakckwkdiss"". she told me to used dbt skills instead to cope if i can and i just feel so distressed!!!!! there's nothing i can do!!! she also suspects i might have ocd???? wtf really wtf

this so hard on me, and i can't rely on telling her that. i feel like im just needy and dependent on her. so i try to just keep it to myself. but as this goes on, i just feel myself splitting. i convince myself that i don't care, and i try not to go around and send her random messages along the day. slowly i fade into  reality (or at least what i make of it) that she is just ignoring me. i get annoyed and i tell her. i feel ashamed of chasing her response and coming around needy...

this repeats through out the times this happens (around a few days at a time). as i express more and more how i don't like that she is distant, the shittier the situation gets. i feel like and absolute ahole for having to remind her of me.

this fades away as she understands we are in fact distant, and things shouldn't be this way. we get to talk as normal. 

this leads me into a few days of doubt and i feel hesitant to message her. i hate this feeling.

deep down i understand that she is busy studying, family, sleeping(as she does short naps throughout the day). but i just can't really deal with my emotions in the short term and tend to close myself. going through it rn and it sucks, i'm in the phase of ignoring her messages after saying that i felt she was being distant (im in shame tbh). 

feeling great despite of that. i'm looking foward to my next appointment as i feel like i'm doing so much progress. just feeling anxious because of uni, no biggie, had worse. and 1 month sober after my last heavy relapse. 

wish you all happy a happy week. thanks for coming to my ted rant.

tldr: sometimes girlfriend gets distant and i have an hard time dealing with it.",GothicBland,1cltbvl

yesterday i told him that i might have a mild crush and he said he was feeling the same. today he has been ignoring me for a greater portion of the day. at first i thought he might have fallen asleep because he told me he hardly got any sleep last night because of work. after 4 hours i asked him if he was still sleeping. another 3 hours after that i told him that it was a shame i didn’t really hear a lot from him today as he had assured me yesterday and this morning. then i saw that he was online for a couple of minutes but got no answer. a while later i asked him to not ignore me and told him if he was busy he just needed to say the word and it would be okay. same procedure with him being online but the. going offline again, but he keeps ignoring me. then i got really mad and told him that it was apparently not important to him and that he hurt my feelings. then i deleted the chat and his number.

of course i still just want him to answer me. but what i want even more is not to feel like a worthless little girl. when will this stop? most of my symptoms are gone after i went to therapy. i can regulate emotions way better than in earlier points of my life. but i feel like i will always look for validation in others and not getting it is so painful. especially from someone i started to like. i just wish i knew why i‘m suddenly being treated like this, i don’t see an apparent reason why he would do that besides from “he doesn’t like me after all”.",Griffinwolf2022,18j7v6i
295,"My BPD diagnosis confuses people who aren’t psychiatrists telling people that i have bpd causes more confusion than clarity - even among therapists that i’ve had. apparently my flavor of bpd is uncommon. i wish that there was a clearer label than ‘bpd’ that i could use to communicate to people.

i know that there are a few labels for bpd subtypes. ‘quiet borderline’ would most likely to apply to me simply because i appear calm on the outside. the idea behind ‘quiet borderline’ is that they have similar emotions to other borderlines but that those emotions are directed inward. i don’t think that this describes me either.

there are hundreds of permutations of bpd symptoms (if you use the dsm4 criteria). so of course there will be people who have bpd who are different. one of the consequences of having an uncommon flavor of bpd is that i often doubt whether i even have bpd. i’ve thought about this a lot and i can’t come to a decision.",GroundbreakingEcho47,1b92zml

the thing is when he comes back, he's always super casual and acts like no time has passed and nothing bad transpired between us. i would love any insight on this situation. is it a memory issue? is he just pretending everything is okay in hopes that i will too? something else?

301,"In response to a comment about splitting there was a post by someone asking how they can be more supportive of their pwbpd. reading thru the comments, i came across one that i just wanted to respond to because it's something i struggle with and feel strongly about. i'd like to get some feedback on this if you dont mind.

the comment was giving advice about how to handle splitting. the pwobpd suggested that when an episode arises and the pwbpd starts attacking verbally to ""learn when to...just ignore and let it blow over."" i don't want to use the wrong term and offend, and i'm definitely not saying it doesn't work sometimes, but i think that mindset is lacking emotional intelligence and very unhelpful if not highly damaging to both people.

splitting in bpd is something i don't think most people really understand. overreacting, spitefulness, being an evil psycho bitch, that's what it looks like. but it's not just getting mad and getting even, and it's so much more complicated than black and white thinking. it's the reaction to intense and confusing negative emotions, to feeling persecuted, betrayed, neglected, abandoned. it's so much more than feeling disappointed, let down, ignored, criticized. it's feeling broken and lost and alone. it's hopelessness and frustration that builds into a frenzied desperation to get it out to make it stop to...make it go away by giving it back. it's a culmination of grief, resentment and fear that's directed outward. 

the things that come out of our mouths during an episode.... i have said some really vile, disgusting shit that makes me sick when i think about it. the cruelty and hatefulness i've unleashed on people that i love is something that i'll never forgive myself for. some of them tried to believe me when i apologized, tried to believe that i didn't mean any of it, that it wasn't me but the bpd. but patience wears thin, confidence starts to fade, trust gets broken, love is lost. the willingness and ability to forgive diminish because the disrespect can't be forgotten. splitting can be incredibly destructive because it hurts both people. it's easy to see the damage caused by the pwbpd, but i don't think many realize, understand or really care about how deeply it affects us. 

in a recent relationship, my fp wouldn't feed into my bullshit when i was splitting, he expected it and would wait til i stopped. but the only thing that stopped was the outward expression. i internalized the grief, resentment and fear, added guilt, shame and self-loathing. i hated myself for hurting him when he was trying to understand and accept and love me. i hated myself for loving him when he was causing me to feel that way. it started a chain reaction of self-sabotage. my fears that he would get tired of it and leave brought on crazy paranoia, the thought that he could leave me when i obviously needed him more than ever caused anger that made words not enough. i did a lot of things that i am ashamed of, i lost a lot of respect for myself, i damaged myself. i lost someone who had given me so much, i destroyed pieces of him that he'll never get back, i hurt him in ways that changed him into someone he didn't want to be. 

this is why treatment and therapy are so so important for both people in a bpd relationship. trying to not take everything someone says personal is good advice, but what if they take it personal? ignoring the problem, thinking it'll just blow over and eventually get better doesn't help anyone. without treatment living with bpd is like being stuck in a tar pit, the more you struggle the faster you sink and anyone who tries to help without the right tools will fall in and sink too, and you'll be stuck in the darkness, separated from everyone and everything, and so will they. it's important to know the tools and how to use them to help someone climb out and make sure you're both okay after. 

when it comes to questions about how to deal with bpd in any way, the only answer should be treatment.",Haunted-Hemlock,1bzhjuy

304,"If you ever feel alone in your diagnosis… just remember pete davidson also has bpd. 

you can have amazing relationships with people, and even be a celebrity with bpd. 

there is literally nothing you can’t do, please please don’t let this stand in your way. 

it’s hard and it fucking sucks, but we all have the power to overcome this shit.

they don’t call it remission for a reason, 
 it’s the psychiatric cancer. 

if people are leaving your life and not coming back because of your bpd, then they’re just terrible people. good people understand why you acted the way you did — you may have hurt them yes, but this is different then intentionally inflicting pain. they may take space from you, but they should not write you off because of symptoms which at times you basically can’t control at all. 

our disorder and pain are hard to understand because they are invisible. you don’t where the pain exactly comes from or how to make it stop. physical illness can at least pinpoint a body part or a physical descriptor (as those are more objective).

my advice to all of you is to tell your friends, a professor, or trusted person, call a hotline or tell a stranger, write on here, other subreddits, start a podcast i don’t care, just talk about it. you can be anonymous, you can be a quiet supporter, hell you can donate $1 a year to a bpd foundation for all i care. 

the more we speak about this disorder to people until they widely (or at least half decently) understand how bpd (and did, bipolar, and other mood/personality disorders) works, manifests, and hurts ourselves and others. people do not know the strength it takes to walk every day living like this. i think we can all agree that it feels like we are living in a forever hell.

apologize for your symptoms, often. thank those who help you along, tell people what may or may not happen. hope for the best, prepare for the worst. don’t shy away from this. because the more we do the more it consumes us. 

we are our own best advocates. the more people know, the more they will be able to help. 

we have to fight for awareness and visibility. 

you are not alone. 
we are not alone. 

we just need everyone to know is that sometimes all we know is how to be alone. 

loneliness is our biggest cry for help. 

mental health is getting so much more attention and importance placed onto it every passing day, and we deserve to be a part of that increased awareness. 

we deserve love, compassion, laughs, hugs, smiles, happy thoughts, and eyes always looking up towards our futures.

we can do it, we can make a world that will be more kind to those who suffer with bpd.

knowing her she’s the kind to avoid confrontations, and i missed her, so i decided to just pretend nothing happen - last week i sent her a random pic of this pen i got her last year (our inside joke but never had a chance tk pass to her). she didn’t reply. so yesterday i texted her casually asking her to go to the movies saying i’ve extra tickets, and lightheartedly said let’s go next week! 

she simply replied “nope i don’t want to go”.

ouchhhhhhhh……… i don’t usually get close to peolle and the few friends i have i cherish. but i’m not sure what has happened here.

i don’t wish to confront her either knowing she won’t reciprocate - and this has triggered my abandonment issues so bad. abrupt as it may seem (since nth happened) deep inside i knew that maybe she was tired of me and this was accumulated. maybe i’m just too much for her.

reminded me of the times when she used to just “disappear” when i get emotional (such as going through a breakup etc) but i always told myself that it’s fine, perhaps she just hates such emotional situations and she’s always there when i needed real help.

but to just turn her back completely on me right now.. :’(

320,"Some insight? i made this account recently. might not be able to reply to comments. me and my ex broke up about 6 weeks ago. together for 6 years. married for 4. and we have a child together. she's broken up with me numerous times over the years. and there was almost always another man involved during the course of our break ups that pretty much never lasted more then 3 or 4 weeks. this times a little different and i'm a little worried. 

she moved on immediately after the break up. which honestly i'm used to. but it's ramped up quite a bit. she's been with him just over a month, planning on moving in together, and she's actively trying to get pregnant. since i've met her she seems to have a small episode every 4 to 6 weeks. and every 6 to 12 months it's a much larger, world turning upsidedown event. 

her and i (moreso me) really started digging into what bpd is during our last breakup about 4 months ago. she was going to start working on herself but didn't follow through. shes throughly convinced what she's doing is in no way bpd related, she won't regret it and knows what she's doing. but she's always said that. i've been trying to be as supportive in what she's up to as much as i can but i'm afraid she's spiralling out of control and i'm just letting it happen. 

i mean she does seem happy. and i know there's nothing i can actually do. i don't even know what i'm looking to get out of this post because i'm pretty powerless in making her see things from the outside looking in. but at the same time it seems like enough time has come and gone and if it was another episode she would have snapped out of it by now. she's been pretty consistent the last 6 weeks minus a couple unexpected behaviors. i just want her to be ok and not ruin her life.",Hungry_Mud8196,182ugt9

i was wondering if anyone has experience dealing with roommates who are happier when you’re not around? i know it’s typical for us to believe people are happier without us, but ever since i started shutting myself off from them (around a week ago) i hear so much laughter in the communal areas, people are more active in the group chat, and one person who almost never leaves their room is almost always in the communal area. i could go on for concrete examples of how this isn’t just my bpd saying they like it when i’m not there, but i think you get the point.

i just feel so alone in my room, but in a way i’ve never felt before; it’s a different type of loneliness when i can hear them laughing when they wouldn’t if i were there. i try to get out of the house but the acknowledgment that i’m running from the problem doesn’t come long after.

so i have this person i really like, and these past few months i’ve been back and forth between absolutely hating them, like everything they do makes me hate them and i don’t even want to talk to them, and then an hour or so or even days later i’ll love them again. this happens with everyone i talk to, but mostly my online friends since those are the only friends i have. but even though it happens with everyone, it happens the strongest with that one person. i feel so bad but i can’t help it. 

another thing i do is cry, and i always cried all the time before but now it seems i do it more often. my mood is constantly either super great or i feel so down.  it feels different from what my depression usually makes me feel. my depression does that but now i feel manic and i’ve been doing things such as stabbing my blankets and laughing while crying i just feel so off.

then slowly i felt everything start to revolve around this person. i lost friends, i stopped pursuing hobbies, and i forgot about my interests. sometimes it kinda felt like almost everything was just in pursuit of spending time with them. the issue was they were happy to spend all the time in the world with me, but it kinda felt like they started to thrive from it, while i just kinda stagnated.

anyway i had a bit of a crisis a few months ago and broke up with them. i've never felt so hollow in my life. the only way i can describe it is feeling like an empty puppet. i still have all these external and superficial qualities i had before, but there's nothing driving me inside if that makes sense. every time i try and pick up an old interest there's no real spark.

i need to rebuild myself but i don't know how. i'm at uni and the workload is quite intense, and it feels like there's no time left over to work on myself. but then when i've got nothing to do i just kinda wallow. what doesn't help is that this person is still this perfect figure in my mind and all i can think about is how much i want them back.

337,"This cycle is terrible i'm having a really rough time. once, a while ago, i had a great relationship that fell apart pretty suddenly. they handled it poorly, i handled it poorly, and in the end because i didn't know how to handle it properly, they were able to convince everyone of our mutual friends (every friend i has at the time) that the lies they spread about me were true. i lost everyone. now i'm in this terrible cycle. i'll get a friend, allow myself to care about them, then if something changes or starts to differ from how it was, like all friendships do, my mind will make me think they have secret resentment for me or are starting to dislike me. they'll then get annoyed by me asking about it, which will cause me to worry even more and cause my worries to become more frequent until eventually the whole friendship falls apart. it's a self fulfilling prophecy of a cycle where each time reinforces the next. it feels awful every time, but worse is the effect it has on the people i cared about. it's horrible seeing how frustrated, angry and upset the whole cycle makes them. and i can't even tell them how sorry i am because i can't stop these things from getting worse instead of better after every talk we have about it. 

i've been through 4 of these cycles and am now at the close of the fifth. this person is the best friend i've ever had. we only knew each other for a year, but we became very close quite quickly. she did more for me and put up with more from me than anyone could ever be expected to. we supported eachother through hard times and laughed through great times. she's an amazing person who deserves a friend so much better than me and i love her so much. maybe it was the speed at which we became friends, but i've been worried for a while that we'd fall apart just as quickly. and sure enough, my mind jumped at the opportunity to make me panic and soon, the talks we had to reassure me got more and more frequent to the point where it was an every day occurrence. soon, she started to feel like i was blaming her for things she didn't do and eventually she was just tired of the whole thing. and somehow, the worst part for me is that she still cares about me even through all of this and i can't stop making it worse. the only thing that would stop it is to do nothing, but every day of that causes me nothing but stress and anxiety. i just want things to go back to how they were before i stopped believing the friendship was stable and before she had to worry about being careful about literally everything she said around me. we just recently had a huge argument that lead to us not seeing each other for a week. part of me is hoping that this will give me a chance to refocus and maybe make things better next time we talk, but part of me is worried that either she'll realize how much easier things are without the constant need to worry about me, or that i'll feel like we're more distant than ever when this is over and not be able to handle the change. i want to be better, i want to make things better between us, but mostly, i want to stop causing the most genuinely kind and wonderful person i know, the person who i fully believe most deserves happiness, to be without it so often.

347,"Going to therapy this Wednesday and I’m Terrified i haven’t been to therapy in a while. last time i saw one i got the feeling she was just downright lazy, because she would never do or recommend anything. my two other therapists before that one were ok, but i didn’t feel like i got much out of it.
recently my dad’s insurance switched because he got a new job, which means we had to switch psychiatrists because i’m still on his insurance. the new psychiatrist listened to me explain my past and at the end she very urgently suggested i see a therapist asap, and got me booked with one in her same office.
i’m very nervous. first of all because i rely on my medication to help me with adhd, and i’m afraid they’re gonna talk to each other to find a reason to get me off my meds or try something different when what i’m on has been working just fine. things like this have happened to me before.
i’m also just really terrified of opening up. even answering some basic questions about my past with the psychiatrist yesterday made me want to cry. i have finally achieved some level of stability by working through my problems on my own, with reassurance and support from my partner. i don’t want some random lady digging into my past and making my life harder by having me remember shit when i’m not ready. i hate that about therapists. they act as if it’s some kind of special relationship. bitch i’m fucking paying you. and you will forget me the second i stop paying you. also, from my experience they just sit there and expect me to do all the talking? like homie i can fucking write in a diary if i wanted to monologue. how about you actually give me answers when i ask you questions instead of making vague statements that are supposed to mimic support? 
as you can see i have a bit of residual anger left from my previous experiences. i do respect the therapy profession, even tho it may not seem like it in this post. my sister has had some amazing therapists and she herself is working towards becoming one. so i’m not hateful towards all therapists. i’m just scared. i don’t want to do it. i don’t want to remember things. i don’t want to feel pain anymore. nowadays when i feel pain, i can manage it, because it’s measured at my own pace. but if i have to talk about it all with a therapist, it can make my life harder when i leave the therapist’s office. because i have to work. i have shit to do. i don’t wanna have to leave work bc i’m having a breakdown bc my therapist and i decided to talk about my relationship with my parents that morning",IrascibleOnion,182ugt9

349,"I know I'm handling this appropriately, but hooooly moly is self-doubt a thing. my kid attended a 4 day leisure program a few weeks back over the break. she struggled when she was there, but i was being told conflicting things. for example, one person said she had covered her ears and screamed a couple times during the morning while another said she had been hysterical all day. i was told she had a great day one day and the next day i was told that she had been crying every single day she had been there. i was obviously upset to learn this at the end of the week and said that i needed a clear picture, please.

i talked to someone in management when the staff were unable to provide me with a written copy of what had been happening and the write up i was permitted to see only and not copy was full of ambiguity and conflicting information any way. the manager was helpful and we came up with a plan -- they would get me a quick little write up of the week's happenings so that i could bring it forward to a doc or counselor to get my kiddo the supports she may need since we are only just getting her in to social settings like this as the pandemic eases up. she has special needs, so now is when we can see what sensory and attention issues are happening, and i want to make sure we can provide her with what she needs to be comfortable and succeed in what she wants to pursue in life. this is the second time she has struggled during a drop-off recreational program- different companies- so i know that we should be looking at what is going on or at least be tracking it. 

i have left four voicemails over three weeks since, and i was finally answered to be told that they needed another 6 days to provide me the information due to staff absence. i've heard nothing since, so i left another voicemail with the manager reminding them that my daughter's doc appointment was coming up- something i mentioned when we spoke... and nothing. so i've left a voice mail with the owner. and i am stressed. 

i know that i have been handling this well. i've been making sure that i'm keeping my correspondences polite and to the point. i keep saying that i understand times are chaotic right now with the pandemic. i've explained that i just want a timeline of when this information will be available to me so that i can book the appropriate appointment with my daughter's pediatrician. i've had one come and go already. i paid the doc just to let her know that information will be coming because my daughter had a very rough time in a social setting. 

it's just so frustrating because i am doubting myself constantly, and my paranoia is flaring huge. i'm scared they're going to throw us out of the other programs she and i attend through them. i'm scared that because we pay a subsidized amount that they are going to treat me rudely. i'm scared of... i don't know. everything? so i just want to walk away from this because the unfairness of this is making me want to explode in rage and i just... don't want to bpd all over the place, you know? but i need to figure out how to remind myself that i'm not wanting to keep myself ""in check"" - i have every right to be pissed off - it's just that i am wanting to stay effective in handling this. and i know i have been, but all that self-doubt makes me spin - why bother the owner anyway? so then i beat on myself for not being mature enough to handle this or causing a big deal when there isn't one... except that i am handling this very, very well... i think... i don't know... and i think this is a big deal. i wish i trusted myself more. frick.",Iwilltakeyourpencil,12xrl1n

351,"People with BPD are not narcissists!! ugh, it just makes me so sick when people say that.  or when people say npd and bpd are cousins. ugh! 

i understand that certain actions we do might look similar, but it's completely different reasons why we do things we do than them.  we dont do things because we have some inflated opinion of ourselves, its the exact opposite of that! we do things because we're insecure and live in fear of our people leaving us everyday! we don't want admiration, we want reassurance to make us feel secure, so we know you won't leave! we don't feel self-important,  we have a lack of emotional permanence so we don't understand bond, so we actually dont feel important to anyone and that's why we seek that reassurance out, because want to know we mean something to you!

for example, i like people who are very clingy and obsessive to me, not because of full of myself and like the attention. its because they makes me feel wanted, it makes me feel secure like they really care about me. if they are this clingy, then they definitely would never leave me! everything ties into that intense fear of abandonment, not arrogance, not narcissism. 

that search for reassurance can be extremely toxic, but that doesn't mean we are narcissists! we are complete opposite of them in mindset. alot of us think we actually don't deserve love and that ties into the fear of abandonment, because why would someone put up with us? that's a question in my mind all the time.

for story context : my parents live next door. they own both apartment complexes, we rent one of them and we haven’t had the best relationship with our upstairs neighbours. it’s a couple of lebanese grandparents that live with their son (25ish? youngest) but since they have lots of grandchildren, family comes and leaves their kids often. results: lots of noise 
they also never shovel. which sucks for canadian winters. the people that lived here before us were the owners, of course you’d expect them to shovel. but here, we’re both renting .. anyway i’ll stop there or i won’t get to my story lol
i was petty after the latest snowstorm , so i shoveled all the stairs and the path to our door. i didn’t shovel their entry.. which isn’t a huge thing either, it was more for the statement that i wanted to leave it 
anyways, i came back to find a mountain of snow on the stairs, im not sure how it happened , but their entry is clear so i was sure it was them
i was certain it was them .. so i threw a huge fit, blasted metalcore (which i’m not very sure they listen often to) and was just yelling.. i called my so, which was at least their to hear me vent .. it calmed me a bit

i’m not sure if anyone has dealt with this or has any advice, but i need some support.

so basically i’ve been vaping for about 6 years. i’m about to turn 20 in less than a month and i’m not trying to go into my 20s with this stupid addiction.
my boyfriend and i decided that we would both quit together while we go long distance for a few months. so the day of his flight was our quit day.
so i quit for about 5 days and then caved today and bought a new vape.
i feel guilty about it, but i was seriously struggling the last 5 days.

the cravings weren’t even that bad, but i couldn’t deal with not having i guess what has been a comfort item and coping mechanism. i started slipping back into old negative habits, like not eating, not taking care of myself, not really doing anything.
it threw me back into who i am in deep depressions. 
i was splitting so hard and having crazy mood swings and yesterday i couldn’t even get myself out of bed to take a piss. it took me until i was literally in tears of pain from holding my bladder to get me out of bed.
so basically, what im hoping for is maybe some tips on how to quit without it turning into that. i’ve worked so hard through all of this covid stuff to become a good person who is in control of her emotions and reactions and be a generally happy person.
in the past 2 years i went from everyday being a 2/10 to everyday being almost a 10/10. there has been so much progress with my bpd and i really really don’t want to lose that over quitting vaping. 
so please, if you’ve gone through this or have any tips on getting rid of a negative coping mechanism, let me know!

he (hasn’t spoken a word to me in weeks) but wrote a draft of a text to send them and wanted to ‘clear it’ by me.
in it he wrote something like ‘we’ve split but we’re on good terms and hope to meet individually…’ 

i impulsively snapped and wrote back “you can take out the ‘on good terms” and then he didn’t respond.

i felt so angry. he hasn’t spoken to me or made an effort at all to know how i’m doing- but to strangers he wants to play pretend that all is good and well. i almost wrote a tirade of text messages echoing this exact sentiment but at the same time something clicked in my brain that said ‘you can be angry and choose not to do anything’.

so i washed my face with cold water in the bathroom and finally just felt that space in between thought and impulse. i can feel anger and still choose not to do anything.

it’s been a full 24 hours and no tirade of text messages yet. pre-dbt me would have cracked at midnight and spent all night writing some intense accusatory letter but post-dbt me is chilling.

374,"Taking break from FP last night, my fp did something that made me split pretty badly. we had been playing video games for like several hours when he told me that he was going to go play something with his other friends. this has happened before and usually it doesn't affect me this bad, but last night was not very good. luckily i didn't freak out at him, but for the rest of the night i was pretty miserable. i don't think it was helped by the fact that throughout our time together, he was talking a lot about his other friends. one of the worst things about me is that i'm a very jealous person, and some days when he talks about his other friends, it makes me terribly jealous. it makes me think that he'd rather be hanging out with them than me. 

anyways, the whole reason i'm writing this is because i need some advice. whenever i get these sort of feelings, i feel the urge to distance myself from him. i know it's a bad coping mechanism for people with bpd, but i also feel it could do me some good to take a few days or a week or however long away, and then return when i'm not feeling as bad. is this a bad way of coping? i did it several months back where i took around a month away and when i returned everything was fine. i'm just scared that if i do it a second time he'll hate me. i think when he left to play with his friends, i may have come across as upset but i'm not sure if he picked up on it and i don't want that to be the last impression. any input would be great.",KingSwagCrab,"1cd5hqa, 1cd5hqa, 1cd5hqa, 1cd5hqa"

377,"Struggling With My FP disclaimer: i haven’t been diagnosed with bpd yet but do exhibit many of the symptoms. i go to therapy to unofficially treat it with dbt and many of the bpd coping mechanisms have helped me tremendously. 

the one thing i still struggle with is the concept of an fp, i have always struggled with these intense attachments to certain people due to my isolated childhood, abandonment, etc… after years of mistakes, i now understand that my intense attachment to these people are not normal thus certain actions i think about should not be taken however it doesn’t dampen my attachment either. 
my current fp is an online friend i met about two years ago. he’s such a kind and wonderful person who i have a lot in common with. a few months ago, i expressed my romantic interest in him and was politely rejected but i can’t seem to get over him. i don’t even think i want him romantically anymore but it’s clear that my emotions are attached his actions. when we talk, i’m happy and feel content but when we aren’t, i desperately crave his attention and start to feel more depressed the longer we don’t speak to each other which i know isn’t normal. 
it’s very confusing because i want him to crave my attention as much as i crave his but proceed to feel disgusted with myself because i know i only feel this way due to mental illness. i want to be his best friend but also know that i probably won’t be more than just “one of his many online pals”. it’s either we are each other’s world or he doesn’t even see as more than passing entertainment he’ll eventually get bored of. i’m so tired of these relationships feeling so one-sided due to this illness, tired of obsessing over him even when i try not to. 
i’m not sure how to cope with all this other than telling myself it’s “all in my head” essentially. should i tell him he’s my fp? would that scare him away? can anyone please spare some coping mechanisms?

i even told my last ex partner before we started dating about what happened with my ex before, and how he ended up bottling up emotions concerning my bpd symptoms and how my emotions weighed on him and then broke up with me suddenly without working through things with me, only giving symptoms of my bpd as reasons (even when he promised me he would never break up with me due to my mental illnesses). i told my last ex how i wanted to avoid that and he promised me he would tell me if things got to be too much… and then he didn’t anyway :(

i’m feeling pretty hopeless right now. i really wish i didn’t have bpd. i miss both my ex’s and i really don’t think i’ll ever get over them. idk if i can take more of this pain. i feel like i’m gunna end up alone because of my bpd. if i didn’t have bpd i would probably still be with either of my last two ex’s. i’m so broken because of this stuff and i just. don’t want bpd to affect my relationships like it has been anymore. i just want to end up with someone forever and be able to communicate freely with each other and that seems to be impossible for the people i date :(

yesterday my last ex told me i made him into a monster and i made him into a worse person because my emotions were so unstable. i just. i don’t know how to deal with that. i have nothing but love in my heart for him and i care about him so much… i don’t know. i’m doing a lot better than before and i’ve gone through dbt and i’ve been working through my issues and trying my best… but i still managed to fuck this up and push away yet another person who i love the most. 

i know i deserve better over all and i deserve people who will be open about their feelings to me instead of bottling them up until it’s too late, i just hate that this has happened twice with me now and i can’t do anything about it. and i get so attached to the people i date and i just want to stay in my room and cry all day because they don’t love me anymore. i still can’t believe they don’t love me anymore :(

nine moves in nineteen years. three schools in one year in two different countries. and the only thing that accomplished for me was a never ending sense of instability and never developing lasting friendships. what was the point of making friends if i was going to be saying goodbye to them in a short time anyway?

and the thing is: i am struggling so so much, for so so long now. over the years i gathered a lot of knowledge about psychology, i've read books and research papers, had friends with depression, anxiety, ed, bpd and more, i am part of internet communities where mental illness is discussed and please don't hate me for what i am gonna say... i am very sure that i have bpd. i do not consider myself as a person with bpd, i do not support self-diagnosing and i do not claim to have bpd. i am just desperate to the core. there are so many reasons why i dodged therapy for at least 6 long years now and i am well aware that therapy is the way to go for me, there is no other way, i know. it's just so difficult, every single day is a struggle, i am overwhelmed, i don't know who i am, i am scared, i am confused, i feel like i am not sick enough to deserve treatment, i am longing for safety, i hate myself, i can't admit the fact that sometimes i don't hate myself, i am so so so tired. and i don't even know what i am typing here, why i am typing it and what comments i expect. i just don't know.

content warning/possible tr**ma dump:
&gt;! major issues with my body and confidence, self harm, unaliving attempts, mood swings on a daily basis, so much confusion, can't talk to strangers, am scared of social interaction and scared to be judged, am a perfectionist to the bone, unhealthy eating (like i straight up starved myself for for weeks in december/november 2021, am still eating unhealthy, but there's minimal calorie intake), so much impulsive behaviour, a lot of feelings i don't unterstand, the slightest things trigger the weirdest strong emotions like??? what???, literally no motivation to live, sleeping so much (14+ hours per day) but also staying up until unholy times, relationship issues like the second i am alone i am convinced i am hated and so much more, i manipulate myself into hurting the few loved ones i have left, i feel like i am super sensitive to everything and everyone and i hate it, i have severe trust issues, i fear being abandoned - that's why i don't even enter new relationships and destroy the ones i have, checkmate! in the past i was bullied for years, my egg-donor absued me emotionally and blames me for basically everything and also tells everyone i am the monster here bc i finally abandoned this woman for good and now she's hurting, she manipulated me, gaslighted me, lied to me on a daily basis, cheated on my father but denies it to this day, she never believed me and always favored my older brother (who bullied me every day but she obviously didn't saw it like that), she straight up blackmailed me, spreads lies and personal information, once threatened to have my apartment door broken up by the police if i don't open to her, she told me i'm fat etc. etc. the list goes on and also why am i even typing this what am i doing, literally...!&lt;

it's not that i think it is someone else, its just that the face in the mirror does not mean anything to me. i am constantly mildly dissociated so this must be underlying it, as well as a lack of identity, and feeling like i don't exist.

396,"in love with my older married monogamous friend. i’ve had bpd symptoms my whole life &amp; was immediately diagnosed once i began pursuing mental health care less than a week after my 18th birthday. i’m 22 now &amp; have been rediagnosed(?) about a million times. thankfully my symptoms have improved a lot through therapy, a better support network, psychedelics &amp; general healing.. but i find myself becoming obsessed with people quite easily, mirroring their personalities subconsciously without even wanting to, fearing abandonment constantly, etc. a few years back i met a wonderful couple, both of these people are incredible &amp; i hope to be able to call them some of my best friends for the rest of my life. but soon after spending more time with them, i realized i was insanely attracted to the husband. over time i fell in love with him &amp; it’s gotten to the point where in the past year or so i really can’t get him off my mind. i just want to learn everything about him &amp; spend as much time with him as possible.. he’s definitely become my fp (my spouse (we are polyamorous) is also my fp but i’m madly in love with both of them).

about ten months ago my spouse &amp; i moved about four hours away &amp; i haven’t been able to really spend much time with this couple, maybe once every couple of months. we all used to hang out like one or two times a week sometimes, so it’s a big difference. it seems like they’re pulling away but i have no idea if i’m just imagining that. my spouse &amp; i are not well off whatsoever but we try to save back as much as we can to go visit them &amp; some of my family in the same town every month or two, or just whenever we are able. when we’re in town, they seem a bit more distant &amp; our interactions sometimes seem forced. to be fair, these people are pretty busy as they each have tons of friends &amp; family, work lives, etc. i’ve tried really hard to keep my attraction to the husband a secret from the couple because obviously i don’t want to ruin our friendship &amp; they are monogamous &amp; have been married for 15 years, so i can’t imagine i’ve done anything that would make it blatantly obvious that i’m into him. we have all always had good conversations &amp; visits &amp; i have searched every corner of my brain trying to figure out why they may have pulled away. my spouse who doesn’t have bpd has even brought it up, so it makes me wonder if we’re both just insecure or if we are indeed reading the situation properly. either way, it feels like my heart shatters every time i think about it, &amp; when we moved i cried nonstop (even though i almost never cry). this family has reiterated many times that my spouse &amp; i are like family to them &amp; we all became so close, but i’m so terrified they’re going to leave. abandonment is one of my greatest fears &amp; i don’t want to do anything to push them away.

the whole situation is weird &amp; complicated &amp; idk what to do. has anybody else been in a situation like this, &amp; if so, got any advice? i’m desperate for answers, i can’t hold this grief in forever.",Leave-me-answers,1agxmz3

we broke up because of how my unstable and manipulative tendencies were affecting us both. at the end of our relationship he started getting into drugs and told me it was his way of coping with the stress i was causing him. 


he was also manipulative in the relationship and i recognise that he has chosen to cope in this way, i in no way condoned his coping methods. but surely it’s no coincidence that each time i break up with sober guys they end up going to drugs, i feel so guilty.

i’ve been with my(18nb) boyfriend(17)for a year and a half, when i got into a relationship with him i started to realise how immature he was. he didn’t know how to use the dishwasher, or any other appliance, he didn’t even know where the pain killers in his house were, his mother brings him dinner and dessert every night, he behaves like my parents saying i can’t go to his because i’m sick is some “evil cruel thing”, he never thanks my parents for dinner/having him over, ect. he also tends to just say hurtful or insensitive shit and just “forget” he ever said it (like saying “wish that were me” to my friend when she said her grandfather died, or mentioning my eating disorder in front of my mother). 

however i’ve met his friends and we’ve been hanging out a lot, twice a week for 12 hrs in person, and from 8pm-3am in video calls. and there’s one of them that’s been discreetly hitting on me, and i really like him too. however i don’t know if i still love my boyfriend (haven’t known for about 6 months, i have a bunch of mood disorders that make feelings hard), and i don’t want to be the asshole who breaks up with my boyfriend and shows up to every hang out with his friend.

432,"I’m finding myself in another BPD relationship after the first person destroyed me so, back in 2020 i broke up with someone who was later diagnosed with bpd. they had cheated on me multiple times with their friends and had really brutalized me because of their self hatred and self destructive habits. they used me as a pawn in their self harm game. i told myself that this would never happen again. fast forward to now and i’m now in love and in a 7 month relationship with another woman who i’ve realized has bpd. and it’s starting to get bad.

my new gf was able to control herself for a few months before getting bad. she breaks up with me at least once a week and will remove her pictures of us on her social media. and she will block me from her stories and post who knows what. i just think it’s really toxic and i thought she was being malicious and manipulative. it’s so embarrassing to me because i pick her up from work and her coworkers are probably seeing all of this happen. she has security at her job and i’m sure they’re happy to see her remove pictures of her boyfriend and post hot selfies of herself when she’s splitting ….

it turns out that she actually seems to have bpd. she will split on me and say crazy things like she wants nothing to do with me . this weekend she is currently splitting on me because she’s being ‘selfish’ and wants me all to herself but i had promised my mom i would drive her to an airbnb. my mom has always wanted for us to get her an airbnb by the beach and she’s i’ll now so this is important to me so i put my foot down and told her that this is important. she blocked me. and then she unblocked me and i made plans with some friends because she’s literally stressing me out and ignoring me. i’m trying to convince myself that it isn’t intentional but it’s so hard. 

on one hand i truly love her and respect her condition. it’s totally not her fault that she’s having these intrusive thoughts. she thinks i will abandon her. but i don’t know maybe i just need therapy. i’m so scared that she’s thinking of other men when she splits. i’ve stalked her instagram and see she likes pictures of other men . i feel like i can accept her mental illness but also my insecurities are creeping up. when she tells me she doesn’t want me anymore, i can’t help think why she’s liking her followers selfies. she says she wants to swell nudes when she’s low on money. it’s stressing me out, she swears that she just gets triggered and loses control. i think i do believe her and i love her so much. i guess i’m just looking for perspective, thanks guys.",Ludens0,16z0kek
433,"if someone were to ask me what it’s like to live with BPD, this is what i would tell them. i’m not living with bpd—i’m trying to survive it. most days i’m scared i won’t. bpd is not just being happy then sad. it’s not just feeling anxious sometimes. it’s not just hating goodbyes. 

bpd is paranoia. wondering what everyone is thinking about me, how they feel toward me. if they can see right through the disguise i have on when i’m around them. it’s sometimes even thinking that there are cameras in my apartment, and i’m being watched, judged. 

bpd is being genuinely terrified of abandonment. all it takes is for someone to show me an ounce affection or validation, and i become literally nauseous at the thought of them leaving. yet i put expiration dates on almost every relationship i form, and sometimes even push those i love and care for away simply because i want to beat them to the punch.

bpd is feeling homesick. it’s sitting in my very own apartment, in my very own bed, and thinking to myself, “i want to go home”. it’s me longing for a place that doesn’t seem to exist. 

bpd is not knowing who i am. i don’t know my own interests, beliefs, morals, or values, because i am a chameleon. i change who i am depending on who i am with because i want to be liked. i want to be loved. i will people please until i’m exhausted from overextending myself. but if means they will stay, then so be it. 

bpd is feeling hopeless. hopeless because there is such a stigma that even some therapists and/or psychiatrists would refuse to treat me. hopeless because there are insurance companies that would refuse to pay for that treatment because they label bpd as “untreatable”.  bpd is me feeling hopeless because i don’t blame them. 

bpd is me destroying everything around me, then trying to pick up the pieces when it’s too late. bpd is destroying *me*.",LuluKun,1befrjf

i have two concerns about that. i want to talk about them with my therapist but our next appointment is in almost a week and i keep thinking about it, and i don't think my friends would understand or give good advice. 


first, because i've been invalidated by others and myself &amp; have been ignoring everything wrong with me for almost all my life, i don't believe i'm in ""bad enough"" condition to take meds, i feel like i should be able to cope another way even though the logical part of me knows that i can't function. 


the second one is that i'm insulin resistant and i've been trying to lose weight for 6 months. i've lost a lot of weight, and i'm so scared that i'll take it back because of the meds and i'll get back to where i was (or in worse condition), and everything i did would be for nothing. i'm having periods of binge eating and periods of starving myself, but they've stopped a lot since i went on a diet to control my insulin resistance and lose weight, and i'm afraid they'll become like they were before. i've also seen some other side effects that scare me but not as much as gaining weight

446,"It's so hard to do anything with the gaping, unending emptiness all around you. the emptiness comes and goes in waves, but has been persistent for the last few months. a lovingly crafted combination of the throwing away of a friendship that gave me hope and fulfillment, the dental pain that never seems to go away no matter how much debt i go into at the dentist, and finally, a bodily injury that's led to me being out of work for the past week and probably 3 more.

without work, as much as i hated it, i wake up way later than i used to. i used to wake up at 5 am. the days felt longer, i felt like i got more out of the time i have with earth. but since being out of work, and being alone, it's incredibly hard to wake up before 9:30/10a.m. coupled with the dental pain that keeps me up, sporadically, at night, and the injury incurred with work, my sleep quality has nose dived. putting me into a daily dissociative fog.

i'm finding it hard to do anything. cook. clean. breathe. i'm a 30 year old dude, 3 years into working retail in this pandemic. the burnout is so real i'm starting to smell cooked skin. everything feels so pointless, because i don't have hope anymore.

i used to have hope. a small hope. but the world is so different now. for work? i've tried applying for better, non-retail jobs (i have a degree, but psych) for years, to no avail. even with a stint interning in hr, nothing panned out. i used connections with friends to find some opportunities, and always failed the interview.

for a relationship? this is the one that hurts the most. i can barely write about it because i can feel the water rising in my chest, about to choke me. the world just isn't the same anymore. it doesn't work like it did when i used to successfully date. i tried online dating, and it's not the medium for me. if refusing to adapt and use online dating means being alone for the rest of my time, i'll make peace with that.

i just...with this truth that i'm going to be alone every single day. for the rest of my life. as i have been for the last 6 years. this truth makes it all so pointless. who i become. what i do with myself. if the only one that ever sees anything i do is me, then what is the point?

i can't pick up my guitar anymore. i can't read. watching tv shows feels like i'm wasting away alone. about all i can do now is hike, just walk and keep walking. listen to the birds. watch things skirt around my feet. it's about the closest i can feel to alive now, but once i get done with the hike, there i am again. just me. and each time i do it, the prospect of hiking again becomes even harder.

at this rate, i don't even have the motivation or energy to even *think* about ending my own life. i just know that when that moment comes, i'll be okay. because i lived, i experienced the things that mattered to me most even if they were brief, i'd rather accept it and quietly end my story, then to try to cling to life hoping that one day, maybe one day, i'll experience human connection again.",Major_Constant_6014,tsp6n5

i haven't seen him in two weeks - different to the usual 5 hours every weekday - because he's had a bereavement and has been away because of that. so as a result of not seeing him and also feeling sad for him and worried about him, i really really really want to give him the most enormous hug ever. 
 
knowing him, he will appreciate a massive hug but i'm worried that i might go overboard somehow. i don't even know what that would entail, but i'm worried about it happening.

i'm also worried that, having not spoken to him in person for so long, i'm going to accidentally pile on the compliments too much or declare my love for him or something like that.

i guess what i'm asking yous for advice on is, firstly, how to have some self control and not get carried away and mess things up, and also, how to deal with the uneasiness when i'm alone of wanting to be affectionate with him, spend time with him, talk to him, or text him etc when i have to try and go at the speed he's going at, so not really going very far at all...",MamaShayButter,14cucsk

then there’s the oh so delightful abandonment issues. i thought i had it covered. it’s part of life surely? fuck no. not part of mine if i had any control over it. stability is forever something im lacking and god knows i fucking need it more than ever. why can’t i just accept that people will come and go like it is literally the basics. nothing stays and people sure as shit don’t so why is it so hard to accept? the thing is i’ve been ditched and i’ve ditched people. it is part of life but sometimes in life a certain individual will come and wreck the somewhat peace you had and now you need this individual. that’s when shit hits the fan and now you’re walking on egg shells trying to be the perfect you so they don’t see past it and see your fuck tonne of flaws and probably leave you.

it’s just heartbreaking. he snaps at me for everything. but when i get angry of course i’m the worst because i have bpd and he just contributes to my anger instead of doing the reasonable thing and making me calm down at least try!!!!

i really can’t wait until i don’t live with him anymore because even though he says “i love you” and i reply “i love you too” i don’t really mean it because of all the horrible ways he acted with me. his argument is always “well you attack me a million times worse through personal, critical insults”  which is true but he hurts me and he doesn’t even realise, unlike me i’m self aware after the shouting and arguing stops.

i was doing perfectly fine for 4 months until my ex reached out to me and wanted to meet up for coffee. we ended up sleeping together and i was under impressed that he wanted to get back with me because we slept together. he told me straight up after that it was a mistake and he does not want to get back with me because i caused him some trauma in the last six years. to be fair, i said some really nasty stuff to him in the past. he was scared that if we get back together, i might be that person again. so he said sorry and how we shouldn't have met up.

that made me go into depression/suicidal spiral and i ended up binge eating and drank crazy amount of alcohol, deleted all of my social media accounts and turned off my phone for 2 days straight. my parents were worried about me and passed by my apartment to check up on me and my mom stayed over night because she thinks i'll attempt again. i'm just so tired of being like this. i wish i'm like others who dont have bpd. it sucks :(",MidoriGurinTheSalad,1cldi9h

469,"Just got 'dumped' by my reddit friend (who also has bpd) last year before i finally went to therapy, i asked my local reddit community about this particular therapy place that i was interested in going. 

my reddit friend entered my chats and long story short we both not only have bpd but we also go to the same therapy place (our sesh are usually scheduled on the same day too) and we both have the same fav spot. 

i was very grateful for her. words of affirmation is not my love language. i do not trust people and their words. so anything anyone says, its full of shit to me. i dont know how but.... she managed to get to me with her words. i genuinely believed her. trusted her. 

last year (just last month), i had plans to off myself and i genuinely was about to go through with them. she knew how serious my plans were so she proposed we met up at least once. and we did. im grateful that we did. she was a nice and funny person and we vibed well irl. 

a couple days after our meetup i was supposed to do it. but things started to happen which got me distracted and made me postpone my plans. im in january now and im struggling so much to stay afloat. its not even the end of the month and i have had experience incredible highs and also very shitty lows. 

i have bought an extremely expensive camera. i got scammed for almost $400. i have recently sourced out for dr*gs and im extremely dependant on my dr*gs/meds. i have started to develop a substance ab*se issue and went down this wormhole of all things related to dr*gs which made me distant and cold. this made me 'accidentally' ignored/forgotten to reply to her msgs. 

today i received this text from her: 

""hey man, i just wanted to message you before i do this: i need to delete my account again and just disappear. i did this a couple of months back as well, and i genuinely thought you wouldn’t notice or care. you were the trigger for the deletion. i’m sorry i didn’t tell you this then, i couldn’t tell you, it felt like i was “too emotional” or “too sensitive”. i do apologise that it triggered your abandonment stuff back then and i apologise if it does that again. 

let me explain why i have to delete and just leave. i think the reality is that i am too sensitive. i am a bpd patient, i am extremely sensitive to rejection. i do get affected when i feel like others simply don’t care and unfortunately, that’s how i felt with you. it would trigger me when you wouldn’t reply to my messages. i tried to be okay with it, i would tell you it’s fine to not reply because i didn’t want to pressure you into replying. 

i get it. sometimes, i can’t reply to messages with my friends either and i always feel pressured and guilty. i didn’t want you to feel that way. however, while i struggle with replying to messages, i do get very triggered when people don’t reply to my messages. it’s similar to the thing with your ex when she’d be late, you’d be upset; but when you were late, she’d patiently wait. this is one reason why i tend to stay away from people like myself, because we can end up triggering each other. it also felt like i didn’t matter in any way to you. 

i felt like you saw my value not in the friendship but in … just having an objective opinion, if that makes sense. that’s not to say you weren’t helpful to me, because believe me, you really, really were. when i needed help, you were always there. but, it’s difficult to explain what i mean when i say that i still felt unwanted. i think i valued you in some way. and it didn’t feel mutual. 

you have your greek friend and you value her. i can see that you truly care about her. 

so this is all just stuff that ended up triggering for me and made me leave the first time as well. even now, i wouldn’t be able to tell you this if not for the fact that i’m deleting my acc. i’m not confrontational or open about my emotions, those things are difficult for me. but i don’t want to just disappear without giving you a reason. 

i hope you don’t feel abandoned. my mind is telling me that you won’t care. but just in case it does trigger stuff — i am sorry. but, my mind is also telling me, you do have people in your life. you have your greek friend, you have your scorpio friend, you have (insert my psychs name here). and maybe other people you value too. those are your friends. i am not sure what i ever was. maybe it’s just my own issues with feeling unwanted, i don’t know. 

anyway, please take care. i hope you’ll go for therapy, it’ll help, i promise it will help. and don’t give up. sometimes looking too far into the future is not a good idea, sometimes it’s just better to take one step at a time. i believe you’ll be okay and you’ll get the future you want. you’ll be a mother, a wife, you’ll have your own cats and kids. just don’t give up. bye bye, it was nice to know you. honestly."" 

it hurts a lot. i dont blame her for doing what she did. she has bpd too. but it hurts to know that her last thought of me would be how i dont care enough for her or value her as a person. i never thought i would make friends thru reddit but i have successfully made some friends here. out of every friend ive made, shes my fav friend. she was the reddit friend i trusted the most. i dont have any other way of contacting her. the only means of contact i have with her is via reddit. shes extremely paranoid and secretive, hence why she never told me her name, where she stayed, her socials or phone number. i respected that and never pushed her to give me more details. she reminds me a lot of one of my close friends irl. theyre both very paranoid and are full of anxiety.... honestly i dont know where im going with this. im just upset. frustrated. hurt.

i feel like i owe to her as she endured me being out of my head for a year aka 2021. where i took a sabbatical year because of my mental health. 

now today i’m thinking if i should switch to searching full time jobs instead of part time asap. she still hasn’t decided but it makes me stressed.

triggering as hell for me as i have absolutely no pictures of anyone i knew 10 years ago and me. i'm often reading about how temporary friendships are for us with bpd and i guess this is proof. very not great.

throw in my own wife then saying to me ""oh i know what you're like, you're making it worse than it was"" after venting to her about being treated like shit by my boss, and all in all, not a fun day. 


i should point out this is nothing serious and i'm aware of that, i'm lucky to be happily married to a very patient and usually super supportive person. just that 10 year thing hit different and hasn't left me. and the fact no matter how much better i get, people will always pre judge me bothers me greatly too...",MistakeConstant8629,1aw0jbm

the one person that has always been there for me and loved me more than anyone in the world is finally leaving me and i’m so broken. this is the man i want to spend my life with, the man who comforts me, the man who was relentlessly patient and understanding and kind to me. i know that the actions that got us to this point are completely my fault, but i just feel so devastated and mad at the world for having this fucking disorder that makes treating the person i love and myself right so much harder. i had always thought that i could focus on myself and work through my bpd and learn coping strategies and work through therapy just as long as i had his support (no one else in my life knows about my bpd). but now i don’t and i’m so, so fucking sad and scared. it doesn’t help that we’ve been together for almost 6 years and this is my first breakup. i can’t sleep because i see him in my dreams and i wake up in panic. i want so badly to go back in time and not fuck everything up so many times. it breaks my heart to see and know what i did to him when i truly love him so fucking much. i don’t know what the point of this post is except to say i’m so, so sorry that we have to deal with this disorder and that our lives feel so much fucking harder to live normally and successfully than neurotypicals. i’m so fucking sad",Mitch_Merk,12xrl1n

477,"Relationship + in need of help i'm constantly having mental breakdowns because of my overthinking. much of these breakdowns are also related to how lonely i feel. 

i don't really know why my mental state has become this terrible, and i think i'm genuinely quite scared of how rapidly my mood changes.

i'd also like to mention that i am currently in a  relationship with someone, and almost every other day, we're arguing. whenever we do so, i'm so affected by the hurtful things my partner says to me and i don't think i can really get past that. in a way, i believe that i'm depending on him in some way and because of how angry he gets at me, i get affected too. 

my partner says that i'm acting quite different and that sometimes i'm plain rude to him. i don't realize it and when my partner points it out, i'm  confused about it, because i wasn't intentionally trying to be rude. i just think i'm talking the way i normally do with him. and because of the way i'm behaving, my partner has stopped being nice to me and constantly says mean things about me and when we're on call, they ignore me when i call out their name and don't always answer back when i ask them something. they also tell me how boring i've become and tbh, i just don't know what to talk about and nothing i say or do interests them anymore. i'm constantly told that i'm in the wrong and how they wished i was funny like them.  its becoming a lot more pressurizing to keep a conversation going. i'm no longer fun. 

i'd like to apologize as i'm not sure what's going on with me. everything i've said seems rather disorganized. i suppose i'd like some advice on how to cope with whatever that's going on with me. i want to try to stop overthinking because it always leads me to think that my partner's cheating on me and is lying to me and maybe that's why they no longer tell me that they love me when i tell them i do.",Monstorbation,13tzb45

i, on the other hand, was the independent girl, who felt like she could find nobody to love. 
we started off as friends, and with each passing day i grew closer to him, opening myself up, learning to love someone truly for the first time. we were in love, but i was constantly questioning everything.i’m retrospect, i always loved him so much, but i still said such hurtful things. we had multiple fights, and each time i felt like that wasn’t me who said all those mean things. i knew exactly what i was doing, i was hyper aware, but i could not seem to control my emotions, no longer how hard i tried. then came the wave of guilt for acting out, which would stay with me for days after each fight, slowly eating away at my self worth. 
all this while my boyfriend, now ex, was losing feelings for me. and i’m not stupid, i knew what the consequences of my actions would hold for me, but i could never, ever, control my reactions to situations. i gave it my 100 percent, that i’m sure, but it could not undo the damage.
in the last few months, (the last leg of our relationship) i had drastically improved, and he said so too. i had been going to therapy and working on my core beliefs. and bam, he announces that he had lost feelings for me a long time ago. i knew deep down he was slowly losing it for me, while my love for him was growing stronger. i cannot begin to express the pain i’m in, knowing all well that it is because of how i am. i hate myself thoroughly for this. i just lost the most amazing person i’ve ever met.",My-soul-was-yeeted,1b92zml

i am 20, almost 21 now and i still can't consider myself as an adult. i try and i try and i try to do everything right but it seems like i'm failing

everything that comes out of my mouth seems either way too rude, naïve or cringe and everyone seems to judge me for whatever i'm saying or do, especially here on reddit.

i don't know if i'm making everything worse than it already is and i definitely know that there are a lot of people who just love running their mouth about everythink. maybe i'm focusing on the negatives way too much, but it fucks up with my brain way too much, to the point i just want to stay in bed and listen to music. and at the same time keep up with school, my parent's expectations, because i obviously have responsabilities, and also trying to still talk to my friends.

i've been bullied quite badly in the past, to the point of getting hit and breaking down crying in the middle of class and being considered an outsider even in highschool (i was literally kicked out of the class groupchat) 

i try talking to my friends, but they always seem to think it's just another episode or another outbreak. for once i just wish someone could listen to me and take me seriously when i say i feel like shit.

i tried finding solace in music, especially kpop lately, more specifically, k-r&amp;b, a little k-rap and k-rock, trying to know myself more through zodiac, mbti and other personality tests, but i still feel empty. i tried filling this void with so much and nothing works.

retail therapy would probably make things 10000x times worse since i am a bigger woman and i would break down trying to find clothes that fit

i tried going to therapy but i was scheduled quite rarely and it didn't really do shit (although i tried) but she basically told me that i am exaggerating and that i should give people another chance (completely disregarding my obvious trust issues and my avoidant attachment style, if you're familiar with it). i opened up to her, my therapist knowing damn well i have bpd (which i had to realise myself, since my paper didn't clearly state borderline, it said emotionally unstable personality structure, which i later found out it was another way to say bpd)

speaking of trust issues, i barely had a one month relationship. i am always the one who flees the moment something seems wrong, especially if someone points it out. i could see myself getting way too attached, but to be fair, i barely had some minor crushes that i would forget the moment i don't see them. so nothing to really suffer over, even if i kinda get attached. i am scared of commitment, not gonna lie, and always feeling like i'm falling behind, since i'm kind of a late bloomer.

2. i want to reach out more and become more social. the pandemic has made us all forget how to be social and i've become comfortable isolating. my plan is to take in-person classes and join the creative writing club.
3. i would like to begin an exercise routine slowly and safely. not to lose weight, but to be overall healthy. my test results said i'm at risk for heart disease/heart attack and i'm 26, so i either nip it in the bud now or risk it. i realized we only get one body, temporarily. i want to treat myself better.
