-Massive-Feeling-,0,my first time inpatient how i learned to advocate for myself hi everyone i just got released from the hospital after the 72 hours i signed all the papers to go in voluntarily so i could stabilize and get my meds changed in a safe environment it is a long story about why i went in but i figured you guys could understand i have recently been diagnosed bipolar and borderline so i was previously on 40 mg of prozac 25 mg lamictal and 10 mg buspar prozac and buspar were part of my old anxiety and depression cocktail the first psychiatrist i saw added 25 mg of lamictal to my regimen after my diagnosis and did not change anything else after that appointment when i got home i felt great for all of2 days my body got used to the lamictal and from there on it was like eating candy i kept taking the medicines hoping it would get better from there things kept going downhill i ended up in one of the most severe depressive episodes i have ever had while also experiencing mild psychosis i had a lot of outlandish thoughts like i wanted to build a makeshift boat and go to india i wanted to get to paris with a total of 60 bucks in my pocket really weird stuff then i talked about hanging myself the next day my family had me go to counseling my psychiatrist was contacted and told how bad things were yet refused to change my medicine and did not call for hours i was still in full blown crazy land so the best option was hospitalization i agreed to it because i was so tired of feeling like i was the hospital was great and i loved the doctors i saw i remember answering tons of questions every single doctor informed me that i should not have been on any more ssris after my diagnosis before being diagnosed i had tried 7 ssris with little to no success or worsening of symptoms also i was told the mood stabilizer i was on was going to be way too slow working the head psych doctor there reevaluated my whole med regimen and took me off of prozac and lamictal and she added lithium and left me on buspar which i do well with i felt like a new person when i started lithium it is been totally amazing so far i have a checkup in 4 days to see my blood levels i am going to do all of my followups with the hospitals doctors which i feel very good about i feel like i can trust them and they have a lot of knowledge about medications as well as what each mental illness needs to be treated with i completely cancelled everything else i had with the prior doctor overall though i learned that it is okay to reach out for help i also learned that i have to fight for myself when my medication is out of balance it is hard when you are seeing some doctor that is second guessing you and then they leave you hanging when you are in a crisis i feel much stronger about advocating for myself after all of this i just wanted to share because this community has made me feel like i belong maybe some of you can relate as well i feel like everyone here is a friend and i would love to hear anything you guys also want to share,qv78g6,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['prozac', 'lamictal', 'lithium', 'stabilizer', 'buspar', 'ssris', 'Fluoxetine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Fluoxetine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Fluoxetine', 'Lamotrigine']",13,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.9957,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,7,2,This information is relevant.

0w_l,2,i am intolerant to most medications how do i cope i would like to start off by saying i know medications are not a fix all cure i have been going to therapy for the past 6 or 7 years and am working on improving my dbt skills but it is extremely hard without proper medication i started trying to take medications when i was 16 i think so about 6 years ago when i was 16 to 17 i took at least 10 medications a few i can remember are sertraline prozac zoloft and more i reacted extremely badly to all of them mostly with extreme chest pain trouble remembering extreme nausea increased anxiety or depression then i found paxil i was on that for about 5 years and slowly tapered off a few months ago i came off of it with the support of a doctor i took all the right steps but it was still hell i came off paxil because it was making me very sick and giving me lots of brain zaps every day when i was on paxil for the first 1 to 4 years my mood was manageable i would still get intense ups and downs but i could manage unfortunately i believe paxil was also giving me hypomanic symptoms because now that i am off of it i do not have hypomanic episodes since i came off paxil i am so suicidal i can barely function i have recently tried abilify and lamotrigine abilify made me more anxious than i have ever been in my life and lamotrigine gave me intense chest pain so currently i am only taking 300mg of wellbutrin which i have been on for about 2 or 3 months wellbutrin makes me mildly sick but it does help a little so i am unwilling to come off of it right now i am just so upset and have no hope for the futureanyone gone through something similar,mtba08,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,1,['dbt'],"['zoloft', 'sertraline', 'prozac', 'lamotrigine', 'wellbutrin', 'paxil', 'abilify', 'Sertraline', 'Fluoxetine', 'Sertraline', 'Paroxetine', 'Paroxetine', 'Paroxetine', 'Paroxetine', 'Paroxetine', 'Aripiprazole', 'Lamotrigine', 'Aripiprazole', 'Lamotrigine', 'Bupropion', 'Bupropion']",21,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.9928,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,10,3,This information is very relevant.

AdviceRepulsive,27,coming to terms with bpd diagnosis job loss first dbt intakewish me luck tldr so i got forced to resign from my job of many years after getting written up for a prior outburst now i need to get mentally stable enough to get a job or die i hope this shit works it is a long story but i had some safety concerns at work that were being dismissed and i laid into my boss about it a little dramatically and was written up i tried to get my act together got full psych eval new bpd diagnosis new meds lamotrigine started feeling more in control started kicking ass at work then landed into the er with a rash and swollen glands it was a set back to my self esteem and finances but i kept on going hard with work trying to keep up trying to keep it up as my role as a pleaser make people laugh reassure everyone i am fine i knew the other shoe was going to drop soon i started taking topamax 2 weeks after i stopped lamotrigine the effects were somewhat similar but a lot more subtle the side effects were also startling rapid weight loss which was initially welcome since i was struggling to lose weight from the lexapro i had stopped taking nearly a year ago i was also experiencing tingling numb handsfeetface slight lack of urgency a little bit of confusion my main boss was out of town while i was on my initial dose of topamax leaving me alone with a newer manager i basically had a hard day things were disorganized since my main boss was gone i got confused and frustrated so i started to cry asked coworkers from a different department for help i tried to breathe and tried not to get angry but i was still in tears they were lost too so they got the new manager and he came over and basically took over and laughed at me instead of helping me with the logistical issues i had to deal with at the start of a very long work day that toward the end of a work week i spent the entire weekend wracked with guilt over crying at work and potentially bumming out my coworkers or bringing down morale monday i am at work itching to talk to my manager about the issues that led to me crying and what i need to have a smoother day monday and i get a call from the dbt institute they said there was no reason why i could not start group right away and that i could have started a while ago i called them after my psych eval from 2 months ago trying to schedule an intake i fill out their intake paperwork online and they eventually reached out to me a week or 2 later to schedule an initial intake then group therapy since one on one has a year wait list fine awesome i was driving so i call back accidentally leave a message in work mode i have an ethnic name and go by an anglicized name for simplicity so was like hi this is __ from ___ companyuhhh never mind click then i called again left another message like normal trying to schedule an appointment and they never got back to me got emails saying i need to sign an info release form so i click the link to sign the form and it says the link has been expired i have called and left weekly messages over the phone trying to schedule intakes to get this started to learn coping skills to save my job and explained all of this over the phone with the poor receptionist i told her i thought it was my fault for leaving a weird confused voicemail a few months ago that i must have scared them off or something she was like ohhhhi am sorry i think there was a glitch with adobe sign amp sendwhat s fucking joke anyway since i broke down and cried at work my manager called in my 2 bosses who i had worked with for years they would not look me in the eyes the manager had only been there for a couple of months did all the talking he said i could either stay on and my entire workflow would change and i would be forced to work closely with him only him and if i so much as expressed any frustration at work again i would be fired on the spot without pay the alternative would be resigning with severance i have never been fired from a job before i felt my whole world crashing all the relationships i built the work i have accomplished the independence i have gained from my family the good will and reputation i have built in the industry i was working was just destroyed up until this point i have had breakdowns at other jobs but have been able to mask repress or remove myself from public view i had been functioning at what i felt was an acceptable level i have always acknowledged my temper was an issue but never been able to admit it could be pathological i have been getting by with repression since my diagnosis i was reluctant to even read anything about bpd because of the stigma i also have adhd cptsd gad mdd i have been seeing the same therapist but i think there were some things lost in translation due to cultural differences i always suspected i was an evil person but because of my own ignorance i thought it meant i was officially diagnosed as evil the more i am reading about it the more i realize i am just really fucking sad and in need of comfort a lot i feel guilty all the time my partner bless him has become much more understanding of me since the diagnosis i have reached out to my sister the person in my family i feel closest to for support but it is hard because i feel like i am shattering her image of a now stable and happy family dynamic which i am not really a part of i do not hang around that much with my parents or family i try when things are good in my life and when i feel i am presentable enough for them ie financially stable have enough to show them i am a total fuck up but i cannot get over the physical and emotional abuse i suffered as a child teen and young adult she asked me if i had been listening to a podcast that my brother and our childhood family friend made and i tried but i cannot i later told her the friend molested me from middle school to high school and i cannot listen to it she said he owes me at least an apology i talked to her a few days later and she asked if i listened to the podcast again then i hung up on her sent a long text threatening suicide told her the family is fine without me now

Afraid-Marsupial-196,35,being poor with mental issues feels like a death sentence i will preface this by saying i am not even in the us where this stuff seems even worse i am in australia where we allegedly have good healthcare the whole mental health system just seems impossibly stacked against you if you are poor it already feels ridiculously tough to overcome these issues without that barrier think in an ideal situation with all factors accounted for there would still be a chance you might not ever recover but if you are broke it just feels impossible to start with it is just a catch22 already i cannot hold down a job because of my issues but i can fix my issues without money that alone makes me feel like giving up but then when you think about the sheer amount of money you have to throw at things that are not even helpful half the time it basically just becomes a sick joke i cannot count how many times i have paid to see a mental health professional that actually left me feeling more confused and hopeless at the moment i am on day three of suffering through absolutely awful ssri withdrawals because i could not afford to get my meds renewed my lexapro was on the same script as my lamictal i have got a healthcare card that is supposed to get me assistance with this stuff but the pharmacy told me that lamictal is not covered i do not even understand that how can a very common mood stabilisers one of the primary forms of treatment for bipolar not be covered it does not even make sense to me they told me it would be 40 to get the script filled and that was for the generic version i literally do not have that money in my account so i just had to say no it just seems so immoral and that is not even to mention neither of those pills did anything for me no intended effects no side effects no nothing same story with every single medication i have taken in the past and i have been at this for years makes me wonder if i am even being treated for the right things after all depending on which psychiatrist you ask i have major depressive disorder persistent depressive disorder bipolar type 2 bpd ptsd cptsd anorexia substance abuse disorder and probably more i am forgetting seems like my diagnosis changes with the wind i have seen 3 psychiatrists all about a year apart because i just could not afford to go more often than that or go back to the same one twice first guy said it was just the depression with maybe some bpd second said bpd with possible bipolar and ptsd or cptsd third barely listened to me and said it is definitely bipolar for purely genetic reasons and maybe some bpd traits i am just lost at this point and i cannot afford to keep going back to get clarity only reason i can get in to see a therapist now is because i am on welfare and you can get a few free appointments but even that is no help because the guy they have sent me to honestly is dumber than a sack of bricks i am sure he means well but he is not going to be able to help me and i cannot afford anyone better and even when i could the cbt specialists dbt specialists emdr specialists all seemed to be basically the same none of it helped and again it took up all my money just to get in the door so i did not have the luxury of trying again afterwards i just do not get it even my gp is throwing up her hands at this point saying there is really no options left i just feel untreatable i mean i am clearly already pretty treatment resistant as it is so if i cannot even shop around until i get someone good or even feel confident i have got the right diagnosis what hope is there how does someone like me ever get better i cannot even afford my goddamn meds anymore this is just awful,wfvh7k,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,3,"['cbt', 'dbt', 'emdr']","['ssri', 'lexapro', 'lamictal', 'Escitalopram', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine']",6,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.9892,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,11,3,This information is very relevant.

AutoModerator,62,i am verging to madness i am literally going crazy in this period i am having dissociative crises i cannot remember my actions or give weight to what i do i am careless i forget things even the most stupid ones i wake up in the morning with a weight on my stomach and i do not know what to do i do not know who i am i am sick all my interests all my hobbies have been lost i am taking drugs to go on because the psychiatric drugs they prescribed for me have no effect on my mood mainly antipsychotics there are days when i suffer from loneliness and i cry like a baby feeling myself like a heavy boulder each step becomes an enterprise on the other hand there are days when loneliness does not even hit me because i am used to it and because i realize that if i had someone next to me first of all i would destroy himher and secondly i would also destroy myself i am always on a tightrope always on the verge of getting pissed and having a burst of anger it happened yesterday while i was texting a girl who i do not even know whether to consider my friend this girl did something that is harmless to me now last night however that thing was not harmless to me i was in a strong state of paranoia i got pissed i had the poison inside me and i needed to spit it out this poison was fermenting in my body i felt it in my stomach and it started to flow up to my chest and mouth i needed to spit this poison i insulted her by hitting her weak points i hurt her i made her feel bad this thing helped me relieve anxiety and distress but only for a few hours shortly thereafter another anxiety returned the anxiety of being alone of not being forgiven and of having hurt that person i felt guilty a real shit she forgave me but i know that when people forgive me that forgiveness is a false forgiveness because words do not slip on anyone and not even bad deeds i go from being pissed empty depressed and megalomaniacal in a day it happens too often too much within 24 hours i am in pain i do not know what to do i would like to have someone but at the same time i do not want anyone because i am afraid of being hurt i consider myself too labile and unhealthy to be able to have a healthy relationship with someone every relationship i had with a girl ended badly every girl who was by my side suffered i carry the pain with me and spread it on the bodies of others i am not well when i get angry i suffer because it is not what i would like but at the same time i cannot contain it i cannot focus on anything else when i become psychotic i cannot even explain this mental asphyxia i have an emotional crater that is devouring me i am still in love with my ex and every day i worry about it because i really hurt her and now i miss her and her does not want to talk me because she is scared sometimes anger is so devastating that it leads me to destroy and hurt even the most beautiful thing i love this anger hurts me more than others the psychiatrist who is treating me continues to denigrate my problem and pretend nothing they prescribe me antipsychotics over antipsychotics such as lamictal and have no effect on me i do not know what to do anymore i am going crazy and i am sick i almost broke my knuckles by punching the wall and this is becoming more and more frequent i am sure that if i continue to feel bad i will kill myself with my own hands i cannot stand myself anymore this disease is destroying me and i was born with the bad luck of having it i do not hate my mom and dad for mistreating me when i was a kid i still remember the episodes in which for example my mother beat me and then told me that if i cried i would have taken twice the blow i remember when one night i went to my parents room and told my father that my tooth hurt and he gave me a backhand telling me to go to bed because it was late i do not hate them for that but in my life i never told either of them that i love them for me they are neutral elements of the family i am confused and i cannot recognize them as my parents i live only for drugs they are my only real purpose in life when they will notice my body only because of the stench i am totally alone caged in my own mind,"1bmcig4, 1blafdh, y5ay6h, 1cg1o4c, 178e0qf, 1bea21n, 1cd5hqa, tsp6n5, tsp6n5, tsp6n5, 1cltbvl, 1cpoca7, 1avt6sj, 18j7v6i, 198dxa3, 1ce9nke, 1c4czwz, 1caqbry, mtba08, 1ck8mlp, 1553kkn, 1arbdc8, 15dkkaa, uclbk4, wfvh7k, 12x3w5h, h7lqwr, 1c96229","(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['lamictal', 'antipsychotics', 'Lamotrigine']",3,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.9994,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,5,2,This information is relevant.

BPDLPC,70,what is going to come of my untreated bpd hi everyone i was diagnosed with bpd just this past november after a lot of misdiagnoses of bipolar disorder and depression i used to be on abilify and prozac but it stopped working after about a year of me taking it and when i was diagnosed with bpd i was prescribed lamictal but i was coming off the other medication combo and trying to adapt to this one and i felt so physically and mentally exhausted from the strain of taking medicine that i stopped taking both and just pursued therapy things have not been the best but they are drastically better than when i was on medication i am a frequent smoker and i find that in moderation it really helps me not have terrible mood swings my moods and emotional instability and my tendency to be irrational are really the worst parts of my disorder i can go from swimmingly happy or at least content to terribly hateful of myself and the world i cry a lot and there was a period a few weeks ago where i cried multiple times every day for two weeks i feel anger a lot too but a lot of it i place on myself or bottle up which i have noticed has been elevating my states of anger more i am always irritated and little things can get me very angry and depressed i have been seeing a therapist regularly and i was learning a lot and making great steps though after the sessions i would feel depressed having to confront my shitty and destructive tendencies still it was helping however i came to therapy today and was pulled aside by the supervisor of my therapist who told me that my therapist had to leave the agency for personal reasons he could not explain now i get very attached to people especially therapists that i have admitted a lot to and talked extensively with about my problems i have had my fair share of therapists and he was one of my favorites i was okay for a while after i heard the news but then i got this wave of frustration about the situation that is another thing when things do not go how they should or how they are expected to i almost just completely lose it i hardly think of suicide seriously but when i got upset about all this all of these hateful emotions just came up and my inner monologue was so hatefully pessimistic and ready to just end it all i am scared of these reactions and these emotions and i wonder if it has to do with my technically untreated disorder i know i would probably feel better in some sense with medication but the side effects of meds and i have taken many kinds always make me feel so unlike myself i guess i am just venting but is there anyone out there not on medication dealing with bpd i would love some advice or solidarity on the matter because i feel like my treatment of therapy has been stifled due to this unexpected change and i just want to know if there is anything else i can do to not feel so upset all of the time,1b92zml,"(1, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,0,[],"['prozac', 'lamictal', 'abilify', 'Aripiprazole', 'Fluoxetine', 'Lamotrigine']",6,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.998,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,9,3,This information is very relevant.
BPDlovely,71,any advice on dealing with lamictal withdrawal so aside from my current mood i finally feel like i am at a good place to start trying to take less meds my only 2 problems in the last good while have been insomnia and anxiety plus crying from pms or if there is a situational explanation i am also with a very kind and supportive boyfriend who never gets irritated with me for my emotions and is 150 sure he will marry me the amount of meds i have been taking is just ridiculous so to start i am tapering my lamictal in increments written by my doctor in addition to my desire to take less meds i think there is a very strong possibility that the lamictal has been contributing to my bad insomnia i mean there are other factors too though i just decreased from 300mg to 200mg apparently part of the reason it was a high dose is because my birth control makes it less effective and it is day 3 i still feel just horrible i have been overly emotional and crazy anxious basically constantly and nauseous with a lack of hunger which does not help my hypoglycemia and i have vomited a bit i mean i am pretty sure it is from the withdrawal and not from the need to take the medication because it certainly was not this bad when i was at a lower dose however long ago that was it really really sucks and i have already had a few panic attacks i also feel like i have been more sensitive to bright lights with headaches bordering on migraines and i have been dizzy and sleepy any advice on dealing with the withdrawal,tsp6n5,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['lamictal', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine']",4,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.0075,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,3,2,This information is relevant.

BlanKatt,94,i have been denying this dx for a long time and i do not know what to do why is it easier to have bipolar i hope this post will make some sense i tend to ramble i also have decreased cognitive functioning from all these dumb meds especially lamictal and gabapentin i swear i am smarter than i am going to sound for reference my official dx are cptsd very well managed now though generalized anxiety disorder and add and then of course bipolar disorder type ii and bpd it can get a bit dizzy with all of these but i have gotten pretty good at isolating which symptom is from which disorder how do i start mental illness runs in my family i was dx with juvenile bipolar disorder when i was 1314 at first i was really upset by it my grandpa had bipolar and committed suicide when i was 5 i felt like now i was this crazy person but i pretty quickly accepted it i read everything i could on the subject i have always been very involved in my own care even from a young age rather than doing whatever they suggested i think that is served me well after a suicide attempt last year in the hospital i had two doctors come into my room this was not the psych hospital i was still in the regular hospital being treated i think they were pdocs though one sat on either side of me it felt very much like an interrogation i hated the way they looked at me they clearly looked down on me for whatever reason i felt they were really condescending they asked if i would ever heard of bpd i said that i knew a little bit they talked about dbt and things like that it is a bit fuzzy since then i have really ignored the bpd diagnosis and i cannot quite explain why i am okay with being bipolar i see it very much as a physical illness something in my brain so maybe i see bpd as an emotional disorder something that is just in my personality hence my fault and my weakness in not dealing with it additionally the fact that childhood abuse is so common with those with bpd makes me feel uncomfortable anddirty like i said i cannot explain it very well i guess i despise the idea that my abusers could still have so much control over me can anyone understand what i am going through my therapist really believes i need to address the bpd along with the bipolar because having both can be confusing and i need to be more aware of which symptom goes with which like i said does anyone understand the feeling of accepting one mental illness but not another bipolar disorder will not ever be cured it is just there an illness i have accepted i will cope with for the rest of my life but can bpd be cured can i move past it i do not know how to accept this i feel so alone,16w7ykf,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,1,['dbt'],"['lamictal', 'gabapentin', 'Lamotrigine', 'Gabapentin']",4,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.9932,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,5,3,This information is very relevant.

Blitzkrieg-333,96,need a place to vent i was diagnosed as bipolar a few years ago i thought it was fitting then because i did have severe mood swings sleep issues and so forth but i feel as if i may not be bipolar but instead borderline please do not jump down my throat as i am not trying to selfdiagnose it just seems different i am a 17 year old male and they cannot make any personality diagnoses until i am 1820 i have never brought this up to any doctor so i am just reaching out to let people hear what i have to say i have been through a lot of stuff in life that is left hard imprints not so much severe one time events but instead unknowingly damaging events that happened for monthsyears i have always had mood swings but the more i grew the more i realized they were not typical bipolar mood swings i understand there is rapidcycling but that still did not fit it i can go from neutral in a good way to violently upset or anxious with a simple sentence from someone that was not derogatoryhurtful at all it is almost as if i split down the middle mood wise i examine what people say to me so heavy that even the slightest things that are not meant to upset me will throw me into suicidal ideation or an internal rage nobody sees it can last for a day or for 5 minutes then i return to normal i am always nervous and i am terrified of being left alone i have a wonderful boyfriend that helps me so much and the only thing i can think of is when he will leave me behind how he will leave me and so on i never let him know this because i will seem looney i am never level headed for more than a few days the slightest thing can send me into a fit of rage that i let nobody see a panic attack dissociation or just a fit of sobbing the drop of a pin could trigger it i use the word dissociation sparingly as i do not experience it unless i swing i feel nothing but an empty rage i do not talk i do not remember doing much etc i am miserable this has only gotten worse i know i am only 17 so please do not tell me that it is just hormones it was never this severe until the events that happened years ago it is only getting worse i am on a mood stabilizer lamictal but it does not do much i feel like therapy is not accomplishing what i wish it would cbt any input is accepted i am just looking for advicesupporta direction to turn,"wj98i2, wj98i2","(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,1,['cbt'],"['lamictal', 'stabilizer', 'Lamotrigine']",3,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.9969,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,2,3,This information is very relevant.

Brightmist,106,so i am struggling again here is me story triggering so i have bpd obviously with severe clinical depression and whole lot of anxiety sprinkled into the mix i am only on lovan fluoxetine 40mgs a day i have previously been on many different antidepressantsanti anxiety medications in the past as well as being on antipsychoticsmood stabilisers i first started on lovan when i was 16 after i tried to kill myself and was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and generalised anxiety disorder i was removed from school and pretty much stayed inside for months under the supervision of mum i am not close to my mum so it was extra shit after those months i went back to school stayed on the lovan but on a higher dosage went to a psychologist regularly until i was 17 and left school met someone moved out with him he treated me like i am as his property i did not know any better he used me mentally abused me raped me quite often even when i was crying and begging him to stop i could not face my parents because i was not close to my mum and i know that they would have been disappointed with my choices so i kept quiet so before then i went from lovan to cipramil to prestique i also got prescribed antipsychotics for short term problems people were always accusing me of having bipolar disorder and saying that no one will ever love me because i am crazy and that my brain is not wired up properly which were the words of my abusive boyfriend which was another reason why i did not leave because i felt like i was not good enough for anyone else pretty much since then i have been on different medications blaming them for me being depressed even though it was my surroundings but i refused to admit it i had different things happen with a lot of trauma a lot of moving being kicked out a lot being abused i finally got the courage to leave him and moved back in with my parents i met someone at a party and ended up in relationship with him for a bit over 3 years he was mentally unwell and we were both just getting worse and worse we loved each other so fucking much but we tore each other a part we fought all of the time screaming matches pushing each other hitting each other this was from 2013 2016 i got a new job in 2015 in a nursing home day shifts and afternoon shifts i started to get really shit at my job so it was obvious that my home life was affecting my work life i got on effexor in 2016 and then the doctors diagnosed me with bpd shortly after and started to prescribe me with valium it was good for when i was overwhelmed with my moods and feelings but god it made me really cloudy i left my boyfriend of over 3 years i told him i did not love him anymore even though i still did but i hated my life with him so i had to rip the bandaid off work got better i starting work afternoons and the nights i got my license and a car and things were going well though i did start sleeping with a lot of random guys and really craved the attention of men i got kicked out of home moved into a share house i then started drinking heavily smoking working only night shifts nursing home slept with a lot more people went to night clubs and did quite a bit of pot this was until 2017 i then quit my job packed all of my belongings into my car and moved up the coast to live and i attempted to study enrolled nursing while i was away i did not know anyone up there i lived with a roommate and i could not get work and had to go on welfare my mental health had gotten really bad i could no longer study i was very suicidal and had regular hospital trips but they would not admit me because i was not bad enough and they did not have enough beds so i pretty much was drugged up most of the time and sent home i was absolutely miserable i attended a place where i had to go to continue to get my welfare money which was good because i met other people that had mental health issues too and they provided job training and opportunities for us the people were beautiful i loved them and it was nice i then started dbt at the hospital there on weekly basis but then i met someone and it went down hill very quickly he had a lovely family and they were very warm which made it harder for me to leave him i was closer to his family than my own he was extremely toxic and he was quite abusive to me mentally and physically but he was obsessed with me and would not let me go and would always go to my house even when i did not want him there he was always there my roommate hated him it took a long time and but i finally got out of it and away from him after he got drunk one night chased after me up the hall at his house picked me up and threw me across the room i had to run home with my things and call a taxi to my place just to get away from him now during this period i was still on effexor but i went from 150mgs to 225mgs and i was on respiridone which knocked me around big time i was super cloudy i could not drive anywhere i could not attend places that i was meant to attend because i could hardly walk to the bloody bathroom but i slowly got used to it and i was slowly getting better to be able to drive again and to attend the places that i needed to attend then i did not have enough money to register my car so i ended up being alone again in a place where i knew no one else but my room mate and a couple of people at the hospital that i attended dbt i still had no job i now had no car and the public transport there was atrocious so i got really suicidal again from being isolated and i ended up in hospital and then was transferred to public mental health unit even further up the coast while i was in the mental health unit they weened me off effexor and respiridone in a matter of days and put me on lovan and lamotrigine it was horrendous the side effects were horrible from withdrawing from 2 meds and going on 2 other meds i threw up every day hardly ate anything cried constantly until they gave me some valium to shut me up for a few hours my parents came and took me back to my home town and i had to stay with them for a while i got a used car thanks to my grandfather i got help and travelled back up the coast to retrieve the rest of my things and ended the lease on the house where i was staying up there i was getting used to my medications and things were ok this was mid 2018 late 2018 i met someone but i took it extra slow i was not ready and he respected that but i really think he had a thing for girls with issues and it kind of weirded me out so i kept my distance but he was there when i needed him and was absolutely caring very trust worthy and i could not ask for anything else in a friend who i did end up being in a relationship with we are now together and are best friends we moved to a few places and finally settled in our own place with just us 2 in late 2019 i am now only on lovan and things are ok i have a new job and a new car and so does he we got a cat and everythings ok but my brain will not shut up i am getting agitated again i am getting really sad again and i have turned back to drinking heavily everyday after work to sedate myself except last night i drunk that much that i could not go to work today and i am disgusted with myself i do not want to go back on antipsychotics i cannot go to a higher dosage on lovan i cannot go on effexor because my highs are way to dangerous when i am on it and i do horrible things when i am manic i do not know what to do everythings ok around me but my brain is still not wired right i dream about my

Budget-Respect6315,111,living with untreated bpd this is my first time posting to reddit i usually just enjoy wandering around different subreddits and browsing but i like coming here when i feel down and out and it is gotten to the point where i feel like i should post something i have been around medication and therapists since my freshman year in high school for the majority of this time i was always diagnosed with depression and this was around the time my grandfather died so i could see this as being a fitting description of my personality back then i knew nothing of bpd in high school i was given lexapro to help cope with my depression but it made everything a lot worse and i was constantly depressed and suicidal after the pills started kicking in during the summer i spent almost a whole month locked up in my room avoiding any sort of social contact and cutting myself on a daily basis it was really bad once i got off of the medication things started to look up for me i met someone and got into a relationship that was calm and comfortable for a while it was my first good relationship in a long time at least in the beginning i have a lot of really trademark symptoms of bpd especially when it comes to relationships i am attached and idealize the person i am with a lot but i have always been extremely loyal and i had never started to make messes in my relationships until i saw that the connection was fading i am very much the kind of person who cannot let go of something that is dying and just accept its end i have to hold on for all i can after a year of dating this boy and i were very happy with each other but he was graduating high school early and planning on going out of the country for a year he never broke up with me before his departure he merely got progressively distant as the day he was supposed to leave neared we spent the last day together and had a teary goodbye but like i said he never told me that our relationship was over and i am not even sure he considered it to be over until he was out of the country for a while he even sent me a letter in his first month signed love g so naturally i thought we were still together until i got a prompt email in february that explained his desire to move on and that that was his intent all along i was devastated but there was nothing i could really do with him so far away and so far from email or a phone i learned to just go on without him for the next five months until he came to my house the day after he came home i would like to say that i was mostly fine until i saw him when he came to my house to say hello after a year of being gone i just wanted him back and i could not understand his petty ambiguous reasons for leaving the next year really exposed my bpd tendencies i feel like i went crazy i tried everything under the sun to get him back and i even let him take advantage of me because i was convinced sex was love i yelled at him and called him crying trying to understand where everything went wrong and i blamed myself constantly and manipulated him into feeling bad i used self harm and suicide to try to get him to care about me again and eventually i had to leave my first year of college away from home and enroll in my hometown school while i recovered at my parents house things started looking up as the new semester started i started dating other people and i had a really good circle of friends who were there for me through everything i was doing well in school so things were starting to look up significantly i had started a combination of prozac and abilify to treat my deep depression and i was given these pills the spring before i came home and they seemed to be working very well for me fast forward to this year it has been almost two years since being given the combination of prozac and abilify i am currently in my spring semester of my third year in college and last semester i had a lot of difficulty dealing with my emotions and moods i barely went to class or work and i was struggling through every aspect of my life i was pulling an allnighter every week in a desperate attempt to get all of my work done because i was flooded with lack of motivation and an inability to concentrate i was taking the same doses as before so i did not understand where this was all coming from i was so inundated by my responsibilities that i was feeling extreme forms of stress and in a random spell of trichtillomania i pulled out all of my eyelashes within the course of two weeks i was seeing a psychiatrist at the time and she was putting me on lamictal while trying to take me off the prozac and abilify i felt like i was going to burst so in my flighty state i stopped going to my psychiatrist and stopped taking medication altogether i felt extremely tired and low within the month and a half that followed and i know this probably has to do with cutting myself off from the medicine so suddenly but at the time i felt like there was no other way i was happy with the result of everything after getting off my medication and i felt more lively and more like myself spring semester has started and i feel like i am overwhelmed by all the stress in my life i feel like i never have enough money for anything my relationships with my friends are deteriorating as time goes on i very much feel more angry and irritable on a daily basis and i am so stuck within my negative thoughts that i constantly feel like i am going to cry i am in an amazing relationship with someone i love but i am always scared i am doing something wrong or that i am going to be to blame if everything falls apart i feel like i lash out at my parents for just being concerned with how i am doing i do not like talking about anything i go to a therapist once a week but most times i end up skipping class afterwards because i get so ashamed of myself and depressed most of all i am unsure of who i am and i greatly dislike whoever i am i cannot escape from the eyes of others and i am constantly worried about what people think of me i do not ever feel relaxed i feel constantly sad and horrified about everything in life even before without medication i feel like things have not been this bad in terms of the way i perceive myself i thankfully do not think of suicide anymore but i am constantly trying to escape in some way and i often fantasize about running away and forgetting everything i do not want to go back on medication because the process is so slow and arduous and i do not want to be disappointed with another medication that stops working i just do not know what to do anymore to make myself feel better i never want to do anything all i ever want to do is sleep in order to avoid all of my problems i do not know what advice i am really asking for i just wonder if anyone knows this awful feeling and if anyone knows the best way to evaluate life and this disorder without being completely overwhelmed,1cd82v2,"(0, 0, 0,

Butterfly-Bitch-,112,question regarding lamotrigine and increased anxiety i am going to start this with my actual question and then provide some context has anyone gone through an increase in anxiety starting lamotrigine and if so what if anything were you able to do about it context back in march i was sent to an adult adhd specialist for years i was bouncing between adhd meds and was looking to finally lock something down along with this i have suffered from depression the last year and a half from an awful breakup i have been doing therapy mostly for trust issues and while it is been a long road i can say i am getting better when i went for my appointment i got a bit of a slap in the face after filling out some questionnaires and doing a few reaction tests i was put in an office where i had a skype appointment with the doctor this was just as covid was ramping up this entire conversation lasted a total of 1015 minutes and consisted of this doctor i had never met before telling me along with adhd i had bpd at the time i had no idea what bpd and in this 10 minute appointment not much was explained to me the doctor sent me out the door with a prescription for adderall 10mg now 20mg and lamotriginegradual increase to 100mg i am waiting for my therapists office to reopen from covid to get a second opinion being completely honest i have been keeping all this in my back pocket until i get that second opinion my therapist knows about this new diagnosis and has me top of the list for a second assessment once they reopen but for the most part we have agreed to focus on my initial depression and trust issue during our phone call appointments the reason i am more laid back on it is my therapist who has known me 2 years did not exactly sound too confident of that diagnosis by the doctor who met me for 15 minutes tops about 25 months ago i started noticing i was clenching my jaw biting my tongue and lip this was to the point id be leaving teeth marks on my tongue or getting aggressive pain in my back teeth before i even caught on i was doing it the first thing i did was call my family doctor and ask to be switched off adderall i knew anxiety was a side effect it was a brand new medication so felt like the right place to start a month went by and it got worse next i thought maybe the thoughts of bpd hanging over my head were causing me increased anxiety so i booked an appointment with my therapist specially to talk about that the truth with that is i am at peace with the idea i may have bpd if it turned out to be true it would finally give a name to what i have been going through and give me something to attack for lack of a better word to this point covid also has not increased my anxiety i took up a new hobby of collecting basketball cards and have actually turned quite a nice profit while building up a personal collection of my favorite players next my family doctor started me on buspirone 10mg 3x day along with 12 50mg trazodone before bed to help me sleep today marks 6 weeks on buspirone and while i have gotten better at noticing when i am locking up my jaw it is still consistent i just use the heads up to start chewing on a piece of gum until i go do something to distract myself gym walk basketball etc i know this was a long walk for a short drink of water but wanted to provide context for this question i am running out of options of things in the last few months that have caused this sudden increase in anxiety my next thought after exhausting every option listed above is call my family doctor and begin scaling back my lamotrigine until i get in for the second assessment because when things began to peak 25 months ago was right around when i hit my current dose of 100mg but before doing that i wanted to stop by here and get some feedback thank you for any insight,16w7ykf,"(1, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,0,[],"['lamotrigine', 'trazodone', 'adderall', 'trazodone', 'buspirone', 'buspirone', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Amphetamine', 'Amphetamine', 'Buspirone', 'Trazodone', 'Buspirone', 'Lamotrigine']",14,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.9856,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,5,3,This information is very relevant.

Cexiny,123,lamictal effects hey about two months ago i started lamictal and now i am at 75mg i am also on luvox 200mg and adderall 20mg i would been having issues with sleep some days could not fall asleep at all others would sleep 12 hours and mood swings obviously so my psych wanted to try it out to be fair i have always been tired but now i feel sleepy all the time at least before i started lamictal if i was too restless to sleep or got sleep i could usually function without just thinking about how sleepy i am as for my sleep schedule it is more consistent but i consistently sleep too little 35 hours a night but i sometimes nap in addition my mood is definitely more stable but i still have mood swings it is more that my mood swings are just far far less extreme than they were but they are still present at first i thought it could be a good thing but recently i am feeling more and more zombielike my cat just died and i have been sporadically crying but i do not feel much at all my eyes will just water for a minute and then stop but i will not really get the emotional release of crying i cannot remember feeling very happy or very anxious or very anything recently i feel like i am just thinking of what emotional response i would have in a situation and then acting it out my mood changes frequently but it can be almost unnoticeable in intensity other than that i have been a bit more sensitive to light and just feel weird overall i described it to my psych as a dreamlike state where things do not seem entirely real i am on a very low dose so this is weird does anyone else have similar experiences with lamictal most of the stuff i have seen talks about how helpful it is and i agree that it is stabilizing but damn i would rather feel my emotions and process them than just not have them at all could these effects lessen with more time,ygo6n5,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['lamictal', 'luvox', 'adderall', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Fluvoxamine', 'Amphetamine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine']",9,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.2001,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,1,2,This information is relevant.

CornsOnMyFeets,144,some questions about bpd long scattered post but please read pretty long post and might be hard to make sense of because i am a very scatterbrained adhd riddled person i would appreciate if you could read through and provide input i just read a comment from a psychiatrist that said if you think you have borderline personality disorder you probably do not how true is this the more i read into bpd the more i suspect i have it i will try to sum up some of my symptoms and why i suspect i might have bpd i probably will not even scratch the surface but i will try i grew up in a not so good environment my dad dealt with severe mental illness and at the time was very unstable throughout my childhood they separated soon after i was born but they lived across the street from each other so from my earliest memories i watched my dad verbally abuse my mother frequently who is the sweetest and would never do anything to truly deserve it i grew up listening to him belittle her and call her horrible the names i do not know if this is relevant but this is just an insight to one of the reasons i could have developed it i do not know anyways throughout my childhood and teenager years i saw many doctors counselors psychiatrists the problem is from a very young age i learned how to manipulate my mood disorders to others away from my mom and some of my family i could mostly control outbursts although in public they happened occasionally i was especially good at pretending to be normal infront of doctors and would deny all of the issues my mom brought up most of the times the doctors would dismiss me as a regular kid that had some slight mood issues although i did receive a few diagnosiss of bi polar and a lot of diagnosiss of adhd i never took the medication i was prescribed as a child which includes lithium and ritalin to name a few along with severe mood swings i suffered from bad adhd as i said previous along with horrible anxiety from a very young age school was hell to me as a child and it lasted all the way up until i dropped out of school it was truly a nightmare from kindergarten onward i can recall fighting my mom to go to school not long after that i was always dealing with the school administration and eventually it would come to court and probation due to truancy it was so bad that i did not care the consequences and would not go when i did go i could never focus probably due to adhd and anxiety as i said i dropped out in early high school and eventually in my teenage years i turned to alcohol then drugs which were mostly silly over the counter things but none the less it was a mostly everyday thing eventually it would turn into hard drugs that resulted in me stealing and other random crimes which was never like me to ever do i would do all of this to fit in with the crowd around me that i found because most of the time being under the influence resulted in no anxiety for me which was so surreal and no decision making either this got me into a lot of legal trouble and most recently resulted in me doing a lot of jail time fast forward nearly a year i have been sober since and do not have any cravings to use or anything like that but the crippling anxiety and mood swings have only gotten worse to the point where i do not leave the house much i am always aggressive and yelling at the family member for no reason and i do not understand why in the moment i feel like i mean the terrible things i say but then when i can force myself to stop and think about it i realize most of what i was mad about was irrational and tell myself i will quit that nonsense for good but it is an everyday thing that seems to be a loop i hate it i have too much anxiety to even apply for a job i have only ever held a couple jobs and the best part is the longest i worked at any one of those was a couple of days my anxiety gets the best of me and despite being on nearly every anti depressant there is along with other medications such as my current regimen of lamictal morning has even come close to helping besides perhaps ativan or xanax but of course i have never had more than a couple of days of a prescription so i do not know if it would have been helpful long term most recently within the last two years i saw a psychiatrist very briefly that did not seem to think i had the bipolar i had been diagnosed with previous to that because i never had a case of mania i had agreed and brought up bpd that at the time i had just briefly read about she quickly dismissed that without even a discussion so i dropped it up until recently so many of the symptoms fit in with me especially that no treatment has even scratched the surface not counseling and especially not medication but alas i suspect that i probably do not have it for the sole reason that it seems as though you do not usually recognize what is wrong with you and maybe for the worse i all to well know what is wrong with me and what i do wrong whether it be right after or some time after it is a horrible feeling that eats at me,12xrl1n,"(2, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,0,[],"['lamictal', 'xanax', 'ativan', 'lithium',

Due-Law5717,199,my experience with lamictallamotrigine this is going to be a very long post because i want to be thorough when i was researching lamictal before i took it i found it helpful to read about peoples experiences and i want to cover every aspect i can think of so here we go i have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder for roughly 5 years although i knew i had it long before that and have always struggled to gain access to necessary medication i was initially prescribed wellbutrin and buspirone then later on lexapro all of which were not even remotely helpful in managing my bpd symptoms despite asking multiple doctors about the possibility of a mood stabilizer my requests were rejected on the basis that i do not have a diagnosed mood disorder i was frustrated by that as i know many borderline folks have experienced relief from extreme mood swings and the intensity of their episodes with the use of a mood stabilizer two years ago i was prescribed low dose ativan then xanax both of which helped mildly at controlling the severity of my episodes but not the frequency or duration of them just to be clear when i am referring to episodes i mean when i am triggered past any level of higher reasoning and i exhibit temporary extreme dissociativepsychotic behaviors and that last for several hours and on occasion days i know episodes look different for everyone but i just want to be clear as this is a medical review lol at long last i found a psychiatrist that recommended i start lamictal a medication used to manage seizures in folks with epilepsy and to stabilize mood in folks with bipolar disorder he explained to me that lamictal has very few side effects in most people both short and long term but that there is the possibility of developing a life threatening rash while adjusting to the medication because of this there is a long titration period to avoid that possibility he also told me that in the 35 years of his practice he has seen the greatest success rate with lamictal for borderline folks as compared to other mood stabilizers as a side note he also prescribed me low dose klonopinclonazepam to help manage daily anxiety so keep in mind that might skew my ability to accurately measure how lamictal has helped me as i am not taking it alone i take 05 mg of klonopin most days although i do occasionally take 1 mg if i am having a particularly bad day or an anxiety attack and i occasionally skip a dose if i feel like i will not need it that day aka i am not leaving the house while waiting for my prescription to come in i did some research i was mostly interested in peoples anecdotes though i did also check out a few studies the use of lamictal for folks with bpd is considered off label so there is not a tremendous amount of research in that area i was pleasantly surprised to find that many folks consider lamictal a wonder drug and very few reported negative side effects of any kind at worst they got the rash and therefore had to end treatment and for others it simply did nothing i did not read any anecdotal reports of bpd symptoms worsening i felt confident in beginning the treatment myself i started off taking 25 mg for two weeks 50 for two weeks 75 for two weeks 100 for one week 150 for one week and finally reaching the therapeutic dose of 200 mg which is the dose i currently take so on to the actual review i have experienced zero side effects of noteno rash no increased appetite no more headaches than usual no fatigue or insomnia it has always been difficult for me to compare how i am doing now to the past as i experience strong emotional impermanence and have almost zero recall of how i have felt in the past to compare to how i feel now here is what i know for sure while i still spiral as much as ever i have experienced a marked reduction in the frequency and severity of my episodes i did not notice the change until i reached 150 mg and at 200 i feel i can actually say there is a difference i am used to going from 0 to 100 when there is a strong trigger and i would say i now go from 0 to 80 that might not sound like much but to me this is an enormous relief i feel i have just enough time to even attempt a coping mechanism or two before the episode becomes too severe to do anything but just ride it out my only complaint is that it takes so long to titrate up and the changes were so gradual that i personally found it very difficult to know if it was making any sort of difference i have had to think long and hard about how i am doing now compared to before taking it but i feel i can say that it has been effective for me right now i am going through some absolutely traumatic life events and i have managed to stay relatively calm throughout i am grieving terribly but so far i have only had one episode when typically i would experience them almost daily when under this amount of stress to me that shows a fairly dramatic change consider asking your doctor about lamictal if you have not experienced any relief from other medications it might not work for you but beyond the rash the risk is markedly low as compared to other mood stabilizers i feel it has been quite effective in reducing the severity of my more extreme symptoms although i have not noticed a significant reduction of milder or comorbid symptoms aka anxiety low self worth thought loops splitting etc as a side note in no way am i suggesting that that anxietysplittingmaladative thought patterns are less impactful on daily living amp massively painfulbut for me personally i consider them less severe as they are a daily reality that i work to manage but do not because me the same extreme distress that my episodes do that is just me though lamictal does not prevent me in any way from feeling triggered but has given me some space to actually address the triggers and communicate before going nuclear and tearing my relationships to shreds to me it is not exactly a wonder drug but i have been impressed with its efficacy so far,1b92zml,"(2, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,0,[],"['lexapro', 'lamictal', 'wellbutrin', 'xanax', 'ativan', 'buspirone', 'klonopin',

Early-Description319,206,i do not fit neatly into a box but that is ok i am bigger and better than any box you put me in i recently had an episode of sh chronic emptiness dissociation suicidal ideation without any real intention just emotionless practicality i have no clue how many times i have been down this road but it is as familiar as it is comforting and as saddening as it is frustrating i am right here and now a 33 year old female who 3 years ago moved from the uk and utterly shit mental healthcare available on the nhs mixed with a tiny bit of privately paid for better quality psychiatric care to australia private healthcare incredible psychiatric care therapy programmes and private hospitalisation available to me 247 when i left the uk i carried with me a diagnosis of possible bipolar disorder and possible bpd but the only confirmed illness my uk doctors had been happy to label me with was major depressive disorder i was unable to access the specialists needed in the uk to investigate bpd or bipolar further despite having been hospitalised for a severe psychotic mania for 3 weeks at one point and another time disappearing because of delusional thinking for a week and ending up stabbing myself in the leg and because of this 90 of my care was via my family gp who would not prescribe anything beyond antidepressants as a result from age 11 to age 29 my life was a complete catastrophe of depression self harm multiple suicide attempts reckless and dangerous behaviour law breaking turbulent relationships and catastrophic self image i am not exaggerating even one ounce when i say i am genuinely baffled that i survived and did not manage to complete a suicide attempt get myself murdered by putting myself all of 5ft 4 of tiny flimsy female in horrifically dangerous situations with men i did not know or accidentally overdose on one of my frequent cocktails of uppers downers psychedelics and opiates at that changed when i moved to aus and got private healthcare as that is just the way here the move triggered a very dark depressive episode with suicidality and i was admitted to a private specialist psychiatric hospital for the first time in my life at age 30 that is when i met my current psychiatrist and he took one look at my previous medical records from the uk literally rolled his eyes so hard you could hear them rattle and told me he was going to evaluate me again from scratch i left the hospital 4 weeks later with a firm bpd diagnosis mdd and bipolar nos i also had a drug regimen that included mood stabilisers and drugs to help with my anxiety fast forward 25 years at my last psych appointment at the end of last week emergency meeting to discuss adjusting my drug and treatment regimen after my sh episode my first for a year previously unheard of my pdoc fiancé and i finally had a really in depth discussion about diagnosis labels and he explained that the reason he has never labelled me bipolar 1 or 2 although he would be tempted if forced to place as type 1 was for 2 reasons 1 i seem to have an atypical reaction to antidepressants compared to the vast majority of bipolar patients as they do not appear to push me into mania my episodes that could be said to be manic or hypomanic appear to be unaffected by them and fluoxetine prozac is actually currently a vital part of my medication regimen 2 secondly even though i have had two prior episodes that he would definitely call manic with psychosis andor delusional thinking as i was not under his care then and have freely admitted being a raging consumer of illegal pharmaceuticals in my 20s when these both happened he cannot with complete certainty rule out the possibility of these both having been drug induced separate to a bipolar episode i appear to have an atypical level of success with certain drugs in general my bpd symptoms are managed quite effectively with drugs prescribed typically for bipolar disorder and in conjunction with antidepressants and anxiolytics he thinks this is because of the severity of the depressive episodes i experience which are actually more in line with the mdd or the severity and frequency of depression experienced by type two bipolar sufferers it really got me thinking that ultimately while obviously useful to a degree in helping categorise and treat our illnesses these labels which we are assigned for treatment purposes have a very high risk of becoming the beall and endall of how we self identify i see myself as a borderlinebipolar person and i have this habit of viewing my entire life and all the experiences within it as being attributed to or symptomatic of my illnesses but my psychiatrist explained to me that even he does not view me like that he views me as a collection of symptoms and his job is to try to treat those symptoms in a way that best suits me so he does not give a shit if sodium valproate or lithium or seroquel or lamotrigine or prozac or propanolol or xanax or diazepam or even ect which i have had twice or olanzapine works best for me he does not care what it is supposed to be prescribed for dbt or cbt does not matter as long as it helps me he is not hung up on labels his job is to find a solution to best treat all of my destructive or inappropriate symptoms and from there help me function to the best of my ability in my public and private life he really made me realise that i should not be so hung up on what my diagnosis is either we are more than a label we are all the sum of many parts we may identify with and relate to each other but we are all different our experiences ultimately do not have to fellow the same path what i am trying to say is that subs and communities like these are an amazing resource of information and comfort from similarly minded individuals we may share many feelings and experiences but we are not all the same and we are not just bpd or bipolar or depression sufferers those are the illnesses we carry with us but they are not us since that chat with my pdoc something inside me has changed not and now i am miraculously cured bullshit but by changing the way i see myself as a person first and having illnesses second i have been able to recover much quicker from my recent episode than i think i have before per my pdocs suggestion i started keeping a list of daily habits and checking them off each day stuff i would normally do but not even think about it like get dressed shower eat brush teeth etc and i tick them off every day it makes me mindful of the positive things i do every day to function as a good normal human being and to remember to give myself credit for them and then i write down any extra things i do like leaving the house cleaning out a cupboard or teaching one of my dogs a new trick it helps me realise that this illness that i feel has taken over my life has not actually won i am still inside here in my head somewhere i am still me i am not a walking personification of my illnesses i am a bright intelligent funny capable person i am sexy and i look awesome i am a brilliant cook and i am an excellent mother to my three fur babies i have good hygiene and cool curly hair that people are envious of i write well i read interesting books i am a fountain of seemingly useless but fascinating information if you are struggling today and feel weighted down by your diagnosis if it feels all encompassing and it defines who you are stop for a second take a moment to remember that it is a collection of symptoms and each one has a method of management it may be something different for you than it is for anyone else do not come to these subs and forums for the wrong reasons do not come here to have your negative self image validated come here for support and to take inspiration from how others find ways to cope so that you can find the right solution for you drugs activities therapy routines meditation creative outlets every one of us is unique and our management techniques will be unique too do not lose yourself in your labels you are so much more so many more parts than one word or an acronym just like your illness is when you refuse to give that label power anymore you open your mind and your heart to taking on each symptom one at a time and then you will start to realise that you are far more powerful than the thing you are trying to fight i want to point out i am not claiming to be fixed or even that i have gotten anything under control this is going to take time and constant effort two days ago i had an episode of rage over a mcdonalds drive thru order that the dumb fucks got wrong and i did not realise till i got home i smashed a few plates and kicked a hole in a door but you know what i also did i managed not to sh and i still showered brushed my teeth walked my dogs did a load of laundry and later on i baked some ginger biscuits and all those things went on the good habitsachievements list a day later yesterday instead of beating myself up for the rage episode i focussed on how i still managed to do good things that day and how now i get to go choose a couple of new plates maybe even a set from target i love shopping and how my fiancé went to the hardware store and bought an identical replacement door pre painted for 75 and had it replaced within 10 minutes nbd if you read this far i hope my story helps you in some way to strengthen your resolve to never stop fighting to give yourself permission to make mistakes and to give yourself credit for even the tiniest things because every positive and productive thing you do even just combing your hair or washing up a cup is one thing your illness did not stop you doing today start adding all those little things up and you will start to realise you are so much more than a mentally ill person that does not mean it will ever go away for most of us this is for life but it means a happier life where you are in control of your illness

that it encourages open emotional expression as opposed to emotion regulation and is for overcontrolled people cluster c avoidant ocd instead of undercontrolled b bpd narcissistic etc because i have extreme bouts of anger to the point of screaming and breaking things it is pretty needless to say that i have never considered this kind of therapy initially they thought that prolonged exposure

none of my friends seem to believe i have mental health problems because aside from lapses in my social involvement i seem fine when i am actually around everyone despite my many explanations and admissions of my struggles at home i only explode around my boyfriend never at work never at school never with anyone other than him and every other boyfriend i considered this a borderline trait but she seemed extremely surprised that i can go from a huge fight screaming and crying then appear at work 15 minutes later and be able to chit chat with coworkers despite secretly wanting to die this is generally my life i feel very uncomfortable and different but i am good at being funny talking expressively and making selfdeprecating jokes i know i am uptight and can be a perfectionist however i have not completed my ba because i keep dropping out due to depression i do and have done a lot of drugs i drink a lot am and have always been promiscuous and generally impulsive perfectionists are successful right i am a broke waitress i cannot even get out of bed i give up on everything i begin i am also a compulsive oversharer it is a joke among my coworkers and people that know me that i would read everyone my diary if i had the chance i connect with people all the time then the therapist asked me how do you feel when you are telling people these personal things do you feel closer to them do you feel connected to them i realized i do not i still feel very far away from people despite my frantic attempts at intimacy i tell them all about myself but i will laugh or smile when talking about childhood trauma or sexual assault she explained that you can share without connecting especially when your emotional expression does not fit the words i am saying vulnerable things because i am terrified of actually being vulnerable this is why i drink so much socially and why i will do drugs socially which even so i have been told i am a reserved drunk and that i am a serious person albeit a very funny one i am constantly aware of my appearance and generally find myself unattractive despite being told i am beautiful and getting considerable attention for my appearance throughout my adult life i have had an onagainoffagain eating disorder for over 10 years and a relentless preoccupation with my weight despite being 1 above the underweight bmi i will not try new things around people i never feel like i let loose if one thing goes wrong i abandon a project i was once asked to do vocals for a band and had to drink vodka beforehand and would still be singing too quietly i was terrified and frozen i refuse to practice anything around anyone she suggested that my depression and mood disorder could possibly stem from being overly controlled that because i cannot let loose and i feel like things absolutely have to be a certain way i paralyze myself and cannot progress she suggested that this is why i have not pursued a career and why i have never shared my creative writing on a lighter note that this is why i refuse to do karaoke she also suggested that the reason i explode on my boyfriend and those in the past is because they are the ones to actually see me vulnerable i no longer have total control over my living environment he see me in my pajamas on the couch at noon he sees me sleep past 1 i cannot posture myself around him so i am scared and i resent him he is going to leave me because he knows what i am actually like i spent the rest of the day in shock i am still processing it which is partially why i wrote this i am starting rodbt next

EmLee-96,218,advice on sleep regulation so i figure this is probably the best place to ask for bpdrelated advice but i guess i do not really know some lengthy backstory on my circumstances gti am a career insomniac since i was a toddler basically and have always had difficulty waking in the morning as well regardless of when i do successfully fall asleep this has always had a negative impact on my performance in basically everything i used to be able to pull allnighters in order to be on time for important things scheduled in the morning i did this frequently throughout college but this is less and less the case and i know it is bad for me anyway as i entered my 20s high stress drug use and i am assuming most of all genetic factors contributed to a decline in my mental health my emotions started to become erratic and my sleep schedule worsened things came to a head when during a period of high stress about two years ago i began to hear voices they were mostly benign but it scared me to death and i went to my doctor he diagnosed it as depression with psychotic features and prescribed me clonazepam and aripiprazole i started at 5mg of the abilify but experienced highly unpleasant akathisia and dropped the dose to 25mg in combination with 100mg quetiapine the quetiapine made me feel like shit so we got rid of that altogether and my symptoms seemed managed on the 25mg abilify the klonopin worked fine and helped with my anxiety to the point i am now 22 a few months ago towards the beginning of the covid outbreak in the us another period of high stress during which i was sent home from school and my job prospects fell apart i began to experience new symptoms i would go days with little sleep feeling incredible productive sociable and driven i would spend money recklessly then i would become incredibly depressed andor listless and aimless and sleep for most of the day for lack of motivation to do anything else there were points at which i was essentially catatonic i do not know why i ignored these warning signs but i carried on like this for a few weeks until things came to a head when my longtime girlfriend broke up with me one morning the voices came back but i tried to just shut them out i could not be bothered to seek help anymore at that point i guess it was only when the hallucinations became more vivid to the point that i could no longer distinguish them from reality that i worried then i started to see things vivid visual hallucinations i still refused to seek help only once my mother found me asleep on the living room floor in a particularly bad depressive episode was i forced to seek help ultimately the hallucinations subsided of their own accord as i got my stress levels under control the periodic mood swings did not and it was ruining my life at this point i had done my research and was fully aware that i was suffering from bipolar disorder i was fortunate enough to have a family friend familiar with a nearby psychiatrist specializing in psychotic disorders i was referred and got an appointment quickly i consider this an act of some higher power as i had suspected he diagnosed me with schizoaffective bpd 2 he suggested some medications including lithium and lamotriginelt the more pertinent bit i did my research and decided on the lamotrigine and began dose titration shortly thereafter i recently got up to the goal dosage of 100mg and my symptoms have largely dissipated however i still experience periods of sleeplessness maybe every two days it severely impacts every facet of my life and i feel like it is causing my mental state to take another turn for the worse furthermore i am trying to secure a job i know that i will not be able to hold the job if i cannot regulate my erratic sleep schedule i can tell my parents worry but do not know what to do i have over the years tried everything under the sun prescription and otherwise to help with my sleep and have only found two things that will both allow me to fall asleep in a timely manner and force me to wake up at a reasonable hour alcohol which i know will ultimately because much more harm than good if i attempt longterm selfmedication with it and ghb which seems more practicable ghb however is illicit and fairly expensive at the dosage i would require to medicate i am aware however that ghb is occasionally prescribed for narcolepsy at a fairly low dose i am considering asking my gp who is aware of my situation if he will prescribe me a buttload of narcolepsy meds i think he may be open to it as he knows i have tried almost every alternative however being realistic this is a longshot i was wondering if anyone here has any nonmedication strategies they use to regulate bpdrelated disordered sleep i am fairly desperate at this

Enolamo,221,brain fog at 75mg lamictal i am looking for advice on where to go from here with lamictal being helpful but also giving me irritating brain fog i have been on lamictal since february until may it was 25mg a day because i switched doctors in that time in may i went up to 50 mg then in june i went up to 75 mg which i have been at for 6 weeks or so i was prescribed it for bipolar ii and for bpd about two weeks ago i noticed more brain fog than normal every time i went up in dose before i had brain fog for maybe a week then it went away this time it has not gone away and persists sometimes drinking caffeine gets rid of that but most of the time caffeine only helps slightly and prior to the 75mg lamictal i almost never drank caffeine it is really annoying because i also have adhd so it basically feels like it is made all those symptoms worse it often takes so much effort to think about anything i feel like i cannot focus on even thinking reading is even harder than because i cannot focus on the words and sometimes it takes a few seconds to grasp the words i am still able to think intelligently come up with good ideas etc and i am not confused it is just my brain feels slow and foggy sometimes i have trouble remembering things or remembering words which never happened before any more than the average person all of that is really frustrating because i am a very active and productive person and all of that has been harder lately i also feel tired or unmotivated often and it makes me so frustrated sometimes that i start crying it is also frustrating because the lamictal is really helping my phq9 score went from 24 down to 12 since at 75mg my anxiety has been a lot better my bipolar seems calm as far as i can tell and my bpd is so so much better i am actually able to be relatively calm about my fp and my suicidal feelings have mostly gone away which is really nice i do not know what i want my doctor to do though the brain fog is so annoying but i am afraid of trying another mood stabilizer because this one helps so well with minimal side effects and i tend to have bad side effects on meds i have taken zoloft celexa and hydroxyzine and all of them had such horrible side effects and made me feel so much worse so i had to stop all of them so i am terrified of trying new meds and because i respond so poorly to most of them i guess i am just looking advice for where i should go from here my psychiatrist who prescribed the meds is okay but i am always terrified of doctors not actually helping me feel better has anyone else had an experience like this on a med and if so what did you do,1acmhn7,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['zoloft', 'lamictal', 'celexa', 'hydroxyzine', 'stabilizer', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Sertraline', 'Citalopram', 'Hydroxyzine']",13,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.9677,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,6,2,This information is relevant.

FelSpace,253,nexplanon brought back my bpd tldr if you are on nexplanon please consider the side effects i learned about bpd through reddit of all places when a bunch of armchair psychologists threw out the term to describe a woman depicted in a meme out of sheer curiosity i read about it on wikipedia and was horrified when i realized most of the symptoms described what it was like for me to live every day i was officially diagnosed in 2016 started a mood stabilizer lamictal and got into intensive dbt for 6 months it was during this time that i worked through a lot of childhood trauma and ptsd from early adulthood i got better and better and eventually felt i was in remission this carried on for nearly 4 years birth control has many effects on women regardless of their mental health once i was on the mood stabilizer i realized that i felt different when on or off of certain birth controls this is because estrogenic birth controls actually inhibit the bodys ability to break down lamictal and in turn it becomes less effective the most pronounced of these was ortho tri cyclen lo when i stopped taking it i noticed a huge improvement in my mood suddenly i was much more confident could focus better and felt more talkative as someone who has had my fair share of adventures i knew that being in a hormonal contraceptive was a necessity i elected to go on the nuvaring which dampened some of the confidenceboldness i gained from coming off of ortho tricyclen lo still i was happy and if i was consistently exercising i was doing pretty well i got off of birth control entirely for a while due to dating a woman and then dating someone who was waiting for marriage when both of those relationships ended i decided to go with nexplanon since it is a progesteronebased birth control and should not affect lamictal the way estrogen does within the first few days of it being implanted into my arm i felt enraged i remember consciously saying to myself that i felt like my bpd had returned still i was stubborn and wanted to stay on some form of birth control as i was in a relationship with a man weird bpd symptoms started popping up again uncontrollable anger splitting and feelings of emptiness it cost me one of my relationships and it was not until a couple of weeks ago when i realized i was about to lose another partner yet again it had gotten much worse i began having dissociative episodes while arguing with my current partner nearly every day some of the arguments were justified others were not part of me wonders if the side effects became more severe after i lost weight after getting nexplanon my weight shot up to 145 lbs i rapidly lost 15 lbs over the span of a month and a half or so meaning that the dosage of hormone i was now receiving was most likely higher than it had been previously my current partner pointed out to me that his sister and ex had struggled with nexplanon due to mood issues i took a hard look in the mirror and realized that i was exhibiting symptoms of bpd again i was ashamed of myself i will say that removing it has made a huge difference in my basal stress levels i no longer feel like everyone is so fucking annoyingstupidwrong all the time i feel relaxed for the first time in a long time my point for writing all of this is to warn other women who are looking into this birth control i have never been on anything that has made me so angry before it was terrifying and my relationship is still mending because of it and also for other reasons related to not disclosing my bpd,12xrl1n,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,1,['dbt'],"['lamictal', 'stabilizer', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine']",5,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.7623,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,3,3,This information is very relevant.

Few_Zookeepergame105,255,experience taking lamotrigine i recently went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed lamotrigine a mood stabilizer i had a huge episode of borderline rage and it really pushed me to see a psychiatrist my regular therapist said it was a good idea as long as i did not intend to stay on it forever which i do not he also said that since we were beginning to get into deeper stuff in therapy doing less damage control and going deep into my upbringing the mood stabilizer will help manage stress and other emotions i will be feeling as a result of this i started lamotrigine on 25mg for two weeks and i am about to go up another 25mg as prescribed my psychiatrist said with this medication it takes a long time to get to a therapeutic dose anyone taking this how much are you on as a therapeutic dose also side effects i have been having are dizziness when standing up too fast more tired at the end of the day heart palpitations loss of appetite though i am making a point to consciously think about when i need to eat so it is not really an issue losing my train of thought what are other side effects you all experienced going further into medication the positives i have significantly cut down on drinking though i do not know that you are really supposed to drink at all on this medication i went from binge drinking 34 days a week to having one or two drinks about twice a week i have not gotten drunk at all i am actually able to contain my emotions and have not had borderline rage or feelings that are too intense since starting i do not know if it is a placebo effect of just knowing i am on the medication a result of being more tired and not really having the energy for that or the medication already having a positive effect i have gotten other parts of my life together and overall feel like an improved person looking for a new apartment decluttering managing money well also not spending so much on alcohol and consolidating amp refinancing my loans i can tell i have a better sense of selfworth maybe just as a result of taking charge of this i am supposed to go up to 50mg in three days i just want to know what other peoples experiences are on this my therapist said this week that he is already amazed at how well i am doing it makes me feel good that he is proud of me and it gives me more motivation to get better,15tt6zt,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['lamotrigine', 'stabilizer', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine']",5,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.9603,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,4,2,This information is relevant.

Flaky-Surprise-4061,259,i think increasing my mood stabilizers increased my impulsivity i recently upped my lamictal from 100 mg sub therapeutic dosage to 150 mg after 4 months the reason i did not up sooner was because i had fucking insane vivid dreams after taking it and my psychiatrist wanted to wait until i was not experiencing them before continuing i am actually still experiencing them i am just used to them now even the ones that should be terrifying do not scare me it still fits his criteria of wanting it to be no longer distressing so i mean anyways i was prescribed lamictal whilst in inpatient to reduce impulsivity and compulsions it really has done wonders especially at helping me curb the urge to lie for attention i have not had any huge compulsions to lie since getting on these meds small ones still surface occasionally but i am much better at resisting them i am also much better at managing the urge for destructive behavior and in general i have had a lot of success however ever since it upped i have become more impulsive it is only been a week on 150 and i have had so many impulsive urges which to avoid hurting readers will not be listed one of my biggest concerns though is contacting people i should not like really should not be contacting fortunately the urge to lie is still under control which was the biggest benefit and so long as i can retain that i am not really inclined to go off lamictal entirely has anyone experienced this with any other mood stabilizers should i ask for my dose to be lowered as soon as possible or just wait and see if this is temporary thank you for the help,uclbk4,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['lamictal', 'stabilizers', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine']",5,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.796,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,3,2,This information is relevant.

Fluffy_Sky2435,263,i am new here and i need to say some stuff i have not told anyone first i should start off by saying i have not been formally diagnosed with bpd i have been diagnosed with depression anxiety eating disorder amp also pmdd ssris always made me nauseous and my doctor told me some people experience that with ssris in may he suggested i try lamotrigine and i have stuck with that now for 4 months when he prescribed it i researched it amp realized it is used a lot to treat bipolar as well as other things again he told me it was just being used in my case for major depression i looked into bipolar and i do not really think that is what i suffer from i do think i exhibit many signs of bpd but obviously i am not a doctor so i am just speaking from my heart on this one overall i have felt a lot more in control on the medicine lamotrigine the doctor also prescribed me xanax for pmdd it is only to take the 12 days i usually feel hormonal changes around my period and they are only a very small dose i also have a therapist that i see biweekly and i have been in therapy on and off for years with this regimen i have not had any episodes amp was feeling really positiveuntil this last week last week i startedcreated a huge fight with my fiancée i have done this in the past but i thought i had made major progress and was past those behaviors i started a fight about something that could hypothetically happen in the future so in retrospect an absolutely pointless fight i screamed horrible things at him like i hate him i did not want to be with him anymore i wanted him to move out i wanted to cancel the wedding i pushed him to the point that he was mad and then i played the victim when he stood up for himself amp said some stuff back i drug the fight on for a few days until i finally snapped out of itand then i apologized a million times i am just so scared that one of these days he will not forgive me amp i will be out of second chances i have been in therapy amp seeing psychiatrists for years so it actually breaks my heart that i feel so fucked up still i want so badly to be better amp to be stable amp to be nice amp to be someone worthy of love to catch you up to speed a bit more here is a little bit about my patterns amp life i am 29female i am privileged and i never worried about money when i was growing up i was a very good student i am a perfectionist i am high functioning so no one really has any idea what is going on i am an attorney and licensed in multiple states i was anorexic in high school amp i have always had body dysmorphia after being physically abused i developed binge eating disorder body dysmorphia has been consistent throughout i have always been a loner i have never had many girl friends i have a few best friends but for majority of my life especially adolescence i had really no friends i grew up in the south my parents are atheist so many families would not even let my classmatesother kids hang out with me i also grew up feeling kind of lost like no moral compass or purpose my parents did not really have friends they just hung out with each other when i was a teenager i had horrible fights with my parents i also said horrible things amp i would do rebellious things for seemingly no reason as a teenager i exaggerated a lot i did not do drugs and i only drank a little in high school but i did lie a lot to my parents i started to validate myself through men in teen years i slept around i tend to isolate myself socially but simultaneously i get lonely amp wish i had more of a support system from about 18 to present day i have been monogamous amp in serial long term relationships my first real relationship was extremely fucked up amp mentally abusive and i was very reckless in it unprotected sex etc it lasted about a year i started seeing a counselor when i was 18 my 2nd big relationship was even more fucked it lasted about 4 years he hit me we had explosive verbal fights prior to him getting physical i also made bad decisions like try molly with him one night i am not a regular drinker amp i do not use any illegal drugs in college i definitely would binge drink amp i tried smoking weed but it was clearly social as i do not like either i also was raped on a night of heavy drinking when i was 19 during some seasons of my life i light up a room amp i am the life of the party so to speak during other seasons i cannot get out of bed amp i am so depressed i have a history of having rocky relationships amp being prone to conflicts i used to chalk it up to girls being mean but it is happened so much that i am likely the culprit i am not suicidal but i have stated i wanted to kill myself a few years ago in a fight with my fiancée if i am being honest it was manipulation it is so fucked and i hate myself for it i am extremely negative and cynical i do have a history of intense relationships i do have a very sarcastic sense of humor i am able to hold jobs amp i typically have kept same jobs for at least 2 years and i always give employers full 2 week notice i have dogs and i love them and take care of them i experience no anger or anything i have never physically hurt anyone or anything i only have episodes with people i am close to ie my parents my sibling my fiancé i do not have episodes with friends coworkers strangers bosses some days i do not feel like doing anything but laying around other days i will run or ride bike most days after work i zone out amp just watch tv or something i am extremely giving amp i always try to do things or get things for my fiancé or family like sentimental or heart felt items i enjoy cooking and i cook most days if i am depressed i will not cook my current relationship is what i would consider my only normal relationship i have ever had we have been together 3 years amp he is the best guy and the love of my life he is 33male i have no trust issues with him and neither of us has ever cheated he has never abused me he has been patient with me in the beginning of our relationship about 7 months i never had an episode i was extremely happy and i felt stable after the first episode i felt so sad amp like omg no i am going to be alone forever i still have these mental issues and for about a year i had many episodes when i say episode i mean that the following typically happens it occurs the week before my period 23 day range it does not occur every month for example it has not occurred at all in last 5 months or so until last week i start a fight i say horrible things and most of which are things i truly do not mean ie i hate you fuck you we are done etc i accuse him of being the mean one amp abusive i push him to point of saying he does not want to be with me amp then act like he is abandoning me i bring up stuff that does not even bother me amp start acting like it does ie i always do the dishes just to add fuel to the fire when i finally snap out of it typically 2 days i am so ashamed and embarrassed i apologize profusely but the damage is done i genuinely feel terrible and crazy i am willing to do anything i do not know what to do i do not want to lose my fiancée we are getting married in a few months more than anything i do not want to ruin his whole life by having him waste it on a marriage to a garbage person he has been so caring and he is extremely sensitive and supportive to whatever underlying mental health issue i have he is never shamed me and he is fully supported whatever i need to make me feel more whole i love him a lot and i want to be better for him obviously i want to be better for myself as well i wish more than anything in the world that i could be stable and not have any episodes in the future where i lose my shit amp get angry amp treat any loved one like shit before this pattern with romantic partners i feel like i did this as a teenager to my parents i do truly think i have bpd and again i am not speaking on a whim or trying to insult anyone with an actual diagnosis but i am wholeheartedly coming to this forum for a shimmer of light hope or positivity i am not sure if anyone else experiences episodes close in time to hormonal changesperiod but that is typically when my episodes happen if they happen i have done talk therapy for 11 years i have been seeing a psychiatrist for about 6 years i just do not know what else to do i would love any tips stories or words that anyone can offer on their thoughts and what they think i can do to manage this disorder i want to be the person i know i am capable of being amp the person that exists a lot of the time i want this disorder to be in remission i am all ears i am willing to do the work and i have been for years in therapy i just do not feel i have made that much progress on managing this i appreciate and thank you in advance for your responses if you do not respond thank you for reading this amp let me say this to someone i am crying as i write this because i just feel so horrible for how i have treated people during my life i do feel thankful to be alive but i wish i never had episodes or days like i have had,182ugt9,"(2, 4, 0, 0)",borderline personality

course i figured i suck after my first presentation later i had a presentation and i thought it was good so it probably really was at least okay because i am very selfcritical my ta said nothing later i hear from two completely separate but both trustworthy people that my ta has been talking shit about me behind my back he has literally told his younger students that i know nothing and similar things he told them that he is very disappointed after my last presentation which i figured was good he has not told me that it hurt like hell i have lost interest in studying this ironically now i am getting closer to knowing nothing because of my current behavior i even think about quitting academia overall bpd you know however here is the problem since i have heard this i act like i am depressed although i know i am not going through a depressive episode it is all a mere reaction to this i sleep a lot get up at 5pm luckily it is holiday season here lie in bed until i must piss return and remain here until i fall asleep again i think about my academic reputation a lot and i bash myself for not studying in the meantime i am becoming more and more suicidal it started with thinking it would be easier to not go through this bullshit nothing pathological now i am at it would not be a shame if i got killed accidentally and i am afraid it is worsening because i am actually starting to consider whether my cats and so would be okay if i killed myself and then i kind of get afraid of the thought and feel like a dick because of them and make myself stop thinking about it i do not want to do it but this line of thought does lead to wanting to do it someday i will not deceive myself if this does not stop i will wind up in a shitty place again my selfharming urges have intensified again literally the only thing stopping me from cutting myself is not wanting to have scars so i turn to alternative selfdestructive methods i smoke on an empty stomach while i drink lemonade it hurts like hell because i have stomach issues i hit myself and i have almost completely stopped eating as a method of do not know really selfdestructive coping just trust me on this one it is not an eating disorder issue because i had no body issues before and now i feel really unattractive 43kg and even feeling unattractive among with stupid boring and forgotten by everybody has it is appeals though more excuses to selfloathe andor die finally i have already seen what extreme stress can do to me from experience it can literally make me psychotic for shorter periods and it has three times in the past i was so glad when i stopped taking the antipsychotic after my last outbreak which was induced by my extreme fear of failing when i start my phd how ironic i really do not know what to do all of this has been induced by my ta talking the things i am most afraid of behind my back i know it is not that much of a deal but i cannot help it right now it is worsening every day i have this feeling that it is really building up somewhere in me and i will breakdown i do not know how i hope i will not end up suicidalwithaplan and i also hope i will not end up paranoid and seeing things again my pdoc thinks things will settle down i feel worse from day to day and it does not go away my partner also says i seem and act worse every day i need help i do not know where to turn to my doctor is probably the best i could find and she is good but she just thinks everything will get back on track eventually i feel like there is no time for eventually i feel i might explode tonight tomorrow or other time soon has anybody been in a similar situation does not have to be the same background just behavior what do i do what do i do if i become psychotic again my ta will think i know nothing forever i wish i was not here yeah yeah i know these are typical bpd thoughts,jy7azi,"(2, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,0,[],"['lamictal', 'wellbutrin', 'stabilizer', 'antidepressant',

Galllatea6,281,irritable at others happiness looking for advice or support i guess a little background i live with one of my best friends i recently moved out of a roomate situation that included my fp that went horribly bad and i was in a terrible spot for months with my bpd as well as just losing 2 of my closest friends in the explosion i moved in with a good friend who i was excited to live with because she is a very positive person and motivating and it was something that i needed badly from my last living situation here is the thing though i had to take a break from the meds i was on lamictal and pristiq and gabapentin and am just now starting new ones after months wellbutrin and i have been struggling so hard with irritability it makes me so frustrated with myself everything makes me feel angry or cringe or just irritable especially her joy though like the things she likes a lot that she loves to talk about and wants to share with me just make me so much angrier it is funny too because it is things that i like too like she is a huge swiftie and this past week has been taylor swift obsession i like taylor swift too i have forever but her joy about it makes me hate it i just continuously find reasons in my head to why i do not like it why it is bad why it is cringe why it should not be that way why she should not like this or do this etc etc it is like everything even small things like using the wrong size tuperware for leftovers it makes me so irritated like i cannot smile or even find a good response to her anymore because i just feel upset at her and the things she likes it makes me so sad because i want to feel the same level of joy she is feeling i want to understand how she can be so happy about these things i just do not feel the joy and it frustrates me so much it makes me more upset than the original upset because i cannot stop being upset i know wellbutrin is not perscribed for bpd specifically usually but i struggle with depression really bad on top of my bpd and my psych and i decided we needed to tackle the depression first but i am afraid i am going to ruin my relationship with my friend if i do not get this under control i do not know how to explain it to her she is not familiar with bpd and it can be hard to talk to her because she is a talker and often does not create space for me to share things or have my say in things which does not bother me because i do not like to share a lot but i just cannot communicate the struggles i face with bpd she is the kind of person who always thinks that problems are related to things like student debt or money of the future and tries to convince me that i would be better if i just did not have the weight of debt but i do not care about my debt at all i do not even plan on paying it back i just do not care about that but she is so convinced that i am i am just stuck feeling irritated and i do not know how to properly communicate with her she has struggles with her family and life which she is not shy sharing which is good but it gets so old and she never gives me space to share my own struggles which are a lot less surface level than hers it sometimes just comes off as shallow to me when she talks about her struggles because she knows that i have sever cptsd from my family life and my own personal struggles and she just has no idea how deep mine are it is like she is stressed about buying a duplex right now that she could rent out she is 22 i am 23 and like keeps talking about how she needs to get a credit card and her savings and her parents buying her grandmas house and such but then completely ignored my family life both of my parents are currently homeless and jobless and i grew up homeless my whole life and am stable for the first time in my life right now and i just do not know how to be accepting of her likes and life when i feel like this anyways sorry for ranting i am down bad right now tldr my roommates happiness and joy about things makes me feel upset and angry all the time and we are so different in our lives and views that it is hard to find a way to not be irritated,1befrjf,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['lamictal', 'wellbutrin', 'gabapentin', 'pristiq', 'Lamotrigine', 'Desvenlafaxine', 'Gabapentin', 'Bupropion', 'Bupropion']",9,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.957,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,3,2,This information is relevant.

GlobalistFuck,285,i made a mistake potentially triggering 26yo male bpd with schizophrenic elementsi should start by saying it is been an unstable four months or so november was extremely depressing and i was thinking about returning to my former addiction of burning myself wrecked my car early december and had to quit my job because of it i spent much of december drinking obscene amounts of alcohol every night and most of the time was irrationally angry or else enraged at the most insignificant events things that do not deserve a second chance sought help from my psychiatrist i had not seen in a while unfortunately have not been able to see a therapist due to insurance change first of the year got a new job first week of january and pretty much worked everyday some 60 hours a week for the next six weeks which is good for a guy like me keeps me busy and occupied in hindsight i was abnormally happy more than what events dictated a bit more than ten days ago things turned sour and by wednesday i was suicidally depressed for the umpteenth time in my life goes back to early childhood for me i guess this would be a good time to mention my medication regiment 450 mg wellbutrin xl since ssris do little for me 30 mg mirtazapine as a supplement to the wellbutrin and a sleep aid and 100 mg lamictal to curb the edges guess they were not working as well as i thought thursday night after once again getting absurdly drunk i downed what i had left of the mirtazapine maybe 400500 mg went to bed slept maybe 6 hours all next day at work i could not stop shaking others noticed and my thoughts got worse that night friday i again got extremely drunk and tried to end it through overdose downing the rest of my meds will refrain from dosages i would rather not give any ideas some 5 minutes later i became extremely disoriented and dizzy and went to my balcony to smoke a cigarette where i lost all cognitive muscle function i do not remember parts other than beating my head against the walls eventually not able to stand puked maybe half of what i had taken up and gave in to the idea i was going to live of course extreme paranoia everyone in my life already knew even if they could not but that is another realm of thought i tried opening to door to crawl to my bed but could not figure out how to work the handle and eventually as my sight dimmed could not even find it so i resided to sleep on the balcony in the cold i woke a few hours later and my sight and a bit of muscle function had returned so i crawled uneasily to my bed and before passing out puked beside my bed one last time i woke up saturday morning around 7am i think i passed out in my bed about 230 am but it is hard to tell really obvious reasons noticed where i had puked next to my bed and a good bit was blood had to be since i had not eaten anything red colored for a couple days i tried sitting up and going to puke again i was extremely nauseous and i fell to the floor having to crawl to my toilet so i could dry heave for about 20 minutes pretty much had to stay bed ridden world spinning till around 5pm when thinks cleared up enough i could walk it is sunday evening now i have cuts and scrapes all over my head and arms i have taken proper care of them after finding them saturday evening and so far this post is the first anyone has heard about this very regretful night of mine fortunately i feel rather even tempered now with a slightly positive outlook on the future as i remember what i had set out to do as of this year to become a better more benevolent man a because i will pick up again starting with seeing my psychiatrist as soon as possible and seeking a therapist immediately it is obvious to me that if going to help people like i want to i need to help myself first and that starts by learning skills and tools to better overcome my problems this event was not my first attempt but i hope it is the last and i will do everything i can to make sure it is my advise to anyone reading this i failed to reach out in my darkest hour do not make that mistake do not be afraid to tell someone you need help also do not let your problems or diagnosis define you that is merely a label and any good therapist treats the symptoms not the diagnosis if you want to be depressed you will be depressed unfortunately if you want to be happy you have to earn it do everything you can everyday to help yourself be a better person help others and always see where you want to be this time next year and do something everyday that gets you closer to that goal good luck my brothers and sisters national suicide hotline someone is there 247 to answer is 18002738255 if no one else will listen they will,"1cd5hqa, 1cjb4f3, 1cjb4f3, 1cjb4f3","(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['lamictal', 'wellbutrin', 'ssris', 'Bupropion', 'Mirtazapine', 'Bupropion', 'Lamotrigine', 'Mirtazapine']",8,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.5552,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,6,2,This information is relevant.

Gold_ACR,288,hi i am new here hi i am a 26yearold woman in nyc who received a longoverdue bpd diagnosis this summer i have long believed my mother to have bpd and probably her mother before her it is just affective instability all the way down in my family i am currently taking two lowgrade mood stabilizers lamotrigine and gabapentin and they appear to really help me ride out my emotional cycles i started dbt this summer but changed jobs and changed insurance and was no longer able to see that therapist due to money i have gone through the ringer with insurance trying to find someone and in the process encountered a therapist who laughed at a story i told her and when i said i thought it was inappropriate said this is what borderlines do they exaggerate and get angry at you prompting me to walk out of the session i have plans to see my former therapist next year when my deductible resets and i will just use fsa for that tldr i have yet to really start a dbt program i do not speak to either of my parents but i have a stable career and friendships and live with my boyfriend of two years my relationship is where most of my symptoms arise mostly in the form of truly irrational jealousy and a compulsive but controlled need for validation in the form of sex i have had some of the worst episodes of my life because of fabricated reasons to feel jealous or disrespected i worry about emotionally dumping on my friends when i do have emotional episodes i have great female friends who know about my diagnosis and understand how my mind works and have genuinely helpful advice when my rational mind has just left me in the dust when i do get upset and worked up about some perceived rejection or potential for abandonment i can not really get through the cycle without talking about what is on my mind while my boyfriend is very understanding and loving i do not feel like it is in either of our best interests for me to vocalize all of my most incomprehensible fears i express them to my friends sometimes but i do not want to impose on their lives in that way i am wondering if it is appropriate for me to use this subreddit as a place to write out what has upset me and how i am handling the feelings i know this is an essential part of dbt and look forward to handling that type of stuff with my therapist next year but for now i am frustrated that my brain is held hostage until i vocalize my ridiculous irrational fears and worry about consequences of me being too bpd all over the people in my life happy thanksgiving,1agxmz3,"(1, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,1,['dbt'],"['lamotrigine', 'gabapentin', 'stabilizers', 'Lamotrigine', 'Gabapentin']",5,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.9465,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,4,4,This information is highly relevant.

GranaPad,290,i feel more functional and normal than i ever have it will be a long one so here we go in the last 3 months i have been on lamotrigine i had to channel my bpd brain when i went to the doctors and coerced them in to writing me up a script i told them that i had taken it previously i had not been to the doctors in that area for a long time and i told him that i had it ages ago but stopped taking it because i felt better so i was super convincing and used a lot of terminology while this is not an orthodox way to get medication i had really no other option as i had tried about 10 different medications since being 16 now 26 and periods of time where i had not taken anything i had been diagnosed earlier in the year with bpd and bp2 which i had a feeling this was the case for awhile now so all the medications over the years just kicked me more out of balance and i have had to ensure many withdrawals sleepless nights restless legs i felt defeated on the antipsychotic front i had seroquel for some time and i gained so much weight my eating disorder thought patterns came back although i kept myself accountable and gave myself the firm no i eat healthy and exercise sometimesrarely so part my fault and part the medication moving on i spent a lot of time doing extensive research and i thought lamotrigine made the most sense to try i started on 25mg and have slowly titrated to the therapeutic dose of 200mg the most recent script i got was about a month ago for 100mg so i have been taking two of those in the morning i got some headaches and lost my appetite in the beginning and each time i titrated i had headaches i went to a psychologist a few weeks ago after i had quit my job of 2 years as i had got another one better pay better team and new role so that blew my anxiety right out of the water we spoke about the wise mind and emotional regulation and she wants to see me again my world is now in colour i feel things i feel happy my body is not sore potential fibromyalgia but i could put it down to depression i am sensitive to sad things i hear about or see on television i have always been sensitive as a person but i had felt numb for the longest time or my bpd amplified it and triggered rage hypomania so it was nice to actually feel something authentic goosebumps and tears in my eyes from something i felt i rarely cry but these are empathetic and heartfelt moments for me which i have not had since i was a teenager i am a lot more understanding and i can have a conversation without feeling defensive or worried about what people think of me despite lying to the doctors which i do not really feel bad about it was the best decision i have made i just wanted to share this with the community in case anybody is in the same boat as me do your research and weigh up the pros and cons this is not advice this is my story so far and for somebody who thought there was no hope and i would be this mess of a borderline and bipolar person clutching straws to keep her life together it is so much easier now tldr coerced doctors new medication feel like a brand new person borderline and bipolar 2 symptoms at bay and i am the happiest i have ever been,"16w7ykf, 16w7ykf","(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['seroquel', 'lamotrigine', 'antipsychotic', 'Lamotrigine', 'Quetiapine', 'Lamotrigine']",6,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.9904,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,4,2,This information is relevant.

Gremins_ontheside,292,just diagnosed and not taking it well hi everyone i feel like i need to say these things to someone who understands so thank you for taking the time to read this and sorry if this is a little disorganized my family and friends have abandoned me at this point i do not know if this is real or imaginary i am 27f and i have been sick my whole life sexually abused starting at 4 years old emotional abuse my entire childhood i started selfabuse when i was seven years old started compulsively cutting at 10 or 11 technically i qualify for both bipolar and bpd if going by the book i have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 by my therapist for many years i have had suspicions that i have bpd as well as bipolar i do not quite understand how someone could have both but in my case i definitely have more going on than bipolar but i also do not have the daily mood changes that are supposed to come along with bpd i have hypomania and severe depression that last months i also have periods in between when i am normal and stable and i have read that bpd does not have this i definitely have the fear of abandonment and paranoia when i am stable i am not easily offended by anything i am independent and not incredibly needy like i am when i break down basically not every little thing in life gets me down and i am a normal functioning person so anyway i saw my first ever psychiatrist a couple of days ago i decided to go to her because i thought it would be better than getting meds from my general practitioner i broke down several months ago and finally after so many years of resisting decided i needed to get on meds my general practitioner gave me what i asked for after research i decided i wanted to try wellbutrin and lamictal started the wellbutrin first and went into what i called rapid cycling psychiatrist does not call it this i also hurt myself for the first time in 6 years i did not cut because i could not find anything sharp enough i used an eraser on my wrist and rubbed my skin off until it was bleeding several months later i am still putting makeup on it because it still looks fresh started lamictal after that and it got better the meds were helping but i may have been in a hypomanic episode for three months which would have been the longest period of time that i have had that i filled out the paperwork for the psychiatrist and the first thing the psychiatrist said to me when i sat down was that i did not have bipolar disorder my heart sank because i knew what she was thinking i had finally just accepted that i have bipolar disorder this is something i will forever live with and i might as well do the best i can several minutes later i asked her if it was bpd that she thought i had she confirmed my fears and said yes we talked for an hour and a half and near the end she changed her mind and said that she has to wait until next session to officially diagnose me because she suspects that i might have both bd and bpd she is also convinced i have ptsd i realized something that i do not like this whole time i have been seeing my therapist i have unconsciously manipulated her into coming to the conclusion that i have bipolar disorder and that is my problem nothing else but i was 100 honest with the psychiatrist for some reason correct me if i am wrong but this unconscious manipulation sounds like things i have read about bpd i liked this psychiatrist i thought she was extremely intelligent and spot on about everything as i was finishing up and checking out i felt okay i thought i was fine as soon as i got to my car i just broke down i called my sister who also has the same mental health issues that i do she just does not see anyone i told her everything that had happened when my husband got home from work i told him everything i was a mess all day i am back to the depression i talked to my sister again on the phone later and told her that i was suicidal and that i just could not handle this right now she did not really say anything but she listened my husband was the exact same way he listened but did not hug me or say anything to me this was all on july 3rd my sister was supposed to spend the day with me on the 4th but cancelled she made up an excuse but i know it is just because she could not handle being around me her excuse was something that would not have prevented her from being with me that day when she knew i really needed support my husband is avoiding this and refuses to do research to better understand what is happening to me i have been trying to think of how to kill myself and i already hurt myself again i say all this and i feel that i am being rational but at the same time i know that there is a chance i am actually being irrational and not seeing the situation clearly i just do not know how i am supposed to continue living like this i am upset and i cannot live with the fact that i might suffer from both these things every minute of the day i am trying to decide what to do with myself because i am stuck and do not get out of bed my therapist is on maternity leave so i cannot see her for a session i feel like i am supposed to accept that i need to deal with this alone and not rely on anyone else i do not blame anyone for avoiding me i know it must be extremely difficult sorry for all the negativity but thanks for listening anyway edit thank you

Gretttel93,293,inquired with my pysch about lamictal plus my life in general tw suicidal ideation hello all i hope this reaches you all as well as possible i was diagnosed with bpd in 2016 and my life since then has been a roller coaster between my own inner turmoil and a lot of outside life events i have not been in a good place for awhile i was with my soon to be ex we are divorcing soon for ten years and she was always a stabilizing force in my life thank god for that but once that relationship was gone i had went back to maladaptive coping mechanisms to alter my moods a lot of ssris and snris have either increased my anxiety and have not been effective for me in the past lamictal has proven effective for me and this past week i had some very intense feelings feelings of suicidal ideation and a situation happened where i just could not cope and i could not eat that entire day i am alive i am safe and i am here but the situation made me realize that i am using others to stabilize my moods and i get angry when they are not available to do so i am trying to give myself grace here because my ex and i were very codependent and we stabilized each others moods for each other and without her constantly by my by side that need is greater than ever plus the grief that divorce brings is a whole mood just in general i reached out to my psychiatrist today about going on the lamictal and hope to hear from her soon she is great and very responsive plus i have an amazing therapist whom i have two sessions with in the next week that took me off my suicidal thought ledge the other day and helped me foster the will to live that day and these last few days i am reaching out here to keep myself accountable and to follow through in the steps of my recovery because i know it will and can be possible i know meds are not the only answer but a tool in the great big toolbox of bpd recovery i really appreciate seeing all your posts because it makes me feel less alone thank you and i love you all for listening,174r8iu,"(1, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,0,[],"['lamictal', 'ssris', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine']",5,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.9805,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,5,3,This information is very relevant.
Griffinwolf2022,294,question for those of you receiving disability benefitsany input really would help possibly triggering for a few different reasons drug abuse sexual violence general bpd stuff past suicidal ideation hey so i have had some pretty bad experiences on reddit lately regarding hate toward me so i am very apprehensive about making this post so let me just get everything out in the open i am a 22 year old male new york city a recovering addict adderall mostly queer bachelors in psychology and sociology from an ok institution i guess diagnosed with bpd at 18 on lamictal valium as needed and zendedi which is like adderall but i take such a low controlled dose and i let my sister hold them so i cannot abuse them all prescribed legally by my doctor all my life i have been able to hold down steady jobs while pulling good grades in both high school and college i had a breakdown in college though resulting in hypothermia that led to frostbite that led to almost losing my toes thank god for whatever modern medicine helped i was knocked out in the hospital for weeks and that was when my parents kind of started to take me seriously anyway after i graduated college in december 2016 i came home and started working at a supermarket i have worked at them before mind you but i could not handle it i do not know why i had to quit after a week because i could not stand having to run into the bathroom to cry multiple times a shift i got another job working at a student loan company and it was good money but i had to quit because my mood swings were getting out of control i got another job working in marketing but it turned out not to be what i expected and my boss would make fun of mental illness almost daily i walked out one day emailed a resignation notice got my last check in months and i have now been unemployed for about four months this paragraph might be a trigger regarding sexual violence i do not know what to do i know i am capable of working i know that and i know i know that but i just feel like i cannot do what society expects me to do i am a fucking 22 year old man who lives with his parents who are struggling themselves with financial problems and i cannot even go see my friends the few that i have so i stay home all day applying for jobs and looking for freelance work but to no avail the only income i have gotten recently came from sex work i do not want to talk too much about it because it was not a good experience end of tw talk therapy does not help me and i cannot afford it i have shit health care fuck america i can barely pay for my meds prescribed by my old psychiatrist when i was just diagnosed but without them i have tried to end my life three times my parents and doctors all believed i was okay afterward i have spent days never weeks in psych wards where the doctors told me that i was pretty much just a kid figuring out the world that is partially true but mostly i live through a facade that everythings great but i cannot hold it up anymore i cannot work i have started abusing drugs again i am about three weeks clean but i am so scared i will go back i have developed what i think is an eating disorder i take speed so i am not hungry and laxatives i weigh about 100 pounds i am only 56 though when people tell me i look like skin and bones i just want to be thinner maybe then someone will love me all my ex boyfriends have told me i am too crazy for them the three people in my life who have been my closest friends have either been locked up for years for charges unrelated to drugsmental illness but i feel responsible i could have helped or the other two they told me i was too much for them as well my last college roommate my best friend the day after i graduated and moved out cursed me out and told me never to speak to her again every day i question if i want to live i want to say i am not suicidal and i am not a danger to myself or others that is very important for me to say right now because those thoughts are just thoughts if i had some money maybe i could afford treatment maybe i could pay my dues to society maybe i could help my parents and pay my student loans and pay the debts to the few friends who have stuck around and loaned me money for food and gave me a place to stay when i got kicked out of my house i am back home though maybe i could help maybe i could do something worthwhile i do not know i think i need disability benefits but i do not want to be labeled too much because i am somewhat confident i will be able to work again sometime in the future and since i am currently not in treatment i do not know what to do i just do not know what to do i am so scared i am so scared i am so god damned fucking scared about everything i did not intend to write all of this i am sorry for the long read,18j7v6i,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['lamictal', 'valium', 'adderall', 'Amphetamine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Diazepam', 'Amphetamine']",7,1,This user is receiving

GroundbreakingEcho47,295,how were you diagnosed and what do you experience daily hello all 26f i am new to this sub i wanted to hear some experiences about something that has been happening to me for a while now and did not know where else to turn i was diagnosed with panic and anxiety about 4 years ago at that point i tried different medications antidepressants and found that some were helpful the most helpful ones though were lamictal and another mood stabilizer but had to go off it because anxiety would come back i was surprised to know this as i thought this was for bipolar individuals skip forward to this year covid basically fucked me up mentally and i had to switch out off mirtazapine by the last days i was on it i felt hopeless with suicidal thoughts and like my thoughts were very rapid which was weird because i am not usually like that the next med i tried was fluvox for about 2 months and this is where the mood swings started i was literally happy one moment and five seconds later i was crying because my life was too difficult and wanted to kill myself i do not but this is a scary obsessive thought that keeps reappearing lately i then tried lexapro the med i am currently on and i have to say i feel like shit in the last year since i have been on this med i have had the craziest mood swings ever thing is i was never like this before at least not to this degree but basically at least 34x a week i wake up very happy motivated clean my entire apartment and all of the sudden at work i go through an alternation of negative and positive thoughts my life makes no sense i love working here my life is so meaningless i hate my job i am excited to go to the gym today i am going crazy i want to end this okay i am fine wtf all in a span of 1 hour at this point i have talked endlessly with my psychiatrist and she keeps mentioning that she thinks i have bpd in my mind i do not truly know because i was not like this before this started showing up mid last year and i am concerned that it may be the medications that have fucked me up in a way in conclusion i would like to ask you guys how you were diagnosed and if you have gone through any experience like the one i described with mood difficulties thanks,1b92zml,"(2, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,0,[],"['lexapro', 'lamictal', 'stabilizer', 'Lamotrigine', 'Mirtazapine', 'Escitalopram']",6,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.9724,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,5,3,This information is very relevant.

Heavenly_Glory,303,staying motivated during a depressive episode i originally tried to post this in a bp group but since my account is new they are screening it i have both bpd and bp not sure if people with bpd alone struggle with motivation but i figured i would ask i am currently too depressed to know if this is the best way to describe how i feel but here it goes i am sure many of you are familar with long lapses in motivation only to be followed by manic swings of conquering every topic you have a vague interest in only to drop it all during my happy times i am driven caring passionate etc but then i go through 23 months where food tastes bland a hot bath feels like nothing my relationships are empty i am also diagnosed with general anxiety and bipolar i have always loved art and i am apprenticing as a tattoo artist which i thought was my dream but creating is giving me no satisfaction and my mind is dry of any inspiration i do not know who to tell because nothing anyone says helps for anyone else who has a favorite person i am wondering if i am alone in how i interact with mine the only thing that makes my motivation better during a depressive state is validation from my fp and my relationships with my fps are usually volatile and so i am a wreck and it feels like i only do anything to make whatever guy i am feeling at the moment like me when that relationship falls apart i feel stripped of everything and function sluggishly it is like i am withdrawing i know i am just using the high i get from their attention to balance out my anhedonia but i cannot seem to break the cycle i have not been truly single in almost a decade my fp at the time died suddenly 3 years ago on the 9th and i have never truly let it go valentines day was his funeral and the person i have been seeing on and off since may seems to have abandoned me since monday and i am not taking it well i hate myself for not handling it like an adult i work my apprenticeship tomorrow but i am struggling to fake wanting to be there and no one understands that deep down i probably care but i cannot feel it right now also the guy i was seeing works there and seeing him at shift change us fucking up my anxiety this shop is the best opportunity i have ever been given and my mental health is about to destroy it i have bills to pay i am 3000 miles away from my friends and family i have to overcome this i am currently taking lamotrigine since june and i just started gabapentin but i may switch to buspar soon if you know any meds you had success with for bp bpd or anxiety let me know and i will ask my doctor i was considering wellbutrin but i could not start at the time because i was very underweight also if you have any other stategies to combat the emptiness i do not start therapy until wednesday did not seek help at all until june after my suicide plan fortunately went awry and it is so hard to be ok right now sorry if this post is annoying i just really needed to vent and it is hard to explain to most of the people i know they are scared of me or stigmatize mental disorders i am not using my diagnosis for pity i would not wish this numbness on anyone i am just hoping there is something i can do to find my passion and be ok without an fp,mtba08,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,1,[],"['lamotrigine', 'wellbutrin', 'gabapentin', 'buspar', 'Lamotrigine', 'Gabapentin', 'Bupropion']",7,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.5493,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,4,3,This information is very relevant.

HsJohnson88,318,trigger warningspilling my heart and story so about a month ago now my ex partner fp twin flame left my ups and downs had made him depressed the shame and the guilt is eating me alive inside i was diagnosed with bulimia at 11 borderline at 21 and received a differential diagnosis of bipolar type ii shortly after the first uk lockdown was put in place it was also a new psych that made the differential diagnosis she left her post within three months i was put on lamotrigine and lithium then taken off lithium shortly after the new psych left having struggled with alcohol issues since my young teens i finally broke that with the love and support of this man coming up to a year sober in december when he walked out i was only two weeks completely off lithium i quit smoking cannabis cold turkey and have not touched it since nor do i miss it the anxiety and the gut wrenching pain is consuming me however and i pray so hard daily for guidance mercy and grace having been severely bulimic all of my adult life i have also not binged or purged since he left i gave up drinking caffeine too which i used to drink a lot of i sensed deep in my heart and soul i was losing him within perhaps the last six months of our relationship and it drove me crazy when he finally opened up i over shared on social media frantically messaged his friends and family and in general made a total mockery of myself he has not blocked me has repeatedly said he does not want to resort to that the onset of a couple of the worse anxiety attacks i frantically messaged him detailing all the positive changes i had made and was making and that i was doing it all for him and to prove to him how much i wanted a life and future with him neither of us doubt our love for one another however he has become convinced we are not compatible it is horrible to think of because i know deep down it is not true and that my mental health is to blame for all of these blockages between us since our last interaction i have respected his wishes and left him alone perhaps one of the few things i have left to feel a tiny bit of pride within myself about i have over spent in the last couple weeks on online psychics and readings researched spells i know this is obsession i know none of it is healthy i am in so much fear if i lose him forever i will lose one of the greatest blessings life ever gifted me i still cling to faith he will reach out when he has had space and time and recognised my dedication to stablising and bettering myself we had just got a kitten two days before he opened up and broke up with me i had to pack his things up for him because he had only done half of it the pain of doing that in itself i think was traumatic i badly hurt myself that day too self harm which i have generally managed to keep under control throughout my life with only periodic slip ups i journal everyday i write gratitude lists everyday i engage with the professional mental health team looking after me though not sure how much ed psych really cares she is also acting as my main psych currently whilst that post is filled i exercise intensely every day i go for walks outside every day i look and apply for training and jobs every day i meditate several times a day and i pray throughout the day too i attend to my personal hygiene and have made a big effort to eat at least twice daily i stopped eating in the initial two weeks after he had left and lost a stone a half i do not look healthy and i am self conscious of that ampx200b i went online today to search for how to love yourself when you have borderline and to reeducate myself on borderline it massively triggered me and i have spiralled into shaking and anxiety ampx200b i am trying so hard the ed psych actually said during our last phone appointment i was in her top three patients who work the hardest at their skills and getting better so why does it feel not good enough to grant me any happiness or success in recoverstability i received the borderline diagnosis at 21 as i mentioned i have a little boy who was one when that happened the pain of receiving some answers but painfulhard to accept truths about myself again prompted more self hatred and doubt my childs father was alot older than me kind of preyed on me if i am being honest when i was 19 and heavily drinking i believed falling pregnant was the universe giving me a chance at a happy life how wrong i was my son is the best thing that ever happened to me but his father has brought such trauma to me he cheated shortly after our sons first birthday and then began a relationship with her she is older than him no children lots of money and twenty years my senior i have struggled financially to hold down jobs to save money i could not afford the house we childs father and i rented so i had to claim homeless with the local council i had to declare bankruptcy from the debt i was left with i took seizures from the stress i still take seizures periodically which the doctors have put down to severe psychological stress i moved house and then had a complete break down i gave my son to my childs father believing he and his new partner could and would provide the stability and finances that he deserved and needed they then took me to court to make it legally binding and my mental health was used against me just as my childs father had used it against me since we first met i have done so much therapy to reverse the belief i could not and would never be a capabledeserving and loving mother i get my son every week and it is the only light at the end of the tunnel for me the whole reason i fight so hard for him and my beloved ex partner the reason truth be told i am still alive today all i ever wanted was a happy healthy stable life with them ampx200b i ended up in the care of the local authority when i was 14 and was raped of my virginity in that care home i was forced to go to the police but my case was never taken to court not long ago i found online that he went on to rape another young girl who did get a conviction and he was sent to the state hospital i pray for him everyday he was so messed up i blamed myself for what happened ampx200b i am tired of feeling like a freak of feeling irreparably flawed without purpose unlovable i am tired of being judged i am tired of endlessly worrying and hurting i am tired of being judged and socially outcast i have pretty much given up trying to socialise because i feel i make everyone uncomfortable just by existing the few friends i have i fear cannot be bothered with me and same applies to my family i constantly question am i a narcissist its never been mentioned but the fear tortures me i have nightmares every night sleeping cycle is erratic at the best of times and unpredictable at present tired of feeling alone in a never ending battle for everything that seems to come so naturally to everyone else i look at around mein life somehow two of my childhood best friends have stuck by me throughout everything and i love them so much deep down i know there is some truth in their words of me being such a deeply kind and compassionate person to point of neglecting myself and being open to abuse i am even vegan because the thought of causing harm to an animal for my benefit is so painful to me ampx200b i do not really know the purpose of this post other than i had to share i feel i am losing my mind is there hope if i keep clinging to faith and doing the daily work do i have any chance at a stable life stable health relationships they say time is a healer but i know if i lose my ex partner for good a part of me dies and i already feel so empty please please i beg you to not be too cruel in your judgements andor comments,182ugt9,"(0, 0,

Huge_Masterpiece_729,319,pseudoxpost anyone with previously misdiagnosed or current duodiagnosed with bipolar disoder differences in treatment for personality disorders compared to bipolar spectrum illnesses this is a copy and pasted post from rbipolarreddit httpswwwredditcomrbipolarredditcommentsbgwzz9anyone_with_previously_misdiagnosed_or_currenthttpswwwredditcomrbipolarredditcommentsbgwzz9anyone_with_previously_misdiagnosed_or_current i asked the mods if this post was okay and we agreed that it was under the condition that i highly reiterate that i am not asking for a diagnosis only a doctor can decide this i am fully aware of the dangers of selfdiagnosis i have no intentions of seeking a diagnosis from this post nor diagnosing myself this is elaborated upon in the first paragraph of the post thank you here is the post ampx200b i have always been in denial for all of my diagnoses its part of me trying to comprehend the profound impact that my psychiatric situations have placed upon my life i am not trying to diagnosing myself never have and never will but i am trying to better identify the past and current symptomsoccurrences that could be valuable data to provide to my psychologist and psychiatrist i am mostly wondering about my behavioral symptoms that i have previously disregarded and am wondering if i should present them to my psychologist when i go home in 2 months to reiterate i am not asking for a diagnosis just asking if any of you have experienced similar symptoms to me and if your doctors considered them to be medically relavent thanks i am currently diagnosed bipolar nos been a psychiatric patient for 45 years since age 1415 multiple suicide attempts self harm grandiose and reoccurring suicidal ideations rapid cycling and increased self harm from antidepressants negative physical side effects from antipsychotics my docs and i only have only identified really minor manic episodes that do not usually last more than a month and are not too dangerous other times it can be very short a week or so but there is always a depression crash when it ends that is an incredibly short summary of why me and my doctors treat me for bipolar disorder using lamictal sometimes i wonder if i have a personality disorder sometimes my mood is just so fucking irregular i cannot ever tell how my day is going to go because i always wake up feeling completely different and never well rested i cut people in and out of my life over periods of many months i more often than not create delusions that these people are out to get me and that they are enemies and that i need to stay away from them it feels like i cannot remember these people sometimes especially when i start hanging out with them again it feels like my ego and values are constantly changing and that i have multiple people that take turns in my head all of my romantic relationships have revolved around codependency and me using the so as a bracer for my instability i cannot deal with being criticized i do not know who i am and often look at other people and am amazed at their ability to constantly flow through life with a stable set of values they wake up and are able to go through life with the same brain that they had yesterday and the day before and the day before their identity is constant and does not seem to change drastically sometimes i talk in multiple voicesaccents sometimes when i respond to something i will say 2 similar things but in 2 different voices 2 months ago i experienced a lot of motivation hard work social prowess etc life for me was really good i was actually dating again and shit recently it ended and now i am just stuck in depression people are wondering why i have not seem them for a few weeks i feel like i am always changing but that is just life at my age and life in general i should not fucking align simple issues with a desire for psychiatric treatment it does not even matter if the treatment for bipolar illnesses and bpd is similar i always think about how i feel and if this emptiness can be fixed or if the life that normal people get to the experience is out of my reach forever oof those of you who have personality disorders or have been treated for them or something similar what medications did your doctor prescribe to treat your personality disorder what was different about it compared to medication that you received to treat bipolar disorder what were areas of behavioral interest for you and your therapistpsychologist to discuss and work on what was the main reason for you to have changed diagnoses or maintain your current one thanks for taking the time to read my post ampx200b do any of you have similar experiences to this its so difficult to be psychotically suicidal for a few hours and then be fine for the next few its so difficult and i feel like i am just a pussy and faking but it feels so real and so out of control i do not want to believe that this is true what do i do ampx200b thanks,"16z0kek, 16z0kek","(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['lamictal',

IdentityCrisis247,327,my story and advice on getting healthy hello i have recently been diagnosed with bpd and i am motivated to work as hard as possible to combat this thing and lead a healthier life my story i have always been afraid of rejection and whether people like me or not this has caused my selfesteem to get really low and has also prevented me from pursuing certain career choices because i thought i was not good enough or i did not want to be rejected the biggest area that my bpd affects are my relationships all of my serious ones have never lasted more than 8 months and when i am broken up with i am devastated for years what motivated me to seek help this time last year i was in an amazing relationship with this wonderful guy we just clicked really well and had all the same goals and outlooks on life however we were in a longdistance relationship because i was in grad school 2 hours away and he lived with his mom helping to take care of his disabled dad eventually he got an offer from an old college professor to get his masters in canada free tuition this turned our 2 hour ldr into an 8 hour distance i was so frustrated at the time with the distance that i would pick fights that i knew would bug him like money or religion after 2 months of living in canada he broke up with me and i was devastated fastforward 10 months to today and the breakup still feels fresh and he is now dating his roommate who also got the same full ride to get her masters i have been obsessively contacting him for months to the point where he wants to end all communication with me which is understandable i still think about him all the time and overromanticize our relationship last time this happened where i was devastated by a breakup it took me 25 years to get over the guy completely i do not want it to take that long again to get over an ex current plan of action i work out and i eat healthy i have also reconnected with a lot of friends and i have been trying to fill up my social calendar i just started seeing a np and a therapist i am on lamictal after an adverse reaction to zoloft trazodone for sleep and the recommended dbt therapy which has not started yet because i am moving and need to find a new therapist advice 1 what other healthy activities should i look into 2 how do i stop obsessing over my ex i have told him about the bpd and he was very understanding but when my mind starts to wander i think about him and i cry and cry for hoursi do not get anything done and i want this to stop 3 are there any books or evidence based articles that are useful for reading 4 i am graduating with my masters in december but i am already having second thoughts about my career and i want to go back to school and pursue something a little different is this related to my bpd or should i pursue a new career after i graduate 5 how do you stop daydreaming and dissociating this kind of practice has helped my get over stressful situations by giving myself false hope and separating myself from the current stressers it really is not a healthy process since reality is never as good as my daydreams and i feel lower than before 4 is there hope will i overcome this bpd and lead a healthy relationship should i give up on dating and just settle into a life of singlehood i am too afraid of experiencing another breakup and the adverse emotional reactions i have to them that it does not seem worth it thanks for any words of wisdom or outreach,1b92zml,"(1, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,1,['dbt'],"['zoloft', 'lamictal', 'trazodone', 'trazodone', 'Lamotrigine', 'Sertraline', 'Trazodone']",7,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.7356,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,4,4,This information is highly relevant.

IndubitableTorch,335,the summation and conclusion of my existence i am the architect of my own downfall brace yourselves this is going to be a long boi 24m keep in mind i am having a severe identitymental health crisis and possibly dissociatingpsychotic i am skeptical that even my perceptions of memories are not reality it all started from the last vivid memory if its real that i have my parents fighting my mom for most of my childhoodadulthood was a neurotic neglectful and a workaholic attention wise she never showed me any empathy or validation unless it was based on performance or benefited her from what i could remember only spoiled me with toys to shut me up also claimed she knew something was wrong from the age of two apparently i was too insufferable for a 24 year old tells me now that she was none of those things and that it was my dad who was conditional my dad from what i could remember was overtly emotional hyper empathetic high functioning drug addict nowadays he is become cynical skeptical covertly narcissistic dependent and extremely stubborn and still using growing up he always committed to things but always was super late on doing them if he ever did polar opposites my mom took me in the middle of the night at 3ys old away from my dad i do not know the real reason why both people have different takes most of my life is a complete blur i cannot remember anything important until 1213yrs old even then every memory i have even nowadays is spotty i know that the only social connections i had consistently growing up were family members i had no friends that i remember except brief ones until highschool kids avoided me as the weird kid i was also called future school shooter a few times girls never asked me out i found out later that they were convinced not to by other people because of my weirdness i was also prescribed lithium at age 5 risperidal at age 7 i was on 60mg of ritalin w10mg of lamictal a day between ages 616 made me fall asleep in class my dad says one summer i came to visit with 13 different scripts at once i do not know what my formal diagnosis was as a kid they had me pinned with bipolar odd and adhd night terrors and even were considering aspergers at one point i do not know in therapy for years as a kid never talked to them about anything ever always deflected to something else at 18 i graduated highschool straight edge kid never used drugs had gotten drunk nor smoked cigarettes started gaining some confidence back started singing open mic locally to get out and socialize had a car was going to college had a job was off my adhd meds for 2 years prior enter my first relationship absolutely amazing perfect the one that got away i was so passionate bought gifts often went on cute dates the ideal notebook scenario half way through the relationship which lasted a year i end up getting my wisdom teeth pulled and given a 30day script of vicodin unbeknownst to my drug virgin mind at the time was a narcotic took it as prescribed was hooked in 2 weeks i became less empathetic more withdrawn my relationships my job my degree all burning down around me with me too numb to care she leaves me because i am hurting her by not being present after she leaves and to this very day i feel broken i get deeper into drugs while still maintaining jobs here and there never lasting longer than a few months my drug experimentation having fewer and fewer boundaries lying to myself that its functional and that i love the research of the drugs and how they work to try and appease my logical side i think i had another relationship about 6 months later lasted 3 months she was amazing loving did a lot for me i ghosted when things got real i did not know how to empathize when things in her life got tough i went on dates frequently after my first relationship ended they rarely went past the first date i still had only slept with 2 people by that point never had cheated never had a one night stand i think its because i got too emotionally involved so quickly keep in mind this entire time i was actively selfharming somewhatsuicidal and making extremely reckless and dangerous decisions just more on the dl back then and frequently testing my limits with whatever drug i was doing at the time i was constantly moving back and forth between my moms and dads houses whenever things got stressful wisconsin vs arizona long distance to move frequently what can i say i was used to it as a kid i was raised and went to school in wisco but visited arizona every summer and every other winter it was not until my first inpatient stint at 21 or 22 that i was diagnosed with bpd every behavior pattern mentioned in the book i bought was relatable to more than a handful of my experiences it felt like i was reading an autobiography for once i felt like i was not crazy and alone the drug use continued but was somewhat manageable until i started stealing money from my mom and the drug use also turned from coping mechanism to a tool for selfharm nssi even when times got tough i usually made it through by a combination of support group of friends concerts my car to get away when i needed to etc flash forward to now this year destroyed me a good relationship my sanity and my willpower prequarantine in december last year i had my first drug od from fentanyl laced percs narcaned 2x aspirated blood into my lungs was on life support for days it was the first time i felt like my family or anyone gave a shit about me here is where it goes downhill when lockdown starts my car is broken my once social connections to reality are mainly severed it did not help that all of my friends are 2000mi away from me i started experimenting with meth at this point in feb or march because i found it in my dads room on one occasion at random i knew what it was even though i had not done it lured me in with the focus mania and dissociation i ended up spending most of the year inside stimmed out of my mind doing too large of quantities of the substance but never going full tweak mode always had antipsychotics and emergency meds on hand inc bp cuff and pulse reader moms side of family has always been in the medical field loved the subject since i was a kid might be why i am such a hypochondriac as the months go on my obsession with the human condition my researching of how drugs work on the brain led me to become obsessed with finding out what causes the human condition on a physiologicalneurochemical level learning about hormones neurotransmitters fight or flight etc my philosophies becoming more cynical and nihilistic by the day trading emotions and emotional control for mania and logic i discovered discord which has helped me cope significantly tldr let us get to the point i feel hopeless completely devoid of motivationpassion for anything outside of my music related hobbies even those i am losing passion in i am convinced the repeated drug selfharming is going to kill me fairly soon whether intentional or not the drug has ruined what little color my life has left i have been in multiple potentially life threatening medical situations from it willingly i knowingly take large enough doses to cause harm but never enough where it will 100 kill me right then i have even less emotional control then before i am more numb to things i cannot even force myself to leave the house i am hearing faint voices that i can tell are not real occasional laughter intrusive thoughts are getting worse even seeing scenes of me hurting myself and others often in graphic detail i am more aggressive i am having night terrors on a bad day i am crying and screaming in a ball on the ground literally on a average day i have fullbodyjoint aches and headaches with an incalculable amount of mental and emotional stress for no reason at any given time which makes me do things that feed the cycle more i am aware most of this could easily be drug induced does not make it any less real to me the best way i can describe it is there is a complete and total dissociation between my logic and emotional sides i am either all logic cold uncaring numb or overtly emotional i could swear its another personality almost in short i am a hopelessly drug addicted hypocritical overtly emotional overtlyanalytical overtlylogical intelligent broken suicidal paranoid possibly psychotic depressed unmotivated dissociated 24yr old my last therapist dropped me earlier this year when i started using my final diagnosis was low functioning bpd w comorbid bipolar ii generalized anxiety disorder and

Katyafan,370,hooray i think that lamotrigine is starting to work d i have been struggling with bpd since i was diagnosed when i was 18 years old now i am 28 and even though i am calmer i never felt normal or able to carry on life like the rest of the people it has always been a constant struggle with failed relationships because of not being able to control my impulses and career stagnation because of not being able to carry life objectives until the end i tried meditation cbt yoga medication etc and some helped but the constant mood swings were always there fucking me up two months ago after another failed relationship i remembered people in this sub talking about lamotrigine i decided to investigate and it seemed to be effective the more i investigated the cooler it seemed to be so i booked an appointment with a psychiatrist and he prescribed me the drug i started taking it 6 weeks ago and have been increasing 25mg every 2 weeks had a couple of small blisters but it went away despite that i did not feel anything until yesterday so in the beginning of the week i started to talk with my ex with who i went nocontact and yesterday as i was talking to her i started to imagine her being with another guy and in the past this would be enough for set me off the rest of the day but yesterday was different i was hurt and jealous by imagining that buuut it was only for a couple of seconds and it went away i was able to carry on with work as normally and did not have that grey aura surrounding me for the rest of the day it was amazing instead of being upset i was happy now i am really hopeful that i will be able to live a normal life that is all i wanted i know that medication alone is not enough and i will have to keep practicing the cbt and try to keep a balanced life in order to have some normalcy but not being dragged back and forth and smashed against the walls by my moods everyday is like 90 of the bpd is solved,"jy7azi, gi4l3v, e67sfj","(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,1,['cbt'],"['lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lamotrigine']",3,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.8014,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,4,3,This information is very relevant.

Late-Ad-9456,389,months of clarity and progress then the darkness came back feeling lost and defeated i have avoided talking about this today and typing up an excessively long post about it all but i do not think i will be able to stop thinking about it constantly until i talk about it hope someone will read until the end and offer some reassurance or send good vibes that are very much needed today lt3 i have been on meds for the past few months i got super lucky as i started to notice lamictal working pretty early on it was awesome because i have spent years trying to find something to give my brain a break so the last few months i have been pretty stable the first month was the best it was so refreshing and my life was not the worst either the actual components of my life right now are pretty shitty but it is not destroying me as it normally would early this year i went like the entire month of july without crying which was huuuge for me lol even after i ended up breaking the streak it was a rare thing i was not yelling at my boyfriend all the time or accusing him of things i just made up in my head i was so much more in control of my emotions not experiencing the extremes anymore and i was capable of assuring myself that any intrusive thought were just in my head it was new for me it was exciting i had so much hope the past couple of weeks have been kind of tough nothing too extreme but the stress was getting overwhelming no matter how stable or possibly even numb i was to what was actually happening in my life i still felt like i was living in hell i just was not exactly sad about it if that makes sense i was even hopeful that i would adjust to it to where it was not as shitty mostly referring to my dogshit new job i still felt good about things last night my boyfriend and i had a rough conversation about something that triggered the fuck out of me i spent all night crying and feeling absolutely worthless thentoday hits god today has been so fucking shitty i clocked into work at 12 and then had to clock back out at 1 because i just could not do anything i take adderall too so usually i have no issue getting my shit done but notttt today for the last 6 hours i have been remembering and reliving everything that has happened to me in the last 11 years of misery that has led me up to be as damaged as i am now l i have been crying all day completely incapable of focusing or thinking about anything else literally just sitting in front of my computer alternating between disassociating and being on reddit waiting to finally be able to stop thinking about this so i could do my fucking work building up more and more stress thinking about my unanswered emails i do not know i just feel like i am back to the beginning it is almost as if what i am feeling seems new to me because it has been so long since i experienced such an extreme low i am feeling the weight of everything i have been able to push away for the last few months and it is pretty heavy i feel so defeated it know it seems so dramatic i do not know i just feel like all the hope i had just disappeared within a single fucking day knowing that no matter how much a medication is working there is always the possibility of getting triggered by something small and then spiraling again and having to put yourself back together again god it just sucks so much i do not know how to find the words to explain how lost and defeated i feel right now it is a mix of anger and sadness and frustration and defeat and the overwhelming urge of shutting everyone out of my life it is actually making me sick to my stomach i hate that something so small can make us feel like our world is ending something i have been free of experiencing for the past few months now i hate that my medication did not help this i hate that this will probably be my reality forever i am just so tired of the constant battles it is been years of living in misery i wish i was not me i wish this was not my life ps i will be talking w my psychiatrist about increasing the dosage of course just got to wait until the end of the month,14cuafw,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['lamictal', 'adderall', 'Lamotrigine', 'Amphetamine']",4,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.8647,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,3,2,This information is relevant.
LateNiteRedditor,390,finally coming to terms with my diagnosis i am 23 and i have seen 8 therapists and 3 psychiatrists within the past 9 years therapy has been a temporary relief and i am not currently seeing a therapist though i know i should i am really glad i found this sub because i thought for a long time that i was the only one feeling this way so it is nice to see that i am not the only one battling the crazy feelings and tendencies i have therapy never lasts long for me because i lie i lie a lot i get ashamed of my issues so i pretend like they do not exist and just talk about my past mostly i do not bring up any current issues just the same shit about being insecure and shy and victimizing myself lies and then after a month or two they send me off because they think i am okay it is taken the past year and a half to finally slow my thoughts down enough to become aware of my actions my boyfriend helped me a lot with this and i love him more than anything he has put up with so much of my crazy victimizing manipulative bs and has helped me learn to be a better person along the way i do not know how he does it he is a true angel i feel so much unlike other people to the point of discomfort i have no friends save my boyfriend my parents my sister and a best friend who lives far away i talk to myself in the car to console myself and get my thoughts straight i also have maladaptive daydreaming that is pretty much a total impairment i have been doing it for so long when i was young i started by imagining two girls living in my head controlling my thoughts and actions one was goofy lazy sarcastic the other motivated smart as hell and a hard ass one of my therapists was truly fascinated by this and thinks that they represent the dual way i see myself i hate it because it is started such a burden that has gotten worse over time even when i am talking with someone my mind just runs off with another thought i do not get what they are saying and then i hate myself for being a shitty listener i imagine everything i imagine myself being perfect being not me because i hate me it is an impossible standard and it makes me depressed i wonder if i have adhd at work and at home i put off things forever i have been an avid writer all my life but i put it off now because i cannot sit still same when i was in college doing homework once i took ritalin to study for a test and it was out of this world i had never been so happy and motivated but i do not think my doctor would ever give me that i was taking lamictal when i saw my old psychiatrist she refused to diagnose me my diagnoses have oscillated from depression to bipolar to borderline she hinted it was more borderline but she did not want to say for sure since she said it can be hard to distinguish from bipolar and i guess i did not see her long enough for her to track what my issues were but i do not get the bipolar mood cycles it is beyond crazy moods my moods fluctuate daily my self image is disgusting i hate myself i playfully fantasize about suicide i would never do it i fear my boyfriend will leave and i cannot handle fights at all i get super happy then super sad within a two hour time span i manipulate people i argue senselessly and i wander out of my body so much it is insane i feel like i am wrapped in string and i just float away from myself i say things without even realizing what i am saying until i get called out and then i have to blubber around saying i never meant it just because i have no self control i have smoked weeks for 3 years and now i take lamictal again it is been really great and i have really never had such stable moods though i still have plenty of issues to continue working on but it slows me down enough that dealing with problems seems manageable and i take klonopins for anxiety i have had debilitating anxiety since i was a kid and i never realized my intense physical fear had anything to do with that until i read more on it and received treatment i am very careful about taking it because i know it is addictive i take a tiny dose i used to abuse stuff like that but i am really proud of myself because i generally have no self control but i have been great about keeping this under control but still i hate myself not really who i am now i have no identity i have relied on other people telling me who i am to create an identity but it is never me it is never enough and it never makes me happy i hate who i used to be because i think everything i have done is embarrassing and horrible but people say i am a really nice person and think i am really smart i am working full time and acing a grad level class i take in the evenings but it is still not enough when i get good grades or positive feedback i just think they know i am crazy and they are helping me get good grades so i will not hurt myself this is me every day i try to make schedules change habits but really i do not care i have felt so shitty for so long it is second nature i want to change just not enough to follow through i have no idea how to stop and just discipline myself this is a mess of a post but i have been wanting to post here for a while to get stuff off my chest maybe hear from someone who feels this way too i consider myself high functioning when i am out in the world but alone i am a train wreck i want to lost everyone i know and run away and live and die alone i am a burden and should not be exposed to a damn person because i am rude and shitty and a tornado of shitty thoughts and moods i hate this so much,"198dxa3,
