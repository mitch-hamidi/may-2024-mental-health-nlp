0w_l,2,the way social media assumes things about and is portraying bpd is so fucking harmful and frustrating like i am a rare case of bpd developing at a very young age i have dealt with it fo at least 14 years most of which were unknowing on top of a laundry list of other comorbid problems and disorders the current social media narratives around this disorder is so fucking scary for me to see i see teenagers on twitter and tik tok self diagnosing and talking about their fps with heart emotes and asking for advice on how to tell them like it is just an intense fucking crush and not a horrible obsessive fixation no healthy person with good intentions towards you would be comfortable withwant you to have towards them for both you sakes one that it is your responsibility to manage and not put on another person who did not ask for it it is either romanticized enabling bullshit that mirrors my internal dialogue i used to justify some of my worst behavior moments that ruined relationships or are still affecting my life today and treats mood swings as a quirk instead of an incredibly invasive and overwhelming experience that feels like it retraumatizes you a little every time or it is infantilizing and demonization they cannot control themselves they are naturally manipulative they have no idea they are doing it and can never change i am extremely aware of myself and my issues constantly to the point i have to also worry about accidentally gaslighting myself as a coping mechanism on top of regulating my fucked up emotions i work so hard to be self aware manage my mood swings in a way that does not lash out at others limit pushing other peoples boundaries and argue with myself and play devils advocate whenever i am splitting on someone this condition has permanently altered how i function as a person and made my life so much harder than it needed to be and despite mental health being such a hot topic for people to throw attention to and improve the narrative on i have never felt more misunderstood by the world than the last few years and it is so fucking frustrating,mtba08,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.9618,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,1,1,This information is minimally relevant.

1air2d,6,long looking for any kind of help regarding a friendshiprelationship with someone having bpd hello everyone this is going to be rather long so thanks to everyone actually reading over all of this i really appreciate it english is not my first language and i am very confused about a lot of stuff that is going on so i am really sorry if there are any passages that might be confusing or hard to readunderstand i am trying my best i met this girl online somewhere around june last summer she was in a relationship when we actually met with no intentions of anything more than friendship between us her extremely toxic relationship was basically over already at this point which i did not know at this point of course and the breakup was basically a few days after we first had contact she had her best friendfavorite person which was basically there for her all the time but apparently she found me very interesting as well so we had quite a lot of contact during this time as well i am a generally very empathic person and am always happy to help or be there for someone if i am actually able to help them feel better so naturally i did she grew attached quite fast and we basically had contact every day without exception via chat at first callstalking via discord later on due to her mental state at this point she opened up very quickly to meabout her having bpd as well talking about basically everything and i had absolutely no problem with this i was actually happy for all the trust she put into me all of this was very interesting to me and mental illness is something that is very interesting to me anyways i had depression for quite a while as well as some other mental health issues still in therapy as well but i am at a point where i am actually stable without any limitiations to every day life or anything similar and she actually suggested me a book about bpd since i mentioned that i was openly interested in understand her and the illness we grew attached quite a lot over time still as friends only but we would have some cheeky flirting going on all the time nothing serious though over time this had become more and more though with her even telling me that she would probably have fallen in love with me if she was not right in the middle of lovesickness which was obviously very flattering for me but nothing more than that at some point we even went over chat logs with her ex for her to realize that she was not the only problem in her relationship and only at this point she actually noticed how terribly toxic her relationship and exbf actually was i was sincerely shocked over how cruel people could actually be obviously she was not completely innocent how her relationship went but this was nothing onesided at all due to this she could finally conclude the relationship and any chance to ever actually get together with him ever again this is where it probably started getting complicated as i slowly started developing feelings that involved more than friendship and it was quite obvious that she did as well this all happened around 4 months after we got to know each other and at some point she actually opened up about how she was feeling as well and that she actually fell in love with me due to her only coming out of a 2 year relationship and the distance between us around 7 hours we did not go that much further into this and just went on with how it went between us anyways doing stuff together online the usual flirting watching movies together etc fast forward in november we started planning to actually meet up and we did actually meet in december this was a huge thing obviously her therapist she started therapy in late october that year actually scrutinised this heavily and i was actually unsure if she would actually pull through with all of this but she did and we met up the time was amazing with her getting to know my family me getting to know hers we had tons of fun and an amazing time together there were so many signs of how great we actually fit together all the stuff like her mentioning that i actually made her feel good and beautiful for the first time in her life she did have some terrible relationships she was actually completely confused when i started adressing compliments to her as she never experienced something like that in her life we actually were together for a few days when she realized that this was all too fast for her and she was not ready for a relationship at this point which obviously made me very sad but there was nothing i could do at this point that would actually change anything so i could only accept this for now we simply carried on as before as very good friends i guess there has been a lot back and forth since then with her saying that she definitely wants to see me again that what we have actually is a relationship just without calling it like that because she is afraid of it her saying that she has no timepowerstrength for a relationship but on the other hand her telling me that i should stop having any expectations or hope as she is unable to actually love or ever have a healthy relationship her having her priorities everywhere but about having a relationship at all at one point she actually mentioned that she wants to see me again but that i should not have any kind of hopes about getting together at this point that she just wanted to see me again that she just wants to have someone be with her i honestly sometimes have no idea at all what of this her bpd is and what is actually rational thinking of her this permanent uncertainty is really nagging on me and is sometimes making me feel really terrible especially her mentioning the fact that she cannot have a relationship at the moment feels really bad there are so many contradictory signs where at one point she tells me about how we do actually have a relationship i just should not see or call it as one as this is what she is struggling with her telling me how she is completely trusting me and how important i am for her but on the other hand the fact that i should not have any hopes or expectations as she is way too scared of not being able to fullfill them and losing me altogether once again i am really sorry about how complicated all of this might sound it is extremely complicated in my head so it is actually really hard to write this all out and i am really hoping that everything is understandable to a certain degree at no point ever have i ever thought about ending this or to stop working on all of this as she really is everything i have ever wanted in a partner i truly am in love as complicated as it might be i honestly do not care and am happy to push through all of this hoping for a positive outcome it permanently feels like she does not know at all what she actually wants or needs herself even though how obviously i am enhancing her life and making everything better and easier for her this is not supposed to sound arrogant or pretentious in any way this is actually something she has told me very often she has terrible mentalscars from her former relationship with some of them that have not even started healing yet at all though i really hope that therapy is going to help with this and i would be more than happy to show her that there are is another kind of relationship than the ones she had until now i am sometimes struggling though all this back and forth is sometimes very exhausting there is times where this is worse times where everything is a lot clearer and easier as well though times where it is absolutely clear that she definitely wants a relationship and all of this and other times where it feels like there is no chance for us to ever get together at all this uncertainty is extremely hard to bear for me from time to time i am unsure what kind of help or support i am looking for here but at this point probably anything and everything is going to help just writing all of this down as confusing as it might be i am really sorry was already helpful for me anything that i could read learn or do any kind of opinion about all of this honestly everything is probably going to help me so i am happy about whatever there is to say if anyone actually bothered to read all of this thank you if there is anything unclear of which i am sure there is quite a lot of i am absolutely happy to answer any kind of question thanks for reading this and thanks to everyone that might try to help me out with all of this,"1befrjf, 1befrjf","(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user

Adromeda_G,24,going to be evaluated for bpd hi i am hesitant to post this purely because i know there is mixed opinions on minors receiving bpd diagnoses i am 16f but i want to do it anyway i went through severe trauma in my childhood and suffered a lot since the last time i saw a psychiatrist was at 14 and he said i did have very clear traits of bpd but that he wanted to see if it would go away as i got older i got a bunch of diagnoses including unspecified bipolar disorder but it did not fit i received cbt and emdr and to treat my trauma and other diagnoses and a few different meds but it was not effective at all it is recently got to the point where my behavior has spiraled out of control and neither my mother current psychologist or school or really anyone in my life knows how to handle me anymore so tonight i have an appointment with my psychologist and she told me they have been in touch with a place that specializes in personality disorders and can help treat my symptoms and possibly diagnose me if they are certain i have it to get into all my symptoms would make for a very long post but if anyone has any questions feel free to ask i am just very anxious because i do not know what to expect and i was not even aware of how much problems i was causing with my behavior,1b0qxii,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,2,"['cbt', 'emdr']",[],0,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.8623,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,4,0,This information is not relevant.

AdviceRepulsive,27,my best friends i was very dependent on left me and i have no idea what to do i am a girl who just turned 16 a couple days ago i had 2 friends i knew and messaged everyday for almost a year we had a gc together and we would just infodump everything about our lives to each other i vented there a lot about my mental health issues mainly my bpd i also feel like i created a fake character just to be liked by them i was so dependent on them and their love and praise i had no other place to vent and they seemed to be understanding of my issues so i thought it was all fine i think a big part of the reason they started to dislike me was that despite being so mentally ill and unhappy i have had a rather privileged upbringing compared to them and supporting parents i am not even sure how most of my mental health issues developed i believe it was genetics or because the schools i went to as a very little kid had terrible teachers who damaged me mentally i already felt like this made my problems invalid but of course i could not change my brain or how i felt it was my birthday a couple days ago and they both wished me a happy birthday i felt a little ignored by them though we continued on as normal until i posted a screenshot of me achieving something in a game we all played and friend 1 suddenly blocked me and left the gc i asked friend 2 why friend 1 blocked me they said they had no idea and they probably just wanted a break i then said i was scared i did something wrong and friend 2 said they did not think so so i did not worry and just moved on with my day i was worrying they would both leave me but i denied it because they both knew about my extreme abandonment issues and that they were some of my only friends so why would they do that to me then i saw friend 2 unfollowed me on all social media that is when i panicked i decided i would leave them before they left me to avoid the feeling of abandonment so i unfriended them on other platforms before they could then i got a very long message from friend 2 they explained that we cannot be friends anymore they were aware of my issues and said that i need to seek professional help and that they cannot help me and they are afraid they are enabling me and making it worse they also told me i need to grow up because i am 16 now and cannot be a kid forever they think i have not changed the whole year they have known me and act like a dumb attention seeking child they brought up some behavior and things i have said that were rather stupid and damaging but i did not realize they were then they said they still care about me and they want me to find better friends and be happier i cried reading the message i was not even angry at them i was just sad i wrote a reply apologizing and wishing them well too but it did not go through because i assume they blocked me then i got a message from friend 1 they called me spoiled and ungrateful and said some other nasty things about me i could not stop shaking reading the message and i wanted to believe it was not real i wanted to believe none of this was real i wanted to stay with my friends but it was over and there was nothing i could do they were just celebrating my birthday a couple days ago and it felt so unreal this was only a few hours ago and i cannot stop crying i really do not know what to do and i feel super lost i feel like a spoiled brat and like all my issues are invalid i only have a few other friends besides them and this guy i had a crush on left me about a month ago and i miss him like hell too it also hurts knowing that both of them are still friends without me i know friend 2 wants me to get professional help but i tried therapy a couple months ago and it did not work out or help because i have a lot of trouble opening up to adults i feel like i wasted so much time talking to those 2 friends and caring about them for nothing i am just so lost and i cannot stop crying but at the same time i feel guilty for it because of how spoiled and ungrateful i apparently am how can i cope with this and move on tldr my best friends left me one of them was nice and mature about it but the other one was nasty and made me feel like shit to them my problems are not valid because i am a stupid spoiled ungrateful brat who needs to grow up i do not know what to do now because i was so emotionally dependent on them and i cannot stop crying i need help coping with this and moving on,1c0563s,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,0.9955,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,0,This information is not relevant.

Baileyertz44,73,an appreciation on a new perspective hi everyone i will be honest and say before i met my friend with bpd i did not know a single thing about it much less even question it but after learning more and more both by asking her questions about how things can be for her and seeking as much information as i could about the the terms and topics that both came up from talking and from what i discovered while exploring around on the subject i have learned to look at people in a different way maybe sometimes when i saw a reaction i thought previously was a little extreme or something that just did not click in my head how someone can be it made me consider if more is going on with people it made me think how ignorant i was to this fact of life for some people where sometimes they do not have that ability to control how they felt around others or a situation i have done my best to keep on being supportive of my friend and to be patient and understanding with her since i have known her and i hope i can always continue learning about bpd and continuing to to show her and your community more support everyday and i just wanted to say thank you to everyone for enduring and prospering when sometimes you did not believe you could and for doing what you do every single day to help better yourselves through a very serious thing that really does need more attention out in the world,11mbwou,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,0.9859,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,0,This information is not relevant.
Bakedbbyofficial,74,how can i help my gf to not feel bad every time i had an emotion so when my gf and i got together she was very understanding and open to learning about bpd and understanding my feelings and where they come from etc but i think it kind of went too far basically my gf has been struggling for like the last six months because every time i have an emotion my gf feels it too if i am sad she is sad if i cheer up she cheers up then gets confused about the quick change then is exhausted from how fast my emotions can change from one extreme to the other she knows my emotions are not always rational and she is educated so it feels like absolutely nothing i say to her is helpful because she knows it already i am trying to hide my emotions from her now so that she stops struggling with the intensity but that upsets her too and it does not even work most of the time she can tell when my emotions change literally from the way my eyebrow moves even if i try to not show anything and i said she should maybe try reading more about being with someone with bpd and dealing with the rapid emotion changes etc and she said she does not want to so that is confused me too because i do not understand why she does not want to fix this issue but she is also at the point where she is not happy in the relationship because of this so i really do not know what to do any advice is appreciated aside from advice to break up our relationship is very very good this is just an issue i am not sure how to solve as i am not sure how to support her,16w7ykf,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.5442,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,0,This information is not relevant.

Beardedweeb,79,psychic connection with my ex partner who has bpd for those of you who believe in this stuff i am pretty sure i have a psychic connection with my exgf who has bpd traits it is been two years since we broke up and i went no contact because she hurt me pretty bad and was devaluing me because she was unstable at that time i let her go and it was the hardest thing i have ever done i have not dated anyone in 2 years the pandemic helped with that but i just was not interested to be honest i always hoped she would heal and somehow our paths would cross again from time to time i would see her birthdate pop up as the time on my phone no big deal right but then one time last year i woke up in the middle of the night and had this intuition to get on a certain dating site and i did not know why as i scrolled through the pics there she was i did not send her a message i was in shock then about 6 months ago something that she had given me fell and broke i felt that something had happened i meditated on it and the word engaged popped into my head i was not sure if it was real i had no way of verifying it because she cancelled her fb account after we broke up which by the way i felt was weird because she had done things to hurt me so why was she trying to hide anyway this morning i woke up in the middle of the night and had an intuition to search for her i call these psychic hits because it is like the thought to check something just comes to me for no reason out of the blue i had not thought of her consistently for a couple of months now so when i get these i follow up on them i literally saw something in my dream about marriage so i went and looked it up and sure enough she just got married i was freaked out and of course had the gamet of emotions i felt happy for her but sad for myself i guess i got my closure i have heard so many stories about people with bpd typically will reach out to their ex if they loved them but this was not the case for us i hope she has healed and will have a good life just sad right now that things did not work out for us,"gvcfta, gvcfta, gvcfta","(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.0739,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,0,This information is not relevant.

DisposableReason,188,honest question possibly a long one okay let me list out the following 1 let us say i have been feeling the scope of how much i am not a priority in peoples lives which is okay i guess for the most part because i am in a different time zone to most and they all have families etc i think everyone i know prioritises family and i do not understand that too much as because of my life friends mean everything to me disparity is there fine so i have been quite understanding of less and less contact but when i actually ask for help fight all instinct and thought to tell them maybe i need a bit more monitoring or more presencesit does not really happen 2 i am quite tired of being more active in checking in on them bridging the gap as it were trying to have a chat etc it feels all the more difficult because of my mental state 3 it has got to a point where the communication with the people i consider friends is more of a surprise when it happens as opposed to something i can count on i should say that i do not talk to them about all the bullshit just want to have the company so it is not always a serious conversation and i always ask if it is a serious conversation if they have the space for it and definitely tell me when it is too much which they have done 4 i am feeling the old need to distance myself from people i am in a bad place so i am aware that it might just be a symptom showing up but at the same time is it a bad thing if a need is not being met and i am counting on it is not it better if i learn distance again and just get by on my own like i am left to do anyway feeling that much more alone and isolated 5 i guess my question is is my thinking so skewed that it is a terrible idea to take some quiet time from everyone i mean i have already told them that if i am quiet for 3 days that they should probably reconnect because of what i just recently learnt about emotional permanence and the other thing i have no reason to think they will do it and it is usually me who thinks i should do it so i do not delve deeper into my aloneness any thoughts thanks for reading,uclbk4,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.8294,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,0,This information is not relevant.

Flashy-Ad9640,262,question regarding cheating with bpd hi there i 22m do not have bpd but i am asking about cheating because i found out my now ex boyfriend 22m with bpd cheated on me throughout the course of our relationship of just under a year with many other people naturally i got upset and upon finding out broke up with him but since he has messaged me saying things like it is because of his bpd that he was trying to sabotage the relationship and provoke me to break up with him to punish himself and also that it was meant to liberate me from the relationship because he does not deserve me i am also upset because i found out he cheated earlier in the relationship it destroyed me and we had a lot of conversations about it i thought it was a one time thing and expressed to him that if it happens again i would leave at the time he also blamed it on his bpd saying he was testing himself or something like that and i worked really hard with him to regain my trust in him however since i have come to learn that he was just manipulating me and continuing to serially cheat whenever i would ask him about a guy because he was acting suspect he would be so great at talking to me and putting my mind at ease when in reality my suspicions have turned out to have always been correct my question is does this make sense i do not want to believe it is all due to his bpd because he never told me about the cheating i found out from a third party and proceeded to look at his phone and it was continuous throughout the relationship so i cannot imagine he ever actually intended on telling me long story short i am just confused and ultimately do not want to believe that this was just a symptom of bpd because he is blaming everything on his diagnosis and making himself the victim in my mind i find it hard to believe that he would betray me so much and so willingly to provoke me or free me when he was actively hiding it from me it feels like he is just using his diagnosis as a scapegoat for getting caught and had no intention of ever telling me about his infidelity like he wanted the comfort of our relationship which on all other accounts was actually quite stable and felt fulfilling and interesting on my part while also sleeping with other people on the side i would really like the insight of other people w bpd on this does this make sense to you obviously you do not know him but what is you impression of the situation i do not know what to think,1aseuyf,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.9931,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,0,This information is not relevant.

FuzzAway7,275,new fp my bpd backstory i thought i was safe from having another favorite person for a while after i got over my exboyfriend which took months to do and required so much hard work pushing him out of my everyday thoughts and so on it was two days before my birthday when i basically forced myself to be completely over him knowing it would ruin my birthday if i woke up expecting a hbd text and did not end up getting one it ended up being the first birthday for as long as i can remember where i did not sob uncontrollably for no particular reason for some reason the night before i decided to take one of my friends along with me to meet this guy who she was friends with after we would exchanged a few texts about potentially seeing each other individually since we had so many mutual friends as the night progressed i began to realize how attracted to him i was which i tend not to take lightly because of how rare it is for me to catch genuine feelings for someone on a regular day i will feel completely asexual until months later i will randomly meet someone and start to like them a lot like to the point where they are all i think about and i become completely obsessed anyways we have not seen each other since then but he is now without a doubt my new favorite person and has been for almost a month i once had an fp last for going on three years and it was not fun i mean to say the least i turned down almost every advance i received even if i did like the person i was getting romantic attention from it felt as if i was betraying him even though we had not spoken in years and he expressed no interest in getting back together with me i lived my life every day feeling like he was watching me and could hear everything i said including my internal thoughts any time i would say something slightly embarrassing even if it was to myself when no one was around the phrase would repeat in my head until i felt complete and utter shame due to the fact that it always felt like he was watching over me judging me i experienced the same thing with my most recent favorite person and the second i realized it was recurring with the guy i like now i kind of started to freak out because we barely know each other i told him i found him attractive and he seemed excited to go out with me but for some yettobediscovered reason i always tend to catch feelings for extremely mentally ill people like myself i guess i thought he was perfectly well which caused me to mask my true personality in order to seem healthier for him but he dropped the bomb on me that he went into a depressive episode and does not want to accidentally push me away because of how overwhelmed he would get when getting to know someone while feeling like this i do not know what to do because i am in need of constant reassurance and i cannot expect that from someone who i recently found out does not even consider what we have to be a talking stage i do not want to lose feelings for him as freeing as it would be this feels so innocent and better for me than any other relationship i have been in i just want him to feel the same and be expressive of it i feel so trapped sucking in my stomach even when no one is looking and feeling like i need to look cute while brushing my teeth because i feel as if he is watching my every move like he is god or something is so dehumanizing even though in a way i am doing this to myself sorry if that was rambly and all over the pace but anyone who understands what i am trying to say can you offer me any help what advice do i need in order to stop my life from revolving around this,1cra8gn,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,0.9955,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,0,This information is not relevant.

Haunted-Hemlock,301,in response to a comment about splitting there was a post by someone asking how they can be more supportive of their pwbpd reading thru the comments i came across one that i just wanted to respond to because it is something i struggle with and feel strongly about i would like to get some feedback on this if you do not mind the comment was giving advice about how to handle splitting the pwobpd suggested that when an episode arises and the pwbpd starts attacking verbally to learn when tojust ignore and let it blow over i do not want to use the wrong term and offend and i am definitely not saying it does not work sometimes but i think that mindset is lacking emotional intelligence and very unhelpful if not highly damaging to both people splitting in bpd is something i do not think most people really understand overreacting spitefulness being an evil psycho bitch that is what it looks like but it is not just getting mad and getting even and it is so much more complicated than black and white thinking it is the reaction to intense and confusing negative emotions to feeling persecuted betrayed neglected abandoned it is so much more than feeling disappointed let down ignored criticized it is feeling broken and lost and alone it is hopelessness and frustration that builds into a frenzied desperation to get it out to make it stop tomake it go away by giving it back it is a culmination of grief resentment and fear that is directed outward the things that come out of our mouths during an episode i have said some really vile disgusting shit that makes me sick when i think about it the cruelty and hatefulness i have unleashed on people that i love is something that i will never forgive myself for some of them tried to believe me when i apologized tried to believe that i did not mean any of it that it was not me but the bpd but patience wears thin confidence starts to fade trust gets broken love is lost the willingness and ability to forgive diminish because the disrespect cannot be forgotten splitting can be incredibly destructive because it hurts both people it is easy to see the damage caused by the pwbpd but i do not think many realize understand or really care about how deeply it affects us in a recent relationship my fp would not feed into my bullshit when i was splitting he expected it and would wait til i stopped but the only thing that stopped was the outward expression i internalized the grief resentment and fear added guilt shame and selfloathing i hated myself for hurting him when he was trying to understand and accept and love me i hated myself for loving him when he was causing me to feel that way it started a chain reaction of selfsabotage my fears that he would get tired of it and leave brought on crazy paranoia the thought that he could leave me when i obviously needed him more than ever caused anger that made words not enough i did a lot of things that i am ashamed of i lost a lot of respect for myself i damaged myself i lost someone who had given me so much i destroyed pieces of him that he will never get back i hurt him in ways that changed him into someone he did not want to be this is why treatment and therapy are so so important for both people in a bpd relationship trying to not take everything someone says personal is good advice but what if they take it personal ignoring the problem thinking it will just blow over and eventually get better does not help anyone without treatment living with bpd is like being stuck in a tar pit the more you struggle the faster you sink and anyone who tries to help without the right tools will fall in and sink too and you will be stuck in the darkness separated from everyone and everything and so will they it is important to know the tools and how to use them to help someone climb out and make sure you are both okay after when it comes to questions about how to deal with bpd in any way the only answer should be treatment,1bzhjuy,"(1, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.9994,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,2,2,This information is relevant.

Infinitecurlieq,337,this cycle is terrible i am having a really rough time once a while ago i had a great relationship that fell apart pretty suddenly they handled it poorly i handled it poorly and in the end because i did not know how to handle it properly they were able to convince everyone of our mutual friends every friend i has at the time that the lies they spread about me were true i lost everyone now i am in this terrible cycle i will get a friend allow myself to care about them then if something changes or starts to differ from how it was like all friendships do my mind will make me think they have secret resentment for me or are starting to dislike me they will then get annoyed by me asking about it which will cause me to worry even more and because my worries to become more frequent until eventually the whole friendship falls apart it is a self fulfilling prophecy of a cycle where each time reinforces the next it feels awful every time but worse is the effect it has on the people i cared about it is horrible seeing how frustrated angry and upset the whole cycle makes them and i cannot even tell them how sorry i am because i cannot stop these things from getting worse instead of better after every talk we have about it i have been through 4 of these cycles and am now at the close of the fifth this person is the best friend i have ever had we only knew each other for a year but we became very close quite quickly she did more for me and put up with more from me than anyone could ever be expected to we supported eachother through hard times and laughed through great times she is an amazing person who deserves a friend so much better than me and i love her so much maybe it was the speed at which we became friends but i have been worried for a while that we would fall apart just as quickly and sure enough my mind jumped at the opportunity to make me panic and soon the talks we had to reassure me got more and more frequent to the point where it was an every day occurrence soon she started to feel like i was blaming her for things she did not do and eventually she was just tired of the whole thing and somehow the worst part for me is that she still cares about me even through all of this and i cannot stop making it worse the only thing that would stop it is to do nothing but every day of that causes me nothing but stress and anxiety i just want things to go back to how they were before i stopped believing the friendship was stable and before she had to worry about being careful about literally everything she said around me we just recently had a huge argument that lead to us not seeing each other for a week part of me is hoping that this will give me a chance to refocus and maybe make things better next time we talk but part of me is worried that either she will realize how much easier things are without the constant need to worry about me or that i will feel like we are more distant than ever when this is over and not be able to handle the change i want to be better i want to make things better between us but mostly i want to stop causing the most genuinely kind and wonderful person i know the person who i fully believe most deserves happiness to be without it so often i am not fully sure what the purpose of this post is i think mostly i needed to vent and to be understood but also i am hoping maybe someone has been where i am before and might have some advice thanks for reading,"y5ay6h, y5ay6h, y5ay6h","(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,0.9978,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,0,This information is not relevant.

IrascibleOnion,347,going to therapy this wednesday and i am terrified i have not been to therapy in a while last time i saw one i got the feeling she was just downright lazy because she would never do or recommend anything my two other therapists before that one were ok but i did not feel like i got much out of it recently my dads insurance switched because he got a new job which means we had to switch psychiatrists because i am still on his insurance the new psychiatrist listened to me explain my past and at the end she very urgently suggested i see a therapist as soon as possible and got me booked with one in her same office i am very nervous first of all because i rely on my medication to help me with adhd and i am afraid they are going to talk to each other to find a reason to get me off my meds or try something different when what i am on has been working just fine things like this have happened to me before i am also just really terrified of opening up even answering some basic questions about my past with the psychiatrist yesterday made me want to cry i have finally achieved some level of stability by working through my problems on my own with reassurance and support from my partner i do not want some random lady digging into my past and making my life harder by having me remember shit when i am not ready i hate that about therapists they act as if it is some kind of special relationship bitch i am fucking paying you and you will forget me the second i stop paying you also from my experience they just sit there and expect me to do all the talking like homie i can fucking write in a diary if i wanted to monologue how about you actually give me answers when i ask you questions instead of making vague statements that are supposed to mimic support as you can see i have a bit of residual anger left from my previous experiences i do respect the therapy profession even though it may not seem like it in this post my sister has had some amazing therapists and she herself is working towards becoming one so i am not hateful towards all therapists i am just scared i do not want to do it i do not want to remember things i do not want to feel pain anymore nowadays when i feel pain i can manage it because it is measured at my own pace but if i have to talk about it all with a therapist it can make my life harder when i leave the therapists office because i have to work i have shit to do i do not want to have to leave work because i am having a breakdown because my therapist and i decided to talk about my relationship with my parents that morning,182ugt9,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.9868,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,3,1,This information is minimally relevant.

Iwilltakeyourpencil,349,i know i am handling this appropriately but hooooly moly is selfdoubt a thing my kid attended a 4 day leisure program a few weeks back over the break she struggled when she was there but i was being told conflicting things for example one person said she had covered her ears and screamed a couple times during the morning while another said she had been hysterical all day i was told she had a great day one day and the next day i was told that she had been crying every single day she had been there i was obviously upset to learn this at the end of the week and said that i needed a clear picture please i talked to someone in management when the staff were unable to provide me with a written copy of what had been happening and the write up i was permitted to see only and not copy was full of ambiguity and conflicting information any way the manager was helpful and we came up with a plan they would get me a quick little write up of the weeks happenings so that i could bring it forward to a doc or counselor to get my kiddo the supports she may need since we are only just getting her in to social settings like this as the pandemic eases up she has special needs so now is when we can see what sensory and attention issues are happening and i want to make sure we can provide her with what she needs to be comfortable and succeed in what she wants to pursue in life this is the second time she has struggled during a dropoff recreational program different companies so i know that we should be looking at what is going on or at least be tracking it i have left four voicemails over three weeks since and i was finally answered to be told that they needed another 6 days to provide me the information due to staff absence i have heard nothing since so i left another voicemail with the manager reminding them that my daughters doc appointment was coming up something i mentioned when we spoke and nothing so i have left a voice mail with the owner and i am stressed i know that i have been handling this well i have been making sure that i am keeping my correspondences polite and to the point i keep saying that i understand times are chaotic right now with the pandemic i have explained that i just want a timeline of when this information will be available to me so that i can book the appropriate appointment with my daughters pediatrician i have had one come and go already i paid the doc just to let her know that information will be coming because my daughter had a very rough time in a social setting it is just so frustrating because i am doubting myself constantly and my paranoia is flaring huge i am scared they are going to throw us out of the other programs she and i attend through them i am scared that because we pay a subsidized amount that they are going to treat me rudely i am scared of i do not know everything so i just want to walk away from this because the unfairness of this is making me want to explode in rage and i just do not want to bpd all over the place you know but i need to figure out how to remind myself that i am not wanting to keep myself in check i have every right to be pissed off it is just that i am wanting to stay effective in handling this and i know i have been but all that selfdoubt makes me spin why bother the owner anyway so then i beat on myself for not being mature enough to handle this or causing a big deal when there is not one except that i am handling this very very well i think i do not know and i think this is a big deal i wish i trusted myself more frick,12xrl1n,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.7379,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,1,1,This information is minimally relevant.

Loaded5,419,my boyfriend and his bestie ok so i will go straight to the point i was feeling really shit these last weeks and i always went to my boyfriend for support until he was feeling bad mentally and needed his space which i respect the thing is he almost did not talk to me and that is completely fine because he needs space when he feels low but i saw on instagram that his best friend was going to his house i had a fucking panick attack because i was already feeling extremely paranoid that he was talking with everyone but me that he needed distance but only from me that was like a confirmation and i panicked i told him i was feeling horrible and wanted to talk about it because relationships do not work without comunication and he told me the truth of his situation and that he was not talking behind my back that day he was feeling better and they talked to him because they needed to do their homework in his pc i calmed down and tried to rationalize the extreme physical pain i was feeling because of my intense emotions vanished and felt much better later that night i woke up at 6am and saw that his bestie uploaded an instagram story she was sitting on top of him they were not cuddling or anything but still it is kind of weird and felt bad about it but tried to no think about it and sleep for a little bit more i had a nightmare about him liking them more than me will not go into details it is long af and now the next day i told him about my nightmare and my jealousy and he said he will be more careful and not upload that kind of things completely fine i guess but in which world you decide just after hearing your partner having a breakdown and talking about their jealousy that you are going to upload a weird story about just what bothers me i always try to make him comfortable and be better for him but does he even care i told him many times that his friend makes me jealous but ehy would yo keep posting weird shit online even knowing it will probably bother me i do not want him to stop hanging out with them i do not want to be a toxic person what else can i do i think anyone without bpd would feel like shit if this happened to them it is not my fault really i found it really disrespectful it is like they are the couple and i am his friend i do not know what to tell him anymore without sounding controlling or toxic or manipulative or shitty,gxp1y0,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,0.6221,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,0,This information is not relevant.

MamaShayButter,447,what to do with unexpressed affection hey all i do not know if this is a common problem amongst people with bpd but here goes anyway basically i have a really serious crush at the moment we went on a date i thought it went well but he did not want another we are on good terms though good thing too as we have to see each other every day and one thing that is worth mentioning is that he is extremely affectionate with everyone myself included while it is nice that he is affectionate with me on an emotional level it is probably kind of confusing as it can make it feel like he is reciprocating when he is not like when we say goodbye he full on kisses me on the cheek and let us me do the same to him he is doing it because he is like that i am doing it because it is him and i am practically in love with the guy i have not seen him in two weeks different to the usual 5 hours every weekday because he is had a bereavement and has been away because of that so as a result of not seeing him and also feeling sad for him and worried about him i really really really want to give him the most enormous hug ever knowing him he will appreciate a massive hug but i am worried that i might go overboard somehow i do not even know what that would entail but i am worried about it happening i am also worried that having not spoken to him in person for so long i am going to accidentally pile on the compliments too much or declare my love for him or something like that i guess what i am asking yous for advice on is firstly how to have some self control and not get carried away and mess things up and also how to deal with the uneasiness when i am alone of wanting to be affectionate with him spend time with him talk to him or text him etc when i have to try and go at the speed he is going at so not really going very far at all,14cucsk,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,0.9937,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,0,This information is not relevant.

Miserable_Elephant12,469,just got dumped by my reddit friend who also has bpd last year before i finally went to therapy i asked my local reddit community about this particular therapy place that i was interested in going my reddit friend entered my chats and long story short we both not only have bpd but we also go to the same therapy place our sesh are usually scheduled on the same day too and we both have the same fav spot i was very grateful for her words of affirmation is not my love language i do not trust people and their words so anything anyone says its full of shit to me i do not know how but she managed to get to me with her words i genuinely believed her trusted her last year just last month i had plans to off myself and i genuinely was about to go through with them she knew how serious my plans were so she proposed we met up at least once and we did i am grateful that we did she was a nice and funny person and we vibed well irl a couple days after our meetup i was supposed to do it but things started to happen which got me distracted and made me postpone my plans i am in january now and i am struggling so much to stay afloat its not even the end of the month and i have had experience incredible highs and also very shitty lows i have bought an extremely expensive camera i got scammed for almost 400 i have recently sourced out for drgs and i am extremely dependant on my drgsmeds i have started to develop a substance abse issue and went down this wormhole of all things related to drgs which made me distant and cold this made me accidentally ignoredforgotten to reply to her msgs today i received this text from her hey man i just wanted to message you before i do this i need to delete my account again and just disappear i did this a couple of months back as well and i genuinely thought you would not notice or care you were the trigger for the deletion i am sorry i did not tell you this then i could not tell you it felt like i was too emotional or too sensitive i do apologise that it triggered your abandonment stuff back then and i apologise if it does that again let me explain why i have to delete and just leave i think the reality is that i am too sensitive i am a bpd patient i am extremely sensitive to rejection i do get affected when i feel like others simply do not care and unfortunately that is how i felt with you it would trigger me when you would not reply to my messages i tried to be okay with it i would tell you it is fine to not reply because i did not want to pressure you into replying i get it sometimes i cannot reply to messages with my friends either and i always feel pressured and guilty i did not want you to feel that way however while i struggle with replying to messages i do get very triggered when people do not reply to my messages it is similar to the thing with your ex when she would be late you would be upset but when you were late she would patiently wait this is one reason why i tend to stay away from people like myself because we can end up triggering each other it also felt like i did not matter in any way to you i felt like you saw my value not in the friendship but in just having an objective opinion if that makes sense that is not to say you were not helpful to me because believe me you really really were when i needed help you were always there but it is difficult to explain what i mean when i say that i still felt unwanted i think i valued you in some way and it did not feel mutual you have your greek friend and you value her i can see that you truly care about her so this is all just stuff that ended up triggering for me and made me leave the first time as well even now i would not be able to tell you this if not for the fact that i am deleting my acc i am not confrontational or open about my emotions those things are difficult for me but i do not want to just disappear without giving you a reason i hope you do not feel abandoned my mind is telling me that you will not care but just in case it does trigger stuff i am sorry but my mind is also telling me you do have people in your life you have your greek friend you have your scorpio friend you have insert my psychs name here and maybe other people you value too those are your friends i am not sure what i ever was maybe it is just my own issues with feeling unwanted i do not know anyway please take care i hope you will go for therapy it will help i promise it will help and do not give up sometimes looking too far into the future is not a good idea sometimes it is just better to take one step at a time i believe you will be okay and you will get the future you want you will be a mother a wife you will have your own cats and kids just do not give up bye bye it was nice to know you honestly it hurts a lot i do not blame her for doing what she did she has bpd too but it hurts to know that her last thought of me would be how i do not care enough for her or value her as a person i never thought i would make friends thru reddit but i have successfully made some friends here out of every friend i have made she is my fav friend she was the reddit friend i trusted the most i do not have any other way of contacting her the only means of contact i have with her is via reddit she is extremely paranoid and secretive hence why she never told me her name where she stayed her socials or phone number i respected that and never pushed her to give me more details she reminds me a lot of one of my close friends irl they are both very paranoid and are full of anxiety honestly i do not know where i am going with this i am just upset frustrated hurt i am taking a bunch of xans tonight and smoking a blunt or two i cannot deal w this shit right now the year just started and i was supposed to off myself last year feels like i should have done it this is bs cheers guys sorry for the vent,"172cqod, 172cqod, 172cqod, 172cqod, 1agxmz3, 178e0qf","(0, 0, 0,

Neo-M_Ahsna,492,i feel like i am losing it as a bit of a backstory i was always considered a more unusualweird kid from anger outbursts quite frequent might i add to daydreaming to anxiety to depression later in life i most probabaly hadhave adhd too but i do not want to self diagnose so i will keep it as a probability i am 20 almost 21 now and i still cannot consider myself as an adult i try and i try and i try to do everything right but it seems like i am failing everything that comes out of my mouth seems either way too rude naïve or cringe and everyone seems to judge me for whatever i am saying or do especially here on reddit i do not know if i am making everything worse than it already is and i definitely know that there are a lot of people who just love running their mouth about everythink maybe i am focusing on the negatives way too much but it fucks up with my brain way too much to the point i just want to stay in bed and listen to music and at the same time keep up with school my parents expectations because i obviously have responsabilities and also trying to still talk to my friends i have been bullied quite badly in the past to the point of getting hit and breaking down crying in the middle of class and being considered an outsider even in highschool i was literally kicked out of the class groupchat i try talking to my friends but they always seem to think it is just another episode or another outbreak for once i just wish someone could listen to me and take me seriously when i say i feel like shit i tried finding solace in music especially kpop lately more specifically krampb a little krap and krock trying to know myself more through zodiac mbti and other personality tests but i still feel empty i tried filling this void with so much and nothing works retail therapy would probably make things 10000x times worse since i am a bigger woman and i would break down trying to find clothes that fit i tried going to therapy but i was scheduled quite rarely and it did not really do shit although i tried but she basically told me that i am exaggerating and that i should give people another chance completely disregarding my obvious trust issues and my avoidant attachment style if you are familiar with it i opened up to her my therapist knowing damn well i have bpd which i had to realise myself since my paper did not clearly state borderline it said emotionally unstable personality structure which i later found out it was another way to say bpd speaking of trust issues i barely had a one month relationship i am always the one who flees the moment something seems wrong especially if someone points it out i could see myself getting way too attached but to be fair i barely had some minor crushes that i would forget the moment i do not see them so nothing to really suffer over even if i kind of get attached i am scared of commitment not going to lie and always feeling like i am falling behind since i am kind of a late bloomer i justkeep fucking up and i am sick of it i am so sick of myself that i cannot even look in the mirror without wanting to break it to pieces i feel like i am saying too much now but i really needed to get some things and i thought you guys would understand i am sorry for the long post but i do not want to hurt the people iove by doing anything and i needed to get stuff off my chest,"1brahhe, 1brahhe, 1brahhe","(1, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.9823,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,2,2,This information is relevant.
