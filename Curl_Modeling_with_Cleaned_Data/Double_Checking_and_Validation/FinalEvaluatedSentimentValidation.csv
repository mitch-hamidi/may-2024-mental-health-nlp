5,Azrai113,502,"be careful that you do not just redirect the abuse from outwards to inwards hurting yourself instead of hurting others does not actually address the problem it is important to understand the formula for a genuine apology a good apology acknowledges the other persons hurt and focuses on that you do not need to explain why something happened unless they want to know the next part is how you are going to fix it now again you need to take their feelings into account and not just decide for them what will make it better next a good apology addresses the future what will you do better next time do not fall for the emotional trap that there will not be a next time because even if the action may not occur again the thoughts or feelings leading up to it probably will and you need an out before you get to the action in the future have a plan and share it with the person you hurt lastly you need to realize that the person does not owe you forgiveness some things are unforgivable and the person you hurt has the right to not accept your apology it is not about how sorry you are it is about them even if a person accepts your apology you do not have a right to continue your relationship as it was or even to be in their life to allow you back in after serious misconduct is a vote of trust but you still have to earn it back by following through with your plan to make things better and try to prevent poor behavior in the future the ball is in their court i know this may sound harsh but i think a lot of people apologize for the wrong reasons if you would like a better explanation of a good apology there is resources online that explain it better than me also keep in mind that an apology usually means change if you are not going to change then you need to accept whatever it is about yourself maybe you chew with your mouth open and no amount of apology is going to fix that so maybe people who get upset about mouth noises just should not be in your life that is okay and it is probably better for everyone some people are only in our life for a short journey and not the long haul and that does not make either of you a bad person you also need to forgive yourself follow most of the steps above when doing this understand that you probably will fuck up again but that is what happens when you are learning something new trying to be better and failing neither makes you a bad person nor undoes all the progress you already made drinking a beer after 6 months of sobriety does not erase that 6 months i did not mean for this to get so long but hopefully it helps you have already made huge progress by even recognizing that you acted in a harmful way you now have the opportunity to use guilt as a tool to improve your life do not let it become

18,BoxOk724,29,i do not know what country you live in but in my country a psychotherapist does not make a diagnosis he only does therapy the diagnosis is made by a psychiatrist in my country to be diagnosed with a personality disorder several conditions must be met age over 18 because the personality is still developing during childhood and adolescence documented symptoms lasting at least a year so you have to go there for at least 1 year but even so in my country usually even more years in my case it was perhaps 7 years since my first contact with a psychiatrist at the age of 13 even though the suspicion fell much earlier and they must send the patient for a complex psychological examination of the personality to an accredited clinical psychologist based on these results the psychiatrist will give the final official diagnosis of personality disorder the patient can receive this diagnosis much earlier but usually it is only a working diagnosis for experts which is not disclosed to the patient it can still change a lot usually before the diagnosis of bpd a person receives various others such as a depressive or anxiety disorder bipolar disorder adjustment disorder or the prestage of personality disorder in juvenile patients is disharmonious personality development i went through all these diagnoses before the final dg bpd and anyway i think that bpd is caused by a combination of innate and genetic predispositions with trauma most often developmental cptsd so more important than getting a bpd diagnosis is to work on where the symptoms originated process the trauma and your inner beliefspatterns in psychotherapy what symptoms are you experiencing how long do they last did you grow up in a dysfunctional environment how old are you do you work on yourself do you go to psychotherapy these are probably the things to start with if you do not start with psychotherapy but immediately take medication it is not very good although the pills saved me at one time they also caused me a lot of negative consequences and they do not cure the because they just hide the symptoms and try to keep you alive i hope it helps,16rvhpl,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.9844,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,3,1,This information is minimally relevant.
