-brokenxmirror-,430,"as a child i was abusedmanipulated by therapists and forced to take harmful medication as a teen i swore all of it off in my teens then i started having severe bipolar symptoms in my early 20s and realized i needed to utilize psychiatrytherapy and have had a huge issue finding not awful bigoted manipulative therapists and psychiatrists most of the decent ones i have had have been interns i do fortunately now have an awesome lcsw the one single time i got into a proper personality disorder program the first day in group the fuckin director of the program singled me out for dressing provocatively because i had just come from work it was 90 degrees in july in manhattan and i was a bicycle messenger i was wearing shorts and a tank top cuz otherwise i would die from heat stroke she starts group by sexualizing me humiliating me and kicking me out first thing my first fuckin day had another lady try to hospitalize me the first couple of minutes of our first ever interaction during an intake had another lady drop me suddenly for being late to a video appointment she just dropped me in the middle of an appointment and told me to call some places for a new therapist saying that is all she owed me it took me months to find her there was nothing in the are at the time and i was driving like a 45 minute commute i could not afford to see her i was applying for ssi under her encouragement cus she was so incredibly concerned about my stability she was treating me for cognitive dysfunction and knew how chaotic my life was then she wrote this really nasty letter saying she discharged me for illicit drug use and i do not tolerate illicit drug use in my clients but i was taking medication assisted therapy and she knew that ahead of time i did not say i was a drug user on my intake form cuz i am not fuckin required to i was not doing drugs at the time and that is not what i was seeing her about and i knew she would not accept me but i desperately needed some help and she was the only person i would made contact with after trying for months to find a provider she treated me like a pathetic helpless child then she tried to stir up legal trouble for me and most recently my new psychiatrist who i was discharged to from intake i start getting pretty acute and had not hardly been stable since getting out and i call him telling please help i have been hypo am not sleeping had just been very depressed and i am feelin big girl mania is about to happen if i do not sleep i am begging for a phone call for liek 5 days like bro i just got out of inpatient finally after calling back at random times for like several days he just leaves a voicemail saying i am going to be leaving the clinic so you will have to call to schedule with a new provider best of luck to you fuckin best of luck to you lol i contemplated hurting myself so i could sue for malpractice 0 there are some gems for sure in the mental healthpsychiatric world but got damn does it take a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of diggin and frustration and honestly so much unnecessary harm like bro this shit is life n death to me and you just treat me like i am a kid crying for ice cream or like my mental illness is the punishment i deserve for being so naughty and it is your job to make sure i suffer, yeah i mean and also med tolerance and response changes are a thing too metabolism is the key i am going to i am a super lucky gal in that i have had this response to most every med i have been on works great works great works greatthen stops working and just side effect city lamictal was awesome first time next timei tried it started to induce mania which is a pretty rare response first two times on lithium it was awesome next time at subclinical dose could not get out of bed or barely open my eyes for a month or the med just does not work at all and all i get is side effects i also have been dealing with similar things with food and other allergens paradoxical responses tolerable becomes untolerable etc, first time i think was 8 months also with abilify lamictal was awesome for disaociation and depression but the word recall and shakes got to be too much and the effectiveness kind of topped out may have been a second time where i lost treatment access that is happened a lot so its hard to keep track last time i felt great for the first few days and theni stopped sleeping and felt really really great and knew it was time to stop before something bad happened","1b1001g, 1aw8cta, 1aw8cta","(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],"['lamictal', 'abilify', 'lithium', 'Lamotrigine', 'Aripiprazole', 'Lamotrigine']",6,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.9907,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,9,2,This information is relevant.

BoxOk724,29,i do not know what country you live in but in my country a psychotherapist does not make a diagnosis he only does therapy the diagnosis is made by a psychiatrist in my country to be diagnosed with a personality disorder several conditions must be met age over 18 because the personality is still developing during childhood and adolescence documented symptoms lasting at least a year so you have to go there for at least 1 year but even so in my country usually even more years in my case it was perhaps 7 years since my first contact with a psychiatrist at the age of 13 even though the suspicion fell much earlier and they must send the patient for a complex psychological examination of the personality to an accredited clinical psychologist based on these results the psychiatrist will give the final official diagnosis of personality disorder the patient can receive this diagnosis much earlier but usually it is only a working diagnosis for experts which is not disclosed to the patient it can still change a lot usually before the diagnosis of bpd a person receives various others such as a depressive or anxiety disorder bipolar disorder adjustment disorder or the prestage of personality disorder in juvenile patients is disharmonious personality development i went through all these diagnoses before the final dg bpd and anyway i think that bpd is caused by a combination of innate and genetic predispositions with trauma most often developmental cptsd so more important than getting a bpd diagnosis is to work on where the symptoms originated process the trauma and your inner beliefspatterns in psychotherapy what symptoms are you experiencing how long do they last did you grow up in a dysfunctional environment how old are you do you work on yourself do you go to psychotherapy these are probably the things to start with if you do not start with psychotherapy but immediately take medication it is not very good although the pills saved me at one time they also caused me a lot of negative consequences and they do not cure the because they just hide the symptoms and try to keep you alive i hope it helps,16rvhpl,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.9844,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,3,1,This information is minimally relevant.

PlatypusDouble2331,38,knowing that your therapy sessions can stay private can be a huge relief i remember when i once had to live with and work very closely with a textbook narcissist she started to resent me journaling she began to make demands that after i journal i let her read it and somehow letting me know before hand that she would read it made it okay i told her point blank there is no point in having a journal at all if i have to write knowing you will read it i suspected that she was going to read it anyway while i showered for example so i stopped writing in my journal completely which contributed to me basically having a breakdown and losing my mind just two weeks in i do therapy weekly and sometimes i like to share with my husband what i learned or talked about there are times though that i need to talk about my husband with my therapist because i am pretty sure that what i am feeling or thinking is unhealthy and i do not want him to have to deal with it my therapist is extremely good about advocating for my husband and helping me recognize his needs and wants and how valid they are she is someone i can trust to help me be good to my husband and to support our marriage it is so important to have the space for that and i know that if my husband does therapy in order for him to feel safe and like it is valuable i let him know that he of course can talk about me and that i am not going to ask him afterwards about the session i know that hearing either of those things may not be very helpful right now to you while you feel jealous remember that your boyfriends therapist is literally being paid to talk to him and there are ethical boundaries that make it so she is not disclosing very much about herself this is her job and she is probably got twenty more clients to think about their sessions are not going to be anything close to the two way give and take that you will have with your boyfriend with my husband i have a system of when i get anxious i ask for mushverbal affirmations my husband will then tell me that he loves me that i am his favorite human that i am fun and interesting to talk to etc and if i still feel anxious i just keep asking for mush and if i am still anxious it is probably because i am having negative self talk so i will try practicing affirmations to counteract whatever negative self talk there is usually that is enough to calm me down it is kind of a nightly ritual with us he used to stress about it because he felt like he needed to come up with truly original stuff every time i asked but i told him no actually it can be really repetitive and still very effective i am listening more closely to your tone of voice than what you are saying anyway that made him feel much more relaxed about providing reassurance most importantly i make sure we both know that if i cannot calm down and feel reassured that is my responsibility bpd typically entails trying to get other people to help us regulate our emotions for us my husband can be helpful but if his help is not quite enough then i know i need to start digging into dbt skills to calm myself down,wb2f5q,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,1,['dbt'],[],0,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.993,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,2,0,This information is not relevant.
