Ash_Catcher,0,alright i am going to start with my experiences move into what your doctor is probably thinking and if you say fuckall to those two topics i have four questions that will help us figure out what it is you need from treatment and then we can talk about some ways you can get those things i can share with you as someone who was suicidal on a daily basis and who selfmutilated extensively for a good six or seven years that none of the many medications i was placed on prevented me from experiencing those emotions and some of them actually had some strangely powerful influence on how much pain i could take my carvings got more elaborate or deeper how much flat affect i experienced or even how frequently or intensely i dissociated from myself i think your doctor might be hesitant for several reasons 1 medication is not a solution to borderline whereas someone with a strictly biological issue like bipolar disorder legitimately needs a chemical to regulate their neurochemistry our issues stem from maladaptive thought patterns and a lack of effective coping mechanisms what that basically means is no one taught us how to deal with really hard emotions and it is amplified by the way our minds work i know that shit gets overwhelming man when you are in the moment it feels so fucking awful that you cannot take it and you do not know what to do you want it to stop please stop it hurts so much please anything to make it stop anything and you end up reaching for that knife unfortunately medication is not going to take that away from you but cognitive therapy will so that is a big upside d 2 if you are suicidal starting on something like an ssri will increase your chances of killing yourself like i said taking that pill will not take away the hurt you are experiencing with that amount of suffering comes a certain degree lethargy i know when i was suicidal i spent a lot of time laying on and staring at the floor let us say you are three weeks in to an ssri regimen and you start feeling increases in your overall energy then something bad happens now you have the same overwhelming feelings and drives but they are coupled with this new found physical energy you might go for it with gusto and really hurt yourself maybe even check out that is terrifying we do not want to lose you and that is definitely something your therapist is considering 3 psychiatric medications have a lot of side effects weight gain weight loss sleepiness insomnia constipation jitters more anxiety dizziness getting sick to your stomach loss of libido anorgasma it is not too fun and the effects last a while i would say a safe estimate of the number of medications i have been placed on is at least fifteen which is an exorbitant number and none helped with my symptoms i can get more into that if you like but it seems like you are trying to find something that will help take this pain away from you you are not on an easy path this stuff is nearly impossible to deal with and your therapist not being of much help is bad news bears so let us start with a few questions so that we can figure out what you need from therapy and what you can do to make sure its given to you 1 if you woke up tomorrow and all your problems were gone how would your life be different 2 if your doctor did provide medication what effect would it have and how quickly would it have that effect 3 besides prescribing medication what are the things you would like your therapist to do that he does not 4 is there anything else bothering you that you would like to talk about anyways i hope you are safe doing okay and hopefully have not felt like you need to cut today we are here for you i want nothing more than for you to be lessened of some of this burden and hurting i look forward to hearing back from you,2m1k8u,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],['ssri'],1,1,This user is receiving treatment,-0.9832,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,6,2,This information is relevant.

KAtusm,3491,"hello rbpd my name is alok dr k kanojia psychiatrist and cofounder of hg ask me anythinghello bpd reddit my name is alok kanojia but the internet knows me as dr k i am a psychiatrist and cofounder of hg a mental health platform that helps the digital generation build a healthy mind it is an honor to be here todayi stream on twitch 700k subs have a youtube channel 125m subs where i talk a fair amount about bpd healthy gamer also has a discord server 70k members that is focused on building mental health i really enjoy working with clients with bpd i have found that they are some of the most exceptional human beings on the planet and it has been rewarding to help them integrate into society in a healthy way i have worked with a ton of folks in highpowered fields such as finance and medicine who have bpd i also believe that eastern psychology and medicine has far more to offer to help people with bpd marsha linehan and the development of dialectical behavioral theory was just the first step also some cool stats most people think of bpd as a permanent diagnosis but research shows that people with bpd can get significantly better and in fact most do 35 remission at 1 year 91 remission at 10 years and 96 remission at 16 years a bit about myself i spent a few years studying to become a monk and wound up going to medical school i went to tufts university school of medicine and then did my psychiatry training at mass general hospital mclean hospital and harvard medical school my work today is largely informed by my time spent in india south korea and japan studying meditation and eastern medicine just a reminder that although i am a medical doctor nothing on todays ama is intended to be taken as medical advice everything is for educational and entertainment purposes only if you have a specific question please see a licensed professionalask me anything edit hey all thank you so much for all your questions i am honored by the opportunity and learned a lot myself best of luck to each and every one of you the road you walk is unfortunately hard but the patients i have worked with who have bpd are some of the most resilient people i have known keep at it and i hope things get better for you soon , this is so so true and so sad in my experience the best way to deal with someone with bpd is to just sit with them in their intensity what is so hard for clinicians is that we fall into the trap of if someone is hurting more do more but the best thing to do is not less per se but just stay as tranquil and supportive as you can over time i have noticed that my tranquility is what most of my patients need but it can feel like you are letting your patients down if you are not doing more and if it is too intense for you as a clinician you end up rejecting the patient which then makes the bpd worse, i think bpd could be a disability the criteria for disability and diagnosis are different and i think that is the way it should be we should not automatically put people in the disabled column because they get a diagnosis at the same time i have worked with people who have bpd for whom it rises to the level of disability i have also worked with people who have been able to rise out of a highly active period of bpd and be incredibly successful its a case by case basis and more importantly a time by time basis just because it is disabling this year does not mean it has to be for the rest of your life, i am not quite sure what you mean by quiet bpd but i have certainly diagnosed high functioning people with bpd these are usually very successful people whose internal experience is incredibly painful they succeed at work may make money but every interaction can feel difficult and painful they hyper read into any interaction they assume the worst of neutral interactions any time there is some sort of conflict or disagreement they assume that the other person is correct they try their best to be what the people around them want them to be even when it hurts them even when things go well they cannot take pride or relax but rather focus on when the house of cards will fall apart basically put together and even enviable on the outside but the subjective price is super high, let us think through it this way if your bpd comes from childhood neglect your mind has lots of data that attachment leads to lots of pain what we want to do is give your mind new data from healthier relationships the more data we give it the more it will start to understand that relationships do not need to be feared it is ok to get overly attached even when it is painful each time you get overly attached if the person is not abusive you will calibrate towards normal and paradoxically if you expect and accept that you will get overly attached that will help you get less attached the last thing to remember about relationships is that when we have bpd our identity of ourselves becomes defined by a relationship this is why breakups are so traumatizing we do not lose another person we lose ourselves when i work with people with bpd i try to help them develop an identity of themselves usually through meditative practices the more your healthy identity develops the less traumated attached you will get, developing a healthy sense of self, this is a very common problem and a great question if we look at the evidence based mindfulness techniques for bpd they are usually grounding techniques things like ice diving when you dunk your head in a bucket of ice water self injurious behavior or cutting also accomplishes something similar but the meditation is far healthier utilizing these mindfulness techniques in the moment can be really helpful the challenge is that using them when you are out of control is difficult so how do you fix that learn how to do these techniques when you are not out of control then start to use them when you are slightly upset then moderately upset level up until you can handle things when you are out of control you do not learn how to swim in the middle of the atlantic ocean you learn in a kiddie pool, x200b the first thing to remember is that no human being is static so is it impossible to have a healthy relationship with a pwbpd it may not be possible in this moment is the person with bpd ready to engage in a healthy relationship they may not be at this moment also it is very possible that the reason that the relationship did not work out is also because of the person without bpd having certain problems or not being able to meet their partners needs it takes two to make a relationship work and it usually takes two to make a relationship fail and what happens on the internet is that people will take individual cases and extrapolate them out so i would say that you can absolutely have healthy relationships with bpd in fact i want to say that the majority of people with bpd end up in healthy relationships the challenge is that it takes some time to get there, the challenge is that in bpd the person with bpd often uses relationships to fulfill other needs using sex as a substitute for connection relying on the esteem of someone else to substitute for self esteem and if the relationship has to carry all this weight it is hard to sustain, hmm this is a bit tricky i see a few threads leaves me thinking i only deserve the people who are willing to tolerate me the first weird thing is that this is true we do not deserve any particular persons company whether you have bpd or not the only people that hang out with you are the ones that will tolerate you this is true of my romantic relationship and my friendships the tricky thing with people with bpd is that they often select the people who treat them poorly or will prereject people who are healthy when someone is abusive towards you they usually try to keep you around abusive people are lonely and will hang on to anyone that tolerates their abuse this is why they chase people down who try to leave even though they will tell them to gtfo so in bpd there is a strange security with an abusive person if i can handle the abuse they will stay so look for this in your own interactions there is also this element of i think i am shit they think i am shit so we all agree and there is no surprises now let us look at a healthy relationship i think i am shit they are treating me ok it is only a matter of time before they find out i am shit and then that will really hurt because abandonment really hurts so the best thing i can do to protect myself from that hurt is to not get attached int he first place so i am going to steer clear of them because they will end up rejecting me anyway because they are good people and i am not good we sort of call this self esteem but in my experience understanding that it is an issue of security can be helpful the crazy thing is that abusive relationships are certain and healthy relationships are foreign and uncertain so we gravitate towards what feels safe which ironically is abusive so pay attention to how you select who you hang out with notice that there are some decent people who you may avoid this is the key thing that needs to shift in a weird way you are taking the decision away from them by prerejecting yourself they get to choose not you so give them the choice offer your friendship think about relationships as an offering given freely and they get to choose sorry for the wall of text hopefully it makes sense, for question 1 look for psychiatrists or psychologists who are open to working with bpd or even specialize in it there is a fair amount of us i think bpd is made out to be way scarier than it is often times in clinical training we see the most severe cases of bpd inpatient and thus we assume that outpatient will be similar if they do not want to work with you that is ok some people want to become surgeons some people want to become psychiatrists some psychiatrists like working with bpd or addictions or depression or ocd everyone has a talent and a preference just look for someone who wants to work with you is comfortable with bpd as for the second apply anyway i am not sure what kind of disclosures you have to make for fire or police but i have worked with both populations and there is a lot of mental illness you cannot control whether they turn you away or not but if you want to do something go for it also it helps to have your bpd in a stable place and hopefully a good support system in place to help you handle the rejection like a therapist, we made a video recently about how to have a relationship in bpdhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrt5pn7ihypc some of our more memefriendly content the most important thing to recognize as a person with bpd is that time is on your side the more you withstand the relationship the better off you will be the second big tip that i would have is that positive emotions screw things up just as much as negative emotions we always think about negative emotions as the problem in relationships and thus we try to control them meanwhile their positive emotions will set the relationship up to fail deeply in love and your lease is running out do not move in together 2 months into a relationship met your soulmate that does not excuse their behavior love this person so much let them leave if they want to trying to trap them will only drive them away, rodbt i do not have any personal experience with rodbt but have some experience with dbt and open dialogue for psychosis i would say give it a shot and it seems like it leans into the acceptance more which can be healthy good luck, hmm i would say that meditation training and even support from spiritual sources can be helpful i have seen a lot of mental illness in ashrams and i have seen mixed results in some cases people get taken advantage of but in others people can become drastically better let us remember that dbt exists today because dr linehan sought some degree of spiritual training and support so if you can find a place that is safe and focuses on meditation training often times these people do not charge for anything i would go with a friend though just so that someone else can be on the lookout for potential of abuse the other thing i would recommend is asking people who offer dbt for some amount of service at a reduced price or even free care thankfully most of the therapists i know offer reduced or even free rates you can also check out httpsopenpathcollectiveorg, i wish i had a better answer for this but i will speak from the heart not sure if it will make sense it is easy to be filled with loneliness when we are trapped inside four walls the loneliness is like an object a feeling that fills us up if you really look at it the loneliness is not absence but a ball of emptiness it is easier to be filled with yourself when you are engaged in some difficult task usually in isolation like hiking or rock climbing or wood working or painting spend more time fully engaged with the self in some task that requires the totality of your concentration and then you will feel full of yourself, hmm the two main features i would try to describe are 1 emotional lability people with bpd literally experience more intense emotions than the normal person so it is like an amplifier of emotions both negative and positive you feel deeply in love and you are devastated by rejection 2 my take on bpd is that it is a core lack of sense of self if we think about who we are when i was 5 years old i was still me even though my body is different i was me before i was a father and after i was a father i am still me 3 x200b so most human beings have a sense of transcendent identity we look different we talk different we become rich or poor we become married or divorced but we are still me in bpd that meness is missing so who we feel like we are is defined by our circumstances, thank you for the feedback in my clinical experience the emotional dysregulation is the biggest overlap between adhd and bpd there is even some discussion within academic psychiatry about the discovery of a new subtype of adhd emotional dysregulation we will certainly add the overlap of bpd and adhd to our list the list is pretty long so not sure when we will get around to it but definitely worth looking into, i have adhd as well and find it so hard to convince my brain to do this how so what difficulty do you run into, what a great question props to you for working a therapist and moving towards remission man i am smiling so much i love working with people who struggle with anger i am excited for you which may be weird but this is clinical work that has been very rewarding for my patients so i hope it will help you learn and grow as well fury and rage when you split is necessary if fury and rage do not have a home with you when you are well my guess is that you think fury unwell and should be avoided fury and rage are to be coveted parts of ourselves treated with respect they are what help us fight for life so let them in to the healthy part of you it is ok to feel angry even be angry with others and voice that to them with compassion let your anger be information if you are being mistreated you will feel it but if you set it aside for the unhealthy part of you you will become a doormat the mistreatment will continue the anger will build up and you lose control and split with fury and rage then we begin to fear it and thus it becomes hard to integrate let yourself be angry with those you love and do so with compassion, i only spent a few weeks in south korea but would love to go back my two favorite places experiences where naksansa temple in gangneung and hwanseongul when i went to hwanseongul it was like irl dwarf cave huge endless so big nothing else like it, i love this question i think that the more we go into deeper spiritual practices the more benefit people with bpd will see the key thing about some spiritual practices is that they help us discover the true self this is precisely what people with bpd are missing interestingly enough i sometimes wonder if people with bpd are the most karmically spiritual what i mean by that is that most people have a karma where they are not forced to learn meditation they can go through their lives bumbling along being secure in themselves and are just sort of chillin but people with bpd are forced into learning these skills their karma demands it and thus they end up on a profound spiritual path which is what i have seen in my practice putting the bpd in remission is just the tutorial, er processing emotions is a big part of perfectionism but if you want to really solve perfectionism it has to do more with the ego why do you need to be perfect in the first place once you realize you do not need to be perfect then perfectionism goes away, what a fascinating question i am going to take a stab at this but this is somewhat spitballing and i do not have a ton of clinical experience with koreans with bpd but i did grow up south asian and certainly have family members with pd so let us think through this what are the core features of bpd on an internal psychological level 1 lack of stable internal identity 2 fear of abandonment 3 emotional dysregulation so when it comes to a cultural manifestation what are the features of korean east asian south asian culture that are different from the west 1 east asian and south asian cultures are more community oriented 2 face and public displays are very important 3 are more hierarchical less independent how does someone with bpd meet their emotional needs 1 they lack stable identity so they live vicariously through their children if my child succeeds i am a success if my child fails i am a failure so putting a lot of pressure on their kids demanding a lot from them 2 if i am afraid you will leave me because i am abusive i am going to become incredibly controlling no friends no dating or if you date i am going to hate on anyone who fosters your independence you stay with me always and if you go off to college in order to keep you close i will express whatever it takes to keep you close i will cry i will throw fits i will find excuses to bring you home i will find excuses to come out there 3 given the importance of face i can accomplish a lot of my goals through histrionics if i make a public display people will give in everyone will want to keep me happy so i do not embarrass them i will also martyr myself if i feel abandoned its all your fault look at everything i have done for you 4 psychosomatic illness if my behavior drives people crazy as a last resort i can get sick that will make people love me care about me and remember if people are displaying symbols of love and affection that will not make me feel abandoned if i am feeling abandoned i will call you because i am having a heart attack and then i will know how much you love me the more inconvenient it is for you to come the more i will know you love me so i will call at the most inconvenient times your so is proposing not today they are not i am having a mi so fly back from canada or wherever the hell you are because i need you because i am dying now the scary thing is this sounds like an awful lot of people i know so maybe bpd just masks as the most extreme things of culturally acceptable behavior controlling vicarious living etc, lotta great questions let us go through a few of them how does stimulant medication help stabilize emotions stimulant medication stimulates our frontal lobes which can inhibit our emotional circuitry when we get our emotions under control our frontal lobes control circuitsare slamming the breaks on our limbic system emotional circuits stimulants strengthen the brains ability to regulate emotions and impulses as for the question of bpd and childhood diagnosis this gets a bit tricky to my knowledge there is no age requirement for the diagnosis of bpd in the dsm that being said i would be reluctant to diagnose a personality disorder outside of conduct disorder in adolescence simply because personality changes drastically during adolescence we think about bpd as an established personality but personality is so fluid throughout our teenage years that the dust has not settled which makes a diagnosis potentially problematic that being said there is very good evidence that early intervention in adolescence is really important at helping kids so even if there is not a diagnosis of bpd i think it is reasonable to help a kid with a traumatic upbringing the treatment may be very similar to treatment for bpd whether there is a diagnosis or not such as dbt mindfulness psychotherapy etc last question is what is the difference between bipolar disorder and bpd bipolar disorder is a mood disorder where moods persist for some amount of time weeks to months and in the case of rapid cycling still weeks iirc the definition of rapid cycling is at least 4 episodes in 1 year in bpd we see a lot of emotional lability over the course of minutes to days the other big difference is that the emotional lability in bpd is often heavily influenced by external circumstances whereas with bipolar disorder it can even be completely independent of those circumstances, ahmm what an interesting clinical presentation if i was teaching a class and we were reviewing a case here is how i would teach it so a few general things mood stabilizers can absolutely because fatigue to be worse so what can we do as clinicians patients use mood stabilizers especially things like lamotrigine to help manage emotional dysregulation so if mood stabilizer is causing fatigue one thing we could do is build up nonpharmacologic skills meditation dbt to manage emotional dysregulation or psychotherapy to manage the roots of the emotional dysregulation once we have those on board you can pull the mood stabilizer down or off this should help with the fatigue i would then ask the class what other considerations are there in a patient like this what would you want to rule out optimize the student who says people with bpd and adhd are both prone to substance use and substance use can lead to fatigue over time so i would want to check for their level of substance use and ideally help them remove stimulants and sedatives from regular use also want to make sure pcos treatment is optimally managed and lastly what has direct benefits for fatigue we want to make sure we do a good differential cbc for anemia checking tsh etc and optimize those things most students should get to there on their own then i would ask my last question after we do all that are there any evidence based interventions we could use to improve adhd bpd and fatigue and the answer is mindbody practices like yoga or tai chi, the media portrayal of bpd is often quite negative the crazy exgirlfriend is usually a caricature of bpd people with bpd can be abusive just like anyone else we also know that people who were abused are more likely to be abusive so i would not think of it as people with bpd are abusive but people who were abused are more likely to be abusive people with bpd are more likely to be abused i have not looked at studies examining whether people with bpd are more likely to be abusive specifically, i would see any mental health professional in your area a diagnosis of bpd after 15 mins sounds highly unusual you usually need someone who understands that this is a baseline pattern for you and not an acute situation any good outpatient mental health professional should be able to do that, thank you for sharing your journey i am grateful that our videos have helped you in some small way i cannot wait until research starts looking at things like dance and other interventions for problems like bpd super curious what happens in the brain and body when you dance or even watch videos good luck to you on your journey and namaste, healthy relationships can sometimes be very confusing for people with bpd a healthy relationship can trigger fears of abandonment which can be difficult to tolerate and make the experience worse cannot be afraid of abandonment if there is no one to abandon you the really harsh irony of bpd is that relationships are often times really hard but are also really helpful frequently a clinical relationship is a good first stepping stone to establish some degree of connection and work on abandonment with solid boundaries so that the patient feels safe if you can learn to trust your clinician you get a roadmap to trusting other people, if you already have an appointment i would go ahead and tell the clinician basically what you said in this post hello dr soandso i understand that this is treatment for anxiety but i have recently been wondering whether i could have bpd i have had treatment for depression and trauma which both felt helpful but also felt incomplete any thoughts on how to approach this situation, i know this can be hard but therapists will frequently see patients at reduced or even no cost most of us are in it to help people and many therapists have the luxury of taking reduced fee or free clients secondly meditation and mindfulness have been shown to help people with bpd so you can start there it is not a substitute for treatment but has therapeutic value lastly there is some evidence that a stable relationship can help stabilize bpd but sometimes that is out of your hands so if you can ask around to see if someone can take you at a reduced fee aside from that meditate, ask as many questions as you want i will get to them as soon as i can 1 i am not too familiar with jordan petersons views on bpd or what context he explains them in in general i think peterson is quite clippable especially on the internet i have gone through his whole course on personality and i think it is excellent we have pretty good data that bpd correlates with adverse childhood experiences aces and early life trauma it is possible that inadequate socialization is one example of this 1 as for misdiagnosed adhd i think there is some overlap in terms of emotional dysregulation and it is possible that the two are misdiagnosed on occasion i have had some patients who can achieve remission from adhd symptoms with stimulant medication and that does not make sense if the source is traumatic because well stimulants do not cure trauma 2 i do think that most people with adhd end up with trauma of some sorthttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxkxpcs_an80 the yt video explains this and there is more detail in dr ks guide 2 determining which sources are credible for mental health info is a huge problem i would start by looking for some degree of clinical experience the second thing is stuff that resonates with you there is a lot of varied clinical experience and clinicians will come to different conclusions we also know that finding the right therapist is really important even if all of them have the same degree the last thing is that a reputable source will likely be wrong on something is and almost always incomplete that is the nature of the internet the more indepth you go the less likely it is to be viewed so all of us struggle with reductionism deep dives never get watched so we have to try to simplify stuff when you simplify you get closer to being wrong 1 the last thing to consider is that even if it is a reputable source is what they say evidence based i try to do my best to be clear that i sometimes make recommendations that are based more on my spiritual training than medical training and that this is not evidence based so sometimes you will get prominent medical influencers who will take a stance on something but they may not take a stance based on science or even their clinical experience so be wary of that, thanks for sharing and good luck to you, sadge","12xrl1n, 12xrl1n,

ObsidianIris,66,"nope take a ton of delicious pharmaceuticals and smoke cigarettes no marijuana though i am a scumbag but i am not nearly that much of a scumbag oo marijuana only impairs cognition which inhibits insight and selfawareness which is vital in pwbpd exacerbates psychotic symptoms and paranoia should someone struggle with that and is generally snake oil for all of its supposed health claims the way it is being used for everything under the sun i believe it can also impair empathy which is the last thing we need just another pseudopanacea and i highly suspect the marketed medical benefits are largely bullshit i find it disgusting honestly it is one of only a few drugs that i seriously judge someone for consuming stick to pharmaceuticalsmainly stimulants depressants mood stabilizersanticonvulsants maybe opioids here and there and moderation and nicotine and caffeine that is my opinion, wait so you do opiates but consider cannabis consumers scumbags yep correct i think the vast majority of cannabis consumers are extraordinarily disingenuous and there is little that is scummier in my view than being disingenuous about matters such as ones drug use i have a rather oldschool view on this i suppose in some ways nicotine is okay pharmaceutical uppers and downers and opioids are great marijuana is not snake oil at best harmful snake oil at worst with very dubious cultural associations and popularity indicative of cultural degradation and decay though i have never selfmedicated mood stuff directly with opioids it is just a nice side effect of having to take them for acute pain associated with electrolysis facial hair removal treatment you are worse than a scumbag imho such a nasty person i am sorry you feel that way i do not think that is terribly fair just based on my having unpopular drug opinions but okay whatever i am giving much and much less of a fuck these days and expressing my true views on things now that i know i am going to kill myself in a few years so it really does not matter happy trails, approved medical users disgusting and then not be thought of as also disgusting see the thing is i do not think marijuana should have been approved for medical as much as it has been i think that is based on very dubious research and was really just a loophole to get around prohibition hence what i said about disingenuousness and that is just one part of it some drugs are better than others and some drug cultures are better than others so yes i can say that i would rather spend time with a fellow pillhead than a pothead any day of the week because i find heavy cannabis users obnoxious most of the time well cigarettes are obviously so toxic that their benefits are far outweighed but nicotine itself is demonstratively beneficial for cognition anxiety and fatigue with minimal detriment on its own cigarettes also contain maois that are extrahelpful for these symptoms in synergy with the nicotine","7xwv18, 7xwv18, 7xwv18","(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.9914,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,5,1,This information is minimally relevant.

Royal_Composer830,25,i would say it mostly depends on how you are going to live your life bpd has a strong developmental component with either forming strong neural connections due to traumatic experiences or not forming the proper ones brain is very plastic when young so these connections are strong but over time you can form new ones that take precedence making your bpd better it requires effort and patience to learn the proper patterns of being but it is very possible something like learning to swim as a adult is harder than as a child but still possible you say that your feels the same way which is good because it did not get worse but for it to get better you should try to go beyond just managing symptoms 30 is still young you have a potentially great future ahead of you,1befrjf,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,0.9822,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,0,This information is not relevant.

Rzonius,4,i think cannabis use can be quite complex for people with bpd especially because bpd and substance abuse seem to go hand in hand unfortunately for example i have a female friend who has been smoking cannabis since her early teens i guess she started at about 1415 years old at that time it was more of a recreational kind of thing and she was not diagnosed with bpd yet now she is in her late 20s and is smoking daily most of the time in the evening but then at least 1 or 2 grams a day to cope with real lifeher bpd issues she mentions it is the only thing that is keeping her somewhat sane and relaxes her which i believe but she refuses to see all the negative sideeffects that stem from her abuse which i do see better then her i think she has problems with her weight she is really skinny because she finds it hard to eat when she is not high so mostly skips eating all day until somewhere in the evening prefers sugar candy above most other things so really little healthy foods unless someone else cooks for her even then she eats about 13rd of what should be healthy for any human being to survive sleeps in really late and is not able to keep a steady sleeping pattern she used to have grouptherapy but due to her not showing up and still sleeping not caring she got kicked out this worsened her mental state even more if she cannot smoke she will get really anxiousmad and it triggers her bad side has low motivation to finish anything she promised to do only thing she does really well is keeping her appartment clean forgets a lot of appointments and has poor memory overall i would not say that all of these problems come from her abuse of cannabis but i am pretty sure she would be better off without or at least greatly reducing her use my problem is that i have tried to talk about it with her many times but she does not want to hear itreflect on her own life and get mad at me for even trying to talk about this so while i know cannabis can help her cope with all the rollercoaster thoughts and heavy emotions she tries to drown them all in cannabis forget about everything and rinse repeat the next day with the same negative outcomes i truely think cannabis is holding her mental development back for years now and keeps her stagnant,7xwv18,"(1, 0, 0, 0)",borderline personality disorder,0,[],[],0,0,This user is not receiving treatment,-0.9784,0,This user does not recommend their treatment plan.,0,1,This information is minimally relevant.

indecisiveuser3864,211,"need a perspective on a failed dbt attempttrigger warning toxic and abusive dbt therapist transphobia please do not read if this may trigger you this will be a long read but i really need some perspective here this took place in a clinic in germany by the way my partner is diagnosed with bpd he started dbt at a specialized clinic this week he is also trans this will play a role in the story so he has been waiting for 6 month to be finally able to start therapy at this place he got some weird vibes from the doctor who runs the clinic beforehand but did not trust his initial gut feeling when he started this week they were completely unorganized and asked him the same triggering questions about his history in three separate sessions with different people needless to say he was really triggered and unwell they sent him home without any support or anything that was already a red flag for me to be honest another thing that happened was him asking the team to use the correct pronouns for him he has not legally changed his name and they refused and told him he need to discuss this with the doctor running the place yesterday he discussed the situation with the doctor and her reaction is beyond me she told him he wants to control the therapy that he needs to give up control and accept being called ms instead of mr he told her that he does not want to control anything just be respected in his identity she told him basically that in the real world people will not accept his identity as well he argued that people actually do she told him that he is living in another world than she is and he should stop abusing her for his goals if he wants to be called mr he cannot stay at that place he stood up gave back his things and told them that he will not come back then here is where i need some perspective i understand that dbt needs a very controlled and regulated environment i see that this doctor is really transphobic but the whole thing rubs me the wrong way for other reasons i have undergone therapy myself and still am and never have i heard that asking for basic respect would be defined as controlling or even abusive and even if it was controlling if a person has a high need for control you cannot just demand giving that up it needs trust to be built between therapist and patient is this normal for dbt being forced into obeying my personal feeling is that this doctor has created a nice place for her to control belittle and abuse people with bpd is this what he needs to expect at other places because i can fully understand not wanting to be at such a place he wants help and get better but that is just not it my gut feeling is that it would be very traumatic for him to stay there being misgendered disrespected and shut down for weeks thank you for reading and sorry if some medical terms are not correct english is not my first language please feel free to share your experiences i am really looking for some perspective of course i will not push him to do anything it is likely he will need some time until he feels ready to start again i just want to be there for him and understand the whole concept better edit can someone explain to me why my post gets voted down i did not mean any harm but rather seek perspective and advice if i can change anything about the post please let me know , i will from what i have heard he will report her to the diversity management of that clinic group they have several clinics in germany so hopefully this will do something, thank you for your perspective on the whole situation i was hoping that this place is not a good example for dbt the details you provided really helped sorry for the late reply by the way i think i will have a look into what dbt is actually supposed to be i might have bpd as well and i was a bit scared about the whole situation to be honest i am really glad to hear another perspective thank you again, thank you for your compassion i am really angry about it as well i was hospitalized myself as well but i was really lucky that everyone was very helpful and compassionate sadly that apparently it is luck here in germany i feel the same to me it looks like she is really toxic and selfcentered not at all fit for that position what i was insecure about is that i have no idea about dbt i heard it is quite strict and there are lots of rules after reconsideration it is a nogo no matter what type of therapy it is i honestly hope he will find the courage to do so he is quite devastated right now and wants some space from the idea of going to another clinic which i completely get i do not want to push him the whole thing just sucks, i am a trans guy myself never did i need to argue about being called by the right pronouns in therapeutic context early in my transition there were a few f ups but you could easily tell it was by mistake and not bad intent i am proud of him as well i do not know if i could have done the same in his shoes he is really brave and kept his calm but was firm in asking for respect thank you for your input and compassion, it is i really was not sure if parts of this are not due to the nature of dbt i have zero experience with that does not sound like that thank you, i am so sorry for your experience that really sounds horrible i hate the statement of not wanting help like you would not go there if you did not want to maybe you do not know how yet but showing up and working on it is the first step i feel the system is really messed up in germany getting help for these things is incredibly difficult and finding a good therapist or clinic seems like an impossible task i wish you a lot of strength and hope you will find the resources you need it is incredibly

juffp,223,"weed as medicinedae smoke bud as a way to regulate yourself i find it helps me stay closer to an emotional baseline it is not 100 effective but in my experience neither are pharmaceuticals and i like the side effects of weed lol it can be anxiety producing at times if i get too high in some situations but i have been smoking a mixture of cbdthc buds together about 7525 and i find that to be the magic combination cannot tell you how many times smoking helped me come down from episodes of extreme emotion at the very least smoking a joint is a breathing exercise and breathing is another go to coping mechanism for me i feel like there is a lot of stigma around weed my parents blamed my issues on smoking and drinking for a long time and fed me with anti marijuana propaganda but in retrospect part of me feels like smoking weed might have been the glue that helped keep me together for so long without realizing i have a serious mental illness to address i think the war on drugs poisoned all the boomer parents minds lolol i have a reefer madness poster hanging in my room they made some extremely outlandish conclusions in that flick when i explained my smoking habit to my psychiatrist he said that is fine i do not see regular pot use as an issue i was really surprised but after all some doctors prescribe the stuff for anxiety and ptsd why not something like bpd wondering if anyone else out there sees smoking weed as a viable treatment for their emotional instability what has worked best for you , lsd changed my life definitely an emotional reset i like to describe it as a dose of mindfulness lol allows me to look at my situation from a completely different perspective listening to grateful dead on lsd is equally as life changing lol but that is jus the hippie in me cool to hear it works for other people out there with similar struggles i also deal with adhdanxietydepression i always fear i am going to become schizophrenic or psychotic from too much tripping but maybe that is a myth from the war on drugs era too i do not know so far the benefits have far outweighed the negatives, i have been thinking about getting a medical card not too sure what the process is like would be cool to have complete control over the strains i am smoking, thanks for your insights i definitely want to get a medical card or something so i can control the strains i do sometimes feel addicted to it if i do not have any i am scraping my grinder and putting joint roach weed on a new joint i am not proud of it lol but i have been able to stop before and i have also been able to just lower my use in general in the past without much of an issue i have been spiraling a lot lately though so i have been relying on it heavily to keep me level, i do the same dopamine seeking behaviors alllll fuckin day lmao i think that is an adhd thing for me normally i can manage it relatively well and still handle my responsibilities but when things get intense emotionally i feel my self control becomes nonexistent and i am just on a rollercoaster ride, definitely not crazy people have been smoking bud for centuries it is just become demonized in capitalist societies because it gets in the way of productivity but maybe just maybe productivity is not what makes our lives valuable i think we could all use a little weed and relaxation ok i am ranting i think i am high enough, recently kicked my years long nicotine habit been almost 8 months lately i have been craving just because emotions have been high but i am fighting the cravings with cbd joints go weed, as an official adult let me just be the debbie downer and reinforce that moderation is key too much of any good thing can become a bad thing the trick is finding a balance for yourself shroomslsd have completely shifted my perspective on life again not saying it is a cure all i find myself repeating toxic patterns all the time but with mindfulness practices and some wonderful psychedelic experiences i have gotten a lot better at seeing things from outside of my sphere of pain still tough but it really has been transformative and made me much more optimisticspiritual just make sure you are in a safe comfortable space going outside is wonderful but make sure it is a safe space as well maybe bring a sober babysitter along with you happy travels lol, likewise, facts i hope so too no clue how many trips i have had but it is probably somewhere around 50 and only a few bad trips every bad trip was produced by a situation that causes me significant anxiety when i am sober so when it happened while tripping i got stuck in an anxiety loop for what felt like an eternity now i know to make sure i am in a space i feel 100 comfortable and have everything that i need, right on i am in philly and jersey just legalized it so as soon as some dispensaries start poppin up in south jersey i will be all over it the cbd i have is solid does not get me thc high but it feels more comparable

knownothing000,2,hey i was in a really similar boat when i started exploring dbt it seemed way too focused on preventing your internal from affecting the external and could not actually touch on diminishing the reason that you were having episodes outbursts meltdowns ect in the first place aka reduce the emotional intensity in any meaningful way and i also felt very similarly defeated like what the hell am i even doing any of this for if i am still going to feel like reheated nightmare shit every day for forever well i cannot speak for your lived experiences and your milage may vary but what i have found is that over time putting the work into skills made to make it easier for others inadvertently also makes it easier for you to process your own feelings the time spent analyzing what is and is not appropriate for people outside of yourself also in a way makes it easier for you to rationalize events to yourself and get a better feel on what is not appropriate or healthy even when its directed at only yourself once i became more secure in the idea of being committed to actually genuinely changing it became easier to forcibly lessen the grip that ruminating on those thoughts might have on you otherwise the distress tolerance skills you have to learn for preventing blow ups at people also work when you are just trying to calm your own ass down by yourself no lie it felt like faking for the longest time a lot of it is going to be challenging your own thoughts over and over and over it really is a game you have to play a long time overwriting unhealthy habits you might not even realize how deeply are engrained in you but it is worth the effort eventually it stops feeling like pretending i am nowhere near done with the work myself and still have a lot of bad days but also holy shit not all of them and recognizing that you have made progress especially when you did not think you would is a something that i hope you eventually experience for yourself best of luck,1acmhn7,"(0, 0, 0, 0)",indeterminate,1,['dbt'],[],0,1,This user is receiving treatment,0.9811,1,This user recommends their treatment plan.,1,0,This information is not relevant.

i want to get better but i do not because i enjoy being mentally ill as fucked up as taht sounds i will get better and make myself worse again because i miss it to me it is a competition of who is the most fucked up i feel like i always have to be the one suffering the most and i like it in a way i have also faked suicide attempts before and i have only told 1 other person i manipulate people a lot so that they feel bad for me or they feel guilty i am a pos and i hate it so much but i do not want to change i want to be happy while also still having my unhealthy habits and especially my very unhealthy toxic relationship i have also faked other mental illness symptoms schizophrenia to get prescribed more medicine because in my head the more medicine the more mentality ill the more validation i have lied about so many things that now i do not know what is real or what is not i cannot deal with myself anymore i feel like shit but i kind of like it in some sort of twisted way i just want someone to relate to me , yea i get where you are coming from it is been years since i have stop taking those meds and most of the stuff i have mentioned have been done in the far past but there is still some shit i mentioned that i have struggled with this is all a big headache i switched psychiatrist because of the reason that she would not listen to my real issues but i do not know everything is so confusing to me when i said a lie about things it probably is not what people are thinking i have gotten reevaluated and that is kind of what came up i do not know sorry, i am not asking to say wether or not i have bpd i just kind of wanted to vent on here i do not know and honestly i have asked for some sort of rehab but there is no place around me for minors and especially none that take my insurance, thank you i am currently in dbt i just yk wanted to say what was on my mind but i appreciate you, huh, not tryna justify it wanted to get it off my chest you can have your opinions on me atp i just do not care, i get where you are coming from sorry if it came off like that, that fact you will look at a situation of someone clearly not being okay in that moment and just add shit to make it worse really says something about you reflect on that shit and as you said fuck off, you sound so fucking entitled, you throw away all the other shit i said and just focus on one little thing you do not know me you do not know my life fuck you it is people like you who just skip over everything and just pin point on one thing that make me feel crazy, lmao thank you sm that is exactly what i needed to hear right now i was fucking going through it in the moment man i just went on the first community that i felt i could let all this shit out on i am not claiming to diagnosed but since so many people point me to this direction i just landed here this shit did not hurt you in any way so why go out the way to comment this i did not make up anymore shit because it all feels so exhausting did saying that make you feel better about yourself are you going to sleep better at night if you did not like it scroll that is it, thank you, ok, i was 13 i came from a home where it had to be something extreme if not it would be ignored you do not know shit about shit so fuck you, entitled to have such an opinion about my life when you know so little, you want to talk to my psychiatrist you want him to write a little special note for you telling you all the details about me as a patient the reason i said all this shit was to try to move past it by letting it out because i no longer do that other unhealthy shit sure but not that the reason i came to this sub was because when every mental health professional tells you about how you got to get your shit together before you become an adult cuz if not the diagnosis becomes yk official you are going to relate to the community could have phrased it better yea but also i am not going to think about all that when i am having a fucking breakdown think about that also the point of me faking those symptoms at that time was not for drugs but for the attention lmao and it did not hurt anyone i was not taking meds from anyone else because the supply was there why where you so mad they were free, have you read my post more medicine equals more validation validation to me being attention the way you say drugs makes it

until i was hit with 2020 covid as a nurse moving after living in the same place for 10 years and starting grad school which i did not stay in i absolutely broke down over many months until i was really really scared i did get the diagnosis a couple of months in i have seen the same psych provider for 10 years so she noticed the subtle pattern learning helped a little but the dysregulation got worse and worse and ended up in the hospital during the worst of the worst with sh and si after a quick stabilization i was discharged to php 2 weeks and iop 6 weeks i was 37 and i was tired of wasting time i would been battling mental illness that was marginally responsive to treatment for at least 25 years in my own research i kept finding that the best treatment outcomes and even remission to the point that i would not have enough symptoms to fit the diagnostic criteria was most likely with the fullmodel dbt weekly skills group weekly individual dbt diary card coaching calls at least one year preferably 2 i have not been working or going to school i do volunteer semifrequently though after the dbt group i moved to an emotional resiliency group weekly focused on just that continuing to manage strong emotions still do weekly individual therapy there are no coaching calls in stage 2 dbt i am a couple months from my 2 year mark and i realized just the other day i slowed down in an upsetting interpersonal situation and all the same judgmental self judgement bpd type thoughts and emotions were there but for the first time in 2 years they were not louder than my wise mindlogic mind i would have never ever imagined being at this point my relationship continues to be a challenge as my partner is completely emotionally selfunaware he does not recognize nor can he process them a big part of improvement was not taking so much responsibility for his emotions and emotional intelligence i was the fix it or faultfail type pwbpd and had to learn somet hings i cannot fix and i should not fix them i can respond in a situation for my own benefit only if needed and that is okay like i said i am a nurse i have not worked through this or gone to school school is

healthcommunity health and am an excellent candidate for those jobs but i do not see enough positives to work outside the home yet i volunteer extensively with boy scouts with and without my family

definitely feel like i am barely 39 how on earth will i survive another 30 years with this i cannot i just try to redirect to the present, i am just 39 but i would say the lowest or worst episodes have given some perspective and then age there are just a lot differentless things i truly care to give my emotional and mental energy too there is a lot more oh well while my partner remains pretty anxious about small things sometimes lol, but you are here friend i am proud of you for that, i am sorry friend how do you cope i cannot imagine how painful that must be, also this is a great description in my head i think of emotion mindbpd as very loud obnoxious relentless big overwhelming dark and the other side was just normal intensity bright so doomed against it is adversary falls back is a great example mine is noise bpd gets quieter and moved back i can hear calmly the other side i learned to strength the rationalbright side some but it was mostly about quieting and

rock_crystal,199,as of today i f27 am no longer a patient in the community mental health servicepsychiatric system after 4 yearshey guys yesterday i had my last therapy session in the psychiatric system after being a patient since 2016 it is both scary parts of me does not feel ready but a bigger part of me is actually damn proud and thankful for the fact that i have evolved and improved so incredibly much and that the professionals think i am not that sick anymore before seeing a psychiatrist i was treated by a psychologist for what she believed was generalised anxiety panic disorder and ocd and we mainly worked with cognitive behavioural therapy i was feeling very unwell and she wanted me to see a psychiatrist and hopefully receive medical treatment i have been through a lot in the system here is the story short 1 seeing a private psychiatrist who first treated me for major depression severe and anxiety some ocd symptoms i started antidepressants and that triggered what the psychiatrist thought was a hypomanic episode and i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder then i started treatment with quetiapine without any significant change and he wanted to start me on lithium but i was not feeling safe so i needed to move on in the system 2 then i became a patient in the community mental health service here i was treated by some not so competent doctors and a nurse they started me for instance on valproate without any effect they wanted me clarified for borderline but a specialised psychologist quickly cleared me for borderline you are way too healthy in your mind to have borderline 3 after the unsuccessful diagnosing the local community mental services sent me on to the specialised unit for affective disorders in my county it was a very underwhelming experience only diagnosing with a psychiatrist and no supportive talks or therapy i became more and more ill because i only had a talk once every two months and only about medicine 4 i called the acute psychiatric clinic a lot at this time fall 2017 and was a patient in their acute team some weeks and in december 2017 i had a 10 day long admission to a psychiatric hospital where i was severely depressedin a mixed bipolar episode a psychiatrist there cleared out my diagnoses again and diagnosed me besides bipolar with borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder 5 after the admission i got back into the local psychiatric clinic this time again with an incompetent nurse no therapy and i was miserable at this time i started seeing a specialised psychologist in psychiatry and he was not content with my treatmentso he helped me on in the system 7 the last stop on my journey through the danish psychiatric system started two years ago i was being declared ready for therapy targeted on my borderline diagnosis at a psychiatric clinic i started with some psychoeducation medicine adjustments many of them and then a year of mentalisation based group therapy the group therapy ended in november and i had individual therapy sessions with my two therapists with the last ever session yesterday the psychiatrist at the clinic decided to remove my bipolar diagnosis because she thinks my problems are all related to my personality disorders these two years have been so helpful the group therapy was so effective and resonated deeply in me i learned so much and my therapists have been amazing when i started group therapy in november 2018 i was very sick i had a lot of suicidal ideation was so afraid did a lot of head banging i could not keep eye contact i was hopeless despondent felt badly treated left alone let down i was a victim i seeked others protection all the time and was helpless i was sure i would shatter if i was left alone in may 2019 my ex boyfriend of 8 years left me because of my mental health problems in september 2019 my beloved mum died way too young only 62 yo and besides this which my therapists thought would crush me i am standing on my own two feet after years of numerous kinds and combinations of medicine numerous psychiatrists numerous diagnoses and therapists i am living alone for the first time ever and it is going so well my suicidal ideation is almost gone i am having better days more frequently and it is easier for me to drag myself up again when i fall self harm is at a bare minimum i am capable of mentalising i am in a relationship with a wonderful woman who actually also has borderline schizophrenia but we are so good together i still have somewhat severe mood swings and i can have days where i am very depressed but i have learned to go softer on my self and be more accepting and loving i have been out of job for three years but slowly but surely i am soon ready to start working again i am not a victim anymore my therapists are so extremely proud of me and my process and they got both goosebumps and tears in their eyes when we said goodbye yesterday it was very hard for me i miss them a lot already especially with my attachment problemsfeeling left but i can cope i am not completely well i still have issues i still have a lot of work to do i am still on a lot of medication and i need to be some time but eventually i can try to get off it with a doctor besides these things i am better than in several years and damn i am so proud recovery is possible i have seen rock bottom but i

unknowngal94,37,"extreme mood swings with recent medicine changehello everyone this is the first time i post on here so if i make any mistakes i apologize i was diagnosed with bpd when i was in a mental hospital last year but was not informed by the psychiatrist until a few weeks ago in the records they gave me when i got discharged last year it only said i have a mood disorder but seeing a psychiatrist a few weeks ago at the mental health urgent care he tells me that i have bpd and is in the medical record he has anyway i went to the urgent care a few weeks ago because i was feeling suicidal a lot of things have been going on in my life i recently got married in march and i was on fluoxetine for years for depression the fluoxetine was not helping much so the psychiatrist decided to change my medication he put me on cymbalta 30mg for a week then increased the dosage to 60mg ever since the dosage went up to 60mg i have been feeling worse over the past 3 weeks i have had blackouts where i dissociate and not know how to control myself two nights ago i got out of bed and started packing my clothes to go to my parents house and my husband kept asking me what am i doing i could not answer i was trapped for a moment i even thought he was my ex boyfriend who has tried to kill me back in 2012 it was very scary today i woke up late for my class that already gave my anxiety my husband was being mean to me and usually in the morning i enjoy sitting outside with him to have coffee and a cigarette when i noticed he went outside without me that was when i felt completely broken i was also very upset and yelled at him told him that he did not have the decency to ask me he told me to leave so i said ok i went to my car and sat there thinking he would go outside and tell me that he did not mean to tell me to leave he did not so i texted him saying that i will leave the key and wedding ring in his room that is what i did and i still could not drive he comes out to my car and tells me that he has to leave to go to class i was crying and all i could say is okay i left and while driving i was thinking of where i want to go i drove to a park had a few pills on me and felt like it would be best to just end everything at that point because i felt so helpless and like a burden i remembered that my therapist from the past saying that if i feel suicidal to reach out to someone so naturally i reached out to my husband he told me that he needs to go to class and he is going to call the cops on me i told him that i will be more upset if he did call the cops on me he said that he would want me in jail just to know that i am safe that was like he took the knife and jabbed it in my heart even further so i decided to drive to a city an hour away from where i am not even driving 5 minutes i get a flat tire i parked on the side of the road no one stopped to help i call my dad and he said he is tired but he will drive to me i felt bad and told him not to bother so i called my father in law and he said he will help me he picks me up and leaves my car where i will not get a ticket and drops me off to the house i live at with my husband 15 minutes or so i am sitting outside with my dog chain smoking and i see two cop cars pulling in the driveway my dog is usually scared of strangers so he kept barking and i was trying to take him inside and all i see is the cop reach for his gun that is when i yanked my dog and pulled him inside the two cops talked to me for 20 minutes and left asked if i wanted to get admitted and i said no because i cannot afford it my health insurance is a joke i am still paying off the thousands of dollars i owe to the mental hospital from last year fast forward a bit my husband leaves campus and comes into the house angry did not bother to hug me or ask if i am okay goes straight to bed i laid in bed and before he went to work he went to get food did not bother to ask if i was hungry before he left he just kisses me on the forehead and tells me see you later no i love you or anything i feel even worse so i call his supervisor and ask if my husband is absolutely needed at work he asked me if it is an emergency and i said no he said unfortunately my husband has to work i said ok at this point my car is still parked and i was waiting a few hours for my father in law to take me to the car to help me change the tire i end up calling my dad again and my dad says he will pick me up so we can go get my car before my dad gets there my husband gets home no warning or anything walks in and asks me for a cigarette i just put it on the table and said here you go again no hug or anything his biggest concern was a cigarette i left and now i am here how do i continue living like this i am so tired of it all and just need someone to talk to with no hate or hurt , i have heard of gene testing but i also heard it is so costly i hope one day i will be able to do that if i survive through all this the brain zaps from the withdrawals are awful i tried to not take it every day and it was so bad i was going to cut a bit ago but i stopped i was laying in bed thinking about scratching myself until i bleed so i got up and broke my razor to use the blade but i stopped after a little bit bled a little bit my husband texted me saying that his advice is that none of my future relationships will not last if i do not seek help he also told me to learn how to deal with my problems on my own and told me that he does not see us lasting i ended up taking 150mg of trazadone because quite honestly i do not feel like i
